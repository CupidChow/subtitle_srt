1
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,000
Who are you, really?

2
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,439
Do you want to know?

3
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,040
Let go of that girl.

4
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,680
I knew you had bad intentions toward Miss Ye.

5
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,159
Good thing I arrived in time.

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,879
Was this your doing too?

7
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,239
Even if I did arrange it,

8
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,280
would I send a fool here?

9
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,159
Xiao Yue,

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,640
don't be afraid.

11
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,319
I'll take you away.

12
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,480
Get lost!

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,359
You still dare call me Xiao Yue?

14
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,480
Your Thundercloud Sect,

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,040
is supposed to be a respectable sect.

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
As the young master,

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,840
you do nothing all day,

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,400
clinging to me like an annoying pest.

19
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,439
What do you really want?

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,519
I like you.

21
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,560
I don't need that.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Let me tell you,

23
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,319
what do you even like about me?

24
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,439
If I change, is that not enough?

25
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,519
See, you're angry again.

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,599
Just go away!

27
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,519
Stop bothering the two of us.

28
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,640
Xiao Yue, my feelings for you are sincere!

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,239
Xiao Yue...

30
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,719
Things like this

31
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,759
can't be forced.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
Long live understanding.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,680
Wait, who are you?

34
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,759
A puppet.

35
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,599
Why did you come out?

36
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,080
Go back!

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Sorry, sorry.

38
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,400
Had too much to drink.

39
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,159
Go back.

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,599
I just wanted some fresh air.

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,159
Young Master Lei,

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,960
I don't care what you have with Miss Ye,

43
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,319
but when I'm drinking with her,

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,520
you

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,520
shouldn't show up uninvited.

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
It's not your place, country bumpkin, to lecture me.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,199
You're still not leaving?

48
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,479
If you don't go now,

49
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,960
I'll really make a move.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Xiao Yue,

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,479
take care of yourself.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,719
If I catch you following me again,

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,319
I'll break your legs.

54
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:56,879
Farewell.

55
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,039
Hey, Miss Ye,

56
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,599
I'm leaving.

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,039
Are we still drinking today?

58
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,120
Let's continue another day.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,199
Another day, then.

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,280
I really can't drink anymore.

61
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,280
Take care, I won't see you off.

62
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,960
Alright.

63
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,680
Take care.

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,080
Miss Luo asked me to give this to you.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Miss Luo...

66
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,639
Young Master Lin,

67
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,520
Forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,800
Thank you for looking after me these days.

69
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,280
You helped me and the caravan avoid danger many times.

70
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,840
But there are still things

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,879
I must face on my own.

72
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,479
This is where we part ways.

73
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,879
We may never meet again.

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,960
Luo Yixue

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:53,879
Who?

76
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,439
I just put on a mask,

77
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,360
and you can't recognize me?

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,039
Young Master Lin

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,639
You shouldn't be here.

80
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:04,879
Looks like I was right.

81
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,520
So it was Lei Zong behind this.

82
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,960
I had no choice.

83
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,800
If you have any trouble, you can tell me.

84
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,840
We're friends.

85
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,120
I won't just stand by and do nothing.

86
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,279
It's a long story.

87
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,920
Do you know the Seven Sins Demon Emperor?

88
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,560
I know all about him.

89
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,920
Every ten years,

90
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
all the sects,

91
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,360
must choose a girl with an Innate Spirit Body

92
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,199
to be sacrificed as a Holy Maiden.

93
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,160
If they refuse,

94
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,279
the sect will face destruction.

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,199
And then?

96
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,759
Lei Zong's sister is the Thundercloud Sect's Holy Maiden.

97
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,360
They don't want their own maiden to be sacrificed.

98
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
So they posted a bounty

99
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,800
across the land.

100
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,959
They're looking for someone to take her place.

101
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,040
And you happen to have an Innate Spirit Body.

102
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,439
Did Thundercloud Sect offer you a lot of money?

103
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,160
Not just that.

104
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,639
They also promised me

105
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:53,240
to help our caravan's business.

106
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040
If you sacrifice yourself to the Seven Sins Demon Emperor,

107
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,959
would your late father be happy?

108
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,279
Tomorrow, I'm signing a contract with Thundercloud Sect.

109
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,879
If I back out now,

110
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
I can't explain it to Thundercloud Sect.

111
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:10,879
Don't worry.

112
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,160
I won't let you walk into danger.

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,120
This matter,

114
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,160
I'll handle it.

115
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,639
Alright, alright.

116
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,040
Sign this.

117
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,399
It's all clearly written.

118
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,680
One hundred million Yaozhu in cash,

119
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,439
plus exclusive rights to Northern Silk.

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,839
Thundercloud Sect will take care of everything.

121
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,839
One hundred million Yaozhu?

122
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,639
You want to buy my Innate Spirit Body for that?

123
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,639
Isn't that a bit cheap?

124
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,600
What,

125
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,639
you want to hike the price on the spot?

126
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,319
You really think you're a Holy Maiden?

127
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,319
A hundred million Yaozhu isn't a small sum.

128
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
Well, that's just

129
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,920
in case you can't afford it.

130
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,839
You're underestimating Thundercloud Sect.

131
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
This Storage Ring

132
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,040
has one hundred million Yaozhu inside.

133
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,439
For Thundercloud Sect,

134
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,199
that's nothing.

135
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,399
No wonder you're a powerful clan.

136
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,480
Kindly accept it.

137
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:23,680
As expected,

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,759
no woman can resist money.

139
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,959
Why are your hands

140
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,800
so rough?

141
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,839
Young Master Lei, please behave yourself.

142
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,240
Now she's

143
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,680
the Demon Emperor's woman.

144
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,160
Doesn't matter.

145
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,959
Just think of it as

146
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,360
inspecting the goods for the Demon Emperor.

147
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,800
What nonsense!

148
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,959
See?

149
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,480
I told you not to touch, but you did anyway.

150
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,920
Now you've damaged the goods.

151
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,639
You... you...

152
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,199
Where did you come from, monster?

153
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,759
I'm a little spirit,

154
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,759
not a monster.

155
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,240
I've seen you before.

156
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,519
That night.

157
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,279
Lin Yue sent you here.

158
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,040
I didn't want to come.

159
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,160
Where is Luo Yixue?

160
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm just a puppet.

161
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:14,879
My master's affairs

162
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:15,600
I don't say what I shouldn't.

163
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,319
I don't hear what I shouldn't.

164
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,199
I don't see what I shouldn't—ugh!

165
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,680
Shouldn't...

166
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,800
I'll beat you to death today!

167
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,399
See ya!

168
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,839
Wait, wait.

169
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,399
Give me back my hundred million Yaozhu.

170
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,439
Then I came here for nothing.

171
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Hold on, hold on.

172
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,040
Lin Yue.

173
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,879
I’m at odds with you now.

174
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,079
All the hundred million Yaozhu are inside.

175
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,160
That’s right.

176
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,279
Come back.

177
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,920
Can’t you let me have some fun a bit longer?

178
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,519
A hundred million Yaozhu can buy a Sacrificial Maiden.

179
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
The people from Wangxian Sect surely know about this.

180
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,319
I guess Yiyi herself refused.

181
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,639
Young Master Lin.

182
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,120
Young Master Lin.

183
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,759
This is for you.

184
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,720
You won’t have to sell yourself anymore.

185
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,600
Try not to let others find out.

186
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,399
About your Innate Spirit Body.

187
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,480
Messing with Thundercloud Sect like this,

188
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,319
they won’t let it go easily.

189
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,759
Don’t worry.

190
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,120
I promise they won’t dare bother you again.

191
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,920
I’m just afraid you’ll get dragged into this.

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,600
How about we leave Night King City together for now?

193
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,000
Let’s lay low for a while.

194
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,639
Before the auction ends,

195
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,600
I can’t go back yet.

196
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,360
There are things I must get.

197
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,480
Young Master Lin.

198
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,759
Our City Lord invites you for tea.

199
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,320
Thundercloud Sect must have complained.

200
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,840
I absolutely can’t go.

201
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,679
Don’t worry.

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Jun Wushang invited me.

203
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,759
I should show him respect.

204
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,279
Go back and tell him

205
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,720
I’ll be there on time.
