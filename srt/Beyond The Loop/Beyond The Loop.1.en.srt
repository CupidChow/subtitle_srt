I'd rather die than give it to you.

If you refuse to cooperate with Mobei,

then surrender your life!

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,640
(What grudge exists
between Mobei and the City Lord?)

44
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,360
(I must uncover the truth and stop
this nightmare becoming reality.)

(These are the red arrows for dispelling
bad omens before entering.)

46
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,160
Yunqing, what are you doing?

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,360
I want to call it off.

48
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,800
Nonsense!

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,896
(Canceling it?)

50
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,800
(He doesn't want to marry me?)

51
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,800
She's not the one I want.

52
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,000
What did you say?

53
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,480
Don't think Grandfather's support

54
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
guarantees your entry.

55
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,760
I have no feelings for you.

56
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:05,880
(Mu Fengrong, Former City Lord
Mu Yunhao, Eldest Son)

57
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,720
Grandfather.

58
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,800
Please calm down.

59
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,240
We were betrothed in childhood.

60
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,560
It's not something you can accept

61
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,800
or reject at will.

62
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,840
I was carried here
in the grand sedan chair,

63
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,440
and this mansion

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
will be my home.

65
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Even if you marry me,

66
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,440
I'll never consummate our marriage.

67
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:36,200
- Why shout?
- What happened?

68
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
(Why am I sleeping with him?)

69
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
(How could I...?)

70
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,440
My lord, my lady, what's wrong?

71
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
Do you want to wash up?

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,128
Okay.

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,560
(I shouldn't drink.)

74
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:08,480
(12 hours ago)

75
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,440
You tried to kill me

76
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,600
with the red arrows
to cancel our engagement?

77
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,040
Do you think

78
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,480
I can be discarded so easily?

79
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,200
You formally proposed with proper rites,

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,880
but now you resist endlessly.

81
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Why?

82
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,424
Answer me.

83
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,200
Look at yourself.

84
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,840
Vulgar and rude,

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,960
a drunkard by nature.

86
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,240
Are you worthy to marry me?

87
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,200
Fine.

88
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,600
I'll grant your wish.

89
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
You don't kill me?

90
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,920
I'm not foolish enough to trade

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
my life for yours.

92
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,040
Since you refuse to sleep with me,

93
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,840
I'll find entertainment elsewhere.

94
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,496
Go ahead.

95
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,032
Go.

96
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,840
(The assassins came as in my dream.)

97
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,840
(Could this dream be a premonition?)

98
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,560
(City Lord's guard, Wei Feng)
Are you two okay?

99
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,799
Who sent you?

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,400
Keep this thing quiet.

101
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,080
Take them away.

102
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,640
Yes. Take them away.

103
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,800
You attracted assassins
immediately after arriving,

104
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,280
bringing chaos to our home.

105
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,080
You accuse me of bringing assassins?

106
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,240
Where's your proof?

107
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,640
Then explain this.

108
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,120
Why do you have this totem?

109
00:09:27,795 --> 00:09:30,208
(2 hours ago)

110
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,760
My lady, you summoned me?

111
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,560
Investigate this totem.

112
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,080
(My lord ordered me to watch her.)

113
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
(She looks suspicious.)

114
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
(What is she doing?)

115
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,480
(Is she plotting something?)

116
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,360
(Liu Bingmo, Yu Yingwan's guard)
Yes, I'll.

117
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,072
My lord.

118
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,520
She ordered Liu Bingmo
to investigate a symbol.

119
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,440
I managed to copy it.

120
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,560
This is a Mobei assassin group's totem.

121
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,600
What's your connection to Mobei?

122
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
