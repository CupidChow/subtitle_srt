18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Wan is your biological daughter.

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,360
It's really Wan!

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,600
Wonderful!

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,880
It's Wan!

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,360
But I haven't told her yet.

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,880
Don't. At least not now.

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,400
Mother.

25
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,200
How is Miss Yu?

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,760
She's much better.

27
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,440
Would you like to see her?

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes, I'll check on her.

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,560
Qiming, it's late now.

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,640
Let Miss Yu rest early.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,040
I'll just check on her and leave soon.

32
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
Qiming, don't forget

33
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,920
she's now the City Lord's wife.

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,680
Mother, I know.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,320
I'm just bringing her some food.

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,280
Don't think

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,240
I don't know what you're thinking about.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,440
Stop embarrassing me!

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,080
Mother, why do you say that?

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,480
From now on,

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
stop pursuing Miss Yu.

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,360
Just give up on her!

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:19,880
Mother.

44
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,720
You approved of her

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,360
and encouraged me to pursue her before.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,880
You wanted me to pursue her,

47
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,800
then I had to.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,680
Now you ask me

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,720
to give up on her?

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,560
Why?

51
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,480
Miss Yu is your elder sister.

52
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,480
Mother.

53
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,080
What did you say?

54
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,600
Miss Yu is my Baozhu,

55
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,400
my daughter,

56
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,280
your biological sister.

57
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,560
Mother.

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,280
You're lying, right?

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,880
Tell me you're lying.

60
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
Mother, tell me you're lying.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,640
Qiming! Qiming!

62
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,520
Liar!

63
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,240
Qiming!

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,440
Liar! You are all liars!

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,920
Qiming!

66
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,640
- Qiming.
- City Lord!

67
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Let him go.

68
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:35,848
Your time has come!

69
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:53,297
Lady! Lady!

70
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
Yunqing.

71
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Why are you here?

72
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,200
Yuanbao said you were practicing here,

73
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,760
and I brought you an outer robe.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
I've made soup.

75
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,480
Come home for some.

76
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,840
Alright, as you wish.

77
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,048
(Shili Pavilion)

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,320
Mr. Song.

79
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,520
Let me toast you.

80
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:24,800
Here!

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
- A toast to you, Mr. Song!
- Tonight, we drink until...

82
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,560
we drop!

84
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,680
Mr. Song.

85
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,000
Are you okay?

86
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,120
Mr. Song, are you okay?

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Two more cups?

88
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
You're so beautiful,

89
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,680
just like her.

90
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,320
Mr. Song, who is she?

91
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,320
It's... She...

92
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,760
Everyone out!

93
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:24,864
Yes.

94
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,680
Why are you leaving?

95
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,880
Qiming! Stop running wild.

96
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,480
I'm not.

97
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,720
I just

98
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,160
feel upset.

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,080
She's your sister.

100
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,640
That's a solid fact.

101
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,840
You shouldn't have given birth to me,

102
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,720
then I wouldn't be suffering like this!

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,400
You...

104
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,440
Qiming! Qiming!

105
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,880
I'm tired.

106
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,840
Please go back.

107
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,720
Qiming, do you resent me?

108
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
I can't tell

109
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,920
whether I resent you,

110
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,760
or I resent myself.

111
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,680
Wan, you must be exhausted.

112
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,400
Have an orange.

113
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,520
No.

114
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,600
Then you must want grapes!

115
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,160
No, you eat them.

116
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
How about some tea?

117
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,080
No.

118
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,760
I know you're worried about my health.

119
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,320
Look, I'm perfectly fine.

120
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
I feel happy in making money.

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,840
Let me calculate

122
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,280
how much I earned yesterday.

123
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,400
You're so busy.

124
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,640
I feel terrible.

125
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,880
I'll give you anything.

126
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,360
Just talk to me.

127
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,680
Be good. I'll talk to you tonight.

128
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,440
But I can't wait until night.

129
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Mr. Song, what brings you here?

130
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,920
Mr. Song. Long time no see.

131
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,560
Long time no see.

132
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,360
I'll go buy

133
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,840
some apricots.

134
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,760
We have plenty of fruit.

135
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,480
Mu Yunqing has been acting so strangely.

136
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,400
Mr. Song, please sit.

137
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,280
Miss Yu, are you feeling better?

138
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Much better.

139
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,040
Full of energy now.

140
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,920
Does he treat you well?

141
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,720
He treats me great.

142
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,720
Just needs some adaptation.

143
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,200
Good.

144
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm glad to hear that.

145
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,680
How have you been lately, Mr. Song?

146
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,560
Very well.

147
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
What brings you here today?

148
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,800
Just to check on you.

149
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,560
If City Lord ever mistreats you,

150
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,440
tell me and I'll deal with him.

151
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,520
No need. I can deal with him myself.

152
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,720
Thank you, Mr. Song.

153
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,280
I'll take my leave now.

154
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,720
Mr. Song.

155
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,880
Thank you.

156
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,280
(I hope you can always)

157
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,760
(be happy.)

158
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,400
(My sister.)

159
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
Husband.

160
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,960
Is this too cruel for Qiming?

161
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,880
I also feel pitiful for Qiming.

162
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,240
But only he can

163
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,400
overcome this obstacle himself.

164
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,080
Fate plays cruel tricks.

165
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
If he truly understands,

166
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll never force him

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,680
to help me avenge you.

168
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,960
I'll let him live as he desires.

169
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,440
Mother.

170
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,320
Rest assured.

171
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,760
From now on,

172
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,400
I can only be Yu Yingwan's brother.

173
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,320
And I'll never forget avenging Father.

174
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,760
Mobei will pay for what they did.

175
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,920
Qiming, I've wronged you.

176
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Though we've found your sister,

177
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,320
I feel I've failed you.

178
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,760
You shouldn't bear such cruel reality.

179
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,120
Mother, actually,

180
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,560
I've always wanted to meet my sister.

181
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,560
Today my wish came true.

182
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm happy

183
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,760
we found her at last.

184
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,560
She must be happy too.

185
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,440
The City Lord's Mansion just sent word,

186
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,680
saying your sister is pregnant.

187
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,480
From now on, we must

188
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,200
care for your sister,

189
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,960
and the child she carries.

190
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,320
I know what to do.

191
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,680
