Godmother.

44
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,400
I don't think I'm a worthy mother.

45
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:48,320
I lost my child this time.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,800
It's all my fault.

47
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,520
I've also lost a child.

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,480
I understand your pain deeply.

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,960
I know you're suffering tremendously.

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,560
Godmother, they say
children come by fate.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,000
If a child leaves you,

52
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,240
it means you aren't destined
to be together.

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,959
These days, I keep wondering

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,680
if fate truly separated
me from my child.

55
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,320
Wan,

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,080
I once thought the same way.

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,280
I even wondered

58
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,040
what sins I committed in my past life

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,720
to endure such agony in this life.

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,360
But Wan,

61
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:49,960
time heals all wounds.

62
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,472
When I lost Baozhu,

63
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:56,280
it was painful.

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
But over the years,

65
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,760
I've been watching
Qiming grow up bit by bit

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,560
and become so filial.

67
00:05:03,744 --> 00:05:04,760
And now,

68
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,800
fate has brought you to me.

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,200
I'm content.

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
Godmother,

71
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,800
I believe your daughter still lives.

72
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:19,480
Perhaps one day,

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,160
you'll be reunited.

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,480

75
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,320

00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:26,640
and enjoying the view.

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,880
It will happen. It must.

78
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,600
So Wan,

79
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:45,800
all suffering is temporary.

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,160
When better days come,

81
00:05:51,136 --> 00:05:53,024
maybe that child

82
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:54,840
will return to you.

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,960
He's just gone for now.

84
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080
If he comes back to me,

85
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
I'll protect him fiercely.

86
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,320
Alright.

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,080
Now, what you should do

88
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,400
is taking good care of yourself

89
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,480
to ease my worries.

90
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,720
Okay, I promise.

91
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,280
Qiming.

92
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,760
It's getting late.

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Let Qiming escort you back,

94
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,080
or the City Lord will worry again.

95
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,280
Godmother.

96
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:35,280
There, there.

97
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
There, there.

98
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,320
Go.

99
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,440
I'll visit again.

Water.

101
00:07:20,736 --> 00:07:21,960
Have you been well lately?

102
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:25,360
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Song.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,040
I'm glad to hear that.

104
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Be careful.

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,640
Let's go.

106
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:50,528
- Stay alert. Don't slack off.
- Rest assured. No problem.

107
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,600
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

108
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,120
You've worked hard.

109
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,080
The former City Lord sent you this wine.

110
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,240
Drink up.

111
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
Don't worry.

112
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,000
I've got the permission from
the former City Lord.

113
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

116
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:48,680
Shishi.

117
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,120
(Get the City Lord Token tomorrow,
or face the consequences.)

118
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:30,120
Shishi.

119
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,440
Didn't you want
to be the City Lord's wife?

120
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,720
We're almost there.

121
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,360
Shishi.

122
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,280
Who's there?

123
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,480
Mu Yunhao.

124
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,600
Wei Feng, who did this?

125
00:10:02,752 --> 00:10:05,480
It was... Mu Yunhao.

126
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,280
My brother? Impossible!

127
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,920
Let's go!

128
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,200
- My lord.
- Let's go.

129
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,280
I'm so tired.

130
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,120
Let me lean awhile.

131
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,680
Okay.

132
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,880
Take it slow.

133
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,680
My lord.

134
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,080
You'll be fine.

135
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm so cold.

136
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,400
Here.

137
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:39,360
No more chills.
We're warm now, Wei Feng.

138
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,080
(My lord, we've faced life and death
together since childhood.)

139
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,400
(I've long considered you)

140
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,560
(my own blood brother.)

141
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,000
That's why I must
protect you and the Madam.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,840
Hold on, Wei Feng!

143
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,880
Stay with me!

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,840
My lord, I once imagined

145
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,160
if we were just ordinary folks

146
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,080
(with you no longer as City Lord.)

147
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
(You and the Madam would have children,)

148
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:16,480
(and the four of us would live humbly)

149
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,840
(yet joyful lives.)

150
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,520
My lord, I can no longer
protect you from now on.

151
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,720
Wei Feng, don't close your eyes!

152
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,440
Wei Feng!

153
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,120
Wei Feng!

154
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,480
Stay awake, Wei Feng!

155
