(Shili Pavilion)

19
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,832
This set won't do.

20
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,200
I look tired in this.

21
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,280
Jinchai, next set.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,520
Where am I?

23
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,280
Have some tea.

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,680
(This is Baimei tea,
exclusive to the Shili Pavilion.)

25
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,800
(In my dream, on Yunqing's birthday,)

26
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,960
(they sent this tea as a gift.)

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,400
(Is she...?)

28
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,000
You are

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,040
Madam Hong?

30
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,880
(Madam Hong)

31
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,200
You're the first
to recognize my identity

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,160
from just a cup of tea.

33
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,160
I've long heard
of your remarkable capabilities.

34
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,680
Now that I've met you,

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,440
your reputation is well deserved.

36
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,800
But Madam,

37
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,760
why am I here?

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,600
Last night, someone abandoned you here.

39
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,000
Fortunately, my son Qiming found you

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
and saved you.

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,160
Thank you for saving my life.

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,760
In my year here,

43
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,120
I've heard much about you, Miss Yu.

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,480
Managing the estate alone since age 12,

45
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
recovering debts with mere words

46
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,079
on your coming-of-age day.

47
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,192
You remind me of my younger self.

48
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,600
Someone as exceptional as you

49
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,960
shouldn't be confined
to the City Lord's Mansion.

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,400
Madam,

51
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
please speak plainly.

52
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,920
Someone wants you dead.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
But Qiming likes you.

54
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,360
If you stay

55
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,720
and become my daughter-in-law,

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,600
I can protect you.

57
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,680
Wait.

58
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,360
Miss Yu was abandoned last night.

59
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
How can I be dressed so extravagantly?

60
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,240
Not very suitable.

61
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,880
Young master,

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,560
you really need to stop changing.

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,320
If you change again,
my arm will fall off.

64
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,000
Jinchai,

65
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
one last set,

66
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
one last set.

67
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,320
Your son

68
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,360
must be an outstanding gentleman.

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,320
But I'm already married
to the City Lord.

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,080
This would defy propriety.

71
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,320
As far as I know,

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,240
the City Lord never
wanted this marriage.

73
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm getting old.

74
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,600
I've often pondered

75
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,120
why women must be denied
the right to choose

76
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,840
who to spend their lives with.

77
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,160
My marriage to the City Lord

78
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
leaves no room for choice.

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,520
But what if I give you

80
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,080
a second chance to choose right now?

81
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,680
I hope you'll cherish this opportunity.

82
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:33,400
(She knows someone wants me dead?)

83
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,200
(Is she connected to those killers?)

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
Thank you, Madam.

85
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
But marriage arrangements

86
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,720
are dictated by the parents

87
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
and matchmakers.

88
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,480
I should inform my parents in person.

89
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,392
Of course.

90
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,520
Qiming stayed awake all night,

91
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
waiting for you to wake.

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Freshen up

93
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,840
and meet him.

94
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,480
Look at your pitiful look.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,480
If others saw this,

96
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
they'd think my son

97
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,880
couldn't find a wife.

98
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:20,560
Mother,

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
is my hair properly arranged?

100
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,840
Why isn't Miss Yu ready yet?

101
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,920
Did you burn last night's note?

102
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,424
Yes.

103
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:37,240
Who sent it, Mother?

104
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Some questions shouldn't be asked.

105
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,216
Oh.

106
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,480
Madam Hong, Mr. Song.

107
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,120
Please sit, Miss Yu.

108
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:26,560
Miss Yu,

109
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,000
my mother mentioned

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
you might stay longer.

111
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,919
I bought some things for you.

112
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,720
Not knowing your preferences,

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,760
I got assorted cosmetics and hairpins.

114
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,880
Use whatever you like.

115
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,720
They're all for you.

116
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,120
Feel free.

117
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,440
Everything's yours.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,160
Thank you, Mr. Song.

119
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:51,520
Miss Yu, this suits you perfectly.

120
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,120
Here's for you.

121
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,384
Thank you.

122
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:04,200
(He isn't completely dense.)

123
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
(This is much better.)

124
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,360
(All are what girls like.)

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,360
(Mr. Song is quite attentive.)

126
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,560
(Isn't this the assassin's totem
from my dream?)

127
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
Yu Yingwan, where are you?

128
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,160
I'll take you home.

129
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,760
(Yunqing, he's come for me.)

130
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:00,064
Wei Feng's guarding outside.

131
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,240
We need to leave quickly.

132
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,584
Don't you want me gone from you?

133
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:05,520
Why come save me?

134
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,520
If not for fearing
your family's backlash,

135
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,800
I wouldn't come for you.

136
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,120
You...

137
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,960
(Since Madam Hong
wants me to marry her son,)

138
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,080
(I'll test your sincerity.)

139
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,720
Madam Hong.

140
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:28,640
You came uninvited

141
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
for what?

142
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,600
Madam, I summoned him here.

143
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:34,752
I must first divorce him

144
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:35,808
before marrying Mr. Song.

145
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:37,248
Only then will it be proper.

146
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,480
Who are you marrying?

147
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:42,600
My son Song Qiming.

148
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:51,440
Madam,

149
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,824
this woman is vulgar and rude,

150
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:54,920
lacking refinement.

151
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,920
Would she truly make
a suitable daughter-in-law?

152
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:03,440
The bite marks, bruises
and burns on my body

153
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:05,408
were all inflicted by this woman.

154
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,120
If you doubt my words, Madam,

155
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,400
inspect them yourself.

156
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
Unnecessary.

157
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,440
If your claims are true,

158
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:15,560
feisty enough.

159
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:18,200
She has merchant blood in her veins.

160
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
If you refuse to let her go,

161
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:26,304
I will have to take her by force.

162
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:27,640
Don't harm my mother!

163
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,704
Qiming!

164

Mr. Song!

Qiming!

00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:34,760
Qiming!

168
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,184
None shall leave here today!

169

Guards!

170
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:38,960
Qiming!

171
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,000
Madam, Mu Yunqing didn't mean to.

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,040
We beg your mercy.

173
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,320
