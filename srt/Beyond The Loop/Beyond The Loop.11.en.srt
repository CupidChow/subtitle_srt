=Episode 11=

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,240
Why have I been craving
sour foods so much these days?

19
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
My period hasn't come this month.

20
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,680
No way!

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,080
(Congratulations.
I noticed a pregnancy pulse.)

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,320
(Please take care of your body)

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,240
(and do not exhaust yourself.)

24
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:19,296
(Shili Pavilion)

25
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,120
Godmother.

26
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,840
Starting today, I must return
to the City Lord's Mansion.

27
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,960
Sorry for bothering you these days.

28
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,520
Thank you for your care.

29
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,240
You're leaving?

30
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,680
A couple should face hardships together.

31
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't leave him
to face all this alone.

32
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,360
Fine.

33
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,080
If you insist on leaving,

34
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,560
I won't stop you.

35
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,480
But I hope you could

36
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,840
give Qiming a proper explanation.

37
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,440
Of course.

38
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,576
However, Godmother.

39
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,280
There's one thing I'd like to ask you.

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,120
I was once hunted by a group of people.

41
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,856
And all of them had

42
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,320
this tattoo on their wrists.

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
Godmother, do you know

44
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,640
something about these people?

45
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,160
Such an ordinary pattern,

46
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,880
how could I possibly remember it?

47
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,080
You'd better ask someone else.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,832
But this paper

49
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,920
was found in the pastry box
from the Shili Pavilion.

50
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,960
Godmother, please tell me the truth.

51
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,280
This is crucial to me.

52
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,072
Some things

53
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,480
will only bring you trouble if you know.

54
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,280
It'd better not knowing.

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
But they tried to kill me several times.

56
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,680
I just don't

57
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,560
want to die without knowing why.

58
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't you even

59
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,240
grant me this small wish?

60
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,552
I'm a businesswoman. I work for money.

61
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,800
As for those pastries you mentioned,

62
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,640
they were all delivered by others.

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,920
Why would I pay attention to some paper?

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,320
Wan, all I can promise you

65
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,560
is that when you're in danger,

66
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
I will certainly save you.

67
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,000
But I can't tell you anything more.

68
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Thank you, Godmother.

69
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,720
You're such a clever girl,

70
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,000
yet with poor taste

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,680
in choosing men.

72
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,280
Godmother.

73
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,440
Probably fate

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,400
determines it.

75
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,560
He's the one for me.

76
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,760
Miss Yu.

77
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,240
Are you returning
to the City Lord's Mansion?

78
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,440
Thank you for your care these days.

79
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,920
This is my gift for you.

80
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,240
Aren't you going to open it?

81
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,320
I like anything from you.

82
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,080
Actually, I know this day would come.

83
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,040
Though I'm upset,

84
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
seeing you happy

85
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,000
is enough for me.

86
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,960
Song Qiming.

87
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,560
No matter what happens,

88
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
we'll always be good friends.

89
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,560
If we actually became a couple,

90
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,392
we might not be able

91
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:09,960
to confide in each other
like we do now, right?

92
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,960
If City Lord heard this,

93
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,120
he'd be jealous for a year.

94
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,680
Alright, I'm off.

95
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,800
Check the gift.

96
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:47,520
(Miss Yu, may you be happy.)

97
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
Mu Yunqing.

98
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,880
Why is no one here to welcome me?

99
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,520
Yunqing!

100
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,920
Wan!

101
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:14,230
(Welcome home, Madam)

102
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,879
(Welcome home, Madam)

103
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,240
This is so extravagant!

104
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,840
Welcome home, dear.

105
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,800
Thank you, dear.

106
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,720
Do you miss me?

107
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,600
Yes.

108
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,840
My lady.

109
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,559
Madam.

110
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,640
What's this?

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
May you have a baby soon.

112
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,520
Why are you two be like Grandfather?

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,680
Grandfather.

114
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,560
Wan.

115
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,040
I have a gift for you too.

116
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,160
Grandfather.

117
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,400
This is my half a lifetime's

118
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,928
savings.

119
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,040
You must keep it well.

120
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,880
Don't let him steal it.

121
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,040
Thank you, Grandfather.

122
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
Grandfather treats me so well.

123
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,880
You are playing favorites.

124
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
You didn't know?

125
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,280
Madam, I miss you so much.

126
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I've already cleaned your room.

127
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,680
You're always considerate.

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm even more.

129
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,480
I've prepared you

130
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,200
a grand homecoming feast.

131
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,320
Know how to cook?

132
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,760
Let's go.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,560
Forgot me already?

134
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,480
Grandfather.

135
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,000
How could we ever forget you?

136
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

137
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,776
Let's go.

138
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,920
Let's go.

139
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,120
The weather is lovely today.

140
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,960
With such a gentle breeze.

141
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Yunqing.

142
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,160
I wish we could be like this every day,

143
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,480
carefree and simple.

144
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,000
Wan.

145
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,680
If one day I'm no longer with you,

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,040
you must stay happy.

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,920
Never feel sad,

148
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,384
or shed tears.

149
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:05,440
What did you say?

150
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Don't say things like that.

151
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,800
Because I love seeing you smile.

152
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,880
I want you to stay happy.

153
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,200
Then I'll smile.

154
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,360
- Okay.
- I'll keep smiling.

155
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay. Keep smiling.

156
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,040

the residence
of the Yunluo Incense seller.

Inform the team. Prepare to take action.

Yes.

I didn't mean it.

Fine.

174
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,640
I know it's because of Miss Yu.

175
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,120
Her departure took your heart with her.

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,000
Mother.

177
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,440
I do miss her.

178
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,840
I understand.

179
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,800
I also often miss your father.

180
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,600
Mother, your knees are hurting again?

181
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,760
Just old pains. Nothing serious.

182
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,840
Mother.

183
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,200
Silly child, it doesn't kill me.

185
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,400
I've decided

186
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,600
I'll avenge you

187
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,440
and make those Mobei people pay.

188
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,800
Qiming, what did you say?

189
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,080
Mother.

190

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,240
understood love,

192
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,960
or separation.

193
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,160
But now I know it all.

194
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,280
If not for those Mobei people,

195
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,304
you and father wouldn't
have been separated,

196
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,800
and our family would still be whole.

197
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,640
So, I must take revenge.

198
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,480
Qiming, you've grown mature.

199
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,560
Come on, get up.

200
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,080
Here.

201
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,240
I made your favorite pastries.

202
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,600
Do they taste good?

203
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Madam, what's the occasion today?

204
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,600
You prepared so much.

205
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:20,040
Take a guess.
If you're right, I'll tell you.

206
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,280
Don't tease me.
