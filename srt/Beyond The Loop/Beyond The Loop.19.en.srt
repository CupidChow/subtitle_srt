Wan.

19
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,360
Are you okay?

20
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,840
I'll do it myself.

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm glad then.

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Why didn't you follow the plan?

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
That's my line.

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
You sent assassins to kill us?

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
Luo Shishi.

26
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,800
You never intended
to cooperate properly.

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Moreover,

28
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,840
you didn't bring your master today.

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,680
I won't obey your orders.

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,280
It's our first collaboration.

31
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,760
Naturally, I had to test you.

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,680
If you show obedient,

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,560
you'll get to meet him.

34
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,360
I hope you to keep your word.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,240
I'm not a patient person.

36
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:17,408
(City Lord's Mansion)

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
Everyone, pause your tasks.

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,160
I have something to announce.

39
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,840
Wei Feng, bring him in.

40
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,400
Mu Yunqing, what's wrong?

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,520
Recently,

42
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,480
the mansion hasn't been peaceful.

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I'm sure you've all noticed.

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
Therefore, I set a trap

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,840
to lure out the traitor.

46
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,160
I never expected

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,240
the traitor would be Liu Bingmo.

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,560
Yunqing, is there any misunderstanding?

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,160
Liu Bingmo works for me.

50
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,920
Wei Feng.

51
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,160
We found this on him.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,440
We wouldn't have caught him

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,279
without drugging him.

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,440
How is this possible?

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,800
You didn't take this, right?

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Tell me the truth.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Have you been framed?

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I'm here.

59
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,320
Just tell the truth.

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,200
Say it!

61
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,000
Liu Bingmo!

62
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,040
He won't even deny it!

63
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
If not him, then who?

64
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,280
Given these facts,

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,320
do as you want.

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,320
Liu Bingmo.

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,440
I'll ask you one last time.

68
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,280
Did you take the City Lord Token?

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,040
If not, just say no!

70
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,160
Did you?

71
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,880
Did you?

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
My lady, do you believe me?

73
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,480
I do.

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,160
Liu Bingmo, let her go!

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,240
Don't move!

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,520
- Liu Bingmo. Are you insane?
- Stay back.

77
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm not, but you are.

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,840
Liu Bingmo.

79
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,880
Let her go and I'll spare you!

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,800
Drop that hypocritical act!

81
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,360
How did you treat her

82
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,680
before the wedding ceremony?

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
Now that she's useful to you,

84
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,720
then you treat her well now?

85
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,280
You're just serving
your own selfish desires!

86
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,360
You disgust me!

87
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,760
Liu Bingmo, let me go!

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,280
And you might still escape!

89
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,480
My lady, back at the cabin,

90
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,520
if he truly wanted to protect you,

91
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,360
why would he repeatedly endanger you?

92
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,840
It's no use saying all this now.

93
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,280
It's still not too late.

94
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,280
My lady, it's already too late.

95
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,840
Go!

96
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,480
Why are you here?

97
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,080
Here to help you.

98
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,760
Help me?

99
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,040
Look at these injuries you have.

100
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,960
I thought you were after wealth,

101
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,120
never expected you love Yu Yingwan.

102
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,520
You did all this for her,

103
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,400
yet she only loves Mu Yunqing.

104
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,520
Worth it?

105
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,320
What's your point?

106
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,600
How about killing Mu Yunqing?

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
I take the City Lord Token,

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
and you'd get Yu Yingwan.

109
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,240
Perfect, right?

110
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,280
Want me to betray my lady?

111
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
You already did!

112
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,120
You!

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,800
You don't have a way back.

114
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,080
Only I can offer a new way.

115
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,040
Think it over.

116
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,240
I'll come to you tomorrow same time.

117
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:41,632
(The next day)

118
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,080
Quite impressive.

119
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,360
You brought Mu Yunqing here?

120
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,400
Time to fulfill

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
what you promised me.

122
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,760
I need to know
who I'm risking my life for.

123
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,360
The City Lord Token?

124
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,000
They hid it.

125
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,800
But I think it's in the mansion.

126
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,920
In that case,

127
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
there's no need
to keep Mu Yunqing alive.

128
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,640
Open it.

129
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,760
Mu Yunqing, why aren't you dead yet?

130
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,240
You've tried every trick
to obtain the City Lord Token.

131
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,360
Why?

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
What's the point?

133
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
You've captured me.

134
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,800
Do as you please.

135
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,640
You have committed so many evil deeds.
And you deserve death.

136
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,480
But we won't let you die easily.

137
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,200
Unless you tell me

138
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,760
the person behind you.

139
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,040
Yu Yingwan, you are clever, right?

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,720
Figure it out yourself.

141
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,920
This place is dark and damp.

142
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,120
Let's go back.

143
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
You deceived me?

144
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,840
Quite bold, aren't you?

145
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,680
My lady, it hurts!

146
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,480
You deceived me

147
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
and took me hostage.

148
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,440
You!

149
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,280
It hurts, my lady.

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,920
This was all for the City Lord's safety.

151
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,200
He asked me to do so,

152
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,000
and I had to obey.

153
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,640
Wan, about this...

154
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,600
You!

155
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,440
Tell me

156
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,920
every single detail now!

157
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Madam...

158
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,200
Stay out of this.

159
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,960
Don't look at him. Look at me.

160
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,080
My lady, actually all of this

161
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,480
traces back to the moonlight that night.

162
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,680
Right, right.

163
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,880
Moonlight?

164
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,600
City Lord, you summoned me?

165
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,520
I heard Luo Shishi
requested to meet you.

166
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,680
Yes. I planned to arrest her.

167
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,880
Liu Bingmo, let me show you something.

168
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,480
What is it?

169
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,200
What are you doing?

170
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,320
It won't kill you.

171
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,280
No, I have matters to attend to.

172
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,720
I need to go now.

173
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,560
You are so scared.

174
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,360
How can I entrust tasks
to you like this?

175
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
City Lord, thank you.

176
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,080
But I don't want
to take on tasks right now.

177
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,280
I just want to protect my lady.

178
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,360
What I'm asking you to do now

179
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,880
is to protect Wan.

180
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,720
If you don't cooperate,

181
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,080
I won't let you be Wan's guard.

182
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
City Lord, what do you want me to do?

183
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,440
I want you to help Luo Shishi

184
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
use the City Lord Token
to lure out the person behind her.

185
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,600
That's easy.

186
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,720
That's easy.

187
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,640
Well, find someone else for this.

188
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,880
Find someone else to do this.

189
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,800
I can't handle it.

190
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,480
If you don't,

191
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
Wan will be hurt.

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
What do you mean?

193
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,200
We have a traitor.

194
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,800
The assassins we captured earlier

195
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,400
died mysteriously in prison.

196
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,120
We have

197
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,280
to catch a fake traitor,

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,480
so they'll lower their guard

199
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,640
and reveal themselves.

200
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,920
Then we can eliminate them all.

201
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,640
A traitor?

202
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,200
City Lord,

203
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,960
your plan sounds brilliant.

204
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,160
But I'm afraid I can't handle it.

205
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,240
Only you can handle it.

206
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,240
They'll only believe it if you do it.

207
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,480
Does my lady know?

208
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,680
She mustn't know.

209
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,720
You'll need to take Wan hostage

210
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,360
to make everyone think
you've betrayed her.

211
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,280
Keep this a secret.

212
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,040
But I must warn you.

213
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,600
If things go wrong,

214
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,480
you might get injured

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
or even get killed.

216
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,840
Think it over.

217
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,080
City Lord, I'll do it.

218
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,560
This is it.

219
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,600
I dare not hide anything from you.

220
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,800
You took such dangerous actions.

221
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,080
Even if you didn't inform me,

222
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,960
should at least have told Wei Feng.

223
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,680
Right, Wei Feng?

224
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,400
If anything dangerous
had happened to you,

225
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,600
Wei Feng should've

226
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,120
blamed them severely.

227
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,600
Right, Wei Feng?

228
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,840
Well...

229
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,520
What's going on?

230
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,560
You brat!

231
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,600
How dare you steal buns!

232
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
I'll beat you to death!

233
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,600
In broad daylight,

234
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,640
how can you hit her?

235
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,080
Come, stand up.

236
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Since you protect her,

237
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,040
why not pay for the buns?

238
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,440
Pay it.

239
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,480
Here, take it.

240
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,240
Get lost!

241
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,320
Are you okay?

242
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,440
I'm okay.

243
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,520
Girl, tell me,

244
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,120
where are you from?

245
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,200
Sir, I came from outside the city.

246
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
There are many others like me out there

247
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,520
who can't get enough food

248
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,840
and have nowhere to live.

249
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,320
Don't be afraid, girl.

250
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,960
In Jin City, no one goes hungry.

251
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,720
It seems that the situation
is really complicated.

252
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,840
What should we do?

253
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,200
We can't just ignore this.

254
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
Wei Feng, open the gates

255
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,040
and provide relief.

256
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,320
City Lord, please think it over.

257
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,400
Our grain reserves

258
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,680
can't feed so many people.

259
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,680
Just open the gates.

260
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,800
I'll handle the rest.
