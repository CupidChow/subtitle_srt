(Tomb of)
Wei Feng.

00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,120
(Friend)
I brought your favorite candies

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,520
(Wei Feng)
and pastries.

21
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,920
Wei Feng.

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,720
It's my fault.

23
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,080
Let me toast to you.

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,440
Rest in peace.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,960
You brat!

26
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,944
I've long considered this mansion

27
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:44,120
my own home.

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
Wan, there's something

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
I've kept from you.

30
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
What is it?

31
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,760
I once received a prophecy
about four lives through dreams.

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,984
This will be my final chance.

33
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,360
What? Why did you keep it from me?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,440
We... We can find the killer together.

35
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:15,960
We can seek revenge together.

36
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,720
I tried it all before.

37
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
In the first three lives,

38
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,920
we both died by Mobei assassins' blades.

39
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm afraid this last time,

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,920
I'll still fail to protect you.

41
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,080
Wei Feng's death

42
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,760
has made me realize

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,080
how precious growing old together is.

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,080
Yunqing.

45
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,480
Wan.

46
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,120
I gave my all to protect you every time,

47
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,120
but you still got hurt each occasion.

48
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:03,040
We even lost our child.

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,608
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,400
For not telling you until now.

51
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,880
But I truly don't know

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,120
what I should do

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
to change our fate.

54
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,960
Yunqing.

55
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,008
Every day with you

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,440
has been my happiness.

57
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,960
The man

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,920
who cares about the people

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,720
is my true beloved.

60
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,520
No matter what path you choose,

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,080
in the past, present, and future,

62
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll always stay by your side.

63
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:16,800
Why did it have to be you?

64
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,120
Surprised?

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
Wei Feng grew up with me.

66
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,960
We were like brothers.

67
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,280
Why kill him?

68
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,760
So what?

69
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,440
He stood in my way.

70
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,440
I had to eliminate him.

71
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,080
I've planned this for so long

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,320
just for today.

73
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,880
No matter what you say now,

74
00:05:39,776 --> 00:05:41,760
I won't show any mercy.

75
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,800
Wake up.

76
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,720
Stop digging yourself deeper!

77
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,520
Mobei's army will arrive soon.

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,840
We are brothers.

79
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,920
Hand over the City Lord Token.

80
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,120
Don't make me force you.

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,240
Fine.

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,320
Either you die today, or I do.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,040
The City Lord Token will be mine.

84
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,160
Attack!

85
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Go!

86
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,080
Chase them!

87
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:25,769
(Shili Pavilion)

88
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,240
Yuhuan, move it this way.

89
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,760
Now?

90
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,560
It looks much better.

91
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,320
Serve some refreshments.

92
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:45,080
Madam, try this.

93
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
Here, Qiming.

94
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,120
Thank you.

95
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,640
Every Lantern Festival,

96
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,280
it's just the four of us.

97
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,160
I envy families with many children

98
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,344
and lively gatherings.

99
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,320
Alright, Mother. I understand.

100
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,600
You!

101
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,480
You should learn more
from the City Lord.

102
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Madam Hong.

103
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,960
Long time no see.

104
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,480
Yuhuan, Jinchai.

105
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,880
Take the young master away.

106
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,480
Mother, I won't go! Who is he?

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,720
Leave!

108
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,520
Mother! Mother!

109
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,000
Why are you here?

110
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
Madam,

111
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,960
please hand over
the Lingxiang Herb seeds now.

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,480
Tell your leader

113
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm cultivating the seeds.

114
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,960
They're not ready for mass planting.

115
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
You're refusing to cooperate.

116
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,320
You misunderstand.

117
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,320
Since I promised your request,

118
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,640
I won't go back on my word.

119
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,000
Besides, I'm a businessman.

120
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,120
Young Master!

121
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
What are you doing?

122
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,240
My mother's in danger.

123
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,040
Young Master.

124
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,720
Let me cut to the chase.

125
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
If you want to leave here alive,

126
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,440
hand them over to me.

127
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,720
You'll get the seeds.

128
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,272
But I've now cultivated

129
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:16,840
an even deadlier Lingxiang Herb Potion.

130
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,200
Within three days,

131
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,280
when I perfect this formula,

132
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,480
I'll personally go to Mobei

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,920
to present it

134
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,320
to your leader.

135
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,640
I'll inform the leader

136
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,920
to await your poison, Madam.

137
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Mother, what are you doing?

138
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:18,784
(Mother)

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
Look.

140
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,480
You painted these for me
and your father when you were little.

141
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,840
Do you remember?

142
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,720
Look at your father here.

143
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:33,696
(Mother)

144
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,360
I looked so young then, didn't I?

145
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,960
I'm sorting these books.

146
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,112
These ones

147
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,200
were your father's favorites
while he was alive.

148
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,200
You must preserve them well for him.

149
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,880
As for the books on those shelves,

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,720
sell what you don't need.

151
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,840
Mother.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,864
Mother, who was that man?

153
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you going to go to Mobei?

154
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,480
Qiming, you know this.

155
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,720
I could never forget

156
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,600
your father's death.

157
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,720
I must avenge his death.

158
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
No. You can't go to Mobei!

159
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,040
Let me go with you.

160
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,560
Qiming.

161
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,440
You never need to kneel again.

162
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
A man's pride lies in his stance.

163
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,200
Rise. Rise now.

164
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,280
My child has grown.

165
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,080
All these years,

166
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,200
watching you gradually transform,

167
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,880
gaining independence of thought,

168
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,640
maturing and becoming courageous

169
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,400
has eased my worries.

170
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,200
If misfortune befalls me,

171
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,680
I still believe

172
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,840
you'll live well

173
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,400
and take good care of yourself.

174
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,600
Now that you've found your sister,

175
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,040
in this world,

176
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,880
you have another family member
by your side.

177
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,080
This sets my mind at ease.

178
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,480
Silly child. Why the tears?

179
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
All these years,

180
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,680
my heart has been filled with hatred.

181
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,360
But I want you
to live freely and lightly.

182
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,440
Now, I'm weary.

183
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,160
Go to sleep.
