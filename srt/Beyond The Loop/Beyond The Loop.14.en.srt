Your time has come.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,856
Mu Yunqing.

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,840
Mu Yunqing, you're alive.

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,208
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,896
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm sorry, Wan.

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,320
I lied to you.

25
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,200
Why did you hide it from me?

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,960
Why did you hide it from me?

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Mu Yunqing, why did you hide it from me?

28
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,400
Do you have any idea

29
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
how much it hurt me when I saw you

30
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,040
lying in that coffin?

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,640
I thought I'd lost you again.

32
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,600
But I'm back now, aren't I?

33
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,560
Why keep it secret?

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,600
The more people who know,

35
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,320
the more people who'll be in danger.

36
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,960
I didn't want you involved.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,800
Wan, please forgive me.

38
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,800
Look, I brought this back for you.

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,296
So pretty.

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
It's good to be alive.

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,960
It's good to have you by my side.

42
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Grandfather refused to eat
because of you.

43
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
If you return,

44
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,120
he'll surely recover.

45
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,000
Wan, I can't come back yet.

46
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,272
Why?

47
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,200
Those people will make their move soon.

48
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,800
I'll reveal myself after they act.

49
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,400
Alright, I understand.

50
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,600
You're back. Let me hold you longer.

51
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,680
Wan, I'm giving you this rattle drum.

52
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,320
Thank you, Yunqing.

53
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,160
So fun.

54
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,040
Wan, come here.

55
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,680
The other day,

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
didn't you want Yunqing's wooden sword?

57
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
I made something for you too.

58
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,280
Someday, I'll gather
all the money in the world

59
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,760
into my own pocket.

60
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,680
Good, good.

61
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,520
Grandfather, eat something.

62
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,240
Wan, sit with me awhile.

63
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes, Grandfather.

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,520
Grandfather, take it easy.

65
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,640
Don't hurt yourself.

66
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,960
Old and useless now.

67
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,920
When Yunqing was little,

68
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,400
he loved the wooden swords I made him.

69
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,920
Maybe if I make more,

70
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
he'll come back.

71
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,640
Grandfather, I need
to tell you something.

72
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,280
Actually...

73
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,920
Luo Shishi, surrender.

74
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,440
Impossible. You can't be alive.

75
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,904
You're a ghost!

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,560
I checked your breathing myself.

77
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
There's no way you're alive.

78
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,320
Sorry to disappoint you.

79
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,880
Luo Shishi, you
have been watching us all along.

80
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
Shut your mouth.

81
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,360
Let me go now,

82
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,400
or I'll kill myself instantly.

83
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,240
You'll never know

84
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,440
who wants to
steal the City Lord Token.

85
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,264
Tell us,

86
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,360
and I'll reduce your sentence.

87
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,480
Stealing the token
is punishable by death.

88
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,000
You'll let me go?

89
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,960
I know you're being forced.

90
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
Put down the hairpin.

91
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,640
Just tell us who it is,

92
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,320
and I'll send you out.

93
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,584
Really?

94
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,040
You can trust me.

95
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,440
I'll keep you safe.

96
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,320
Alright, I believe you.

97
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,880
Luo Shishi, stop
this stubborn resistance!

98
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Let me go now,

99
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:47,280
or I'll kill her.

100
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,160
Don't.

101
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,888
Alright.

102
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't hurt her.

103
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,920
Let me go!

104
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,320
(Mu Yunqing really isn't dead.)

105
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,920
Go!

106
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
He's actually alive.

107
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Go now!

108
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,760
What about you?

109
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,040
You've been exposed.

110
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
Should I kill you right here?

111
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560
Get out!

112
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,640
Go!

113
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,360
Help! Help!

114
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
Someone! Save me!

115
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,240
Yunhao.

116
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,256
After her!

117
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,408
Yunqing.

118
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,440
Yunhao.

119
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,296
Yunhao.

120
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,744
Are you okay?

121
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,640
Yunqing.

122
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,600
Yunhao.

123
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
Don't worry. Yunhao will recover.

124
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,760
How is my brother?

125
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't worry.

126
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,880
Fortunately,
no vital organs were injured.

127
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Just keep applying

128
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,080
the medicine and let him rest.

129
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,768
Thank you.

130
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
Wei Feng, escort the physician out.

131
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,544
Yunqing.

132
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:22,680
Grandfather.

133
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Yunqing.

134
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,760
Grandfather.

135
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,880
It's good that you're back.

136
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,728
Get up. Get up now.

138
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,680
Grandfather, let's check on Yunhao.

139
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,288
Grandfather.

140
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,760
Yunhao, are you feeling better?

141
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Does it still hurt?

142
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
No.

143
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,600
Yunqing, Wan,

144
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,920
your brother will be fine.

145
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,880
You two should rest now.

146
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,400
Go.

147
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,240
Yes, Grandfather.

148
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,640
Yunhao, we'll take our leave now.

149
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,352
Go.

150
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,000
Go. Go now.

151
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,616
Go.

152
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,040
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

153
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,480
(Mu Yunqing,
I never thought you'd be alive.)

154
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,384
Are you tired?

155
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,440
It's fine.

156
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,904
My lord.

157
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,640
Might we speak privately?

158
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,280
Wan, go back to rest.

159
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
I'll be right back.

160
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Come back sooner then.

161
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,160
I want to tell you something.

162
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,480
