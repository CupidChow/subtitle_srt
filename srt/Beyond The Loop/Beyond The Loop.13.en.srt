it's a remarkable life.

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,320

00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,160

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,880
Song Qiming?

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Song Qiming.

My lady.

85
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,880
Don't destroy yourself like this.

86
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,960
He died. I eat as usual.

87
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,000
What's wrong with that?

88
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,360
By the way, Mu Yunqing is dead.

89
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,720
Should we go to the Shili Pavilion

90
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,320
to discuss my marriage?

91
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,760
You want to marry Song Qiming?

92
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,320
Of course.

93
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
And I'll marry him

94
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,120
in grand style.

95
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,440
Mu Yunqing said

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,960
he wanted me to live well.

97
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,799
I can't let him down.

98
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,760
After all my lord's kindness to you,

99
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,559
you're already planning to remarry?

100
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,840
Madam, I've misjudged you.

101
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
Marrying Song Qiming is perfect.

102
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Freedom,

103
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,960
no more bowing to others,

104
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,960
and I can run my business gloriously.

105
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,640
Why wouldn't I want that?

106
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,904
You!

107
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,176
What are you trying to do?

108
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
I just wanted to hear
your true thoughts.

109
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,720
You want to remarry all along?

110
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,320
Perhaps the City Lord's death

111
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,200
was your scheme with Song Qiming!

112
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
Don't you dare slander my lady!

113
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,416
Get out!

114
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,360
You bootlicker.

115
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,520
Who do you think you are?

116
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:40,064
(Flower House)

117
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,320
I never expected

118
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
things to go so smoothly.

119
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
I even checked his breathing.

120
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,440
You even thought about that?

121
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,880
I thought you were
genuinely mourning him.

122
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,280
He was not worthy

123
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,600
of my mourning.

124
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,240
You have no idea

125
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,560
how thrilled I was

126
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
when I saw Yu Yingwan's grief.

127
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,360
So next,

128
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,960
will you smoothly become the City Lord?

129
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,520
That old fox is too cunning.

130
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,160
I can't let him suspect me.

131
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,840
Wait a few more days

132
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,120
until he hands over the City Lord Token.

133
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,920
If he still refuses,

134
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,240
you should help me.

135
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Since Mu Yunqing's dead,

136
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,280
Yu Yingwan...

137
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,040
I've already arranged something for her.

138
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
Let's reunite her with Mu Yunqing.

139
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,872
(Shili Pavilion)

140
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
Mu Yunqing is dead.

141
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,560
If you think it's okay,

142
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,360
I'll marry Mr. Song immediately.

143
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Wan, are you certain about this?

144
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,120
I've made up my mind.

145
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
He's dead.

146
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,040
I won't remain a widow for a corpse.

147
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,280
As long as you're resolved.

148
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,680
Be my daughter-in-law,

149
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,720
and I'll ensure you want for nothing.

150
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,712
Godmother.

151
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,040
I'd like some time alone with Mr. Song,

152
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,832
if you please.

153
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
I understand completely.

154
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,640
I understand.

155
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,240
What are you afraid of?

156
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,360
Didn't you claim to adore me?

157
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,240
Now that I'm marrying you,

158
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
why avoid me?

159
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,960
Miss Yu, there's no need for this act.

160
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,200
I see. You want
something more thrilling.

161
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
Miss Yu, please
put your clothes back on.

162
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,800
Mu Yunqing is already dead.

163
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,280
Why are you scared?

164
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,640
Miss Yu, what are you trying to do?

165
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
This knife

166
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,520
has been sharpened for an hour.

167
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,640
If it's pressed against your throat,

168
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,520
what will happen?

169
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,520
Miss Yu, let's talk this through calmly.

170
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm not ready to die yet.

171
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:10,080
(One day earlier)

172
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:20,880
Mu Yunqing, don't die.

173
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,280
Or Miss Yu will be devastated.

174
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,920
Thank you, Mr. Song.

175
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,560
I have a plan.

176
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,400
Would you be willing to help me?

177
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,440
Okay, I agree.

178
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,960
But what happened today

179
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,800
must not be told to anyone.

180
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Not even Miss Yu?

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,920
I'll remember

182
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,480
your righteousness well.

183
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,840
You want to talk?

184
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:33,240
Fine, then tell me,

185
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,360
why did you kill Mu Yunqing?

186
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:38,480
It's not what you think.

187
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,080
Believe me. I didn't kill him.

188
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,840
Wei Feng saw it himself.

189
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,840
How could that be fake?

190
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,280
I truly didn't kill him.

191
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,760
Your life is in my hands now.

192
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,640
Speak the truth.

193
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,760
Even if you kill me,

194
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,720
my answer is no.

195
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,880
I didn't kill him.

196
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,240
If you truly don't believe me,

197
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,800
then do it.

198
00:15:13,344 --> 00:15:14,640
One day,

199
00:15:16,288 --> 00:15:18,200
I'll end you myself.
