Grandfather, drink more.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,280
This dish was prepared by Mr. Yunhao.

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,800
Yunhao, your cooking skills are amazing!

21
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,840
Yunqing, learn from Yunhao

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,640
and cook me some delicious dishes.

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,960
If I ever master cooking,

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
Yunhao will have to quit

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,760
as the family chef.

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,520
Nonsense!

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,320
You're about to be a father,

28
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,240
yet still talking nonsense.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Eat up, everyone.

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,600
We haven't

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,160
gathered to have a meal

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,200
for a long time.

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,800
Today is a joyous occasion.

34
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,840
Yunqing, Yunhao.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,560
Let's make a toast

36
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,480
to wish Wan good health,

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,880
a safe delivery,

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,240
and for adding a new member
to the our family.

39
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,280
Thank you, Grandfather.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,920
Yunhao.

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,880
Find me a sister-in-law!

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,600
Hurry up.

43
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,480
Him?

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,120
He's not grown up yet,

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,640
now still hanging around
those pleasure houses all day,

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,920
enjoying his carefree life.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,360
How could he spare time to find a wife?

48
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,320
Come on, let's eat.

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,240
Here, let me toast you.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,360
Yunhao.

51
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,680
Yunqing.

52
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,400
Drink up!

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,240
Yunhao, you are

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,800
at your age,

55
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,040
not married,

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,120
not chasing career,

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,400
what do you want to do?

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,320
W-What can I do?

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,240
I've been cowardly since childhood,

60
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,520
not cut out for great things.

61
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,560
I'll just live off the family fortune.

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,440
You have

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,320
the capabilities as the City Lord.

64
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,240
Here, Yunhao.

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,040
Here.

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,600
Bottoms up!

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,200
Let me check. There's some left.

68
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,280
To be honest...

69
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,640
Go ahead.

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm tire

71
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,560
of being the City Lord.

72
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,640
I wanted to quit long ago.

73
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,520
Yunhao, why don't you take over?

74
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
Nonsense!

75
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,720
Yunhao.

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,800
You are the City Lord.

77
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,680
I'm telling you, you're drunk.

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,840
Just focus on being the City Lord.

79
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,680
Grandfather is watching you.

80
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,120
Later, let Wan help you back.

81
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,480
I-I should...

82
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,560
Yunhao, another cup!

83
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,200
You're drunk.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,320
Wan will come get you later.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm leaving.

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,760
Yunhao, take care.

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,160
After the physician treated Mr. Yunhao,

88
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,176
and I escorted him out.

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,880
He said something strange.

90
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,080
Strange?

91
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,880
The physician said

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,560
Mr. Yunhao's wound

93
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,400
seems to be stabbed

94
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,640
by himself.

95
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,920
(What am I thinking?)

96
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,840
(Why would Yunhao harm me?)

97
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,680
Husband.

98
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,720
I made you this hangover soup.

99
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,280
Taste good?

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

101
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,240
Are you drunk?

102
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,000
I can drink more than Yunhao.

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
Let's go for a walk.

104
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,440
Alright.

105
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,400
Let's go.

106
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,320
For the children?

107
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,800
That design is beautiful.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Almost sold out.

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,120
How much?

110
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,760
Three coins. Pretty.

111
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,320
Come see the lanterns!

112
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,720
Come see the lanterns!

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,120
Children love them.

114
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,640
We have all kinds of shapes here.

115
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,640
I wish time could freeze at this moment,

116
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,520
so we could be this happy forever.

117
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,400
Then you better treat me well,

118
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,360
or I'll run away.

119
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,840
You won't.

120
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,000
I am sure about that.

121
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,720
Wait for me.

122
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,520
You kid.

123
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,560
Here, take it.

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,720
Thank you.

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,040
Mother.

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,960
Candied haws.

127
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,472
Candied haws again?

128
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:23,640
Yunqing, when our child is born,

129
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,000
we'll be happier than them.

130
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,520
You love children so much?

131
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Then have a few more.

132
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
You think giving birth

133
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,160
is that easy?

134
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,680
How about this?

135
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,440
I'll give birth to them, okay?

136
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Fine, you'll do it.

137
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,760
Try having one then.

138
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,920
I'll do it.

139
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,240
Lanterns!

140
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:52,680
What's the occasion?

141
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,600
So many lanterns!

142
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
Madam.

143
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
The Lantern Festival is in half a month.

144
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,640
Lantern Festival?

145
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,920
Look, I bought you a jade pendant.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,760
Wan, what's wrong?

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,680
Yunqing, I'm not feeling well.

148
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,840
Let's go home.

149
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,480
Are you okay?

150
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,480
Alright. Sorry.

151
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,559
Let's go home.

152
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,080
What's with you today?

153
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,320
Don't move.

154
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,240
At today's dinner,

155
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,640
Mu Yunqing acted strange.

156
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,720
I think we can't keep this
hidden much longer.

157
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,560
Today I kept thinking

158
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
if I hadn't fought for this position,

159
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
we might've had our own child

160
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,360
and our own courtyard by now.

161
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:47,960
Or even,

162
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,880
our own piece of land.

163
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
Yunhao, no matter what happens,

164
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,400
I'll always stay by your side.

165
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,200
Okay.

166
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,400
(I'll definitely help you
eliminate Mu Yunqing)

167
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,200
(and reclaim the City Lord Token.)

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,320
You poisoned my lady,

169
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,480
yet you came to me now?

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,360
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,600
What?

172
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,600
The Yu family is just merchants.

173
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,600
What makes
a skilled person like you obey them

174
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,280
is nothing

175
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,200
but sufficient payment.

176
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,560
Think you can buy me off
with this little?

177
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,920
This is just the deposit.

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,880
Tenfold after success.

179
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,840
What do you want me to do?

180
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,120
Yu Yingwan is such a nuisance.

181
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,720
You know what to do.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Working with you is risky.

183
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,880
I want to meet your master.

184
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Deal.

185
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,600
City Lord, terrible!

186
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Madam has gone missing!

187
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,600
Lady.

188
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,520
Lady.

189
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,120
Liu Bingmo, where are we?

190
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,280
No idea. I just woke up too.

191
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,040
What happened?

192
