18
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,240
Wan, you've been preoccupied lately.

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,584
Is it because of
what happened back then?

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Why didn't you tell me

21
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,120
all these years?

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
What happened

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,520
isn't anyone's fault.

24
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,720
It's not your fault.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,400
Wan.

26
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,400
Do you remember?

27
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,840
When we were kids,

28
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
what my father used to say?

29
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,320
Keep moving forward?

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,240
Our current life didn't come easily.

31
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,336
From now on,

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
we must stay together

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,040
and face challenges.

34
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's follow his advice.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,280
Keep moving forward. Okay?

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,760
Yunqing.

37
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,120
The reason I can't let go

38
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,320
isn't just that they're your parents.

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,400
They're also our baby's grandparents.

40
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Really?

41
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

42
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Such wonderful news!

43
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,240
If my parents knew,

44
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,320
they'd be overjoyed.

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,120
Wan, trust me.

46
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,840
I'll protect you

47
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
and our child.

48
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,360
The family of us three

49
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,200
will grow happier every day.

50
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,120
Mother and Father would be proud too.

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
Trust me.

52
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,216
I do.

53
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,400
In the future,

54
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
we'll go through

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
thick and thin together.

56
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,560
Let the bygones

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,480
be bygones.

58
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,960
Stop dwelling on it.

59
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,152
Okay?

60
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,808
Okay.

61
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Yunqing, I want to thank someone.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,720
City Lord.

63
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
Why call me out so late at night?

64
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,992
Make a guess.

65
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,160
If Mother finds out about this...

66
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,240
Miss Yu, you...

67
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,280
Mr. Song.

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,120
I misunderstood you before.

69
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,560
I apologize.

70
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,920
But thank you for saving Yunqing.

71
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,536
Qiming.

72
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,520
I haven't thanked you yet.

73
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,832
Thank you.

74
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,800
I should do so.

75
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,480
And I wasn't mad at you.

76
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,080
Then are we still friends?

77
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,424
Of course.

78
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,160
Don't mess with me.

79
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,600
You are so fierce.

80
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,720
What can you do to me?

81
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,880
You'll still dote on me.

82
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,368
Stop.

83
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:40,080
What's wrong?

84
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,160
No.

85
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,000
Why?

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,640
It is the price I should pay.

87
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Never seen you act like this before.

88
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,520
Come here.

89
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,624
No! I want to be a good father!

90
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:55,560
Just one hug?

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,680
No. Don't touch me.

92
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,480
Hug me!

93
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,392
No.

94
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,280
You don't love me anymore?

95
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
No.

96
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,584
No.

97
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,160
Let me hug you.

98
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,160
Good night.

99
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:30,920
You're Mu Yunhao

100
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,960
who wants
to be the City Lord of Jin City?

101
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,320
You're Mu Yunqing's elder brother.

102
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,240
You turned against your brother?

103
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
I don't want

104
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,600
to keep working with a guy like you.

105
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,440
Just give me the Lingxiang Herb,

106
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,320
and I'll help you conquer Jin City.

107
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,320
Jin City's thirty thousand troops

108
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,240
will help your take the Central Plains.

109
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,760
Lingxiang Herb?

110
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,040
I swear

111
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,720
this time I can kill Mu Yunqing

112
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
and his wife.

113
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,520
Once they're gone,

114
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,760
the City Lord Token will be mine

115
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,120
sooner or later.

116
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,720
My patience has limits.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,320
This is your final chance.

118
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,176
If you don't get the City Lord Token,

119
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:23,904
I'll make you suffer terribly.

120
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,880
I love money. Money loves me.

121
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,720
I'll earn much of it.

122
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,896
Here.

123
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
Deliver this to the Li family
at the eastern city gate.

124
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,928
Make it quick.

125
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,680
Delicious pastries.

126
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,840
Where did you get them?

127
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,600
Your friend sent them.

128
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,808
Which friend?

129
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,440
I think the name with Luo...

130
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Someone I met in the mansion.

131
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Luo Shishi?

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,120
My lady.

133
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,040
Help!

134
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,640
Physician, how's my wife?

135
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,720
Madam has been poisoned.

136
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,680
As for whether
it's Lingxiang Herb poison,

137
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,240
I am not able to confirm that.

138
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,880
I think a physician

139
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,880
who served for the military
on the frontier

140
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
might be able to confirm it.

141
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,160
Fortunately, she didn't eat much.

142
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,080
I'll prescribe antidotal herbs

143
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
to alleviate her symptoms.

144
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,000
The unborn child remains safe for now.

145
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,280
However,

146
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,800
she must take good rest.

147
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
Wei Feng, issue an order!

148
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,560
Arrest Luo Shishi.

149
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes, City Lord.

150
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Escort him back.

151
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,680
Sir, this way please.

152
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,752
Okay.

153
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,216
It's okay.

154
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,840
Liu Bingmo, take good care of Madam.

155
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll search for a physician
familiar with Lingxiang Herb poison.

156
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
Yes, City Lord.

157
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,480
You...

158
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,400
Come with me.

159
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,880
(Miraculous Cure, Renxin Clinic)
Easy now, easy.

160
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,776
Sir, what's your opinion?

161
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,760
Never thought I'd encounter

162
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,560
a Lingxiang Herb poison case again.

163
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,200
Can you treat this poison?

164
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,080
I'll do my best.

165
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,280
Come with me to prepare the antidote.

166
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,240
Okay, I'll go with you.

167
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:37,640
During military services,

168
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,440
did you encounter similar poison cases?

169
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Just one case.

170
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
When I served for the military,

171
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
a deputy general got poisoned by this.

172
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,680
But my medical skills

173
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,000
couldn't save his life.

174
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,560
Was the deputy general

175
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,720
Mr. Song from my father's army?

176
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,320
Yes, exactly.

177
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,360
Madam, perhaps you should rest inside.

178
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,040
You might catch a cold here.

179
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,400
I'm fine.

180
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,000
The baby says he wants some sunshine.

181
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
Careful.

182
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
Alright.

183
00:12:28,896 --> 00:12:30,000
Baby.

184
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I will definitely protect you.

185
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,040
Wan, why aren't you
resting at the mansion?

186
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,440
I'm doing the accounts.

187
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,088
- Haven't finished it yet.
- You...

188
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,120
Godmother.

189
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
Wan.

190
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,520
Godmother, what brings you here?

191
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,080
I went to the City Lord's Mansion

192
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
and they said you were here.

193
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,920
Wan, are you alright?

194
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,480
Much better now.

195
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,360
Just like before.

196
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,320
Some matters delayed me these past days.

197
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,040
I should've come sooner.

198
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,880
Don't worry about me.

199
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,864
I'll recover.

200
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:29,760
I'm perfectly fine.

201
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,656
Glad to hear that.

202
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,448
Madam Hong.

203
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
There's something I want to ask.

204
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,600
And I hope you can answer me.

205
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,240
Is it about the Lingxiang Herb?

206
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,440
Wan asked me about it before.

207
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,800
I knew

208
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,720
she learned about it from you.

209
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,560
But I wasn't ready
to share this with you.

210
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,360
Godmother, are you truly
growing the Lingxiang Herb?

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,680
I am indeed growing the Lingxiang Herb,

212
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,560
but I would never harm you.

213
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,200
I do it with my own reasons.

214
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
As for what,

215
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,600
I can't tell you yet.

216
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,776
Madam Hong.

217
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,400
Growing the Lingxiang Herb is dangerous.

218
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,040
No one can cure this poison now.

219
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,720
Please stop now.

220
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,200
I appreciate your kindness,

221
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,280
but I must grow the Lingxiang Herb.

222
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,920
I have something that I must do,

223
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,400
otherwise, I would regret it.

224
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,800
If you don't mind,

225
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,680
I'll take my leave.

226
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
Madam Hong, hold on.

227
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,560
What I just said

228
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,880
wasn't only for your sake,

229
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,160
but also for your daughter's.

230
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
My daughter?

231
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,880
It's a sad story.

232
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,000
Mr. Song once had a happy family,

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,040
with a son and a daughter.

234
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,920
But on the night he died,

235
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,680
his daughter went missing.

236
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,320
On that very day?

237
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,280
Remember any features of his daughter?

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,680
His wife posted notices.

239
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,880
I remember

240
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,480
that girl had a birthmark.

241
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,920
A pale pink birthmark

242
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,560
on her waist.

243
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,160
Your daughter had
a birthmark on her left waist.

244
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,720
She was lost in Anle Alley years ago,

245
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,120
right?

246
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,160
How do you know this?

247
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,040
Wan is your biological daughter.
