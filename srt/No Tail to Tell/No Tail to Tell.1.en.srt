00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,961
NO TAIL TO TELL

00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,295


3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,422

00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,265


5
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,477


6
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,356


7
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,402


8
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,988
-

00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,031


10
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,950


11
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,494


12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,540


13
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,292


14
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,918


15
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,178
What the…

16
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,180
There's nothing in the bag.

17
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,772
You've been digging up this whole mountain
for three months straight.

18
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,066
Who… are you?

19
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,151
Where is Hanyang?

20
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,154
- What?
- I need to get to Hanyang today.

21
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,073
So, tell me. Which way is it?

22
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,329
Hanyang is that way.

23
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,081
Oh, that way?

24
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,585
But it'll take at least 20 days
to get there.

25
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,382
What?

26
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,892
Oh, I almost forgot.

27
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,105
Dig that up
and brew it carefully for half a day.

28
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,066
It will help with your mother's illness.

29
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,692
What?

30
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,291
<i> This is an ancient tale.</i>

31
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,878
I found it!

32
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,089
<i>It is the story</i>
<i>of a nine-tailed fox</i>

33
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,674
<i>who wished to become human,</i>

34
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,386
<i>spending her days cultivating virtue</i>
<i>on Myohyangsan Mountain.</i>

35
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,122
Can you leave us for a moment?

36
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,416
Chun-sim stays.

37
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,005
Chun-sim.

38
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,882
That's you!

39
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,228
What did you do with Chun-sim?

40
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,064
Pardon?

41
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,066
What do you…

42
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,110
Look.

43
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,239
It's so obvious.

44
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,623
You seemed completely human,
yet your cunning is all fox.

45
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,583
How did you know?

46
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,668
Your scent.

47
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,837
I smell the earth on you.

48
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,132
The scent of Myohyangsan Mountain's soil
that I've known for centuries.

49
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,342
Have you been well?

50
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:25,474
I was just bored without you around.

51
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,727
By the way, don't worry about Chun-sim.

52
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,188
I bet she's dozing off in the kitchen.

53
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,606
All right.

54
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,484
How do you feel?

55
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,736
It's your long-awaited wedding day.

56
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,198
It still doesn't feel real

57
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:45,285
that I've become human
and will be wed to my beloved.

58
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,496
Goodness.

59
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,625
Fine, leave me behind
and go live a happy life.

60
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,338
Come here, Eun-ho.
Let me hug you. It's been a while.

61
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,299
Geum-ho…

62
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,706
<i>This is usually</i>
<i>where old tales end.</i>

63
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,046
<i>She finally became human</i>
<i>and married the one she loved.</i>

64
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:42,759
<i>And so, they lived happily ever after.</i>

65
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,928
<i>The end.</i>

66
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,015
Get over here!

67
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,019
Wow, amazing.

68
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,439
Look at this.

69
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,567
These hairpins must be new.

70
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,861
Oh my gosh, they're so pretty!

71
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,988
Don't they look good on me?

72
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,994
- Geum-ho?
- Yes?

73
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,416
What's got you staring like that?

74
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,176
Well, look at you.

75
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,263
What?

76
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,975
So that's why
you wanted to come to the market.

77
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,852
You had an ulterior motive.

78
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,396
It's not like that.

79
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,898
If you're done looking, let's go.

80
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,442
My lady!

81
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,824
So we meet again.

82
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,827
Yes, my lord.

83
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,830
What a coincidence running into you.

84
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,843
Be happy, Geum-ho.

85
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,779
<i> But I didn't know then…</i>

86
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,282
That way!

87
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,953
<i>…that human life</i>
<i>is endlessly fragile,</i>

88
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,039
<i>and their happiness</i>
<i>shatters far too easily.</i>

89
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,545
<i>That life is hard,</i>
<i>and death is always near.</i>

90
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,883
<i>That was the future that awaited.</i>

91
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,973
<i>So in the end,</i>
<i>Geum-ho would not find happiness.</i>

92
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,602
<i>All because she loved a human</i>
<i>and chose to become one.</i>

93
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,107
PRESENT DAY

94
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,529
<i>And so, I became who I am today.</i>

95
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,615
<i>A nine-tailed fox</i>
<i>who refuses to love humans</i>

96
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,450
<i>and does not seek to become one.</i>

97
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,077
<i>That's who I am.</i>

98
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:23,044
<i> Why should I want</i>
<i>to become a human?</i>

99
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,423
<i>So trivial, powerless, aging, sickly,</i>

100
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,925
<i>and in the end, doomed to die.</i>

101
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,139
<i>Here and now,</i>

102
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,559
<i>one life ends…</i>

103
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,022
<i>and another begins.</i>

104
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:50,447
<i>And this story began</i>
<i>nine years ago.</i>

105
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,998
EPISODE 1
AN INEVITABLE EVENT

106
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,626
Here! Over here!

107
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,919
SOSIN HIGH SCHOOL

108
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,049
HYEON WOO-SEOK

109
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,258
Pass! Over there!

110
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,885
Cover! I'm coming through!

111
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,927
NINE YEARS AGO

112
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,345
That's it!

113
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,140
He's good, isn't he?

114
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,017
That's Hyeon Woo-seok.

115
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,769
He just became a high school senior.

116
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,443
Since he was
first selected for the U-13 national team,

117
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,237
he has been the starting striker
across all youth squads.

118
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,286
Hey, Woo-seok! Pass!

119
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,748
- Pass!
- Cover this side!

120
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,042
Hey! You crazy idiot!

121
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,418
Woo-seok was open!

122
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,921
Stop messing around
and just pass the ball!

123
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,341
He's asking who that player is.

124
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,759
Which one?

125
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,680
That one.
The one who was messing around earlier.

126
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,225
- That's a foul!
- That's Kang Si-yeol.

127
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,644
Gosh, that kid is just crazy.

128
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,188
He's all flash and no substance.
And he never passes.

129
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,315
He tries to do everything himself.

130
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,491
Hey, Si-yeol, you brat! Just tap it in!

131
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,201
Stop showing off!

132
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,251
Damn, that little…

133
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,380
Woo-seok, nice assist.

134
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,132
Assist.

135
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,012
You think what a coach says is a joke?

136
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,474
I told you to pass to Woo-seok
whenever you get the ball.

137
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:47,230
The new youth national team coach
came to watch Woo-seok play today.

138
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,440
The least you could do
is help your friend,

139
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,526
not get in his way.

140
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,865
How is me scoring a goal
getting in Woo-seok's way?

141
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:01,119
So why did you have to score a goal?

142
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,080
I told you to play defense today.

143
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,708
When did I tell you to score a goal?

144
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,586
You got carried away trying to stand out.

145
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,795
Straighten up.

146
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,053
You've never even paid
your club fees on time,

147
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,014
and you give me this attitude.

148
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,268
Good work.

149
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,853
- Hey, boys.
- Eat up.

150
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,855
Woo-seok's father
is treating us,

151
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,899
so make sure you thank him
before digging in.

152
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,859
Gosh, Coach.
There's really no need.

153
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,488
- Here, have some more.
- Hey, Kang Si-yeol.

154
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,656
LET'S GO, SOSIN SOCCER CLUB!

155
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,866
Dad, hold on.

156
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,284
- Sure.
- Hold this.

157
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,871
- Kang Si-yeol.
- It's fine. I don't want any.

158
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,336
Coach.

159
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,546
Yes, good to see you.

160
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,590
- Great game today.
- Not at all.

161
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,968
Here, use this to take the boys out
for a nice dinner next time.

162
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,970
Thank you as always, Mr. Hyeon.

163
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,265
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

164
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,269
<i>The contractor for Bannam Zone 2,</i>

165
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,814
<i>Korea's biggest redevelopment project,</i>
<i>will be named today.</i>

166
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,401
<i>With three top-tier construction companies</i>
<i>competing for the contract,</i>

167
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:19,072
<i>experts say Geumsu Construction,</i>
<i>embroiled in a power abuse scandal,</i>

168
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,867
<i>is unlikely to win, leaving the other two</i>
<i>as front-runners.</i>

169
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,036
<i>- In other news--</i>

170
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,871
Why did you turn it off?

171
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,707
I was listening to it.

172
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,585
I'm sorry, Mr. Lee.
Should I turn it back on?

173
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,342
The real issue isn't abuse of power.
It's subordinates getting out of line.

174
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,762
I pay you to drive,
so why aren't you focused on driving?

175
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,973
Mr. Lee, it's not that--

176
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,474
Are your ears perking up

177
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,228
because they're trashing me on the radio?

178
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,562
No, sir.

179
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,439
That's not it at all.

180
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,942
It's a red light.

181
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,653
What the heck?

182
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,073
Watch where you're going!

183
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,660
2016 SEOUL
BANNAM ZONE 2 PROJECT PLAN

184
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,456
It fell. What bad luck.

185
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:29,392
WELCOME TO THE CONTRACTOR SELECTION
GENERAL MEETING

186
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,144
Did you drive here yourself?

187
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,271
I ended up driving myself.

188
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,733
Mr. Lee, there's also
the board's decision to consider.

189
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,109
Are you sure about this?

190
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,070
You mean those old geezers
telling me to stay put?

191
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,781
There's no need
for you to get involved, sir.

192
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,659
It was always going to be
a difficult contract to win.

193
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,871
Now there's a risk that
you might have to take all the blame.

194
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,290
This is why you're just an employee.

195
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,379
- Just take off your shirt.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,923
- Should I hire a new driver?
- Sure, whatever.

197
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,718
Just give him some money
so he doesn't run his mouth.

198
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,927
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,853
This project is mine.

200
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,148
I want every son of a bitch
in the sticks to know

201
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,693
that Lee Yoon of Geumsu Group
personally won a 9.5-trillion-won project.

202
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,155
Then those old geezers won't be able
to call me a deadbeat anymore.

203
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,241
Mr. Lee.

204
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,869
Now is a crucial time,
with the group's succession on the line.

205
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,537
If you fail to win the contract--

206
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:34,540
You know that saying,
"there's nothing money can't buy"?

207
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,793
I used to think
that was just an expression.

208
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,461
But I was wrong.

209
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,339
There's nothing that money can't solve.

210
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,300
Seriously, anything's possible with money.

211
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:55,603
Dear fellow members
of the Bannam Zone 2 union,

212
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,564
To begin, we,
the executive team of Yeoni Construction,

213
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,275
would like to extend our deepest respects
to the union members.

214
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,487
BANNAM ZONE 2 CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PLAN

215
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,575
What, a deep bow? Give me a break.

216
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,871
YEONI CONSTRUCTION

217
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,588
I'm sorry, sir.

218
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,843
Hey, what did you do?

219
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,886
- Aren't they starting?
- What's going on?

220
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,557
- Jeez.
- What are they doing?

221
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,061
What's this?
Did they hire another celebrity?

222
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,271
<i>My dear humans.</i>

223
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,106
<i>Allow me to intrude for a bit.</i>

224
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,357
What is going on right now?

225
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,733
- What…
- Who's she?

226
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,193
<i>It's a little noisy.</i>

227
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,947
<i>Don't panic.</i>
<i>Starting now, you will lose your voices.</i>

228
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,952
<i>Now, everyone focus on me.</i>

229
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,162
<i>Don't think of anything else.</i>

230
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,637
Ah, ah.

231
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,557
I'm sure you're all very busy,
so I'll make this quick.

232
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,437
You must all be stressing over
who to vote for to make more money.

233
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,482
But really, does it even matter
who builds the new Bannam-dong apartments?

234
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,400
Don't overthink it.

235
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,362
Everyone on the left side,
just vote for Geumsu Construction.

236
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,865
As for everyone on the right,
do as you please.

237
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,825
Well then.

238
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,496
Oh, right.

239
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,955
Honestly, I feel a little bad.

240
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,876
I have a general idea of how much
you humans love your apartments.

241
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,463
But what can I do?
I have to make money too.

242
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,798
I'm sure you all understand
since we all love money.

243
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,800
Right? Bye then.

244
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,977
You. Follow me.

245
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,556
Oh dear.

246
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,310
Goodness.

247
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,895
- Grandma, let me.
- What?

248
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,024
All right, let's go.

249
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,780
I scored a goal today.

250
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,991
Oh my, well done.

251
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,911
- Is that it?
- What else should I say?

252
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,122
I'm just saying "well done"
because you did well.

253
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,749
My goodness, Grandma.

254
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,919
If you keep this up,
I won't spoil you when I'm older.

255
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,299
I don't care about that.

256
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,301
Well, I care.

257
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:14,802
Just you wait.

258
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,806
By the way, when do we need to pay
this month's soccer club fee?

259
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,852
I told you not to worry about that.

260
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,980
I'm exempt from the fees.

261
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,773
I'm the star player, you know.

262
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,611
Still,
that's not how things should be.

263
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,572
Grandma, haven't you heard
of a full scholarship?

264
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,658
I don't have to pay a single penny.

265
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,535
Gosh, really?

266
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,079
Oh, my little boy, I'm so proud of you.

267
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,759
- Enjoy your meal. Take care.
- Thank you.

268
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,719
Here you go. Be safe!

269
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,099
Enjoy your meal.

270
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,517
SPEEDY DELIVERY SERVICE

271
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,151
Thank you.

272
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,838
What are you doing at this hour?

273
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,010
What about you?
And what's with that outfit?

274
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,138
I'm working my part-time job.

275
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,724
- What?
- I've got my eye on some cleats.

276
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,186
Jeez, you should be spending
your time practicing.

277
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,230
Just ask your parents for the cleats.

278
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,693
Hmm?

279
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,907
- Hey, wanna make a bet?
- Jeez.

280
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,703
Okay.

281
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,413
What are the stakes?

282
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:34,942
Oh!

283
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,071
- Hey, that was a clear foul!
- Goal!

284
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,781
You're out.

285
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,165
Goal!

286
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,375
- Left.
- Right.

287
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,967
It went in, right?

288
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,053
Goal!

289
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,894
Nice.

290
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,023
Mm.

291
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,280
I was wondering why you were playing
like your life depended on it.

292
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,491
But is that it? A chicken breast?

293
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,242
I wasn't playing like that.

294
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,328
I just crushed you with my skills.

295
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,332
What? Are you hurt?

296
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,542
Hey, just hurry up and eat.

297
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,795
I want to get a few more deliveries in.

298
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,464
Mm.

299
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,301
What, is this your thing?

300
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,886
A lazy genius?

301
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,057
I mean, you don't seem to be taking
private lessons like everyone else.

302
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,809
And you're working part-time at this hour.

303
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,854
But seeing you in action…

304
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,818
You asshole!

305
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,403
Hey.

306
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,572
A poor genius.

307
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,199
What?

308
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,202
You got the genius part right,
but I'm a bit short on cash.

309
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,830
My parents aren't around,

310
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,331
and my grandma's sick.

311
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,042
I see.

312
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,045
So while you're practicing,
I have to be out making money.

313
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,755
Hey, I didn't know--

314
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,924
But you know what's really important here?

315
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,887
Despite all that,
without any of those damn private lessons,

316
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,515
I still managed to kick your ass today.

317
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,142
You saw the goal I scored
during practice today, right?

318
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,855
Yeah, I saw it, you punk.

319
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,774
So don't get too cocky
just because you're on the national team.

320
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,862
When you get called up,
I'm gonna take your spot as striker.

321
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:43,904
Mm.

322
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,575
When you get back, the starting lineup
might be totally different.

323
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,077
Why am I even talking to you?

324
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,036
Jeez.

325
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,831
Man, that's good.

326
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,293
You really don't want any?

327
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,836
I don't eat stuff like that.

328
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,057
Why aren't you eating?

329
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,311
That poor cow died for nothing.

330
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,770
I don't have an appetite.

331
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,064
I told you,
there's nothing to worry about.

332
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,275
This is important to me.

333
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,362
I'm sure it is.

334
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,323
You acted like a deadbeat,

335
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,658
and now you're
on your rich father's bad side.

336
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,410
And now your position as heir is at risk.

337
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,456
You seem pretty interested
in human affairs.

338
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,374
Because I've taken a liking to you.

339
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,086
You're rich,
and you look like a troublemaker.

340
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,464
I think you're going to become
a repeat customer.

341
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,341
Since we're on the subject,

342
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,594
who are your other clients besides me?

343
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,223
You seem pretty interested
in nine-tailed fox affairs.

344
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,770
Can I have this one too?

345
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,025
I guess that's a secret.

346
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,988
Then, what exactly are you capable of?

347
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,951
Judging by the fact that you need money,

348
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,453
it seems you can't do whatever you want.

349
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:18,040
Shouldn't I know
what you can and can't do

350
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,584
if I'm going to hire you again?

351
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,796
Humans are always like this.

352
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,883
All right, let me explain something.

353
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:40,896
What is this?

354
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,941
Where am I?

355
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,277
I guess calling you a "customer"
gave you the wrong idea.

356
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,989
That if you just give me money,
you can order me to do anything

357
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,532
and ask for whatever you want.

358
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,585
Simply put,

359
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,213
think of this less as making requests
and more like praying.

360
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,217
Whether or not I grant your wish
is up to me.

361
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,970
And how I choose to grant it
is also up to me.

362
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,389
How much I take,
and what I take as payment,

363
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,516
is obviously up to me as well.

364
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,310
I'm the one who asks questions, not you.

365
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,273
Even what you're allowed to know,
and how much, is up to me.

366
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,485
Do you understand now?

367
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,488
I'm telling you not to get cocky.

368
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,907
You pathetic little human.

369
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,248
But since we're on the subject,
I'll tell you one thing.

370
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,459
I have only one principle.

371
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,794
I avoid doing
even the smallest of good deeds

372
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,713
and only avoid doing major misdeeds.

373
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,135
Looks like you didn't get it.

374
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,971
This is important,
so I'll break it down for you.

375
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,141
I don't do good deeds.
No matter how trivial.

376
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:03,062
I can't risk cultivating more virtue
and accidentally becoming human.

377
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,773
As for wrongdoings,
I only avoid major ones.

378
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,858
Things like…

379
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,611
killing people.

380
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,821
That's the only thing I avoid.

381
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,617
I'm trying to avoid becoming human,
not trying to diminish my spiritual power.

382
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,454
SECRETARY CHOI

383
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,210
You can go now.

384
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:31,048
The voting results are out.
You should go get your picture taken.

385
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,133
Nothing beats a photo for showing off.

386
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,179
By the way, I already took the money
from the trunk of your car.

387
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,556
So don't worry about it.

388
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:24,601
<i>A human's life</i>
<i>is like swimming in a sea of suffering.</i>

389
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:29,648
<i>From the moment they're thrown</i>
<i>into this unfamiliar world</i>

390
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,317
<i>until they rot away to nothing,</i>

391
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,529
<i>humans can never find</i>
<i>even a moment of peace.</i>

392
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,868
<i>Life is a constant competition.</i>

393
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,788
<i>It's a battlefield</i>

394
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,499
<i>where they can only climb up</i>
<i>by dragging others down.</i>

395
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,797
<i>And it's a hamster wheel</i>
<i>that never stops turning.</i>

396
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:00,888
<i>Human happiness</i>
<i>is but a fleeting illusion,</i>

397
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:05,058
<i>and such is the human condition</i>
<i>I have observed for hundreds of years.</i>

398
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,606
<i>But in contrast to that,</i>
<i>my life as a nine-tailed fox</i>

399
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,066
<i>is like a festival that never ends.</i>

400
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,790
Hey.

401
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,127
Yes?

402
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,630
All the kids these days
seem to dress like you.

403
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,174
I used to dress like that 20 years ago.

404
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,010
- I guess it's back in style.
- Excuse me?

405
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,011
You.

406
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,347
Come shopping with me today.

407
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:44,973
Why should I?

408
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,226
Because I like the way you dress.

409
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,103
Besides, it's boring to shop alone.

410
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,774
Think of yourself
as a friend for the day, if you will.

411
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,026
What the heck?

412
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,778
What a weirdo.

413
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,240
Listen to me.

414
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,034
You're going to hang out with me today.

415
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,037
Yes, of course.

416
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,833
So, you're saying
you're a nine-tailed fox?

417
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,293
Really?

418
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,796
Come on, a nine-tailed fox?

419
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,048
There's no such thing.

420
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,467
You'd believe me if I used sorcery
and showed you my tails,

421
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,219
but I can't be bothered.

422
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,473
Just believe it. I'm a nine-tailed fox.

423
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,559
Oh, okay.

424
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,273
Oh my! Those look great on you too.

425
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:35,649
You think so?

426
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,775
I'll take these too.

427
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,697
Hey, I have a question.

428
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,781
What is it?

429
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:46,159
"Aren't nine-tailed foxes
supposed to eat human livers

430
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:49,246
and seduce men to drain their life force?"

431
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,123
Yes, how did you know?

432
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,583
It was obvious.

433
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,004
Do you think you're the first human
to ask me such questions?

434
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,340
Do you know how people
in the Joseon era used to speak?

435
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,843
You think they were like…

436
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,803
"Your Majesty,"

437
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,013
"How insolent"?

438
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,515
Do you really think that?

439
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,516
They didn't?

440
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,477
That's all just made up
by those TV people.

441
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,064
It's not as if they actually
lived through that era like I did.

442
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,275
So how would they know?

443
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:22,070
You make something up,
and humans just believe it.

444
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,073
Same with the tales
about nine-tailed foxes.

445
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,117
My goodness, that's truly amazing.

446
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,829
Look at everything happening
inside that little box.

447
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,457
My goodness, how fascinating!

448
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,916
RETURN OF THE LEGEND
NINE-TAILED FOX

449
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,169
<i>People didn't think of us in this way</i>

450
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,379
<i>before that damn </i>Return of the Legend.

451
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,102
Oh my gosh.
That scared the life out of me.

452
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,691
When humans cultivate themselves,
they're called sages,

453
00:30:59,775 --> 00:31:01,902
while animals that do so
are called spirit beasts.

454
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,280
So why do foxes cultivating themselves
to become human get treated like monsters?

455
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,326
Do they think it's easy to self-cultivate
and train until we grow nine tails?

456
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,370
Nine-tailed foxes cultivate themselves?

457
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,956
Yes, just like how sages self-cultivate
and train to become immortals,

458
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,793
nine-tailed foxes have to self-cultivate
and train to become humans.

459
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,752
Think about it.

460
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,546
Why would a nine-tailed fox,
who's self-cultivating and building karma,

461
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,048
hunt human livers? If they did that,

462
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,217
they would lose
all the spiritual power they've earned.

463
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,637
Oh, I see.

464
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,932
You must have felt so misunderstood.

465
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,226
Anyway, that's all in the past.

466
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,853
I'm the only nine-tailed fox
left on Earth now.

467
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:40,816
I've lost all desire to be human,
so I have no reason to cultivate myself.

468
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,692
You're not trying
to become human?

469
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,611
But you're a nine-tailed fox. How come?

470
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,738
Because I love the way I live now.

471
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,783
Sometimes, humans get the wrong idea.

472
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,120
They think that living forever
would be tedious and boring.

473
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,331
But when you actually experience it,
there's never a dull moment

474
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,500
because the human world changes so fast.

475
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,796
There's always something new and fun.

Hey, Teacher.

I can't understand a single word.

How am I suddenly speaking
in Joseon language?

00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,571

532
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,869
What is that supposed to mean?

533
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,621
You don't think
I've accomplished anything?

534
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,248
I've learned everything
and played every game there is.

535
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:29,252
But no matter what you've learned,
you haven't followed through.

536
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,130
If there's something you don't like,
you just change it all.

537
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,549
- Or just scrap it.
- It's not like that.

538
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,968
And you don't have any friends
to shop and chat with,

539
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,553
so you just grab a random person and--

540
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,846
I said it's not like that!

541
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,849
Hey, take my side.

542
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,017
No matter what.

543
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,730
I envy you.

544
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,398
I wish I could live like you.

545
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:54,778
Just spending money and having fun
without a care in the world.

546
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,322
What?

547
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,199
Yes? What is it?

548
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,952
Forget it. Just finish your food.

549
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,330
I really chose
the wrong person for this.

550
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,334
Can't she read the room at all?

551
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,688
What is it?

552
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,023
Why did you drag me out on a weekend?

553
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,526
Pick one. Whichever.

554
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,319
What?

555
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,031
You said there were cleats
you wanted to buy.

556
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,992
Don't save up with your part-time job.
Just pick them now.

557
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,539
And if I do?
You're going to buy them for me?

558
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,249
No.

559
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,919
I happen to have
a sponsorship deal with this brand.

560
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,046
It's a sponsorship
worth 20 million won a year,

561
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,549
but I can't use all of it
by myself anyway.

562
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,426
A sponsorship deal?

563
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,594
But you're not even a pro.

564
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:06,433
Dude, I'm a top prospect
for the youth national team.

565
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,019
They signed me a few years ago.

566
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,816
Are you going to pick one or not?

567
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,651
Do you think I'm a beggar?

568
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,820
What?

569
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,613
I'm fine.

570
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,742
I'm leaving.

571
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,495
Hey…

572
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,289
SONGWONGAK CHINESE RESTAURANT

573
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,376
That was so delicious.

574
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,419
Yeah, I guess you--

575
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:42,635
Humans are so pathetically weak.

576
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,393
Get up. Is anything broken?

577
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,520
No…

578
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,733
No, that's not it.

579
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,236
What happened?

580
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,864
But are you okay?

581
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,158
We ran into each other pretty hard.

582
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,453
You should try exercising
instead of just burying yourself in books.

583
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,954
You're pathetic for a guy your size.

584
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,080
Just go.

585
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:13,583
Oh…

586
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,129
My apologies.

587
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:34,771
KING RAMYEON

588
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,950
How interesting.

589
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,493
What is?

590
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,453
That human over there.

591
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,665
I think he'll become quite famous
in the near future.

592
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,084
Famous?

593
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,544
Which one of the two?

594
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,920
That one over there.

595
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,758
I see.

596
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,761
But how do you know things like that?

597
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,137
I just do.

598
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,391
I sometimes see fragments of the future.

599
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,726
I can't see them whenever I want.

600
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,398
I don't know when, why, or what I'll see,

601
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,193
but whatever I see is inevitable.

602
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,579
That way!

603
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,794
<i>Even I can't do anything to change it.</i>

604
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,509
Anyway, that guy will become rich
and famous at some point.

605
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,720
So he might become one of my clients.

606
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,929
Oh, right.

607
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:54,684
You said you grant rich people's wishes
and get paid for it, didn't you?

608
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,312
Then, maybe you could grant my wish too?

609
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,939
You think I would do that?

610
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,318
You don't have nearly enough
to become my client.

611
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,279
But starting today, we're friends.

612
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,948
Don't you have, like,
a discount for friends and family?

613
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,743
Humans never fail to disappoint.

614
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,289
This is exactly why I don't bother
with troublesome human relationships.

615
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,373
I told you earlier.

616
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,542
You're just a friend for the day.

617
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,501
What?

618
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,378
What that means is…

619
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,465
…you're going to forget

620
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,009
everything you did with me today,
everything we talked about,

621
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,721
and even my very existence.

622
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,097
Understand?

623
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,432
Yes, I understand.

624
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,601
Anyway, I had fun today.

625
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:37,936
You should get going too.

626
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,365
Hey, you guys.

627
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,785
Come carry this for me.

628
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,181
You're a beast cultivating yourself.

629
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,433
What in the world are you doing here?

630
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,203
Hey.

631
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,789
Are you really mad?

632
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,962
Look, it wasn't because
I felt sorry for you.

633
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,340
Hey, come on.

634
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,012
I'm sorry.

635
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:59,851
I guess now that I think about it,
I did feel sorry for you.

636
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:04,564
But it's not because I think
I'm better than you or anything.

637
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:08,735
I just wanted to help you out
after what you told me.

638
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,654
Hey.

639
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,657
- What?
- Wanna kick the ball around a bit?

640
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,117
What?

641
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,703
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

642
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,623
Sure, bring it on.

643
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,469
At cafés, you have to buy
one drink per person.

644
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,804
That's the rule
in the human world these days.

645
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,806
I'm…

646
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:44,812
…a being far greater
than any rule made by humans.

647
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,314
I'm sure you are.

648
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,816
After all,
you're the Deity of the Big Dipper.

649
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:54,739
What brings you here all of a sudden,
interrupting my hobby like this?

650
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,034
You call that a hobby?

651
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,080
Of course. There isn't anything
more human and fun than spending money.

652
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,087
If you enjoy living like a human so much,

653
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,299
why won't you become one,
while deceiving the eyes of Heaven?

654
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,552
You're missing the point.

655
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,554
Who said I want to live like a human?

656
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,640
Squeezing into the subway to go to work

657
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,725
and working for over ten hours a day,

658
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,353
only to collapse into sleep
from exhaustion.

659
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,690
Even if you make a few bucks like that,
you don't have time to spend it.

660
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,735
That's what it means to be human.

661
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:36,155
A moment of sweetness,
and a lifetime of bitterness.

662
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:42,829
But life as a nine-tailed fox is kind of
like spending money on a pay-to-win game.

663
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:46,332
You get to enjoy all the fun stuff
without any of the inconvenience.

664
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,379
I wonder if the big shots up there
would even understand what I'm saying.

665
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,339
Since they're just so divine and all.

666
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,925
You're still wicked and irreverent.

667
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,678
Oh, whatever.

668
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,264
Anyway, I don't think we're
on good enough terms to sit and chat.

669
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,851
Let's just get straight to the point,
Lord Pagun.

670
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:05,977
So?

671
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,646
You want me to become human already?

672
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,190
Are you asking why I'm still like this

673
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,693
when all the other nine-tailed foxes
have already become human,

674
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,195
lived out their lives, and died?

675
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,658
I refuse.

676
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,119
If that's all, I can go now, right?

677
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,830
I'm going to go home
and unbox my new stuff.

678
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,373
Your scale

679
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,542
is tipping.

680
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:38,926
That can't be.

681
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,306
I put an insane amount of effort
into keeping that balance aligned.

682
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:47,768
I even earn my own money
just to appease all of you up there.

683
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,854
So how could the scale be tipping?

684
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,982
There will come a time
when you must choose.

685
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,651
Whether to become human

686
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,739
or be forever annihilated.

687
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,828
Don't make me laugh.

688
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,248
They may be deities,
but how dare they threaten me?

689
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,628
Let them try.

690
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,633
Do they still think I'm the same
naive fox who believed everything

691
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,635
the ones above told me?

692
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:22,720
They won't get their way.

693
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:26,432
Even you guys don't really get
the so-called Law of Heaven, do you?

694
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,310
Because it's so vague and messed up.

695
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,355
Well, there's one thing
I know for certain.

696
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,483
"Heaven's net is vast and wide,
yet nothing slips through."

697
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,695
You may think
you're outside of Heaven's influence,

698
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,781
but nothing ever escapes notice.

699
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,368
Ha!

700
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,745
Save the sermon.

701
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,880
That was Daoist teaching, actually.

702
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,427
Excuse me.

703
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,847
- Get up!
- Get up!

704
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,182
Mr. Lee!

705
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,101
We love you!

706
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,603
You're the only boss we have, sir!

707
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:17,525
Lee Yoon!

708
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,568
What was that? I can't hear you.

709
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,736
Louder!

710
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:26,575
Lee Yoon!

711
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,327
Everyone, drink up!

712
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,204
Drink up!

713
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,431
Nice.

714
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,565
Hey, are you okay?

715
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,818
Gosh, let's call it a day.

716
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,611
Hey, it's my turn though.

717
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,198
Damn it.

718
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,035
Fine.

719
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,752
Unbelievable.

720
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,463
I can't believe they're still
trying to boss me around at my age.

721
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,839
Today just keeps getting worse--

722
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,593
What? Who was that?

723
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,770
Wow, it was like a missile.

724
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:39,273
Hey, I'll go find the ball.
You go on ahead.

725
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,859
- I'll come with you.
- It's fine. You go.

726
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,569
Bye.

727
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,661
Man, where did it go?

728
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,624
Was it you?

729
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,253
Are you the owner of this ball?

730
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,421
Yes, I am.

731
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,923
Thank you.

732
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,095
- Wait.
- No need to thank me.

733
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,603
- Hey--
- Go. We're done here.

734
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,938
Excuse me!

735
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,902
Wait, you're that kid from earlier.

736
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,114
Were you kicking a ball around this late
because I told you to get some exercise?

737
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,783
You don't look it,
but you're quite obedient.

738
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,284
What is she talking about?

739
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:35,287
Anyway, you shouldn't go around
popping other people's balls.

740
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,456
Well, I couldn't pop your head, could I?

741
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,166
Since I'm a self-cultivated beast.

742
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,793
Unbelievable.

743
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:44,547
Hold on.

744
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,382
They don't usually pop that easily.

745
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,008
It's not some kind of balloon--

746
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,719
That's because you are a weak human.

747
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:52,179
What did you say?

748
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,765
Wait, who do you keep calling weak?

749
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,934
Can't you tell just by looking?

750
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:57,935
I'm an athlete.

751
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,020
Is that so?

752
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,439
I may not be much now,

753
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,608
but in a few years,
I'm going to be a really famous athlete.

754
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:05,943
Right.

755
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,988
I don't think so.

756
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,948
- What?
-<i> Famous?</i>

757
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,534
Which one of the two?

758
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,453
That one over there.

759
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,289
<i>Maybe your friend, but not you.</i>

760
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,540
I saw it earlier.

761
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,250
What are you--

762
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,669
Your friend is going to be very famous.

763
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,338
He'll be a world-class player
and make a lot of money too.

764
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:30,301
I'm certain. The future
never changes after I've seen it.

765
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,094
But as for you…

766
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,222
Hmm…

767
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,018
I don't see anything at all.

768
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,354
Who are you to say that?

769
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,190
You don't know anything about me!

770
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,359
You'll just be a nobody.

771
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:51,697
You might become a mediocre player
no one remembers,

772
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,365
but any success beyond that…

773
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,911
It's just not in your future.

774
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,372
So don't get your hopes up
and dream too big.

775
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:02,166
That way, you won't get hurt.

776
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,459
This…

777
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,628
This woman is a complete lunatic.

778
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,838
It's cruel, I know.

779
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,217
But that's just how human life is.

780
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,636
It's not like life is being
especially cruel to you.

781
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,054
So don't take it too hard.

782
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,437
Man, I did it! Damn it!

783
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,149
I'm Lee Yoon. Who's going to stop me?

784
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,863
Move! Damn it!

785
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,073
Whoa!

786
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,179
- Did you hear that?
- I don't know.

787
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,681
Maybe there was an accident.

788
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,183
It has nothing to do with me.

789
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:13,112
Oh no, oh no… What…

790
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,287
I have to get out of here.

791
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,252
Hey!

792
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,629
Stop! I said stop!

793
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,299
Damn it.

794
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,302
I said stop!

795
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:43,475
Woo-seok!

796
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,394
Woo-seok!

797
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,023
Woo-seok.

798
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,451
OPERATING ROOM

799
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,663
You can't come in.

800
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,924
PLEASE DISPOSE OF TRASH HERE

801
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,176
Damn it.

802
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:19,595
Jeez.

803
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,933
Seriously.

804
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,730
What am I going to do?

805
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,950
It'll probably be fine.

806
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,877
He seemed drunk.
He was stumbling when he walked.

807
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:56,131
So you suspect
he was intoxicated.

808
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,218
Okay, we've requested
all the security footage from the area,

809
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,969
so we'll identify the vehicle owner soon.

810
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,729
- How may I help you?
- Well, I…

811
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,564
Yesterday, I…

812
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:16,860
ran someone over.

813
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,658
<i>Bong-chang just went to turn himself in.</i>

814
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:27,579
There won't be
any problems for you, sir.

815
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,041
<i> It's not him.</i>

816
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:32,459
It wasn't this guy.

817
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,961
I saw him.

818
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,463
- Sir.
- Yes?

819
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,717
Are you sure
you were the one driving?

820
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,929
Yes. I secretly took a company car out,

821
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,598
- and made a mistake--
- You're lying.

822
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,268
You weren't the one
who caused the accident.

823
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,103
I saw everything!

824
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,814
Why are you lying? Seriously!

825
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,482
Let go of me!

826
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,234
<i>Sir, we have a problem.</i>

827
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,445
Bong-chang just called.

828
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:04,199
He said he couldn't bring himself to lie
and asked if we could just forget the deal

829
00:54:04,283 --> 00:54:06,660
in exchange for returning
all the money we gave him.

830
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:09,246
What are you talking about?
Why the sudden change?

831
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,456
He said there was a witness.

832
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,837
Bring that bastard here right now.

833
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,593
- There's one more thing--
- What is it this time?

834
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,554
I received a call from the police station.

835
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:29,224
They said you also need to come in
for questioning as a witness, sir.

836
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,776
How the hell are you…

837
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,737
Damn it!

838
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,032
How could you handle this so poorly?

839
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,659
I apologize, sir.

840
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,417
Get out.

841
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:57,878
Pardon?

842
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,089
I'll handle it myself from now on.

843
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,257
Get out.

844
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,344
Mm-hmm.

845
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,268
Jeez.

846
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,910
I WILL GRANT YOUR WISH

847
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:53,892
Wow.

848
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,311
It's you again.

849
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:08,031
It must be nice to be rich,
summoning me again after just one day.

850
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,284
Maybe I didn't charge you
enough yesterday.

851
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:17,124
This time, it's a very simple job.
But it's urgent.

852
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:18,834
What a shame.

853
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,837
I was thinking of taking a break
for about ten years.

854
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:26,884
An annoying old geezer
has been pestering me lately.

855
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,387
So, I'm rejecting your request.

856
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,474
I'll pay you double
what I gave you yesterday.

857
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,103
I guess I'll rest
after I handle this quickly.

858
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,104
What is it?

859
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:43,400
URI GARAM HOSPITAL

860
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,053
Who are you?

861
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,224
You again?

862
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,644
It seems we're deeply connected by fate.

863
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:21,980
The soccer ball from yesterday, right?

864
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,651
But how did you know I was here?

865
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:26,735
Right.

866
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:31,406
I'm here to tweak your memory a bit.

867
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,616
What?

868
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,452
Look straight at me. Don't look away.

869
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,752
About what you saw last night…

870
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:08,944
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

871
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,279
This can't be happening.

872
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,661
No way.

873
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,707
Their fates have switched?

874
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,338
What is this now?

875
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,465
<i>You're still wicked and irreverent.</i>

876
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,928
<i> Your scale</i>

877
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,763
is tipping.

878
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,138
NO TAIL TO TELL

879
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:03,350
<i> I said I lost a huge chunk</i>
<i>of my spiritual power.</i>

880
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,811
<i>- You're going to help me.</i>

881
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,229
I mean, what are you exactly?

882
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:08,605
<i> This beauty. And this mystique.</i>

883
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,482
- A demon?
A nine-tailed fox!

884
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,443
<i>But no matter how much</i>
<i>I think about it, I just don't get it.</i>

885
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,070
<i>What did I do that was so wrong?</i>

886
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,781
A human has died. Because of you.

887
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,199
Who are we?

888
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,724
<i>Kang Si-yeol.</i>
