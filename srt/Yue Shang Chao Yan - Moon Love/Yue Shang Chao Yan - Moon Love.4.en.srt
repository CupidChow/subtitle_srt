Where are you going?

8
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,660
It's so late. Why are you still on the streets?

Well, I want to help you

14

Why are you so confident you'll be able to help me?

15
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,380
I'll know only if I give it a try.

Besides,

17
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,340
I suspect this case has something to do with the renegade immortal.

18

Aren't you afraid of the renegade immortal?

19
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,990
Why do you still want to find the renegade immortal?

20
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,350
That's because

21

I want to help you solve this tricky case.

22

38
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,880
I came to Imperial Censor's Mansion not long ago.

39
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,740
And then such a big case happened.

40
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,600
I must investigate it carefully.

41
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:41,730
In Qingzhou City,

42
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,340
there are very few officials

43
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,460
as responsible as you.

44
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,500
When I was investigating just now,

45
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,060
I found a suspicious person.

46
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,460
So,

47
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,060
I followed her all the way.

48
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,960
I've caught her.

49
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,760
Is it me?

50
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,410
You live in the morgue

51
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,980
and now you're investigating the case in the middle of the night.

52
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,110
You're really different from others.

53
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,500
Actually,

54
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,880
I'm doing this because I want to stay in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

55
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,670
If I can solve this case,

56
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,920
it means I'll do His Lordship a big favor.

57
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,600
Then

00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,270
There seems to be nothing unusual here.

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,600
There is only

62
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,910
a shoe

63
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,260
and a lamp.

64
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,909
If no one else saw them

65
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,900
and only the two Wen sisters were chosen,

66
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,090
I'm afraid

67
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,280

It was found that Yiling, a candidate for the imperial concubines, lived in the room

and that the fire was caused when she was burning joss papers.

564
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,770
And I did find some clues.

565
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,130
Brother Xie.

566
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,690
Please help me investigate someone.

567
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,840
Why are you following me?

568
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,860
My Lord, it's not safe outside tonight.

569
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,880
I dare not go back to the morgue alone.

570
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,280
Do you want to spend the night

571
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,700
in Imperial Censor's Mansion again?

572
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,140
Don't be afraid.

573
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:19,220
I've sent

574
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,880
a group of soldiers to patrol.

575
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,870
No place is safer

576
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,500
than Qingzhou City tonight.

577
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,100
Besides, you've been with me for so long.

578
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,290
No renegade immortal will dare to approach you again.

579
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,010
Fine.

580
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,420
You are right.
