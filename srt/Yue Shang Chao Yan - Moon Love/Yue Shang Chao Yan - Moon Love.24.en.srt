00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,230
It seems that

7
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,860
it's not proper for us to go in and disturb them.

8
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,200
Zhaoyan,

9
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,050
sorry.

10
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,310
Being with me

11
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,130
makes you full of regrets.

12
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,310
In Qingzhou City,

13
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,040
I clearly remember

14

what we did and where we did it.

15

Being able to meet you

16
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,450

Mr. Governor,

22
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,290
Lord Ren and Miss Yun sent this.

23
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,300
They left without leaving a word.

24
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,360
It seems that Ren Shique

25
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,829
really left.

26
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,230
I did tell you to retreat to the mountains and forests,

27
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,850
but I...

28
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,440
I was just saying.

29
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,560
Now that you've left,

30
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,210
what's the fun

31
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,770
of me being the Governor here?

32
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,880
My Lord,

33
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,130
are you really not going to

34
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,250
give it back to him face-to-face?

35
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:18,709
No. Forget it.

36
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,370
If I go to him when he's like that,

37
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,940
it might cause trouble.

38
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,390
My Lord, what's wrong?

39
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,230
Didn't you say

men and women who make wishes on the Broken Bridge

41
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,810
would part in the end?

42
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,659
I've made a wish to the moon.

43
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,400
The Moon God will hear my prayers.

44
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,030
My Lord, you've said goodbye

45
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,910
to everyone else.

46
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,900
Now,

47
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,990

48
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,320
But

49
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,710
I have a little wish

50
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,240
that I haven't told you yet.

51
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,310
You have more wishes than others.

What is it?

00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry that I'm not able to see

where you're going.

55
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,159
You can't

56
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,580
go to that place casually.

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,670
You're right.

58
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,300
Yun Zhaoyan,

59
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,980
you are the biggest challenge I've faced

60
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,740
since I came to the mortal world.

61
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,610
Remember,

62
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,960
don't be afraid of what your eyes give you.

63
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,310
And cherish yourself

65
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,620
After a hundred or a thousand years,

66
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,170
I will forget you completely.

67
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,950
In my long life,

68
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,610
Be careful.

188
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,370
Qing.

189
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,540
[Holding the Jade]

190
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,310
You've been pregnant for months.

191
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,570
Are you still going to deal with the affairs in the mansion?

192
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,130
The people of Qingzhou City love me so much.

193
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,720
Of course I can't escape.

194
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,120
Honey, don't worry.

195
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,610
I've been practicing martial arts since I was young.

196
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,600
I'm very strong.

197
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,540
You're going to be a mother,

198
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,280
yet you are still so careless.

199
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,350
By the way, Honey,

200
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,420
do you know what day it is today?

201
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,630
Today?

202
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,110
Today

203
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,490
is the 15th.

204
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,400
The Moon Worship Ceremony is coming soon.

205
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,710
Yes.

206
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,370
It's been a year since Ren Shique left.

207
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,090
And Zhaoyan has been waiting for him for a year.

208
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,980
Stop following me.

209
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,680
I haven't slept all night.

210
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,800
Let me have a good sleep.

211
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,690
Yun Zhaoyan.

212
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,920
Aren't you getting up yet?

213
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:12,849
My Lord?

214
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,319
Yun Zhaoyan.

215
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,300
Not only are your eyes special,

216
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,220
but your ears can also hear strange sounds now.

217
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,440
It's been more than 300 days

218
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,400
since I met His Lordship.

219
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,600
I wonder if His Lordship is doing well

220
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,180
on the moon.

221
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,430
I want to see him so bad.

222
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,290
Another day when His Lordship is

223
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,720
not in the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

224
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,350
Miss Zhaoyan.

225
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,190
Guigui?

226
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,400
Shouldn't you

227
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,880
be fishing

228
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,610
with the Governor at this hour?

229
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,100
He's really not worth my friendship.

230
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,580
The Immortal Wu Tu you mentioned before

231
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,430
should be very similar to the Governor, right?

232
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,040
It turns out to it's a thousand years of fate.

233
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,060
What fate?

234
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,440
If I hadn't disobeyed two bans of the Heaven Emperor

235
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,300
to help you and God,

236
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,200
I wouldn't have ended up in the mortal world

237
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,620
and be stuck with the Governor every day.

238
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,300
Guigui.

239
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,320
What are you thinking about?

240
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,650
I'm thinking about a selfless Laurel God.

241
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,350
To make a good love story come true,

242
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,470
he plunged into deep distress.

243
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,870
What a touching story!

244
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,180
Guigui.

245
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,640
I brought you soup.

246
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,570
I'm coming.

247
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,310
It seems

248
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,480
there's more to it than the distress.

249
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,560
Miss Zhaoyan, I'm leaving.

250
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,470
Wait.

251
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,150
I have something to ask you.

252
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,940
Have you

253
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,760
heard His Lordship's voice recently?

254
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,650
Miss Zhaoyan, you'd better not overthink.

255
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,900
Yeah.

256
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
I was overthinking.

257
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,860
How could His Lordship come back?

258
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,540
Do you know me?

259
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,480
I remember faintly.

260
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,020
Faintly?

261
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,930
It seems that Chang Xi

262
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,280
left you that memory, anyway.

263
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,070
It's hard to say goodbye.

264
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,130
The memories of the Moon Palace

265
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,040
are precious to me.

266
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,250
But going to the Moon Palace is already a blessing.

267
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,840
I won't leak it out.

268
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,610
Are you sure you're ready

269
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,080
to be separated from Chang Xi for a long time?

270
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,730
His life is still long,

271
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,100
while yours is fleeting.

272
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,310
Do you still want to be alone,

273
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,600
waiting for

274
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,460
a result in an indefinite future?

275
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,110
When I decided to be together with His Lordship, alive or not,

276
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,680
the results don't matter anymore.

277
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,440
Because we have love and courage in our hearts,

278
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,240
no matter how hard it is, we'll go on together.

279
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,300
Every moment I spent with my loved one,

280
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,800
the warmth of our holding hands,

281
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,520
and the heartbeats when we looked at each other

282
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,180
will all become the reasons for us to stick to it.

283
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,480
It seems that

284
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,610
you're not afraid of those renegade immortals anymore.

285
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,040
They look scary,

286
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,880
and they always appear out of nowhere,

287
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,800
but I know

288
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,620
they are kind people with obsessions.

289
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,490
If I can help them get over their emotional knots,

290
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:56,490
I'll be doing something good within my capability.

291
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,390
But sometimes,

292
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,760
you need to learn to go easy on yourself.

293
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,910
Go easy on yourself…

294
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
You little girl.

295
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,840
In the end,

296
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,040
are you talking about you and that guy,

297
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,100
or are you talking about me and Kui Ji?

298
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,060
Actually,

299
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,140
your love for Kui Ji

300
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,560
is no weaker than His Lordship's love for her, right?

301
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,200
You let her exist forever in the form of petals

302
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,480
because you hope

303
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,210
the thoughts in your heart will never disappear.

304
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,040
Am I right?

305
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,840
Are you, a mortal girl,

306
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,610
instructing me?

307
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,270
I dare not.

308
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,450
I'm just talking about the perfectly happy things in the mortal world.

309
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,370
Perfectly happy things?

310
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,000
What is

311
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,850
a perfectly happy thing in this world?

312
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,080
You need to have the courage to be kind

313
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,010
and wait quietly.

314
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,960
The perfectly happy things that belong to you will come eventually.

315
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,220
It seems that Chang Xi

316
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,260
picked the right girl.

317
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,390
I've been limited by my status,

318
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,090
so I had too much love that I couldn't protect.

319
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,630
You should

320
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,950
be happier than me.

321
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,920
Kui Ji,

322
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,550
this is where we met and got to know each other.

323
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,180
Our son Chang Xi

324
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,280
has got his happiness.

325
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,910
You can rest in peace now.

326
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,280
Kui Ji,

327
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,880
you've been trapped by Chang Xi and me all your life.

328
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,940
Now,

329
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,110
go to the place

330
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,030
where you can feel the most happiness and liberty.

331
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,350
You're back so early today.

332
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,250
People all like happiness in perfection.

333
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,990
So, naturally, they love the full moon.

334
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,320
But I

335
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,360
am waiting for the dark moon every month.

336
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,640
I wonder

337
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,090
how His Lordship is doing now?

338
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,220
I fell on your boat.

339
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,290
Why didn't you even give me a hand?

340
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,510
You're a man.

341
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,740
How can you be so delicate?

342
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,900
But you...

343
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,950
Why are you here at this hour?

344
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,320
To see the moon.

345
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,760
Oh.

346
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,460
Did you make a wish to the Moon God again?

347
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,740
My Lord, why are you here?

348
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,530
I still have unfulfilled wishes in the mortal world.

349
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,030
I need your help.

350
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,480
You mean…

351
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,470
you've become a renegade immortal?

352
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,400
Hush.

353
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,160
Don't tell anyone.

354
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,980
Only you can see me.

355
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,120
I sneaked down.

356
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,030
What?

357
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,370
Are you still afraid of renegade immortals?

358
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,960
Of course not.

359
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:57,150
♫I'm willing to become a breeze in the world♫

360
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,510
♫I'll be with you in a dream♫

361
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,990
♫Maybe in this life I came to meet you♫

362
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:14,710
♫So we should sing for the world♫

363
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:20,890
♫Although the world is beautiful♫

364
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:26,610
♫I'm only moved by you♫

365
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,070
Daohuang, you sure know how to be kind.

366
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,440
How dare you extend a red thread to the mortal world

367
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,930
so that the secluded Moon Palace can be traced now?

368
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,400
Now, God Taiyin left the palace by that.

369
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,840
Do you admit your crime?

370
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,810
Heaven Emperor.

371
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:52,100
Now, there's a new renegade immortal of the moon phase,

372

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,990

374

377

378
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,800

Nothing here has changed.

Hush. Don't talk for now.

But...

389
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,310
I sneaked down from the Moon Palace,

390
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,030
so it's better not to show up

391
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,880

Tell me now.

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,500
How did you escape from the Moon Palace?

402
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,880
I should thank the renegade immortal Daohuang for that.

403
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,360
Now that the world is peaceful,

404
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,100
will you go back again?

405
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,390
