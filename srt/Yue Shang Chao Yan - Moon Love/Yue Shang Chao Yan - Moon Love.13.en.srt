[Moon Love]

3
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:53,940
[Episode 13]

4
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,810
It has been ten years,

5
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,910
and God has finally found some clues.

6
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,090
But now he has new worries.

7
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,410
It's troubling me so much

8
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,620
that I can't even take a good nap.

9
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,250
Leaning against a big tree feels the most secure.

10
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,290
Kanxu.

11
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,880
Wake up!

12
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,610
Heaven Emperor?

13
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,920
Why are you here in Imperial Censor's Mansion?

14
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,450
Look around. Where are you?

15
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
The Moon Palace?

16
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,280
Why don't I remember

17
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,210
when I returned to the Moon Palace?

18
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,850
It looks like you've not only forgotten where this is

19
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,410
but also the purpose of your descent to the mortal world.

20
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,370
I wouldn't dare.

21
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,690
But the exposure of God's identity

22
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,950
was truly an accident.

23
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000
There was nothing I could do.

24
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,990
Fine.

25
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,370
There is a task to redeem it

26
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,900
that you must accomplish.

27
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,520
This time,

28
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,370
I will devote myself fully.

29
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,850
Have Chang Xi withdraw his mortal affections

30
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,110
and sever his ties with the mortal world.

31
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,210
Remember,

32
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,700
he should come back to the palace when the moon phase is full.

33
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,060
Doesn't that mean breaking up a perfect couple?

34
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,329
A perfect couple?

35
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,590
Humans and immortals are different.

36
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,650
If they insist on going against fate,

37
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,730
they will only end up as an unhappy couple.

38
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,450
Kanxu,

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,520
I hope you understand its seriousness,

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
and stay within your limits.

41
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,240
If you fail to stop Chang Xi,

42
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,610
the Heavenly Realm won't keep you.

43
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,170
Yes. Heaven Emperor.

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,890
But...

45
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,330
Weren't you and Kui Ji...

46
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,740
Am I back?

47
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,050
Heaven Emperor actually came into my dream to guide me.

48
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,400
It's really rare.

49
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,080
Guigui!

50
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,680
Miss Zhaoyan.

51
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,630
You look like you're in a good mood today.

52
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,650
Yes.

53
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,530
Not only did His Lordship not drive me away,

54
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,090
but he also gave me a salary.

55
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,770
I finally have the money

56
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,850
to refurbish the morgue.

57
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,280
I'll buy myself a big bed

58
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,140
and never sleep in coffins again.

59
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,409
Meeting His Lordship

60
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,970
was truly a blessing for me.

61
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,490
Good fortune always comes with misfortune,

62
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,090
making it hard to distinguish between the two.

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,770
Guigui.

64
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,930
Why are you so sentimental today?

65
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,080
I should thank you

66
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,140
for always speaking well of me in front of His Lordship.

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,530
I can't do it from now on.

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,090
You can't?

69
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,930
What do you mean?

70
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,650
Nothing,

71
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,690
Miss Zhaoyan.

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,680
Anyway, if you encounter anything strange in the future,

73
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,540
just come to me.

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,920
Even if I'm scared, I'll still help you.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,490
Then I'll thank you now.

76
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,570
But...

77
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,450
it's better if there are no strange occurrences.

78
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,530
You're right.

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,500
With His Lordship here,

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,880
there won't be any strange occurrences in Qingzhou City.

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,100
Well, I'm leaving.

82
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,240
Have Chang Xi withdraw his mortal affections

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,360
and sever his ties in the mortal world.

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,060
Remember,

85
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,990
he should come back to the palace when the moon phase is full.

86
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,930
Humans and immortals are different.

87
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,990
If they insist on going against fate,

88
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,380
they will only end up as an unhappy couple.

89
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,760
As the father, he couldn't control himself in this matter,

90
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
yet he insisted on forcing his son to control himself.

91
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,720
What a pity.

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,290
What are you mumbling about out there?

93
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,770
God,

94
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,310
The moon phase in the Soul Collecting Lamp has reached half full.

95
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,700
Are you planning to return to the palace?

96
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,340
I have long ceased to have any attachment to the Moon Palace.

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,800
Going back will only invite trouble.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,320
You're no longer bothered by Kui Ji.

99
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,920
Why do you still hold onto it?

100
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,940
Or is it because you are attached to Miss Zhaoyan

101
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,570
and don't want to leave her?

102
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,480
God,

103
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,170
if that's the reason,

104
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,130
please cut off your affection as soon as possible.

105
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,690
What's wrong with you today?

106
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,920
You're acting out of character,

107
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,760
filled with so much emotion.

108
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,480
Weren't you always trying to

109
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,140
matchmake Yun Zhaoyan and me?

110
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,909
God,

111
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,520
humans and immortals are destined differently.

112
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,370
Continuing like this

113
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,380
will only repeat the tragedy

114
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,120
of Heaven Emperor and Kui Ji from years past.

115
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,770
Moreover,

116
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,570
the person who coveted your eyes

117
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,970
may still be lurking.

118
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,700
If that person notices anything unusual about Miss Zhaoyan...

119
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:48,890
God,

120
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:51,440
perhaps being a bit further from Miss Zhaoyan

121
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,730
is actually the best way to protect her.

122
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,670
Have I been expecting too much?

123
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,500
It's really fun.

124
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,840
And it's like a little ball.

125
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,890
It's really fun.

126
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,610
Sister.

127
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,750
Who are you talking to?

128
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,000
Sister?

129
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,730
It's really fun.

130
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,180
It's really fun.

131
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,600
Why is your head so hot?

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,680
Sister,

133
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,230
be a good girl and stay home.

134
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll go and get an adult for you.

135
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,130
It's really fun.

136
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,190
It's really fun.

137
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,350
Would you like to shake the rattle-drum?

138
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,270
Mother.

139
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,720
You often said that

140
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,480
the Moon God can bless

141
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,290
everyone's wishes to come true.

142
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,440
But now I understand that

143
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,510
the moon is more frequently seen in its crescent phase than in its full phase.

144
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,410
I wonder when the void in the heart of His Lordship

145
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,500
will ever be filled.

146
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,450
So,

147
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,240
the longing that Wanwan talked about

148
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,100
is that you can't help thinking about each other

149
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,160
even when you're in the same city.

150
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:09,610
Sister!

151
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,360
Sister!

152
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,370
Can you help me?

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,620
Who are you?

154
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,280
My sister is having a fever

155
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,130
and is talking nonsense.

156
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Our parents went out to work and haven't come back yet.

157
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,440
I searched for a long time,

158
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,910
and your house is the only one with the lights on.

159
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,070
Take me to see her.

160
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,400
Let's go.

161
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,350
Why is her head so hot?

162
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,560
Sister,

163
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,140
where does it hurt?

164
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,240
Tell me.

165
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,350
Let's go.

166
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,610
Let's go to the clinic.

167
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,780
Come.

168
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,380
So it's because of you.

169
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,370
Why are you bulling a little girl?

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,870
Let me tell you,

171
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,030
you had better leave quickly,

172
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,900
or

173
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,580
Imperial Censor will come to arrest you.

174
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,890
Sister,

175
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,590
who are you talking to?

176
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,990
I...

177
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,710
Nothing.

178
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,100
Let's go to the clinic.

179
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,320
Is he hiding in here?

180
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,440
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

181
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,450
My Lord,

182
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,580
what a coincidence.

183
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,970
I was just about to look for you,

184
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,970
and here you are.

185
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,750
My Lord,

186
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,370
I found this.

187
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,760
What is this?

188
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,980
There is a rattle-drum in it.

189
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,440
There's a strange little renegade immortal inside,

385
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,100
I had no choice but to let this little girl come to Imperial Censor's Mansion

390

394
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,390
Perhaps it's because children have pure hearts,

395

so

396
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,210
she can see the presence of companions around her.

397
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,380
Who is this companion?

398
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160

Nuo

was originally an immortal who descended to the mortal world.

402
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,150
After being separated from his family, he became attached to the mortal world,

403
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,630
and was demoted to a renegade immortal,

416

that little renegade immortal hiding in the rattle-drum

418
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,690
that the little sister has been falling ill

419
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,410
and almost fell into the lake.

420
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,810
It's very dangerous.

421
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,960

to me,

431
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,650

Sister!

567
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,240
Sister.

568
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:36,370
Sister.

569
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,690
Nuo.

570
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,780
Do you know

571
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,270
what death means?

572
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,790
It means the place they live

573
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,610
will move from this world

574
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,110
into our hearts.

575
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,810
They never left.

576
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,060
We just can't see them anymore.

577
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,160
You want to know if there are people living in my heart?

578
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,320
Of course there are.

579
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,530
And

580
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,860
a new one moved in recently.

581
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,889
But he hasn't died.

582
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,880
He moved into my heart,

583
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,710
yet he doesn't know it himself.

584
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,620
You mean I should tell him quickly

585
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:29,870
or it'll be too late?

586
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,790
Nuo!

587
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,409
The old man in black was right.

588
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,060
Yun Zhaoyan is here.

589
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,630
Who are you?

590
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,270
We...

591
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,320
We are the ones whose plans were disrupted by you.

592
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,900
Have you forgotten about the incident at Jia's Mansion so quickly?

593
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,110
You are accomplices of Lady Lan?

594
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,550
Yun Zhaoyan.

595
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,400
Yun Zhaoyan.

596
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,720
Has she already gone to the southern suburbs?

597
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,200
My Lord.

598
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,120
My Lord.

599
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,600
Why did you come to me?

600
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:31,600
My Lord.

601
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,130
I saw Zhaoyan hurried to the southern suburbs.

602
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,020
Did she go there on a mission

603
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,380
assigned by you?

604
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,600
Do I need to report to you about

605
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,310
the tasks I assigned to her?

606
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,800
There has been bandit activity there recently.

607
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,990
I'm worried...

608
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:55,050
[Moon God Temple]

609
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,130
Let go!

610
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,170
Let go!

611
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,180
Let go of me!

612
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,510
Go in by yourself.

613
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,140
We won't do anything.

614
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,030
What a bad luck.

615
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,470
Bad luck?

616
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,870
We're even unluckier than you.

617
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,800
Exactly.

618
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,120
We brothers

619
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,440
could have been living in leisure with the witch,

620
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,260
but now we're reduced to bandits,

621
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,070
chased and hunted everywhere.

622
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,670
If it weren't for you ruining our good fortune,

623
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,470
we wouldn't be living like this.

624
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,370
It's because of your own deceit and tricks

625
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:25,830
that...

626
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,420
You...

627
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,480
Enough.

628
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,290
Let the officials from Imperial Censor's Mansion come and redeem her.

629
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:30,890
You...

630
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,770
You...

631
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,380
You want to extort?

632
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,440
Let me tell you,

633
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,290
the Imperial Censor won't come.

634
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,820
Don't mention the Imperial Censor to me again!

635
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,680
Let me tell you,

636
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,060
stop talking.

637
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:19,850
Are you okay?

638
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,380
I thought I would never see you again.

639
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,700
I still have something to say.

640
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,530
Alright.

641
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,320
Alright.

642
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,050
It's okay.

643
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,840
Are you okay?

644
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,910
I thought I would never see you again.

645
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,180
I still have something to say.

646
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,880
Alright, it's okay.

647
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,300
My Lord.

648
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,880
My...

649
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,300
My...

650
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,380
Catch... Catch him!

651
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,220
My Lord, forgive us for our failure in patrolling against the bandits.

652
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,330
We deserve to die for this negligence.

653
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,800
You've been frightened.

654
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,920
Go back and apologize to Yun Zhaoyan.

655
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,890
Miss Yun, are you all right?

656
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,450
Take him away.

657
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,980
Take... Take him away.

658
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,710
Why don't you come out?

659
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,620
Zhaoyan.

660
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,240
Brother Xie.

661
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,500
You...

662
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,740
What's this?

663
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,080
I found this rattle-drum by the roadside

664
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,820
and I picked it up because it is pretty.

665
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,330
Brother Xie, why did you come to me?

666
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,160
Zhaoyan,

667
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,910
lately you should try to stay close to His Lordship.

668
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,960
If you notice anything unusual around you,

669
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,510
please inform me promptly.

670
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,600
Brother Xie, why did you suddenly talk about this?

671
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,280
I know you are special.

672
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,090
But sometimes,

673
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,520
that uniqueness may harm you.

674
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,100
But Brother Xie, didn't you say before that

675
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,420
my uniqueness wasn't a bad thing?

676
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,520
Anyway, be careful.

677
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,010
Actually,

678
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,520
he has been waiting

679
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,010
outside the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

680
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,320
What? You brought a renegade immortal here

681
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:12,680
without my permission?

682
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,810
He's not blind.

683
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,190
He just doesn't have very sharp eyes

684
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,360
when he's looking at you little one.

685
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,790
Are you badmouthing me?

686
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,750
No.

687
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,720
No.

688
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,810
Let this little renegade...

689
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,450
Let this little one go out first. I have something to tell you.
