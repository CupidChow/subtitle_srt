00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,020
My Lord, you really deserve your title.

10
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,720
You lit so many candles in broad daylight.

11
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,750
You said you saw me before.

12
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,200
My Lord,

13
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,410
you were in Qingzhou

14
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,000
ten years ago, right?

15
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,680
What does it have to do with you?

16
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,200
Do you know

17
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,470
ten years ago,

18
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,350
there was a fire in Qingzhou City?

19
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,080
Who on earth are you?

20
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,990
Why did you come to Qingzhou?

21
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,190
I'm from the Yun family of Qingzhou.

22
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,950
When I was seven,

23
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,260
my father died of an illness.

24
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,360
After that,

25
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,370
my mother also died of an illness.

26
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,670
I was adopted by a kind person.

27
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,750
Then a disaster accidentally happened because of me.

28
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,730
So I had to leave Qingzhou City

29
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,040
and be a handyman to support myself.

30
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,540
Later...

31
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,030
Enough!

32
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,590
I...

33
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,230
I don't want to hear these trivial matters from you.

34
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,430
Just get to the point.

35
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,230
Ten years ago,

36
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,990
I begged Moon God

37
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,030
to let me see my mother for one last time.

38
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,110
She really sent

39
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,530
an envoy to give me eyes.

40
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,670
Since then,

41
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,430
I've been able to see

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,230
what ordinary people can't see.

43
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,360
They have a mark of the moon phase.

44
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,780
But they are scary and mysterious.

45
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,370
Although they can't talk,

46
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,720
they can express their inner voice to me.

47
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,310
They pester me every day.

48
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,800
This makes me worried all day long.

49
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,540
So,

50
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,160
you hate Moon God?

51
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,100
I dare not.

52
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,670
I'm grateful that Moon God

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,930
gave me eyes so that I could see my mother.

54
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,540
But the eyes

55
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,460
have become my nightmare and worry.

56
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,190
They can't be cured.

57
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,090
So I'm thinking

58
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,270
it would be great

59
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,600
if I can return the eyes.

60
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,950
You want to have the eyes

61
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,570
when you want them.

62
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,990
You want to throw them away when you don't want them.

63
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,320
There is no such a good thing in this world.

64
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,980
You're too greedy.

65
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,300
When I met you,

66
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,180
I felt

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,010
very familiar with your eyes.

68
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,950
Are you the envoy

69
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,810
who gave me the eyes ten years ago?

70
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,870
Look me in the eye.

71
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Tell me.

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,830
Can you still remember the face

73
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,790
of the person who gave you the eyes?

74
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,390
I...

75
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,150
I suddenly

76
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,670
can't remember his face clearly.

77
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:42,960
Since

78
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,870
you can't clearly remember the face

79
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,800
of the person who gave you the eyes,

80
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,830
how can you be sure

81
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,120
I'm the person you are looking for?

82
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,700
My Lord,

83
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,870
you may not believe me.

84
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,450
As long as I'm by your side,

85
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,730
those scary things don't dare to show up.

86
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,700
In this way,

87
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,310
I don't need to be scared every day.

88
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,830
So,

89
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,520
I've made up my mind.

90
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,760
Whether you're the person I'm looking for or not,

91
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,700
I want to stay by your side.

92
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,270
Everyone in Qingzhou City

93
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,860
wants to stay away from me.

94
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,510
Only you want to stay by my side.

95
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,950
Either you're crazy

96
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,970
or you have ulterior motives.

97
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,280
My Lord, please think about it.

98
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,310
I can do many things for you.

99
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,390
I can do it

100
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,590
no matter how difficult and tiring it is.

101
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,140
You're pestering me.

102
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,790
What's the difference between you and those things pestering you?

103
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,390
You act absurdly

104
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,790
and are full of nonsense.

105
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,820
As long as I'm here,

106
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,630
you can't stay in Qingzhou City.

107
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,190
Get lost!

108
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,340
So,

109
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,250
this is what you think of me.

110
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,580
I'm sorry

111
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,550
for disturbing you.

112
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,270
Please don't mind.

113
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,060
I'm leaving.

114
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,230
Here's my advice.

115
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,950
If you want to live a worry-free life,

116
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,890
don't meddle in other people's affairs.

117
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,790
Miss,

118
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:44,630
sorry.

119
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,430
His Lordship just finished handling the day lily matter of the Lu family.

120
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,980
He's too tired

121
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,370
to care about the strange thing you said.

122
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,270
It's okay.

123
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,909
I'm used to it.

124
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,740
This girl is really pitiful.

125
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,950
Father,

126
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,980
Mother,

127
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,700
I really

128
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,660
can't cheer up today.

129
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,790
It would be great if you were with me.

130
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,130
You would accompany me

131
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,710
and tell me

132
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,310
what to do, right?

133
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,549
Kitty,

134
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,890
you're so naughty.

135
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,440
You jumped into the box.

136
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,070
Luckily, I found you.

137
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,470
Go.

138
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,540
I hope there can be

139
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,820
fewer lonely people like me in this world.

140
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,550
I should go back.

141
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,550
Why... Why are you still following me?

142
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,270

You want to see her?

Indeed, my eyes

150
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,610
can see through your inner thoughts.

151
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,430
Stop following me.

152
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,790
I can't help you.

I'll leave too.

157
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,200
Miss, sorry.

158
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,660
His Lordship just finished handling the day lily matter.

159
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,830
He is worn out.

160
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,410
If I can help His Lordship solve the problem,

161
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,680
maybe there will still be a chance.

162
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,670
Okay.

163
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,270
I'll help you.

164

[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

165
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,570
Why are you here again?

166
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,870
Miss...

167
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,280
Miss Yun, right?

168
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,660
The day lilies you mentioned today

169
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,270
are in Lu's Mansion, right?

170
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,960
Why are you asking this?

171
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,860
Well...

172
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,500
I have an old friend

173
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,310
who wants to find the family familiar with day lilies.

174
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,670
So I came to ask about it

175
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,110
to comfort my old friend.

176
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,240
But I can only tell you

177
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,230
that's indeed where Mrs. Lu lives.

178
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,070
I can't

179
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,530
tell you anything else.

180
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,840
According to the age,

181
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,390
the person Lin Nian wants to see

182
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,910
is indeed Mrs. Lu.

183
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,930
Looks like I can only ask this young man for help.

184
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,580
Please help me...

185
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,970
give this handkerchief

186
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,740
to Mrs. Lu.

187
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,200
If she has a connection with my friend,

188
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,160
she will understand what it means.

189
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,030
My friend will be waiting for her beside the Mirror Lake.

190
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,910
Right,

191
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,600
don't tell His Lordship.

He hates me so much.

193
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,190
He won't help me.

194
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,380
Why should I help you?

just call me Guigui in the future.

200
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,760
I'll take that as a yes.

202
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,110
I haven't agreed yet.

00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,400
Why won't you listen to me?

I've never disobeyed you.

223
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,310
I asked you to become an official in the court

instead of staying away from the court.

please don't come to me again.

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,550
You really like to push your luck.

why are you here?

234
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,230
What's with this handkerchief?

235
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,950
Is there also someone in the Lu family

236
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,620
who you want to stay with?

237
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,870
Of course not.

238
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,140
I only want to stay by your side.

239

It's not that I insist.

Who is the owner of this handkerchief?

His name is Lin Nian.

He's an immortal who still has attachment in the mortal world.

he found out

252
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,570
he was abandoned by his birth mother.

253

The only clue to find her

254
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,730
is the handkerchief in your hand.

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,550
Since

256
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,290
he was abandoned by his birth mother,

257
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,860
he should accept the fact that he's an abandoned man.

258
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,510
If the truth is more heartbreaking,

259
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,820
is it still necessary to know the truth?

260
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,260
But My Lord,

I used to live in that yard.

382
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,390
So this used to be your mansion.

383
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,030
Sir, don't worry about it.

384
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,960
Although this used to be my home,

385
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,530
I won't disturb you.

386
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,530
May I know your name?

387
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,620
Yun Zhaoyan.

388
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,230
Yun Zhaoyan.

389
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,210
That's a good name.

390
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,990
By the way,

391
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,830
I found a painting

392
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,400
in the courtyard of your house.

393
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,830
The people in the painting

394
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,950
should be you

395
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,690
and your family members.

396
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,630
Please wait a moment.

397
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,110
Sir,

398
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,210
you are a good person.

399
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,320
Thank you.

400
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,050
No big deal.

401
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,810
Just call me Zhaoyan from now on.

402
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,030
Then you don't need to call me Sir anymore.

403
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:12,870
Call me...

404
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,950
Brother Xie?

405
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,520
It's late.

406
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,550
Since I've returned it to you,

407
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,520
I won't bother you anymore.

408
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:30,980
Miss.

409
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,670
Zhaoyan,

410
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,070
see you.

411
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,280
See you.

412
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,310
I didn't expect

413
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,110
that I can meet such a good person.

414
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,340
You're so persistent.

415
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,340
The day lilies in front of Mrs. Lu's room

416
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,510
were planted by you after you became a renegade immortal, right?

417
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,570
You hate her very much, right?

418
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,910
You hate her for abandoning you

419
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,180
because of the birthmark on your face.

420
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,630
So,

421
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,860
you want to make her feel guilty for the rest of her life

422
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,390
through the day lilies that can't be removed.

423
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,610
Alright.

424
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,630
Well,

425
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,450
I'll help you one last time.

426
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,840
We almost let you sneak in.

427
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:48,980
You can't enter Lu's Mansion

428
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,640
just because you want to.

429
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,500
Just let me in.

430
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,140
No.

431
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,050
Zhaoyan.

432
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,140
Brother Xie.

433
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,740
Greetings, My Lord.

434
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,400
Why are you here?

435
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,260
Brother Xie, you're

436
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,070
the deputy censor?

437
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,630
I just took office.

438
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,750
What...

439
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,470
brings you here?

440
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,130
I came to look for someone.

441
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,520
It's urgent.

442
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,140
Okay.

443
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,210
Come in with me.

444
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,040
Thank you, Brother Xie.

445
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,790
Zhaoyan.

446
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,160
[Blessings continue forever]

447
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,310
It's time.

448
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,630
Why is Mrs. Lu still not here

449
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,350
at this hour?

450
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,430
She's the elder here.

451
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,640
If she doesn't come,

452
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,020
they can't start

453
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,040
the celebration and ancestor worshipping ceremony.

454
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,840
The day lilies on the handkerchief

455
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,690
mean the relief of anxiety.

456
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,290
My son,

457
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,680
please don't blame me

458
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,180
for abandoning you.

459
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,690
Mrs. Lu.

460
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,930
Who are you?

461
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,090
Why do you have this?

462
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,090
An old friend

463
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,990
asked me to give this to you.

464
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,680
Who is your old friend?

465
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,520
His name is Lin Nian.

466
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,260
On his face,

467
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,020
there is a dark cyan crescent birthmark.

468
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,120
You came to Lu's Mansion

469
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,100
on the occasion of the ancestor worshipping ceremony.

470
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,330
What are you up to?

471
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,840
I didn't mean to disturb you.

472
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,980
It's just that

473
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,990
an abandoned child

474
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,740
wants to see his mother.

475
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,120
I only have one son.

476
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,200
He is Lu Qingchi,

477
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,960
the current Number One Scholar.

478
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,820
Please don't talk nonsense here.

479
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,540
Do you really not want to see him?

480
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,910
Actually,

481
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,930
he died 20 years ago.

482
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,450
He died?

483
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,560
There was a plague in his village.

484
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,350
The birthmark on his face

485
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,390
was considered as the source of the plague.

486
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,930
So he was thrown into the water.

487
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,360
I know it's hard to accept this in a short time,

488
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,770
but I beg you

489
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,670
to fulfill Lin Nian's wish.

490
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,310
It's inconvenient in Lu's Mansion.

491
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,990
Now,

492
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,490
he's waiting for you at the place where you sent him away.

493
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,150
He wants to see you.

494
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,580
Young Master.

495
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,040
This...

496
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,510
Young Master.

497
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,510
Why is he leaving?

498
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:56,840
What happened?

499
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,400
Mrs. Lu is missing.

500
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,670
Young Master also went out to chase her.

501
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,220
Why?

502
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,230
Today, Mrs. Lu

503
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,550
had a chat

504
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,550
with a guest named Yun Zhaoyan.

505
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,030
Suddenly, she got distracted

506
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,260
and went to the lake.

507
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,560
It was Yun Zhaoyan again.

508
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,470
I'll go there to take a look.

509
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,540
You stay here.

510
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,510
I'm not lying.

511
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,620
When I mentioned your name today,

512
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,140
she really was moved.

513
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,230
In her heart,

514
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,060
she cares about you.

515
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,090
She just can't say it out now.

516
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,810
Mrs. Lu.

517
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,310
Is he...

518
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,110
here?

519
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,600
Before sons embark on a long journey,

520
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:27,330
they will plant day lilies

521
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,100
in the north hall where their mothers live,

522
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,190
hoping their mothers won't miss them so much

523
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,350
and they can relieve anxiety of their mothers.

524
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,270
So,

525
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,440
you planted

526
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,790
the day lilies that won't wither

527
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:49,920
for me,

528
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,280
right?

529
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,480
Mrs. Lu,

530
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,230
Lin Nian

531
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,390
has always been wondering something.

532
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,330
Miss,

533
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,540
go ahead.

534
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,920
He was born different from others.

535
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,430
Since he was little,

536
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,760
he had been ostracized.

537
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,470
But he didn't care.

538
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,420
He just wants to know

539
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,470
if you detest him like everyone else.

540
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,810
As a mother,

541
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,390
how could I not care about my child?

542
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,740
But at that time, this was the only way

543
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,270
to make him stay alive.

544
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,750
I had no choice.

545
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,250
Why...

546
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,490
Why is this child...

547
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,230
He was born with a scar.

548
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,500
It's really ominous.

549
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,940
My daughter,

550
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,480
the Lu family has been working in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau for generations.

551
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,200
If they see this ominous blood moon mark,

552
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,160
this child

553
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,830
can't live.

554
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,660
My daughter,

555
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,400
listen to me.

556
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,670
You should make a decision on this

557
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,060
as soon as possible.

558
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,500
Mother,

559
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,740
I want to send him away myself

560
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,400
so that I can be relieved.

561
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,580
Kid,

562
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,170
cry loudly when you're downstream.

563
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,410
Someone will pick you up and adopt you.

564
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,690
All these years,

565
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,469
I've been thinking about this child.

566
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,480
Could he have enough food to eat and be properly clothed?

567
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,580
Would he be bullied?

568
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,489
It's been more than 30 years.

569
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,860
I've never let myself

570
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,199
enjoy the happiness of a family reunion.

571
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,460
That's why I've gradually become distant from my child.

572
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,870
Now,

573
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,050
I know Lin Nian

574
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,409
doesn't resent me anymore.

575
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,580
It has reduced my guilt

576
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,230
in this life.

577
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,190
Thank you.

578
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,300
Miss Yun.

579
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,470
♫In my dream♫

580
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,310
♫I jumped and forgot myself♫

581
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:56,450
♫Hearing whispers of mountains and rivers in the mortal world♫

582
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,960
♫The sea is infinite, and I returned to this old place♫

583
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,510
Mrs. Lu.

584
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,290
♫Mayflies are most afraid of being affectionate♫

585
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,780
♫They spend the rest of their lives separately♫

586
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,490
After hearing what you said,

587
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,790
Lin Nian is satisfied.

588
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,350
He's gone.

589
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,820
♫Our fleeting encounter♫

590
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,650
♫Has disappeared amid reincarnation♫

591
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,670
♫The wind blows, reflecting everyone's loneliness♫

592
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,490
♫The ripples at dawn♫

593
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,500
♫The date of return on the other side♫

594
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:39,100
♫I'm waiting for my own answer to my own question♫

595
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,050
♫The sea of clouds drifts in this world and suddenly goes away all because of you♫

596
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:52,250
♫Since we said goodbye in spring, I haven't asked or told anyone and I was clear-minded even when I was drunk♫

597
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,270
♫I traveled a long way alone by boat, and the Milky Way in my heart is for you♫

598
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,120
God Taiyin,

00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,170
♫When I look back, I've let go and I'm neither happy nor sad♫

600
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,910
retrieve the immortal.

601
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,170
Mother,

602
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,730
I know everything.

603
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,680
I always thought you didn't like me.

604
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,350
I didn't expect that you've been punishing yourself.

605
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,310
Aren't you scared?

606
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,670
Why did you help him?

607
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,110
Indeed, I'm scared.

608
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,110
But when I think about it,

609
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,830
they are quite pitiful.

610
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,790
Go on. Are you dumb?

611
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,710
My Lord,

612
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,810
you said

613
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,290
I'm useless to you.

614
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,180
I don't think so anymore.

615
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,670
Maybe I can make up

616
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,900
for your regrets.

617
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,790
I want to stay in Qingzhou City.

618
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,010
We will meet again.

619
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,190
Will Ren Shique

620
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,210
come?

621
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,120
No.

622
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,140
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

623
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,940
It depends on this whether I can get rid of renegade immortals or not.

624
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,770
Miss Zhaoyan said

625
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,290
there is also someone who you miss

626
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,050
around you.

627
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,090
She knows you hate her,

628
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,980
so she didn't dare to tell you directly today.

629
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,800
My Lord,

630
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,550
you're finally here.

631
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,720
Yun Zhaoyan,

632
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:48,190
what did you see around me?

633
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,480
You tell me first

634
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,810
if you're the person from ten years ago.

635
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,030
Then I'll tell you what I saw.

636
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,190
Cut the crap.

637
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,570
You said you can see what's around me

638
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,700
just to trick me into coming here

639
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,500
and make me tell you that, right?

640
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,660
No.

641
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,660
I just want to make a deal

642
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,320
with you.

643
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,320
A deal?

644
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,890
Since you won't tell me,

645
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,700
don't blame me for being rude.

646
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,330
Look at me.

647
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,430
Tell me.

648
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
What on earth did you see?

649
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,900
What's going on?

650
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,770
My head suddenly hurts.

651
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,380
I can't believe I believed her so easily.

652
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,080
Yun Zhaoyan,

653
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,230
you are a downright liar.

654
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,070
My Lord, don't go.

655
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:20,710
I...

656
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,210
[Crescent]

657
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
My Lord.

658
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,710
It's the moon! My Lord!

659
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,680
The moon is out.

660
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,590
Let go...

661
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,480
My Lord,

662
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,940
I'm kind of useful, right?

663
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,530
Now,

664
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,810
can you let me

665
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,480
stay by your side?

666
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,640
[The animals in this episode didn't get hurt]

667
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,640
[They were under good protection during the filming]

668
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,840
This family really makes me envious.

669
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,210
[Drawn by Zhaoyan on the seven-year-old birthday]

670
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,110
Zhaoyan.

671
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,130
Imperial Censor,

672
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:33,200
I have something to tell you.

673
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:34,810
What?

674
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,270
Do you want to give me

675
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,670
another difficult task?

676
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,970
No.

677
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,410
You still remember the Lu family's Number One Scholar

678
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,670
went back to his hometown to worship his ancestors, right?

679
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,080
Today is the day they worship their ancestors.

680
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,290
You should

681
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,590
pay more attention.

682
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,730
The anomaly in the Lu family has disappeared.

683
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,040
Don't worry.

684
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:01,010
I just want you to make sure nothing will go wrong.

685
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:11,520
What?

686
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,600
Imperial Censor,

687
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,320
I heard a woman came to Imperial Censor's Mansion.

688
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,030
She's here to visit you.

689
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,030
You even led her into the inner hall.

690
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,160
What's the relationship

691
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,150
between you and this woman?

692
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,950
Look at you.

693
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,240
I can't ask you this?

694
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,800
Forget it.

695
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,540
I forgive you.

696
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:41,010
The Number One Scholar returning to his hometown to worship his ancestors is an important matter in Qingzhou.

697
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,280
You must remember

698
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,040
not to let those irrelevant people make trouble.

699
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,430
Well, I'll...

700
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,410
Mrs. Lu, Young Master is back.

701
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,740
You came back from Shengjing. It was a long journey.

702
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,800
Go back to your room to rest.

703
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,120
I have a chronic disease.

704
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,260
I'm worried you might get infected.

705
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:11,810
Mrs. Lu.

706
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,190
I'm not going to see you today.

707
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:12,760
You...

708
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,420
Mother, since you are sick,

709
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,400
I won't disturb you.

710
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,990
I'll visit you tomorrow.
