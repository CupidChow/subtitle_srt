[Episode 8]

00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,280
[The Moon at the First Quarter]

5
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,460
My Lord.

6
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,420
Why are you here?

7
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,990
So ugly.

8
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,690
I must be drunk.

9
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,910
My Lord, you cannot see me.

10
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,740
My Lord.

11
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,350
Now that you've sobered up,

12
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,820
you should go back early.

13
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,170
Thank you

14
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,790
for helping me sober up.

15
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,670
Just now in the yard,

16
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,870
I said something stupid.

17
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,070
I said those words

18
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,400
to make you feel better.

19
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,320
From now on,

20
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,910
don't do such stupid things again

21
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,190
to comfort me.

22
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,430
What you need to do

23
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,320
is tell me Kui Ji's replies

24
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,880
word for word.

25
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,840
I got it.

26
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,940
When you arrive at Imperial Censor's Mansion tomorrow,

27
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,870
come to me first.

28
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,140
I already have a job that suits you the best.

29
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,310
Really?

30
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,780
Is this a blessing in disguise?

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,520
I didn't expect that one day

32
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,280
I could get a job

33
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,210
because of the renegade immortal.

34
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,050
And I also didn't expect

35
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,560
that you would be my amulet.

36
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,590
Now your amulet

37
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,970
is closer to you.

38
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,260
In the future,

39
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,350
you need to make full use of your talent.

40
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,720
I will.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,630
My Lord.

42
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,470
I remember

43
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,840
the staff in Imperial Censor's Mansion

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,430
are paid to work.

45
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,390
Have I become

46
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,630
a member of the staff of Imperial Censor's Mansion?

47
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,900
Yun Zhaoyan.

48
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,540
Don't push your luck.

49
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,120
I don't charge you

50
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,730
for being your amulet.

51
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,550
If you want to be paid,

52
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,400
I'll also charge you.

53
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,980
The fees

54
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,750
will be deducted from your wages.

55
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,440
It's useless for you to feel unhappy about it.

56
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,480
After all,

57
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm the only one in the world

58
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,659
who's able

59
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,080
to protect you.

60
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,960
But

61
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,990
in the world,

62
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,190
only I can see Kui Ji.

63
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,360
I am also the only one in the world

64
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,200
who you really need.

65
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,800
Without me,

66
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,950
you'll have to spend

67
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,080
the rest of your life hiding yourself.

68
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,430
But without you,

69
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,390
I'll just feel a little regret.

70
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,550
By the way, My Lord.

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
Did you

72
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,830
see something just now?

73
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,140
I...

74
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,180
You were too drunk.

75
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,620
I didn't see anything.

76
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,800
To my surprise,

77
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,390
His Lordship

78
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,790
let me be his personal attendant so soon.

79
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,270
Whenever His Lordship comes,

80
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,909
the moon becomes brighter.

81
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,040
Now your amulet

82
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,510
is closer to you.

83
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,760
In the future,

84
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,980
you need to make full use of your talent.

85
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,909
With His Lordship,

86
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,970
I don't have to be afraid of the renegade immortals.

87
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,460
How I wish he could be with me all the time.

88
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,010
Yun Zhaoyan.

89
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,090
You need to be aware

90
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,860
that His Lordship is so nice to you

91
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,540
because he hopes that you'll find Kui Ji for him.

92
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,680
Don't think too much.

93
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,560
Come on, be clear-minded.

94
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,720
[Yun's Mansion] [Morgue]

95
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,380
Ma'am.

96
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,190
Deputy Censor Xie.

97
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,510
It's said

98
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,059
that you and Yun Zhaoyan are colleagues now.

99
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:36,940
Ma'am.

100
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,230
Is Zhaoyan

101
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,400
inside now?

102
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,309
She left early in the morning and looked very happy.

103
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,350
She also said

104
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,630
she had finally found a place

105
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,200
where she could stay without feeling worried.

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,260
Deputy Censor Xie.

107
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,330
Please

108
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,160
take good care of that girl from now on.

109
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,090
Take care of her?

110
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,920
Of course I will.

111
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,600
She looks like an emotional girl

112
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,910
but sometimes I feel sorry for her.

113
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,360
She often says

114
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,760
there are many scary things following her.

115
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,810
Scary things following her?

116
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,790
Now I'm one from Imperial Censor's Mansion.

117
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,390
How dare you still follow me?

118
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,930
[Huixin]

119
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,660
But now,

120
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,110
it's not a good time to listen to your story.

121
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,910
Stop following me.

122
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,330
Go away.

123
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,850
Zhaoyan.

124
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,520
Are you alright?

125
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Brother Xie.

126
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,070
I'm fine.

127
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,280
You...

128
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,480
Who were you talking to?

129
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,210
Why were you so flustered?

130
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,290
Brother Xie, don't worry.

131
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,850
I was absent-minded.

132
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,630
Tell me the truth.

133
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,760
Are there people threatening you?

134
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,550
Yes.

135
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,190
I knew it.

136
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,920
You always look flustered

137
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,800
and anxious.

138
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,760
When you go back to the morgue,

139
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,150
you often take a detour.

140
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,640
Is it all because you're under their threats?

141
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,570
Yes.

142
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,950
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

143
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,020
Do those people

144
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,160
have something to do with His Lordship?

145
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,110
Actually,

146
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,340
yes.

147
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,050
Brother Xie.

148
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,080
Why are you asking me about these things?

149
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,620
I went to see you this morning.

150
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,790
Ms. Long said

151
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,990
you were always followed by some weird people.

152
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,590
That's why I'm asking.

153
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,440
Zhaoyan.

154
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,870
What are you afraid of?

155
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,440
Just some

156
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,960
renegade immortals who are wandering in the mortal world.

157
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,540
They always pester me.

158
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,280
Renegade immortals?

159
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,220
What are renegade immortals?

160
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,520
They are immortals

161
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,850
who did something wrong

162
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,370
and were stripped of their spirit bones.

163
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,190
So,

164
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,500
people can't see them.

165
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,080
Then...

166
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,550
They...

167
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,890
What do they look like?

168
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,420
They...

169
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,470
Actually,

170
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,330
there is one renegade immortal

171
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,340
standing beside you now.

172
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:21,950
Zhaoyan.

173
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,530
What are you afraid of?

174
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,790
Well...

175
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,350
Some...

176
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,720
Some weirdos.

177
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,390
Did you report this to the police?

178
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,800
It's no use reporting this to the police.

179
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,090
I now work in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

180
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,870
I'm afraid

181
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,210
things are not as simple as you think.

182
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,360
However,

183
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,150
I seem to have found

184
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,700
the way to get rid of them.

185
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,190
Brother Xie, don’t worry.

186
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,810
Is your way

187
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,440
to be near His Lordship?

188
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,200
How did you know?

189
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,350
Yes, it is.

190
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,750
His Lordship

191
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,950
is very special to me.

192
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,530
Zhaoyan.

193
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,880
Actually,

194
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,870
if you need anything,

195
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,980
I can help you.

196
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
Thank you, Brother Xie.

197
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,130
As I expected,

198
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,560
there're more good people than bad people in Qingzhou City.

199
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,240
You call me Brother Xie.

200
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,010
It's my pleasure to help you.

201
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,310
You may rest assured

202
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,370
that I won't charge you for anything.

203
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,570
I know you won't.

204
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,130
Let's go.

205
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,450
Sir.

206
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,350
It's said

207
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,870
this thing can turn one's grey hairs into black hairs, right?

208
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,640
Yes.

209
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,360
But

210
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,800
you don't have grey hairs.

211
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,830
Yes, I do.

212
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:53,890
Look.

213
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,400
Look.

214
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,040
Here.

215
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,710
Where?

216
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,420
Here.

217
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,840
Take a closer look.

218
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,470
Where are your grey hairs?

219
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,350
Here.

220
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,230
Well.

221
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,760
I have to report this to His Lordship.

222
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,830
Yun Zhaoyan and Xie Guichen were walking together?

223
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,490
What does it have to do with me?

224
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,300
But you care about it so much that you don't even want to drink tea.

225
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,990
My Lord.

226
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,880
What is the thing you're wearing on your head?

227
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,620
It's too fancy.

228
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,660
It's a hairpin.

229
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,470
My Lord.

230
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,080
Didn't you lose your sight?

231
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,160
I can feel everything in the world.

232
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,890
Why are you here?

233
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,440
I'm on duty.

234
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,400
You asked me

235
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,350
to be your personal attendant last night.

236
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,430
I should be beside you at any time.

237
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,960
So you do remember what your job is in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

238
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,310
To do what you asked me to do

239
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,180
is my top priority.

240
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,920
My Lord.

241
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
Please tell me what I can do now

242
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,530
as your personal attendant?

243
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,870
I now think

244
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,310
you're not suitable

245
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,820
to be my personal attendant.

246
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,870
I've found you a better position.

247
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,670
A better position?

248
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,520
Where will I be working then?

249
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,980
In the Qingbin Warehouse.

250
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,530
Qingbing Warehouse?

251
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,030
It sounds like

252
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,870
a clean and cool place.

253
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,940
Guigui.

254
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,190
Take her there.

255
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,920
Yes.

256
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,960
[Qingbin Warehouse]

257
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,870
[Restricted Area]

258
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,640
This...

259
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,120
Isn't this place an ordinary warehouse?

260
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,470
This used to be an armory of Imperial Censor's Mansion.

261
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,110
Weapons of different dynasties are stored here.

262
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,630
Then all wars ended and the country has been at peace.

263
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,870
The weapons have been stored here

264
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,800
and not used for many years.

265
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,510
And they haven't been cleaned for long years.

266
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,590
So this place

267
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,520
looks a bit messy.

268
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,200
Well.

269
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,750
What is the job His Lordship assigned me to?

270
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,240
His Lordship just said

271
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,150
he appointed you custodian of Qingbin Warehouse in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

272
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,240
Custodian?

273
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,790
It sounds like a menial job.

274
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,119
The daily duties of a custodian

275
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,940
include arranging these weapons

276
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,510
and guarding them.

277
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,839
Got it.

278
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:12,839
We'll leave this to you from now on.

279
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,600
Is she there now?

280
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,040
Miss Zhaoyan seemed a little disappointed.

281
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,300
Actually, I also think

282
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,960
it's a bit inappropriate

283
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,750
to let a girl do that work.

284
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,720
Really?

285
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,830
But I think

286
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,230
she'll be doing well in Qingbin Warehouse.

287
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,240
Working there is better than being sent to the exterior hall.

288
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,830
Lord Xie's place?

289
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,100
Princess.

290
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,260
[Invitation]

291
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,430
This is an invitation letter for the Dragon Boat Lantern Festival.

292
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,960
All the dignitaries in the city will go there.

293
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,400
The lantern festival will be a wonderful occasion.

294
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Besides,

295
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,530
not everyone can go.

296
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,370
You escorted me home the other day.

297
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,530
I said I would return the favor.

298
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,200
So this is my way

299
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,330
to return the favor.

300
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,400
Thank you, Princess.

301
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,880
Princess.

302
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,700
When will the Dragon Boat Lantern Festival

303
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,590
be held?

304
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,920
It starts at 7 p.m. the day after tomorrow.

305
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,960
But we can meet earlier

306
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,360
and go try the desserts at Rongxing Bakery.

307
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,150
Got it.

308
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,520
That's it?

309
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,910
Shouldn't we talk about

310
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,070
where to meet?

311
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,310
We?

312
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,810
Why should we meet?

313
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,460
As I said,

314
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,130
I gave you the gift to return the favor.

315
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,730
It means I want you to go to the festival with me.

316
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,630
Only in this way can I show my sincerity.

317
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,150
You mean

318
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,450
if I don't go with you,

319
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,600
you will

320
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,430
take back this invitation.

321
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,040
Not really.

322
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,200
But

323
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,180
the lantern festival is such an important event.

324
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,400
I'm the only one

325
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,530
who is good enough to go with you there.

326
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,920
You don't have to go with me.

327
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,520
I feel your sincerity in the invitation.

328
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,650
It's enough.

329
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,870
Thank you for your invitation.

330
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,610
I'm on an errand.

331
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,930
See you.

332
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,250
[Qingzhou City]

333
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,210
Miss Zhaoyan.

334
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,070
His Lordship is going on night patrol.

335
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,190
Why are you following him all the time?

336
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,000
I...

337
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,580
I just want to stay with His Lordship a little longer.

338
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,980
Then no renegade immortals will come to me.

339
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,790
Help!

340
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,970
Help!

341
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:01,960
Help!

342
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,580
Miss.

343
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
What's wrong?

344
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,410
It seems...

345
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,900
It seems something

346
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,160
is following me.

347
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,780
There's nothing.

348
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,620
My Lord.

349
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,110
What?

350
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,480
There's an renegade immortal.

351
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,610
Renegade immortal?

352
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,420
What's wrong?

353
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,740
Greetings, My Lord.

354
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,260
I heard some noise here.

355
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,290
What happened?

356
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,120
She

357
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,580
fell down just now.

358
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,440
When I was doing stocktaking at Xiaoxiang Pavilion,

359
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,440
I found an extra Buyao on the ground.

360
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,050
I picked it up

361
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,890
and then weird things started to happen one by one.

362
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,540
On my way home,

363
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,440
I felt

364
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,130
someone had been stalking me.

365
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,080
Deputy Censor Xie.

366
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,520
Take this lady to the clinic first.

368
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,480
You stay here for now.

369
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,040
I'll go forward and have a look.

370
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,150
My Lord.

371
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,190
What about me?

372
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm scared.

373
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,540
I'm with you. What are you scared of?

374
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,250
Come with me.

375
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,910
Thank you, My Lord.

It's not safe on the streets tonight.

378

Be careful.

379
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,430

382
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,800
Make sure the lady

383
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,160
is safe and sound tonight.

384
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
So that no more trouble will happen.

385
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,970
Why do you call Xie so many times every day?

386
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,890
Let's go right now.

387
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,270
He said he would let me go with him.

388
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,610
Why did he leave me and go investigate the case alone?

389
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,830
I...

390
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,000
I...

391
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,360
I'm warning you.

392
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,640
I'm now

393
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,790
working for Imperial Censor's Mansion.

394
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,620
Devils, go away.

395
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,880
Misfortunes, go away.

396
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,510
Renegade immortals,

397
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,510
stay away from me now.

398
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,900
Stay away from me.

399
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,660
It's a Buyao.

400
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,160
It looks dear and exquisite.

401
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,550
♫It's hard to distinguish what's good and what's evil, and it's hard to love or hate someone♫

Just now,

415
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,360
I was acting improperly.

416
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,570
Then you shouldn't have done that.

417
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,860
I didn't mean to.

418
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,350
When I was walking just now,

419
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,720
I picked up a Buyao.

420
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,100
Then a renegade immortal kept chasing me.

421
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,000
Just now,

422
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,880
I thought I was going to be killed.

423
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,560
When I saw you,

424
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,230
I couldn't help but...

425
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,920
Alright.

426
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,710
You're fine now.

427
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,670
Then...

428
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,080
My Lord,

429
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,880
Can you help me

430
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,280
solve the Buyao problem?

431
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,760
Fine.

432
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,440
What do you want me to do?

433
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,740
[Goodness of Nature]

434
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,630
[Qi's Mansion]

435
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,340
The character "Qi" is inscribed on the Buyao.

436
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,030
[Qi]

437
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,820
There is only one Qi family in Qingzhou City.

438
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,920
The wife of the master of the Qi family

439
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,700
also passed away over ten years ago.

440
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,030
This is the right place.

441
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:22,960
The Qi family

442
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,520
runs pawnshops in the city.

443
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,060
The Qi family is very rich.

444
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,950
Let's go and ask.

445
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,660
Maybe we just need to

446
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,310
return the Buyao and the problem will be solved.

447
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,150
Yun Zhaoyan.

448
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,430
You always said

449
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,920
you were scared of the renegade immortals

450
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,630
but you always interfered

451
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,390
in their business.

452
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,190
I really don't understand this.

453
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,560
I'm afraid

454
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,910
the renegade immortals

455
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,960
will pester other people of Qingzhou City apart from me.

456
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,620
Others in the city will definitely be more scared of them than am I.

457
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:53,990
Alright.

458
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,010
Before you go in,

459
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,760
remember to

460
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,360
get yourself well-dressed.

461
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,750
After all,

462
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,510
you now work for Imperial Censor's Mansion.

463
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,710
Well-dressed?

464
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,340
I...

465
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,070
My Lord.

466
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,720
You can see me?

467
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,270
You're always impulsive

468
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,710
and you always look messy.

469
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,200
I guess

470
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,720
you look messy now.

471
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:27,370
[Mourn]

472
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,860
[Mr. Qi]

473
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,350
What can I do

474
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,420
for you?

475
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,070
This is the imperial censor.

476
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,750
I'm sure you know about him.

477
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,450
Greetings, My Lord.

478
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,770
[Mourn]

479
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,760
You always

480
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,990
put the memorial tablets

481
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,280
in the main hall?

482
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,440
My wife and I

483
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,040
were deeply in love.

484
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,780
After my wife passed away,

485
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,220
I swore

486
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,300
that I would never marry anyone else.

487
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,310
And I put her memorial tablet

488
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,390
in the main hall.

489
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,360
[Memorial Tablet of My Beloved Wife Qi Huixin]

490
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,430
My wife

491
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,030
was born in February.

492
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,590
And she died on February 29.

493
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,150
Instead of paying tribute to her every four years,

494
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,420
I put her memorial tablet to let her spirit be here forever.

495
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,740
[Mourn]

496
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
So I can often think of her.

497
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,560
Mr. Qi,

498
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,690
My condolences.

499
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,840
We're here

500
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,160
to ask

501
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,920
if this belonged to your late wife.

502
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,710
Well...

503
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,320
Why does Mr. Qi

504
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,320
have a woman’s handkerchief on him?

505
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:48,820
Oh, yes.

506
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,680
It belonged to my late wife.

507
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,820
Yun Zhaoyan.

508
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,450
What are you doing?

509
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,480
Looks like Mr. Qi

510
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,320
is not familiar with this.

511
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,160
Bye.

512
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:21,390
[Mourn]

513
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,560
She's so weird.

514
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,390
Honey.

515
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,480
Why are you so late? What took you so long?

516
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,520
Two people from Imperial Censor's Mansion came

517
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,490
and asked about that woman.

518
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,810
Her again?

519
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
She's been dead for many years.

520
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,270
[Rou]

521
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,120
Thanks to her,

522
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,810
I have gained a good reputation for being a good widower.

523
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,540
If I didn't have that reputation,

524
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,810
our pawn business in Qingzhou City

525
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,430
wouldn't be doing so well.

526
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,010
You business is indeed doing well.

527
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,650
But you still can't let me be your lawfully wedded wife.

528
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,510
I'm just your lover.

529
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,150
All these years,

530
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,960
you've had a hard time.

531
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,910
How are you going to make up to me?

532
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,170
How do you want me to make up to you?

533
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,250
Do you remember

534
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,200
the Buyao your late wife used to wear when she was alive?

535
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,070
That was a dowry of hers.

536
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,790
When I was her maid,

537
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,370
I heard that the Tian-tsui on that Buyao was rare and exquisite.

538
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,270
I saw it the other day.

539
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,840
I put it on and went outside.

540
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,790
But

541
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,980
I lost it accidentally.

542
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,780
Will you blame me?

543
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,470
Did this belong to your late wife?

544
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:56,960
You mean

545
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,760
you lost that Tian-tsui Buyao.

546
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,750
Yes.

547
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,390
This is tricky.

548
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,440
What?

549
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,910
You said you would make up to me just now.

550
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,260
I just lost the Buyao. Why do you think it's a big deal?

551
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,410
Honey.

552
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,720
Honey.

553
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,920
So,

554
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,710
what are you going to do with the Buyao?

555
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,260
I thought

556
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,640
I should return the Buyao to the owner's husband

557
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,200
so the Buyao would remind him of his late wife.

558
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,530
Then she'll get over it.

559
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,350
I didn't expect

560
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,130
that her husband didn't seem to miss her.

561
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,380
These are all your guesses.

562
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,590
Anyway,

563
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,850
I won't mess around with you anymore.

564
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,470
After today's trip,

565
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,030
I now think Mr. Qi is really strange.

566
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,360
He made everyone believe

567
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,440
he loves his late wife very much.

568
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,350
However,

569
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,550
he hid a bright-colored handkerchief on him.

570
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,230
That handkerchief

571
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,590
must belong to a woman.

572
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,180
You mean...

573
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,590
My Lord.

574
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,400
Let's go there again.

575
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,740
Didn't you hear what I said?

576
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,710
But My Lord.

577
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,590
I think

578
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,820
We should go there again.

579
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,520
My Lord.

580
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,760
The expression on your face now

581
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,220
is even scarier than a renegade immortal's.

582
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,310
My Lord.

583
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,360
You can see my face?

584
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,950
My Lord.

585
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
You've regained your sight, right?

586
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
You've really regained your sight?

587
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,040
My Lord.

588
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,970
You can really see me,

589
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:24,890
right?

590
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,500
Yes.

591
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,740
And you look ugly.

592
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,990
Great.

593
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,400
My Lord.

594
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,000
You've regained your sight.

595
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,320
So,

596
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:43,970
My Lord,

597
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,130
you've been fooling me for a long time.

598
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,490
Yes.

599
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,070
I've been fooling you.

600
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,490
What can you do about it?

601
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,420
I feel guilty

602
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,960
so I've always wanted to help you find Kui Ji.

603
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,600
You should

604
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,740
help me find Kui Ji as soon as possible.

605
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,840
How can you just take my help for granted.

606
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,000
I thought

607
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,750
immortals don't lie.

608
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,680
You fooled me for so long.

609
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:13,250
You need to make it up to me.

610
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,710
So you should go to Qi's Mansion with me again.

611
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,320
You want to get yourself into trouble again?

612
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,480
My Lord.

613
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,790
You're so capricious

614
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,060
and good at lying.

615
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,490
You're like a renegade immortal.

616
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,870
I still need to walk a long distance

617
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,880
before I can arrive at the morgue.

618
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
If some renegade immortal

619
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,960
comes to me,

620
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,740
I'll be terrified.

621
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,300
Don't come to me.

622
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:03,920
Don't come to me.

623
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,310
Are you feeling cold?

624
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,360
Brother Xie.

625
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,889
Why are you back on your own?

626
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,540
Luckily, I was fast enough

627
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,670
to catch up with you.

628
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,909
So,

629
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,090
you came to find me?

630
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,040
I

631
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,520
heard something bad had happened to you.

632
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,350
I was worried that it was not safe for you to go home alone.

633
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,110
So...

634
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,659
So I came to see you.

635
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,699
How are you?

636
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,270
Are you okay?

637
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:36,270
I'm fine.

638
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,840
Just some scratches.

639
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,210
I'm used to having them.

640
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,230
By the way,

641
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,780
has Pingting recovered from her injury?

642
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,310
She's much better now.

643
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,050
But

644
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,230
are you sure you're okay?

645
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,139
I'm fine.

646
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,110
What's wrong?

647
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,840
Nothing.

648
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,480
I saw nothing.

649
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,480
Zhaoyan.

650
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,040
Do you

651
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,440
like watching lanterns?

652
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,550
Yes.

653
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,730
But I rarely go to festivals or celebrations.

654
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,310
Well,

655
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,950
do you want to go to the lantern festival?

656
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,640
With you?

657
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,500
Yes.

658
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,260
But I may not be able to stay long.

659
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,990
I'm afraid I'll scream suddenly

660
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,120
or

661
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,870
run away.

662
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,360
Sound like you're going to the execution ground.

663
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,520
Don't worry.

664
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:45,750
I'll be with you.

665
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,820
You won't have to be afraid of anything.

666
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,350
Let's go.

667
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,280
[Qingzhou City]

668
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,990
You

669
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,310
know her?

670
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,020
She's Mr. Qi's...

671
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,400
Fine.

672
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,380
I'll follow her for you.

673
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,780
[Xiaoxiang Pavilion]

674
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,110
Did you

675
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,950
find a Tian-tsui Buyao

676
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,630
which looks expensive?

677
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,710
Buyao?

678
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,490
Let me help you look for it.

679
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,750
It's just a Buyao.

680
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,570
That handkerchief

681
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,630
seems to be the one I saw on Mr. Qi.

682
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
We didn't find

683
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,310
the Tian-tsui Buyao you talked about.

684
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,260
It's a rare thing.

685
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,440
It's something we can see only once in a century.

686
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,260
If you lost it,

687
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,710
that would be such a pity.

688
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,030
Fine.

689
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,180
I'll go to another shop and look for it.

690
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,230
Maybe I lost it somewhere else.

691
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,380
Bye, Miss Rou.

692
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,400
Could it be that

693
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,640
she was killed by her husband?

694
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,550
Walk properly.

695
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,510
My Lord,

696
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,760
I still think

697
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,850
Brother Xie and others are in danger.

698
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,600
Instead of worrying about others,

699
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,560
you should worry about yourself.

700
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,120
I know.

701
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
But

702
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,440
ordinary people don't know there're renegade immortals around.

703
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,100
They will be scared by them.

704
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,110
So,

705
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,450
you didn't tell Xie Guichen

706
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,960
about your psychic power?

707
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,940
I

708
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:19,320
didn't dare to tell him about it.

709
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,820
You should tell him about it

710
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,580
and see

711
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,160
if he will still protect you

712
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,000
the way he's protecting you now.

713
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,060
So,

714
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,390
only you're able to protect me now.

715
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,350
You've realized this. Good for you.

716
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,530
[Qi's Mansion]

717
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,590
Since you have found the owner of the Buyao,

718
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,850
why didn't you return it to him directly?

719
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,620
Renegade immortals are scary.

720
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,970
I didn't expect

721
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,920
the evil thoughts of some people can be scarier.

722
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,800
What?

723
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,840
You think

724
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,070
Mr. Qi is suspicious?

725
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,870
That long-haired renegade immortal

726
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,040
values this so much.

727
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,760
This must be her precious thing when she was alive.

728
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,800
Mr. Qi said

729
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,490
he loved his late wife so much.

730
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,990
If so, he should have recognized this at the first sight of it.

731
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,040
You're argument

732
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
is fallacious.

733
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,010
My argument is based on human nature.

734
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,050
You have no idea how much

735
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,520
that long-haired renegade immortal values this.

736
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,980
Her face looked like this.

737
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,400
But she was still following me.

738
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,350
Alright.

739
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:31,770
Stop impersonating her.

740
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,120
Oh.

741
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,240
You can't see me.

742
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,780
She's always like this.

743
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,480
She keeps pestering me.

744
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,320
Just like this.

745
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,760
Alright.

746
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,520
I believe you.

747
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,630
It's good that you believe me.

748
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,830
Now

749
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,650
you're with me.

750
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,280
I feel safe.

751
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,940
Judging from your behaviors in the Qi Mansion just now,

752
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,770
you didn't look afraid.

753
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,870
My Lord.

754
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,490
You can definitely see me,

755
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,650
right?

756
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,780
Yes.

757
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,130
And you look ugly.

758
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,040
Great.

759
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,300
My Lord, you've regained your sight.
