[Episode 17]

4
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,140
Go now.

5
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,340
Report to me as soon as possible if there is any information.

6
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,020
-Yes.
-Yes.

7
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,800
Go.

8
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,620
Xie Guichen.

9
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,139
I've made up my mind.

10
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,120
What?

11
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,980
Just be with me from now on.

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,400
I...

13
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,110
don't know what you mean.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,370
We both know our feelings for each other,

15
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,730
but we're hesitant about being together. I don't like it.

16
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,860
If so,

17
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,329
we will miss each other in the end.

18
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,930
So,

19
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,260
Xie Guichen,

20
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,380
give yourself to me!

21
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,550
Stop hesitating.

22
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,660
Did I scare you just now?

23
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,960
Princess,

24
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,610
please allow me to think about it.

25
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,820
I...

26
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,780
really have too many burdens.

27
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,890
I can't easily...

28
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:58,530
All right.

29
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,760
I never listen to others refusing me.

30
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,630
I was too hasty today.

31
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,020
But,

32
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,410
I won't let you go easily.

33
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,120
Sorry.

34
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,470
On this occasion,

35
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,600
I should be the one

36
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,030
to leave first.

37
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,170
Bi Luo,

38
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,040
you must have been mistaken.

39
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,130
The man just now is only in his twenties.

40
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,260
He can't be the one you're looking for.

41
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,720
What did you

42
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,710
give me just now?

43
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,130
I heard

44
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,280
Yun Zhaoyan will take you to Shengjing

45
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
to look for the man who betrayed you.

46
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,870
Why would I stop you?

47
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,940
I just think

48
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,520
you're pathetic because you need someone else

49
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,409
to express your thoughts for you.

50
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,250
Bi Luo,

51
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,870
if you have a real body,

52
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,270
you can settle the score yourself.

53
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,040
Isn't that great?

54
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,540
Yun Zhaoyan,

55
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,210
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,310
There are some things

57
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,520
that I have to handle myself.

[Goulan House]

59
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,990
Could it be Zhaoyan is in danger?

60
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,760
You are...

61
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,570
Bi Luo?

62
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,550
I didn't expect us to meet like this.

63
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,200
Honey,

64
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,780
I've been waiting for you.

65
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,620
I really am...

66
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,539
too ashamed to face you.

67
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't want to see you.

68
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,750
But the half-moon mark on my hand

69
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,500
is so painful.

70
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,630
With obsessiveness,

71
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,050
I came to Shengjing from Qingzhou

72
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,880
just to put an end to the resentment in my heart.

73
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,450
Bi Luo,

74
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,220
it was my fault.

75
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,140
I was afraid of death back then.

76
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,340
After I was saved,

77
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,220
I didn't have the courage

78
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,960
to die with you anymore.

79
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,660
Although I survived,

80
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,090
my life has been a living hell.

81
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,370
Since you're in so much pain,

82
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,740
come and accompany me.

83
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,060
Bi Luo,

84
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,730
forgive me.

85
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,590
I owe you in this life.

86
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,730
I'm willing to do anything to make it up to you in the next life.

87
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,480
Bi Luo,

88
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,740
I'm begging you.

89
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,150
Don't kill me.

90
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,270
Bi Luo,

91
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,050
please let me go.

92
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,870
I'm begging you.

93
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,430
I'm begging you, Bi Luo.

94
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,930
I didn't expect

95
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,170
that my obsessiveness

96
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,330
has turned out to be a joke.

97
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,620
Bi Luo,

98
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm begging you.

Please don't kill me, Bi Luo.

Bi Luo.

101
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
Do you regret it?

102
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,520
No.

103
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,640
I'll marry you

104
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,800
in the next life.

105
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,990
What if I can't find you?

106
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,910
I'm from Qingzhou.

107
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,740
If you can't find me,

108
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,730
go to Qingzhou to look for me.

109
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,440
From now on,

110
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,540
we will be together forever.

111
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,070
Remember the marks on our palms.

112
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,130
We can recognize each other

113
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,050
through them in the future.

114
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,670
You've seen his true colors.

115
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,690
What's the point

116
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,800
of going after him now?

117
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,840
Bi Luo,

118
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,850
get out of Yun Zhaoyan's body now.

119
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,150
Stop acting recklessly.

120
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,610
I spent many years in the Soul Collecting Lamp.

121
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,870
I've never seen

122
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,450
cold-hearted God Taiyin

123
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,970
so nervous.

124
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,670
Looks like

125
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,980
although you lost your eyes,

126
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,940
you are still

127
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,380
observant.

128
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,110
Bi Luo,

129
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
we've known each other for decades.

130
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,870
I understand

131
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,340
why you're doing this.

132
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,520
I was wrong.

133
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,930
I entrusted my life to a wrong person.

134
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,210
You've seen

135
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,030
what Liu Zong is like now.

136
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,600
He has been tortured by the past

137
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,120
for nearly a lifetime.

138
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,390
You should let go of your obsessiveness.

139
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,220
What I want

140
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,140
is just

141
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,660
eternal love.

142
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,830
Why can't he give it to me?

143
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,510
Let bygones

144
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,930
be bygones.

145
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,060
Let the person in your heart

146
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,170
die completely.

147
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,420
Bi Luo,

148
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,310
stop torturing yourself.

149
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,960
He wants to stay alive, but I want love.

150
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,490
There is not a solution to our problem.

151
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,970
Now that we have gone our separate ways,

152
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,700
we should follow our own paths.

153
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,170
The rarest thing in this world

154
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,590
is true love.

155
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,480
I can't have it

156
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,200
in this life.

157
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,080
Fine.

158
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,590
But

159
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,720
I really didn't expect

160
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,550
that cold-hearted God Taiyin

161
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,460
would take risks for someone.

162
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
Look at you now.

163
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,130
You've become more like

164
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,500
Yun Zhaoyan, that ordinary mortal.

165
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,060
What a pity.

166
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,680
Yun Zhaoyan is too cowardly.

167
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,230
She doesn't know

168
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,870
she has gained something very precious.

169
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,710
How about...

170
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,890
letting me make them understand?

171
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,330
Bi Luo!

172
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,300
What are you going to do?

173
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,250
I'm warning you.

174
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,390
If you dare to hurt her,

175
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,440
I will make you suffer a hundredfold in return.

176
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,960
In this world, love is unpredictable.

177
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,040
Today, I'd like to see

178
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,120
what you are willing to do

179
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,430
for Yun Zhaoyan.

180
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,180
There is another reason why Yun Zhaoyan left Qingzhou.

181
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,790
Don't you want to know?

182
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,550
Come down first!

183
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,150
Could it be that...

184
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,250
you've fallen in love?

185
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,000
Do you like

186
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,040
Yun Zhaoyan or not?

187
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,710
If you do, I'll come down.

188
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
If you don't,

189
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,900
I will jump into the lake with her body

190
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,320
to end your attachment in the mortal world.

191
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,490
Don't move.

192
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,310
This is not your body.

193
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,080

00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,800
Just go back.

380
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,000
I wonder if His Lordship will come out

381
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,590
to patrol in the middle of the night.

382
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,510
My Lord?

383
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,810
Who asked you to come back?

384
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,470
Don't you know it's very dangerous in Qingzhou City now?

385
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,380
How did you know I came back?

386
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,990
I... thought it was a renegade immortal.

387
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,500
I wish I were a renegade immortal.

388
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,670
So I wouldn't be so worried.

389
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,990
Yes.

390
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,020
It would be great if you were a renegade immortal.

391
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,060
Then it wouldn't be necessary to pester you

392
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,450
and you would stay by my side naturally.

393
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,220
I can't do that.

394
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,550
You're right.

395
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,610
You're Moon God from the heaven.

396
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,180
Of course you can't see me.

397
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,950
From now on,

398
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,410
I won't let you see me again.

399
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,070
Yun Zhaoyan,

400
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,530
I'm going to explain it to you today.

401
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,180
You have been pestered by renegade immortals

402
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,650
because of the eyes

403
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,650
I gave you.

404
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,170
To make it up to you,

405
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,780
I will find

406
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,710
a safe and quiet place for you,

407
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,430
so that you can live a peaceful life

408
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,230
like an ordinary woman.

409
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,860
But you have to leave Qingzhou City.

410
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,430
Stay as far away

411
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,470
from this place and me

412
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,670
as possible.

413
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,590
Even if you don't say this,

414
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:13,100
I will leave Qingzhou City.

415
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,730
I came back this time

416
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,000
because I have to help someone here.

417
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,830
He is also the reason why I met you.

418
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,130
There is something I have to do

419
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,670
and someone I want to protect...

420
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,580
here.

421
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,810
From now on,

422
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,220
let me protect you.

423
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,230
After all,

424
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,820
I have your unique eyes.

425
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm doing this

426
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,220
to fulfill your wish:

427
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,980
to find a quiet place

428
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,650
to live a peaceful life.

429
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,240
My Lord, why are you saying this?

430
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,340
What are you afraid of?

431
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,240
I don't need to explain so much to you.

432
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,750
It's just that...

433
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,780
you make me feel very uneasy now.

434
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,730
My Lord, you don't need to feel uneasy because of me.

435
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,110
I will find the peace you mentioned

436
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,370
on my own in the future.

437
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,930
If Imperial Censor's Mansion needs me in the future,

438
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,120
I will come back

439
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,480
to find the renegade immortals

440
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,120
and make them leave.

441
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,130
It's late.

442
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,469
Let me walk you back.

443
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,389
My Lord,

444
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,179
I can go back myself.

445
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:35,820
[Invitation]

446
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:24,480
[Invitation]

447
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,000
[Invitation]

448
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,510
You still came back.

449
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,240
I hope

450
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,200
you can complete your unfinished task here.

451
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,040
[Invitation]

452
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,220
♫In my dream♫

453
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,130
♫I jumped and forgot myself♫

454
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,100
♫Hearing whispers of mountains and rivers in the mortal world♫

455
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,130
You snuck into Imperial Censor's Mansion for nothing.

456
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,910
♫The sea is infinite, and I returned to this old place♫

457
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,260
You didn't even take the hairpin with you.

458
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,170
♫Mayflies are most afraid of being affectionate♫

459
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,490
♫They spend the rest of their lives separately♫

460
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,480
♫Our fleeting encounter♫

461
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,310
♫Has disappeared amid reincarnation♫

462
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,900
♫The wind blows, reflecting everyone's loneliness♫

463
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,030
[Invitation]

464
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,600
♫The ripples at dawn♫

465
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,700
♫The date of return on the other side♫

466
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,630
♫I'm waiting for my own answer to my own question♫

467
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,090
Princess,

468
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,960
do we have to do it this way?

469
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,970
You know nothing.

470
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:11,570
Since Ren Shique came to Qingzhou,

471
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,720
my brother has paid much attention to appearing

472
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,660
on public occasions like wedding and worshipping ceremonies.

473
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,490
It's more difficult to get this invitation from him

474
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,990
than making him angry with Ren Shique.

475
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,800
So,

476
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,530
we have to use a special way.

477
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,350
Princess, why is it so dark here?

478
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,860
It's fine.

479
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,380
My brother always puts things

480
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,900
in a few specific places.

481
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,450
Yun Zhaoyan.

482
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,770
Hurry up.

483
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,950
Yun Zhaoyan,

484
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,570
who is that old friend you mentioned?

485
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,880
You're doing everything you can to help him. Is it worth it?

486
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,420
Now,

487
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,680
he doesn't have a name.

488
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,140
You can't see him either.

489
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,930
But he has always been around you.

490
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,850
Why are your words still so weird?

491
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,670
Don't be afraid.

492
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,090
I'm not afraid.

493
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,870
Then why did you move?

494
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,680
Let's go.

495
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,750
Let's go.

496
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,530
Isn't that Miss Zhaoyan?

497
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,940
Why did she come back?

498
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,050
No, I need to go back and tell His Lordship now.
