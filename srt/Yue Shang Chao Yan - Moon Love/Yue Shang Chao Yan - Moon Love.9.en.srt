[Episode 9]

4
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,230
She really lives here.

5
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,110
What are you doing here?

6
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm here to deliver something

7
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,260
for Miss Rou who went in just now.

8
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,610
She has too many things,

9
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,579
so she asked me to deliver it here.

10
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,270
Give it to me.

11
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,820
No.

12
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,510
This is very valuable.

13
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,270
I have to deliver it myself.

14
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,700
Also...

15
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,500
Also, that girl has a bad temper.

16
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,610
If anything goes wrong with this thing,

17
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,270
you won't be able to give an explanation, right?

18
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,600
Let her in.

19
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,370
If we help her deliver it,

20
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,720
we'll be blamed if something goes wrong.

21
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,000
She is not a person to be trifled with.

22
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,030
Yes.

23
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,740
Go in then.

24
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,260
Thank you.

25
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,430
Where did you go?

26
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,880
We just lost the Buyao.

27
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,500
Can't you just lay low?

28
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,820
I went

29
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,200
to look for the Buyao.

30
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,360
After all, it's so valuable.

31
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:34,940
Do you want

32
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,160
to use the same things as hers that much?

33
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,700
Why can't I have

34
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,510
what she had?

35
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,350
I also want

36
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,260
what she didn't have.

37
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,070
Do you have the guts to wear something of a dead person?

38
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,040
Speaking of Huixin,

39
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,600
you remind me of something.

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,120
If I find out

41
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,870
you dare to order someone

42
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,060
to harm me with that kind of slow poison,

43
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,060
I'll tell everyone

44
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,540
that you killed your wife.

45
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,530
Honey,

46
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,360
do you really have the heart to do that?

47
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,709
I put

48
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,579
the poison myself.

49
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,960
You should be careful.

50
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,120
Who's outside?

51
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,470
Your name

52
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
is Huixin, right?

53
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,300
Seeing them like this,

54
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,470
you must be very sad.

55

[Ten years ago]

56
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,620
Young Madam,

57
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:42,860
Young Master is back.

58
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,330
Honey!

59
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:46,490
Honey.

60
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,240
Honey,

61
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,210
don't leave me.

62
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,860
Honey.

63
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,670
Honey.

64
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,930
Honey.

65
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,190
Honey.

66
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,860
Don't leave me.

67
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,880
Honey.

68
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,440
She is dead.

69
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,409
I believe

70
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,610
someone

71
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,659
can seek justice for you.

72
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,860
My Lord, are you able

73
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,320
to see things clearly now?

74
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,900
The moon phase has become normal,

75
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,980
and the Soul Collecting Lamp is getting complete.

76
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,710
Of course I can see things.

77
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,470
Miss Zhaoyan really has helped a lot.

78
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,650
Right, My Lord,

79
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,660
how does it feel

80
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,460
to see things in the world again?

81
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,500
Is there anything in this world

82
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,110
worth my attention?

83
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,710
Miss Zhaoyan.

84
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,190
What did you say?

85
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,370
I mean

86
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,320
I haven't seen Miss Zhaoyan today.

87
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,810
I wonder what she is doing.

88
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,940
Did she go to Qi's Mansion again?

89
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,990
Miss Zhaoyan is

90
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,580
as persistent as you.

91
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,140
If you are worried,

92
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,470
you can go take a look.

93
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,659
I...

94
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,110
I'm busy.

95
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,710
Stop!

96
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,470
Stop!

97
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,130
Stop running!

98
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,409
Stop!

99
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,210
Stop!

100
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,470
-Stop!
-Don't come near me.

101
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,090
You eavesdropper.

102
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,460
You think I didn't see you?

103
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,020
Guards,

104
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,920
don't let her leave here alive.

105
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,590
My Lord.

106
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,520
My Lord.

107
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,710
The servants didn't recognize you.

108
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,710
They almost hurt you accidentally.

109
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,140
She's a member of Imperial Censor's Mansion.

110
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,190
I ordered her to investigate the case here today.

111
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,520
You should apologize

112
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,590
to her.

113
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,520
Please forgive me.

114
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,810
I thought you were a thief.

115
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:34,360
But this lady came uninvited

116
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,510
and broke into my mansion.

117
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,290
I don't think

118
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,080
it's reasonable.

119
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,770
Yun Zhaoyan,

120
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,620
don't be timid.

121
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,530
Just say what you want to say.

122
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,460
Mr. Qi, do you still remember

123
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
how Madam Huixin died of an illness?

124
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,190
My wife was busy

125
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,820
and very sentimental.

126
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,810
In the end,

127
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,190
she died of depression.

128
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,910
In that case,

129
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,360
tell me

130
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,670
what symptoms she had before she died.

131
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,110
Why are you

132
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,410
asking me this?

133
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,280
Just now, I heard in the yard

134
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,340
that Mrs. Qi

135
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,600
was murdered by you.

136
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,910
Nonsense!

137
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,560
My wife and I were very close.

138
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,380
Everyone knows it.

139
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,410
Since everyone knows it,

140
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,460
why couldn't you

141
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,580
recognize her favorite Buyao

142
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,110
when we came here last time?

143
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,460
I...

144
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,720
My wife was from a rich family.

145
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,460
She had many dowries.

146
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,790
Besides,

147
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,620
it's been more than ten years since she died.

148
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,740
It's reasonable

149
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,600
that I forgot the Buyao, right?

150
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,110
Nonsense!

151
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,830
She was murdered by you.

152
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,640
You had an affair with Rou, a maid in your mansion, long ago.

153
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,810
Madam Huixin chose to put up with it.

154
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,010
But she didn't expect

155
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,980
that you still

156
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,230
wanted to kill her.

157
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,410
I wish

158
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,930
she could look at me forever,

159
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,420
so that I, living alone in this world,

160
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,200
would no longer feel lonely.

161
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,680
[Huixin Hall]

162
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,530
But Miss,

163
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,430
you're using a dead person to make trouble.

164
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,340
This will make the dead unable to rest in peace

165
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,080
and the living feel sorrowful.

166
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,470
My Lord,

167
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,350
how could you let your subordinate

168
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,670
be so rude?

169
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,880
Miss,

170
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,740
if you keep talking nonsense,

171
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,360
I'll have nothing to say.

172
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,060
Since I've lost my wife forever,

173
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,450
please pity me

174
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,500
and give the Buyao back to me,

175
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,340
so that I can

176
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,750
keep it as a souvenir.

177
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,060
Yun Zhaoyan,

178
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,150
with me by your side,

179
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,030
you don't need to be afraid.

180
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,460
But everything

181
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,630
should be supported by evidence.

182
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,980
Do you have evidence

183
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,820
to prove what you just said?

184
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,750
Madam Huixin was obsessed with the Buyao

185
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,190
because

186
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,720
the Buyao is the evidence.

187
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,860
Yes.

188
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,230
The Buyao

189
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,060
is what you used to poison her back then.

190
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,320
You...

191
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,000
Madam Huixin didn't die of an illness.

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,330
She was murdered by you.

193
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,010
The poison takes effect slowly.

194
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,420
So it disappears slowly.

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,270
The dragon boats...

388
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,630
are gone.

389
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,470
It's all my fault.

390
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,350
Good things would never happen to me.

391
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,230
I even made you

392
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,820
miss the lantern fair.

393
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,060
It's okay.

394
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,710
I'm already very happy

395
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,740
that you came.

396
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,910
But I heard

397
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,470
the lantern fair is rare.

398
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,350
I don't like

399
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,350
crowded places anyway.

400
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,620
Great.

401
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,830
I don't like crowded places either.

402
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,630
Well,

403
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,870
where can we go now?

404
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,630
This time,

405
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,510
just follow me.

406
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,460
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

407
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,900
My Lord,

408
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,310
these are the files to be put in the archive.

409
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,270
Have you read them?

410
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,450
[Excerpts of doubtful cases]

411
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,720
[Excerpts of doubtful cases]

412
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,790
Yun Zhaoyan has read them to me.

413
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,830
My Lord,

414
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:07,980
you can

415
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,180
see things now, right?

416
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,940
The government files are complicated.

417
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,060
She was free.

418
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,570
What's wrong with reading them for me?

419
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,350
Do you know Miss Zhaoyan

420
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,680
has an appointment with Lord Xie tonight?

421
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,240
What does that have to do with me?

422
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,730
I risked my life to save her

423
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,070
and helped her solve Mr. Qi's case.

424
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,560
I can't believe she still has the mood to keep the appointment.

425
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,740
Guigui,

426
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,640
go get me the calming pills.

427
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,100
I'm having a headache

428
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,430
because of Yun Zhaoyan.

429
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,010
My Lord,

430
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,860
looks like Miss Zhaoyan

431
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,700
makes you very uncomfortable.

432
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,450
Can you get better just by taking a calming pill?

433
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,190
Since Huixin has come back,

434
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,280
the moon must be very beautiful tonight.

435
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,190
Miss Zhaoyan and Brother Xie

436
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,390
will definitely

437
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,640
enjoy themselves

438
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,960
very much.

439
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,610
Don't worry.

440
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,130
She can't stay quietly in one place

441
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,650
for an entire night.

442
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,020
Soon,

443
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,150
the whole street

444
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,060
will be a mess because of her.

445
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,390
But

446
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,250
the city guards just delivered a message.

447
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,120
They said the Dragon Boat Lantern Festival tonight

448
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,170
took place in an orderly way.

449
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,310
Nothing went wrong.

450
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,410
Looks like Miss Zhaoyan's appointment

451
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,010
with Brother Xie

452
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,490
went smoothly.

453
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,340
But Miss Zhaoyan

454
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,390
is too ungrateful.

455
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,800
She only wants to have fun.

456
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,820
She doesn't even know

457
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,420
you're here taking calming pills to stay calm.

458
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,220
My Lord,

459
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,400
have a good rest.

460
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,860
I'll take my leave.

461
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,310
Why do I feel so uneasy?

462
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,700
No.

463
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm feeling uneasy here,

464
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,850
but Yun Zhaoyan is having fun outside.

465
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,100
This is unfair.

466
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,840
I really don't know where to go.

467
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,320
So I brought you here.

468
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,470
This is the first place I got familiar with

469
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,080
after I came to Qingzhou.

470
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,200
The Mirror Lake.

471
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,040
I've been here before.

472
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,650
And there was an accident.

473
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:36,880
Accident?

474
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,590
What accident?

475
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,980
Anyway,

476
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,870
let's go somewhere else, okay?

477
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,200
Okay.

478
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,240
We can go sit in the pavilion ahead.

479
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,960
That's great.

480
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,360
I'm more relaxed when I'm with Brother Xie.

481
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,780
When I was with His Lordship recently,

482
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,490
I always had a strange feeling in my heart.

483
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,370
What's wrong, Zhaoyan?

484
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,180
Why don't we

485
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,670
go this way?

486
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,680
But

487
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,700
if we want to go to the pavilion,

488
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,330
we have to go this way.

489
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,190
I think the scenery on that bridge

490
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,360
is very beautiful too.

491
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,690
Also, if we stand there,

492
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:32,830
maybe we can see

493
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,760
the fireworks of the lantern fair.

494
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:37,950
Okay.

495
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,270
Zhaoyan.

496
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,780
What's wrong?

497
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,760
I...

498
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,900
Are you tired?

499
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,260
Why are you

500
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,620
doing this?

501
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,590
Why is Yun Zhaoyan

502
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,670
still so weird?

503
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,930
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,690
I was too rash.

505
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,180
S...

506
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,740
Sorry, Brother Xie.

507
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,180
I...

508
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,300
I just...

509
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,360
feel a little hot.

510
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,510
Cold rice cakes.

511
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,980
Delicious cold rice cakes.

512
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,030
Well,

513
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,970
I'm going to buy something

514
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,100
to help you get cool.

515
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,780
I heard someone is selling cold rice cakes over there.

516
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,980
Brother Xie, please

517
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,300
buy some for me.

518
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,520
Wait for me.

519
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:48,950
Go.

520
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,890
Buy all the cold rice cakes for me.

521
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,870
Yes.

522
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,340
Stop pestering me.

523
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,960
I can't help you.

524
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,400
Sir.

525
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,860
Is there any cold rice cake left?

526
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,500
No.

527
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,420
A girl bought them all.

528
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,290
All the cold rice cakes have been sold out?

529
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,170
Do you know

530
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,620
where else I can buy some?

531
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,440
That place is far away from here.

532
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,080
It doesn't matter.

533
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,100
Just tell me.

534
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,820
Turn left at the third alley ahead.

535
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,750
Thank you.

536
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,660
Princess.

537
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,620
I bought them all.

538
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,430
So many?

539
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,010
Let's see what he can do.

540
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,490
Zhaoyan.

541
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,470
Why were you hiding there?

542
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,350
Thank you,

543
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,260
Brother Xie.

544
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,320
I just came to the riverside

545
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:16,930
to cool off.

546
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,340
Try it.

547
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,270
Where did he buy it?

548
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,540
[Yun's Mansion]

549
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
I'm home.

550
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,190
Brother Xie, thank you for walking me home.

551
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,700
Although we didn't see the lantern fair today,

552
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,020
I still had a lot of fun.

553
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,660
I should thank you.

554
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,210
I haven't been so happy

555
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,620
for a long time.

556
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,960
Right,

557
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,340
are those scary villains you mentioned

558
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,600
still following you?

559
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,530
Since I entered Imperial Censor's Mansion

560
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,980
to stay by His Lordship's side,

561
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,440
everything has been fine.

562
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,310
You can also tell me

563
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,260
if you're in trouble in the future.

564
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,350
Well,

565
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,290
I'm going in.

566
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,030
Lord Xie

567
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,350
is looking at Yun Zhaoyan

568
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,710
so affectionately.

569
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,840
[Meet me in the forest now]

570
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,100
Who is Xie Guichen in contact with?

571
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,570
So mysterious.

572
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,510
Princess,

573
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,870
it's scary here.

574
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,520
Let's go back now.

575
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,060
Master.

576
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,020
You went to enjoy lanterns with Yun Zhaoyan tonight.

577
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,780
Did you find anything new?

578
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,300
Master,

579
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,670
during the days I spent with Yun Zhaoyan,

580
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,290
I tested her countless times.

581
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,260
I didn't find anything special.

582
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,020
I think

583
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,810
she came to Qingzhou

584
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,639
just to find a place to live.

585
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:34,650
It doesn't have much to do

586
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,010
with Ren Shique.

587
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:38,100
Really?

588
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,130
This is a little different

589
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,750
from what you said last time.

590
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,929
I...

591
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,090
Guichen,

592
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,020
are you being disturbed

593
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,270
by some emotions

594
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,080
which you shouldn't be feeling?

595
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,120
I will keep my mind clear.

596
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,270
Don't forget your mission.

597
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,440
What you're doing

598
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,100
is for upholding justice.

599
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,840
I...

600
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,100
will remember what you said.

601
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,620
Princess.

602
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,890
Why are you here at this hour?

603
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,690
Are you scared?

604
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,190
Did you do something wrong

605
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,550
that you dare not let others know?

606
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,700
Deputy Censor Xie,

607
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,830
you

608
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,480
ran so fast just now.

609
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:52,680
Even I couldn't catch up with you.

610
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,800
You've been following me.

611
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,930
I'm the princess of Qingzhou.

612
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,000
Of course I should find out

613
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,950
what happened in Qingzhou.

614
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,200
It's just the two of us here.

615
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,980
Confess now.

616
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,580
Princess, what do you know?

617
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,020
What

618
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,850
do you want to know?

619
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,150
Then tell me first

620
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,970
who you went to see.

621
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,860
I just went to see a senior.

622
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,800
He asked me to investigate some private matters.

623
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,440
Since they are private matters,

624
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,000
there's no need for you to know.

625
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,300
Private matters?

626
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,240
That means personal grudges then.

627
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,630
You're the deputy censor of Imperial Censor's Mansion.

628
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,400
The person you're investigating

629
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,060
should be someone around you.

630
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,520
Wait.

631
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,190
Is Yun Zhaoyan the person who you're investigating?

632
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,940
So...

633
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,950
last time, you said

634
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,780
you would take the one you love to the lantern fair.

635
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,890
It's not because you like her.

636
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,150
It's because you're investigating her.

637
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,560
If this is the case,

638
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,470
what are you going to do?

639
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,700
If this is the case,

640
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,210
of course I won't stop you.

641
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,600
Just investigate her.

642
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,240
I've always hated Yun Zhaoyan.

643
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,800
She has loved

644
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,900
to cause me trouble since childhood.

645
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,580
She disappeared for ten years.

646
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,230
After she returned to Qingzhou,

647
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,360
she ruined my plan to enter the palace.

648
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,490
Then the mirror incident

649
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,340
made me a fool in front of everyone on the street.

650
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,400
So,

651
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,400
if you find anything out,

652
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,890
remember to help me teach her a lesson.

653
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,090
Consider it

654
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,660
helping me vent my anger.

655
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,660
Princess,

656
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,810
you'll keep the secret for me, right?

657
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,780
Then you should always remember that

658
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,590
we

659
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,020
can be counted as allies.

660
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,850
You can say that.

661
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,620
I'm going back to rest.

662
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,590
You just

663
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,210
focus on the investigation.

664
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,640
Although the princess is arrogant and wilful,

665
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,680
luckily,

666
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,390
she is straightforward.

667
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,550
I don't think the renegade immortal

668
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,020
will follow me here.

669
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,070
You said renegade immortals are scary.

670
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,340
But I think...

671
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
you are scarier.

672
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,880
If he is with me,

673
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,800
he'll always be pestered by renegade immortals.

674
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,980
It's indeed scary.

675
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,270
It's been an hour since I came back, right?

676
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,340
My Lord, what can I do for you?

677
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,260
Nothing.

678
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,380
You two,

679
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,470
go to Qi's Mansion

680
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,860
to see

681
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,660
if there's anything wrong there

682
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,890
or...

683
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,500
if there is anyone

684
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,890
who shouldn't be there.

685
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,940
If there is, come back to report to me immediately.

686
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,110
-Yes, My Lord.
-Yes, My Lord.

687
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,750
How long will it take

688
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,480
to walk to the morgue from here?

689
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,270
A-About 15 minutes.

690
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,110
Yes.

691
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,630
Brother Xie,

692
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,420
I'm home.

693
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,110
Zhaoyan,

694
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,460
I'm thinking if I can

695
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,870
ask you something.

696
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,340
Brother Xie, go ahead.

697
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,030
Imperial Censor's Mansion never accepts women.

698
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,560
How did you manage to get in?

699
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,340
Maybe because

700
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,100
I'm a man.

701
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,140
I'm just kidding.

702
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,520
Actually, I don't know either.

703
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,500
Maybe because

704
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,070
I'm gifted.

705
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,950
Then...

706
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,420
why do you

707
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,780
have to enter Imperial Censor's Mansion?

708
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,430
I...

709
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,460
Because of His Lordship?

710
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,150
You and he...

711
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,400
are old friends?

712
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,820
We just met recently.

713
00:41:54,750 --> 00:42:00,500
[Yun's Mansion]

714
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,980
Also,

715
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,730
letting me enter Imperial Censor's Mansion

716
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:58,860
was not easy for him.

717
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,710
Then...

718
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,220
Then do you...

719
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,140
Am I asking too many questions?

720
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,270
I just

721
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,150
want to stay by His Lordship's side.

722
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,550
I have no other purposes.

723
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,220
I see.

724
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,780
Sorry for being rude.

725
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,580
Well,

726
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,940
let's meet in Zuiyin Tavern

727
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,430
before 7 p.m. tomorrow.

728
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,830
If I knew someone would walk you home,

729
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,440
I wouldn't have come.
