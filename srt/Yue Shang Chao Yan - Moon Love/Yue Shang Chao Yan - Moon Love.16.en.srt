It's late at night.

5
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,610
Why are you in the morgue?

6
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,250
[Bi Luo]

7
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,490
Are you homeless?

8
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,650
If so,

9
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,410
how about

10
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,440
you stay here tonight?

11
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,340
She is so strange.

12
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,610
Why would she spend the night in the morgue?

13
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,880
But it's so late.

14
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,170
I can let her stay her tonight.

15
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,370
Miss.

16
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,810
Aren't you going to bed?

17
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,740
Okay.

18
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,170
I'm going to bed.

19
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,050
Make yourself at home.

20
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,730
Miss.

21
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,190
It's early in the morning.

22
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,550
Why are you staring at me?

23
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,740
[Zong Nan and Bi Luo are lawfully wedded today.]

24
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,370
So your name is

25
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,360

26
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,280
[Zong Nan and Bi Luo are lawfully wedded today.]

27
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,840
Liu Zong is your husband.

28
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,930
You want me to help you find him?

29
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,570
I often help people.

30
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,250
Let me go to

31
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,890
Imperial Censor's Mansion and find some documents to see where Liu Zhi may be today.

32
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,890
But Imperial Censor

33
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,450
doesn't want strangers to enter his mansion.

34
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:24,930
Just wait for me here.

35
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,120
It's late.

36
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,650
I'm going to work in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

37
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,730
You stay here.

38
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,570
Slow down.

39
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,130
You are a renegade immortal!

40
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,810
I've never seen

41
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,810
a renegade immortal who is so beautiful and lifelike.

42
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,580
You're not as scary as other renegade immortals.

Marriage counseling.

44
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,410
I can tell you information about the fate of your marriage.

45
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,670
I can tell you information about the fate of your marriage.

46
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,290
What would you like to know, Miss?

47
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,130
I want to know the whereabouts

48
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,250
of a friend from 20 years ago.

49
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,850
I'd also like to know whether we'll meet again.

50
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,450
Miss, please pick a stick.

51
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,130
Sir, what does it say?

52
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,330
The bright moon is in the clear sky.

53
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,520
You'll meet again at a banquet.

54
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,970
The person you're looking for

55
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:30,890
can be found

56
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,690
in the area within a hundred mile radius.

57
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,680
He'll show up at a banquet.

58
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,159
The way to find him is hidden in the bright moon in the blue sky.

59
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,180
I think I've understood it

60
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,050
but I'm not sure.

[Yihong Brothel]

62
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,480
Isn't he Mr. Drunkard?

63
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,210
Why is he drunk again?

64
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,150
You don't know

65
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,890
that once the Plum Blossom Song is played on the stage,

66
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,230
he'll get too much.

67
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,120
My father told me

68
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,890
[Liu Zong]

69
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,049
this stanza of Song of Lady Jade

70
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,049
was written by this lunatic

71
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,650
for his ex-girlfriend.

72
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,690
Later,

73
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,770
his ex-girlfriend took poison and committed suicide.

74
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,210
Since then, he's developed a habit to come to brothels every day.

75
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,530
He couldn't get over his ex.

76
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,250
Oftentimes,

77
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,010
he gets so drunk

78
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,370
that he doesn't remember what his last name is.

79
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,700
So everyone calls him Mr. Drunkard.

80
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,390
Your father told you the story?

81
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,050
Looks like

82
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,410
you've inherited your father's habit

83
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,030
to go to a brothel often

84
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,670
and listen to songs there.

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,310
Nonsense.

86
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,320
What are you doing?

87
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,440
Is that you?

88
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,230
I missed you so much.

89
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,640
But I dare not look for you.

90
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,040
Why are you holding me?

91
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,730
I'm not a woman.

92
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,030
Why is he crazy again?

93
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,650
Just think of him as a joke.

94
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,520
Stop watching.

95
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,960
Guards!

96
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,450
Get him out of here.

97
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,000
Hurry up. Get him out of here.

98
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,770
Go.

99
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,810
Get him out of here.

100
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,450
Take him away.

101
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,650
Wait for me on the way to the underworld.

102
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,030
I'm coming soon.

103
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,420
If he had known he would be so sad, he shouldn't have been that happy.

104
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,050
Please go on drinking. Enjoy yourselves.

105
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,080
He is so drunk.

106
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,960
Come on, Bai.

107
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,090
Let's go on drinking

108
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,260
and enjoy the music.

Stop following me.

111
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,890
I'm going to Imperial Censor's Mansion.

112
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,580
Imperial Censor is there.

113
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,590
I'm sure you don't want to see him.

114
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,210
You shouldn't believe everything the divination stick says.

115
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,300
After all, he's your husband.

116
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,210
You have to believe

117
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,410
that you'll find him.

118
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,810
All right.

119
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,490
I'll help you.

120
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,730
Stop following me.

121
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,270
Miss Zhaoyan is running so fast.

122
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,730
Did she meet a renegade immortal again?

123
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,490
My Lord, don't worry.

124
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,090
The renegade immortals will stay away from you

125
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,820
if they know you're nearby.

126
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,330
Miss Zhaoyan will be fine.

127
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,790
Looks like

128
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,090
she doesn't

129
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,950
need my protection that much now.

130
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,730
My Lord.

131
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,370
Miss Zhaoyan

132
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,650
doesn't need your protection anymore.

133
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,890
This is good news

134
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,850
for you and her.

135
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,370
The moon phase is going to be complete.

136
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,090
You should prepare to leave

137
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,530
so that Miss Zhaoyan won't have any expectations.

138
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,410
Otherwise,

139
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,610
she'll be very disappointed in the end.

140
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,930
Kanxu.

141
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,690
You're really weird.

142
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:28,970
In the past,

143
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,730
you always

144
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,690
tried to make me and her stay together.

145
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,120
But why

146
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,930
are you telling me to stay away from her now?

147
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,050
This...

148
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,980
I've served you for hundreds of years.

149
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,090
I know your situation

150
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,890
and your experiences very well.

151
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,330
I used to be naive.

152
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,010
Now,

153
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,470
I need to think about what is the best for you.

154
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,610
In your opinion,

155
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,850
how can I

156
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,800
have not much to do

157
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,010
with the mortal world

158
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,610
and at the same time

159
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,870
make Yun Zhaoyan feel safe in the future?

160
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,860
How about you

161
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,700
give Miss Zhaoyan something that can protect her before you leave?

162
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,960
Then tell me

163
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,770
on the moon,

164
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,500
what is the most magical thing?

165
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,110
It's my branch of the laurel tree.

166
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,520
The tree has been absorbing the energy of the moon for lots of years.

167
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,240
Any evil spirit

168
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,390
will stay away from it once they see it.

169
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,410
My Lord.

170
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,490
Are you trying to let me...

171
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,520
No way.

172
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,850
You can make her feel safe.

173
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,730
But don't hurt me.

174
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,370
My Lord.

175
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,250
Let go of me!

176
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,780
What are you doing, My Lord?

177
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,630
My Lord.

178
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,880
Are you really going to give this hair stick to Miss Zhaoyan?

179
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,110
I didn't say that.

180
00:12:59,330 --> 00:12:59,870
I...

181
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,650
My Lord...

182
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,890
My Lord, are you resting?

183
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,890
Come on in.

184
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,980
My Lord, excuse me for disturbing you.

185
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,370
I want you

186
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,930
to do me a small favor.

187
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,490
But don't tell Guigui about it.

188
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,010
He said you were resting

189
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,770
and he didn't want me to disturb you.

190
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,080
Guigui told her about it?

191
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,650
I...

192
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,650
It's not because I'm worried about you.

193
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,250
And I haven't decided whether to give it to you.

194
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,130
Give it to me?

195
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,660
Give me what?

196
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,730
Something...

197
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,490
Something like a talisman.

198
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,730
A talisman?

199
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,220
I don't understand

200
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,050
what you're saying.

201
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,750
Looks like

202
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Guigui hasn't told her about it yet.

203
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,400
What brings you here?

204
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,500
Are you pestered by a renegade immortal again?

205
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,290
You're amazing.

206
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,650
Your guess is right.

207
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,050
But this time,

208
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,250
the renegade immortal is so beautiful.

209
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,580
She's not as fierce as the renegade immortals I used to meet.

210
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,530
In the world, if all people

211
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,210
judge whether a person is good or bad by their appearances,

212
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,140
then I wouldn't let you be beside me

213
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,730
when I first saw you.

214
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,410
My Lord, how could you say that?

215
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,040
After all,

216
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,310
I have eyes given by you.

217
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,610
I don't think

218
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm that ugly.

219
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,410
Well,

220
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,210
can you draw a painting for me?

221
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,090
You want me to draw the renegade immortal for you?

222
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,000
No, I want you to draw a human.

223
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,620
The renegade immortal's name is Bi Luo.

224
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,740
She's looking for her husband.

225
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,130
So I want to

226
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,490
take a painting of him with me and go to Yihong Brothel to ask about him.

227
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,550
Maybe someone there knows about him.

228
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,290
Yihong Brothel?

229
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,290
You...

230
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,570
If you go there,

231
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,010
you'll get into trouble.

232
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,810
Let me go with you.

233
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,810
No.

234
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,450
If you go with me,

235
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,330
Bi Luo won't go with me.

236
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,810
I can go there alone.

237
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,620
Yun Zhaoyan.

238
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,830
Are you refusing to let me go with you?

239
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,100
I...

240
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,770
I have my reasons that I cannot tell you.

241
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,790
I will never cause any trouble for Imperial Censor's Mansion.

242
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,330
My Lord.

243
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,010
Her husband's name

244
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,250
is Liu Zong.

245
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,080
His eyes are like stars.

246
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,340
His eyebrows are like willow leaves.

247
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,970
My Lord.

248
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,320
You're trying too hard.

249
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,810
You should be drawing like this.

250
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,330
Look.

251
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,410
Because you're beside me,

252
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,040
I made mistakes.

253
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,660
Keep a distance from me.

254
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,210
I thought

255
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,250
the mighty Moon God

256
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,330
had excellent drawing skills.

257
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,210
Are you

258
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,770
looking down on gods?

259
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,610
Then draw it yourself.

260
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,210
No, you go on drawing.

261
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,570
Miss Yun.

262
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,090
Yihong Brothel is so big.

263
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,740
So many men have come and gone over the years.

264
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,890
With only this painting,

265
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,050
I don't know who you're looking for.

266
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,950
Ms. Lian.

267
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,750
Please take a closer look.

268
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,770
Well,

269
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,930
this painting

270
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,570
shows what Liu Zong looked like 20 years ago.

271
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,650
He should be a middle-aged man now.

272
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,570
Think harder.

273
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,770
Miss Yun, why didn't you tell me this earlier?

274
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,090
How would I know

275
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,620
what happened 20 years ago?

276
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,570
I'm still quite young.

277
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,370
Take it away. Be good.

278
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,990
I'm going to serve the customers later.

279
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,570
Well...

280
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,880
Think hard about it.

281
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,170
Back then,

282
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,370
was there a top beauty named Bi Luo here?

283
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,520
Bi Luo?

284
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,530
Did it ring a bell?

285
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,440
There seemed to be a beautiful love story about her back then.

286
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,250
It's said 20 years ago,

287
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,160
there was a top beauty who was very famous in Shengjing.

288
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,330
Her name was Bi Luo.

289
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,930
I don't know anything else.

290
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,210
I'm busy right now.

291
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,130
How about this? You go to the door and ask the guy who writes storybooks.

292
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,450
He used to live Shengjing and he knows a lot about what happened there.

293
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,570
He remembers all the anecdotes there.

294
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,040
I'm going to serve the customers later.

295
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,170
Be good.

296
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,210
I'll ask him. Thank you.

297
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,530
Excuse me.

298
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,810
Sir,

299
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,770
do you have storybooks

300
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,450
about what happened in Goulan House in Shengjing?

301
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,410
What?

302
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,610
Goulan House.

303
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,110
A story of pity?

304
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,170
My storybooks are all about pities.

305
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:43,570
Really?

306
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,810
Do you know

307
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,010
a girl

308
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,250
named Bi Luo from 20 years ago?

309
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,420
Bi Luo?

310
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,670
Yes.

311
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,180
Here.

312
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,370
Her story and the information of people involved are in this storybook.

313
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,790
Bi Luo used to be the top beauty in Goulan House.

314
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,770
She was excellent at playing the Guqin.

315
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,330
That made her more attractive.

316
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,730
One day, Bi Luo was playing the Guqin

317
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,650
when a handsome man came.

318
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,730
Their music was in harmony.

319
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,530
The music of the Guqin and the flute was melodious.

320
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,890
As time went by, the love between them grew stronger and stronger.

321
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,350
In the end, they told each other their feelings for each other.

322
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,930
Then petals fell from the sky.

323
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,500
They hugged each other

324
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,930
and decided to spend the rest of their lives together.

325
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,330
However, the happy ending didn't last long.

326
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,730
When Liu Zong's family found out about their relationship,

327
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,610
they forced them to break up.

328
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,010
They had no choice

329
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,600
but to commit suicide by drinking poison,

330
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,050
hoping to die together.

331
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,430
How did you know these stories?

332
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,030
An old friend of mine told me the stories.

333
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,440
Who is the old friend?

334
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,000
He told me the story.

335
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,220
And he was in the story.

336
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,320
The person who told him the story

337
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,420
was also a man in the story.

338
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,370
Could it be that Liu Zong

339
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,340
didn't die back then?

340
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,130
Sir.

341
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,850
Please give this letter

342
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,370
to the old friend of Bi Luo

343
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,610
and tell him

344
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,290
that I'll meet him at the Broken Bridge beside Yihong Brothel tonight.

345
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,630
That person has gone to Shengjing.

346
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,690
Don't come to

347
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,900
disturb me again in the future.

348
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,250
Shengjing?

349
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,700
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

350
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,240
Bi Luo.

351
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,370
I now know

352
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,970
where the person you're looking for is.

353
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,210
But

354
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,650
he has gone to Shengjing.

355
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,250
Is it because you promised to see him there?

356
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,280
Shengjing...

357
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,290
I can't go with you to Shengjing.

358
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,090
Bi Luo.

359
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,960
I really can't go with you.

360
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,610
Because

361
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,900
the person I want to protect

362
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,230
is in Qingzhou.

363
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,960
My Lord.

364
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,290
Deputy Censor Xie, anything to report?

365
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:13,210
My Lord.

366
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,450
Can Zhaoyan

367
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,490
see things

368
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,990
that others can't see?

369
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,850
Why are you asking this?

370
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,690
I just want to know

371
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,230
whether that's why

372
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,690
you keep her by your side.

373
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,770
Does

374
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,080
the mastermind want to know about this?

375
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,360
Since Zhaoyan

376
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,240
is so special to you,

377
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:51,210
then please treat her well

378
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,050
and try your best to protect her.

379
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,610
What do you mean?

380
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,480
It's all because of me.

381
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,320
Zhaoyan may be in danger.

382
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,080
So please protect her, My Lord.

383
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,410
My Lord.

384
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,650
You haven't

385
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,600
given her the laurel hair stick?

386
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,860
I still don't know how to give it to her.

387
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:36,770
Kanxu.

388
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,450
I think

389
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,850
I can't stop worrying about her.

390
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,700
Xie Guichen came to me just now.

391
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,740
He asked me to protect Yun Zhaoyan.

392
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,940
I wanted to refuse.

393
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,130
But no matter what,

394
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,050
I was unable to say to him

395
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,170
that I wouldn't protect her.

396
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,890
From the bottom of my heart,

397
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,860
I want to protect Yun Zhaoyan.

398
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,970
Kanxu.

399
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,810
I'm afraid

400
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,490
to me

401
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,690
she's no longer

402
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,960
just a bait.

403
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,670
I don't know when

404
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,730
I started to think

405
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,150
it's not bad to stay in the mortal world.

406
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,730
The mortal world is different from Guanghan Palace.

407
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,190
There's hustle and bustle

408
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,430
and love and friendship in the mortal world.

409
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,160
She's also in the mortal world.

410
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,810
In the past,

411
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,990
she tried so hard to be close to me.

412
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:51,160
Now,

413
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,140
I want to take a step towards her

414
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,930
even if the consequences

415
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,870
are disastrous.

416
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,120
If

417
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:18,370
♫It's hard to distinguish what's good and what's evil, and it's hard to love or hate someone♫

418
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,570
you can make all the withered flowers

419
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,720
in the garden

420
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,980
bloom at the same time,

421
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,490
I'll allow you

422
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,210
to take shelter beside me occasionally.

423
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,640
♫We meet and part, coming to nothing♫

424
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:31,540
♫Regardless of the chaos and fate♫

425
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,970
My Lord, the flowers are blooming.

426
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,090
♫I only love you with deep affection♫

427
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,100
You must be familiar with Yun Zhaoyan.

428
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,430
♫I'm a lonely person and tears trickle down my face♫

429
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,920
I'll put the laurel hair stick here.

430
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,940
Don't let others see it.

431
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,590
♫I dare not face so much sorrow♫

432
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,810
As to whether Yun Zhaoyan will see it,

433
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:56,070
♫Puzzled, I'm too sad to play the guqin under the moon♫

434
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,510
it will depend on our fate.

435
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,710
♫I want to hear you talk about romantic things♫

436
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,960
♫In the cold moonlight, I'm willing to go to you♫

437
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,300
♫In the dim worldly affairs, my heart warms for one person♫

438
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,010
Kui Ji.

439
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,220
Are you here today

440
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,890
to tell me who the mastermind is?

441
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,810
You won't tell me

442
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,820
because you need to protect His Lordship?

443
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,970
The mastermind is a horrible person?

444
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,150
He's doing that

445
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,280
to maintain the stability of Heavenly Realm

446
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,310
and there's no way to stop him?

447
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,300
What he's doing will make His Lordship lose everything?

448
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,900
But if you don't tell him the truth,

449
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,010
he will hate you forever.

450
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:16,180
When His Lordship was in the Moon Palace,

451
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,550
he encountered misfortune because of a pair of eyes.

452
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,810
Now His Lordship and I are very close.

453
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,690
His Lordship will get into trouble again

454
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,490
because of me.

455
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,250
My eyes

456
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,780
pose the greatest threat to His Lordship.

457
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,200
Didn't she see it?

458
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,090
How come my eyes

459
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,250
can't even see a hair stick?

460
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,000
Could it be

461
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,310
that I hid it too well?

462
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,440
Let's go to Shengjing tomorrow.

463
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,830
I'll go find Liu Zong with you.

464
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,600
You can stay here tonight.

465
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:51,770
His Lordship.

466
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,200
His Lordship.

467
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,040
Miss Zhaoyan has left.

468
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,230
This is her resignation letter to the imperial censor.

469
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,200
[Do good things and don't ask about the future. From Yun Zhaoyan]

470
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,200
[I'm not capable enough. I hereby resign from my position as the custodian of Imperial Censor's Mansion's Qingbing Warehouse. Please allow me to quit.]

471
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,170
She left

472
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,940
but she didn't mention the reason for it at all.

473
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,950
She didn't mention me either.

474
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,140
♫In my dream♫

475
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,350
♫I jumped and forgot myself♫

476
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,420
♫Hearing whispers of mountains and rivers in the mortal world♫

477
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:06,330
♫The sea is infinite, and I returned to this old place♫

478
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,480
♫Mayflies are most afraid of being affectionate♫

479
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,230
♫They spend the rest of their lives separately♫

480
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,200
♫Our fleeting encounter♫

481
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,970
♫Has disappeared amid reincarnation♫

482
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,600
♫The wind blows, reflecting everyone's loneliness♫

483
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,040
My Lord.

484
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,530
I'm so lucky

485
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,600
♫The ripples at dawn♫

486
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,890
to have met you.

487
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,470
♫The date of return on the other side♫

488
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,880
♫I'm waiting for my own answer to my own question♫

489
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:50,430
♫The sea of clouds drifts in this world and suddenly goes away all because of you♫

490
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,040
[Shengjing]

491
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:15,699
This is

492
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:18,219
where you and Liu Zong fell in love?

493
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,719
You want me to try this on for you?

494
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,800
I can't.

495
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,650
It's impolite for us

496
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,580
to sneak into someone else's room.

497
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,550
That's the person you've been looking for?

498
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,370
What? Yun Zhaoyan has left?

499
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,260
Ren Shique.

500
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,810
Is it because you always so cruel

501
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,890
and distant to Yun Zhaoyan

502
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,370
that she can't stand it anymore

503
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,570
and decided to leave?

504
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,180
Come down first.

505
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,410
Don't diver my attention to something else.

506
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,410
Don't deny your responsibilities.

507
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,040
Fine.

508
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,730
I won't ask you now.

509
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,370
Xie Guichen.

510
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,210
Is what you said true?

511
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:15,050
Yun Zhaoyan

512
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,670
is in danger

513
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,880
and she's afraid she'll get others into trouble

514
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,960
so

515
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,090
she's made the same decision she made ten years ago

516
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,420
to leave Qingzhou City?

517
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,070
Now,

518
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,520
you still won't tell us

519
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,540
who the mastermind is?

520
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,260
It's my master.

521
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,420
Ten years ago,

522
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,520
he adopted me.

523
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,460
I owe him a lot.

524
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,620
He brought me up.

525
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,180
So I always listened to him and obeyed his orders.

526
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,810
Then

527
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,170
he asked me to search for you everywhere.

528
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,690
Later, I found that you were in Qingzhou

529
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,050
and you lost your sight.

530
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,120
So when Governor

531
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,340
sending a deputy censor,

532
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,840
I took the chance and sneaked into Imperial Censor's Mansion.

533
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,240
I investigated your whereabouts secretly

534
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,130
and found that you had a special relationship with Zhaoyan.

535
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,770
So I told Master about it.

536
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,420
I didn't expect

537
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,610
my master then targeted at Zhaoyan.

538
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,970
I tried my best to stop him but in vain.

539
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:28,980
Right now,

540
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,550
I can't find his whereabouts.

541
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:34,320
Who is your master?

542
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,480
I've never seen his face.

543
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,740
All these years,

544
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,920
he sometimes appeared in fogs

545
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,980
and sometimes wore a black robe.

546
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,070
He didn't allow me to ask questions

547
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,360
or get close to him.

548
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,890
I could only follow his instructions.

549
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,230
All these years,

550
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,730
you must have had a hard time.

551
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,220
That's not important.

552
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,370
So

553
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,910
Yun Zhaoyan felt she was in danger

554
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,330
so she left?

555
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,690
She's really...

556
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,850
Well,

557
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,950
I'll send my men

558
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,130
to search for Zhaoyan

559
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,710
along the waterway.

560
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,390
I'll go with you.

561
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,880
By the way, Ren Shique.

562
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,040
Yun Zhaoyan's feelings for you

563
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,450
are far more than gratitude to you

564
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,730
as she said.

565
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,970
So if you see her again,

566
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,500
make sure she won't do things like this again.

567
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,450
This has been my first time to ask you to do something

568
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,250
since you came to Qingzhou.

569
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,970
You must do it well.

570
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,460
What Yun Zhaoyan felt

571
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,240
is the danger

572
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,810
that Kui Ji cannot tell?

573
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,580
Sir, do you have storybooks

574
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,210
of stories happened in Goulan House in Shengjing?

575
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,210
What?

576
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,800
Goulan House?

577
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:26,930
Pity?

578
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,490
These storybooks are all about stories of pity.

579
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,700
Really?

580
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,860
Do you know

581
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,730
a girl named Bi Luo from 20 years ago?

582
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,460
Bi Luo?

583
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:42,830
I know.

584
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,870
Her story is in this book.

585
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,170
Her story and the information of people involved are in the storybook.

586
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,020
How did you know these stories?

587
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,520
An old friend told me the stories.

588
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,520
An old friend?

589
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,130
Who is the old friend?

590
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,450
He told me the story.

591
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,860
And he was in the story.

592
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,010
Miss.

593
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,610
Stand aside. I need to do business here.

594
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,940
If she behaves like this,

595
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,250
I'm afraid she'll cause trouble again.

596
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,700
Guigui.

597
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,090
Miss Zhaoyan.

598
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,170
My Lord, why are you here?

599
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,380
I was passing by.

600
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,290
You stopped at Yihong Brothel by coincidence?

601
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,620
You're an attendant. You have no right to question me.

602
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,200
Besides,

603
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,400
you're a girl. Why do you often come here?

604
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,110
Oh, I came here to deal with something.

605
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:58,450
I'm heading to the suburbs of the city, so I'll be going now.

606
00:40:59,170 --> 00:40:59,970
Stop!

607
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,350
Is there anything else?

608
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,120
Get in.

609
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,180
Why does His Lordship look weird?

610
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,000
Is he still unhappy about the what happened in Moon God Temple the other day?

611
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,930
Yun Zhaoyan.

612
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,700
Be quiet.

613
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,020
I'm satisfied

614
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,950
that I can look at His Lordship this way.
