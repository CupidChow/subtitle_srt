[Hall Dedicated to Wanwan]

4
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,420
Thank you for saving me, My Lord.

5
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,290
I didn't expect

6
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,070
the red threads were so magical.

7
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,350
Just a few red threads.

8
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,360
It was so easy to untie you.

9
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,220
The Jia family is indeed holding

10
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,500
a ceremony of the posthumous marriage for the late Miss Jia.

11
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,910
There is convincing evidence for that now.

12
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,830
The Jia family is a prestigious family in Qingzhou City.

13
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,940
We're unable to punish them easily.

14
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,000
But the witch from Western Region

15
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,170
is full of nonsense.

16
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,840
Investigate and arrest her first.

17
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,110
You go out first. I'll take your place.

18
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,950
Let me meet the witch from Western Region.

19
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,240
[Episode 11]

20
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,870
Your Brother Xie

21
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,120
is safe now.

22
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,030
I helped you save him.

23
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:33,940
You should thank me.

24
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,740
Fortunately, Brother Xie and Wanwan didn't get married.

25
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,020
Why can't they?

26
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,280
A married couple should love each other.

27
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,110
But Wanwan was in love with someone else.

28
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,880
By the way, My Lord.

29
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,920
You can just catch the witch.

30
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,150
Why are you here pretending to be the bridegroom?

31
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,780
I know I can just catch her.

32
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,860
I just want to see

33
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,260
if the witch will play any other tricks.

34
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,680
By the way, My Lord.

35
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,100
The man Wanwan was in love with

36
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,480
is in the mansion now.

37
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,700
How about

38
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,769
you take this opportunity

39
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,500
to try to persuade Wanwan's grandmother.

40
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,860
Then I'm sure you can help Wanwan fulfill her wish.

41
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,540
Whether her wish can be fulfilled

42
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,400
doesn't depend on what we'll say.

43
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,180
If you're really capable,

44
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,860
why don't you let her show up

45
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,920
and explain to Old Madam Jia herself?

46
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,460
Otherwise,

47
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,140
why would Old Madam listen to you?

48
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,810
If I were able to do that,

49
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,220
I wouldn't have sneaked in.

50
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,340
All right, you get out first.

51
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,920
I'll take care of the rest.

52
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,090
But...

53
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:55,980
I...

54
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,520
I don't want you

55
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,530
to marry anyone else.

56
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:25,400
[Jia's Mansion]

57
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,000
What's going on in Jia's Mansion?

58
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,080
Ren Shique's been inside for so long.

59
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,740
But there's been no news from him at all.

60
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,900
Could Yun Zhaoyan and he

61
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,220
be confined in there?

62
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,440
Princess.

63
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,100
Xie Guichen.

64
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,270
Why are you here?

65
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,460
Why are you here?

66
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,980
Go back now.

67
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,030
His Lordship is still inside.

68
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,260
Don't go in and make trouble.

69
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,900
What do you mean?

70
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,230
I am the Princess of Qingzhou.

71
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,740
I've warned you.

72
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,450
What you'll do

73
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,240
is none of my business.

74
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,990
Where are you going?

75
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,130
Since Ren Shique is already inside,

76
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,670
it's out of my hands.

77
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,030
I want to go with you.

78
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,820
You...

79
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,240
What's wrong?

80
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,420
Let's go.

83
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,140
What should we

84
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,820
do next?

85
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,630
Are you going to nail Lady Lan's lie directly

86
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,840
or

87
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,510
wait for her to take action?

88
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,040
Every lie

89
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,830
will be nailed eventually.

90
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,900
Those seemingly magical tricks couldn't be played

91
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,980
by her alone.

92
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,880
So Lady Lan

93
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,970
must have other accomplices.

94
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,690
We must catch them all.

95
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,470
You're so smart.

96
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,750
You just said

97
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,100
you didn't want me to marry anyone else.

98
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,800
Why would you say that?

99
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,820
I...

100
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,300
I...

101
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,210
I don't want you to marry anyone else

102
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,920
because...

103
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,020
Well...

104
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,510
Because?

105
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,070
Because...

106
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,800
Because

107
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,640
you are the Moon God.

108
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,340
If you do that,

109
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,680
you will break the heavenly rules.

110
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,640
I don't need you to tell me this.

111
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,370
I...I'm just giving you a small warning.

112
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,220

114
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,920
There's something

[The other day, I went to Shengjing, where the night market there was so bustling.]

118
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,179
These are the letters and paintings

119
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,460
Wanwan and Jing Yao exchanged with each other.

120
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,299
They decided to marry each other back then.

121
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,440
If Jing’s Mansion hadn’t been confiscated,

122
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,380
they

123
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,470
would be

124
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,060
a happy couple.

125
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,070
Unfortunately,

126
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,030
they aren't meant to be.

127
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,750
You want me

128
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,380
to give these to your grandmother

129
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,130
to prove

131
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,620
My Lord.

132
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,070
Can we go out now?

133
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,700
These things

134
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,430
are enough to prove how deep their love is.

135
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,500
Wait.

136
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,330
It's the auspicious time. Miss Jia, please come.

137
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,100

138
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,810
My dear granddaughter is back.

139
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,980
Come and see me.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,880
Old Madam.

141
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,920
The ceremony has begun.

142
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,000
You and Miss Wanwan can only look at each other.

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,530
You can't touch each other.

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,950

come out.

146
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,040
Has it started?

147
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,190
Stay here. Don't go anywhere else.

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,870
Where is Wanwan? Where is she?

151
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,530
Kick him out.

152
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,640
The ceremony can't be interrupted.

154
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,300
Are you really Wanwan?

155
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,180
I'm Jing Yao. I'm back.

156
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,080
When I was on the border,

157
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,670
I always wanted to come back to see you.

158
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,350
But I was unable to do that.

159
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,740
It was all my fault.

160
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,150
And you suffered a lot.

161
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,180
Wanwan.

162
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,000
No matter where I am,

163
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,000
my love for you will never change.

164
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,560
My love for you

165
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,280
is as deep as ten years ago.

166
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,780
And it'll be the same in the future.

167
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,270
Wanwan, look at me.

168
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,430
Wanwan.

169
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,700
Lady Lan.

170
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,550
The ceremony has been interrupted by him.

171
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,550
What should we do now?

172
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,860
Old Madam.

173
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,340
Imperial Censor?

174
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,910
Old Madam, you ignored the dissuasion.

175
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,270
So I have to come here in person.

176
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,230
My Lord.

177
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,960
Why did you have to ruin the ceremony?

178
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,180
As long as the ceremony is held successfully,

179
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,260
Wanwan will be carefree.

180
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,900
Why can't you let me

181
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,820
fulfill this wish?

182
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,960
Right now,

183
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,410
why are you still so stubborn?

184
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,200
Old Madam.

185
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,800
You misunderstood His Lordship.

186
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,300
He didn't mean to destroy the ceremony.

187
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,020
This ceremony

188
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,720
is just a scam.

189
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,510
Miss Yun.

190
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,270
What do you mean?

191
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,860
This is the incense I found

192
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,460
in Miss Wanwan's courtyard.

193
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,140
The witch from Western Region used the incense and the bell

194
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,270
to create illusions

195
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,180
so that

196
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,590
you can't know what has really happened.

197
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,240
And she

198
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,720
is not Miss Wanwan.

199
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,540
Nonsense!

200
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,480
This is my Wanwan.

201
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,600
You're an accomplice of the witch from Western Region, right?

202
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,700
You...

203
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,880
You're not Wanwan.

204
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,720
Old Madam!

205
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,400
Miss.

206
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,560
How did you know

207
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,720
Wanwan

208
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,550
used to hold my hand like this?

209
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,520
Old Madam, did Wanwan say

210
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,380
she would be your crutch?

211
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,020
Did she also say

212
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,140
the person who would spend the rest of her life with her

213
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,940
would definitely be someone you and she both like?

214
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,740
Grandmother, my future husband

215
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,240
must be a guy I truly love.

216
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,660
You little girl.

217
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,920
You should feel ashamed of what you just said.

218
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,320
How can an unmarried lady

219
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,840
find her the husband by herself?

220
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,720
Grandmother, you're wrong.

221
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,320
My husband is going to spend the rest of my life with me.

222
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,450
How can I accept an arranged marriage?

223
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,100
If my future husband is someone I don't like,

224
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,410
we'll be a fake and unhappy couple.

225
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,920
Then that's no different from a life

226
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,850
in which I'll be lonely forever and die.

227
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,930
But I believe you'll like the man

228
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,460
I'll be in love with.

229
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,780
The man you'll be in love with

230
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,340
must be a very talented man.

231
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,010
I'll definitely like him.

232
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,130
It's Wanwan.

233
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,260
It's my granddaughter.

234
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,940
Miss Yun, can you see her?

235
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,520
Where is she? How is she?

236
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,300
I want to talk to her.

237
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,900
Please tell me what I should do

238
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,530
to fulfill Wanwan's wish?

239
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,420
She...

240
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,460
Princess, Imperial Censor ordered me

241
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,340
to investigate

242
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,270
whether Lady Lan has accomplices.

243
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,340
If her accomplices and I start to fight,

244
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,380
you may get hurt.

245
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,170
You should go back first.

246
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,920
We are allies now.

247
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,310
Of course we should take action together.

248
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,980
By the way,

249
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,850
though I promised

250
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,280
to keep your secret,

251
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,980
you have to promise me

252
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,940
that you will never do anything

253
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,540
that will harm Qingzhou City

254
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,540
or hurt the people of Qingzhou City.

255
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,840
Otherwise,

256
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,500
I won’t let you off.

257
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,830
Princess, you can rest assured

258
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,980
that I

259
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,150
will never hurt anyone.

260
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,300
But you broke my heart.

261
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,740
If you feel sorry,

262
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,780
you can quit your job in Imperial Censor's Mansion

263
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,580
and come to Governor's Mansion.

264
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,460
Ren Shique always assigns tricky tasks to you

265
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,990
and make you patrol the whole city and take business trips.

266
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,500
If you come to Governor's Mansion,

267
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,300
you'll have much more free time.

268
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,020
His Lordship

269
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,950
always assigns tasks to us fairly.

270
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,200
I

271
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,480
don't think my tasks are tricky.

272
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,340
You really don't know Ren Shique well.

273
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,180
He sends you to patrol here and there every day

274
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,770
to separate you from Yun Zhaoyan.

275
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,700
Ren Shique

276
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,359
is extremely narrow-minded.

277
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:14,670
If you really want to get close to Yun Zhaoyan,

278
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,339
I'm afraid you'll have to make extra efforts.

279
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,020
I know that.

280
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,520
I

281
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,180
have never had the thought of hurting Yun Zhaoyan.

282
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,550
Judging from what you said,

283
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,100
do you really have feelings

284
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,530
for Yun Zhaoyan?

285
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,420
You were really telling her

286
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,630
your true feelings for her last time?

287
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,370
Why don't you answer? So you really like her?

288
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,550
Is your hatred for Zhaoyan

289
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,180
true?

290
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,250
Some things

291
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,230
are hard to tell.

292
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,040
So?

293
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,940
Do you really like her or not?

294
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,740
Old Madam.

295
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,080
Wanwan

296
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,070
has something to tell you.

297
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,800
Those are her happiest memories.

298
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,380
Wanwan.

299
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,360
The painting shows the most beautiful scenery in Qingzhou City.

300
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,870
Everything I could see was painted on it.

301
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,150
These are the views of Qingzhou City outside my house?

302
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,150
When you recover,

303
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,740
I'll take you out for a tour.

304
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,790
We can go wherever we want to go.

305
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,280
Not just Qingzhou City.

306
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,220
We can go to Shengjing and the border area.

307
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,140
I'll take you to see all the beautiful scenery.

308
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,970
My illness

309
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,460
is an inborn disease. I've had it since I was a fetus.

310
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,820
It can’t be cured.

311
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,500
So my grandmother has never allowed me to leave home

312
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,650
and I could only stay in this courtyard

313
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,830
in case any accident happens to me.

314
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,860
Without you,

315
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,120
my life will probably be more boring.

316
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,360
Since you can't go out,

317
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,950
I'll travel around for you.

318
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,620
I'll bring you what you like

319
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,950
and what you want to eat.

320
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,120
Keep your promise.

321
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,470
By the order of His Majesty,

322
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,030
from now on,

323
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,500
all adult men in Jing’s Mansion

324
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,570
will be exiled to the border.

325
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,100
You shouldn't have anything to do with me,

326
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,910
son of an official who committed a crime.

327
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,820
Jing Yao.

328
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,620
Stay safe.

329
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,640
I'll wait for you to come back.

330
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,900
I'll keep waiting until you come back and marry me.

331
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,320
I swear to the Moon Goddess

332
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,800
that when my sentence of ten years ends,

333
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll marry Wanwan.

334
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,230
I also swear to the Moon Goddess

335
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,270
that I will keep waiting for Jing Yao.

336
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,670
I'll only marry Jing Yao.

337
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,720
My dear Wanwan.

338
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,420
Old Madam, don't be too sad.

339
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,210
Wanwan asked me to tell you this

340
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
because she hopes

341
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,820
that you won't ignore

342
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,650
Jing Yao's true love for her.

343
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,850
[The other day, I went to Shengjing, where the night market there is so bustling.

344
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,190
Wanwan

345
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,700
has been missing Jing Yao.

346
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,460
The Jia family

347
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,700
is a prestigious family.

348
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,560
When Master was alive,

349
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,810
he wanted to find Wanwan

350
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,640
a husband who's also from a prestigious family.

351
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,550
The Jing family committed a serious crime.

352
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:46,590
Anyway, Jing Yao is not the right person for Wanwan.

353
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,630
Old Madam.

354
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,000
True love may transcend the differences brought by family backgrounds.

355
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,630
Maybe.

356
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,500
Back then,

357
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,730
Jing Yao might only love Wanwan.

358
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,290
But so many years have passed.

359
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,580
Everyone knows the border is a dangerous place where life is hard.

360
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,960
How can I be sure

361
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,460
that

362
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,260
Jing's love for Wanwan has never changed?

363
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,900
Mr. Jing.

364
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,980
Do you still have the jade pendant

365
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,050
that Wanwan let you keep?

366
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,700
Yes.

367
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,420
Old Madam.

368
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,250
You just said

369
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,160
the border was dangerous.

370
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,480
If Mr. Jing

371
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,240
were a greedy and cunning man,

372
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,660
he would have sold

373
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,260
this valuable jade pendant.

374
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,600
He kept the jade pendant

375
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,130
at the most difficult time.

376
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,820
Doesn't this show

377
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,340
his true love for Wanwan?

378
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,710
Wanwan once said

379
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,560
she wanted me to bring her this jade pendant and propose to her.

380
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,420
It was a pity that

381
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,140
I didn't get to marry Wanwan.

382
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,760
Old Madam, please

383
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,950
let me see her one last time.

384
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,880
I want to tell her that I'm back

385
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160

They were so deeply in love.

Why can't you stop splitting them up?

389
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,800
It's understandable

390
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,400
that you've been missing your granddaughter.

391

392
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,510

Life is full of changes.

394
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,430
You cannot force others to be happy or sad.

Why can't you

396
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,910
just let them be together?

397
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,100
Even though Mr. Jing

398
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,110
is not the perfect man for Wanwan in your eyes,

399
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,410
and even though

400
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,090
he's a man of humble origins

401
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,620
and his family is a poor one,

402
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,640
in Wanwan's eyes,

403
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,960
he's her Mr. Right.

404
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,010
True love is hard to find.

405
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,500

408

Am I right?

410
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,100
I shouldn't have forced you to break up.

411
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,360
I shouldn't have trusted the bad person.

412
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,980

413
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,690

417
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,100
like to call me Grandmother?

418

Mr. Jing.

419
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,270

You two really need to catch me in person?

427
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,940
You used dirty tricks

428
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,670
to fool the people in Qingzhou.

429
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,820
This alone is a serious offence.

If you let me go today,

I'll tell you about your previous life and what this life of yours will be like.
