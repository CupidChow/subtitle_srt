There are dozens of people in the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

His Lordship won't be able to

This is what His Lordship asked me to convey.

His Lordship needs me.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,630
Why am I the impudent one?

When can I meet His Lordship?

This is also what His Lordship said.

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,350
His Lordship has poor eyesight.

29

It's hard for him to notice you.

30

I've also noticed that, too.

Isn't today the last day of the harem selection?

How can it end so abruptly?

What about me? I haven't participated yet.

The matter of the Wen family has caused panic.

People from Shengjing were afraid of more trouble,

43
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,250
so they stopped the selection and went back to the palace early in the morning.

189
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,120
you can make all the flowers

190
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,450
bloom at the same time,

191
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,790
I allow you

192
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,630
to seek shelter beside me occasionally.

193
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,670
But these flowers are withered.

194
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,700
How could they bloom suddenly?

195
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,400
That's your business.

196
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,800
My Lord, the flowers are blooming.

197
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,560
I didn't expect that some renegade immortal

198
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,730
would dare to be so reckless before me.

199
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,100
I haven't seen such a beautiful scene in ten years.

200
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,850
What's so special about it?

201
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,140
My Lord, you've seen the world.

202
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,360
Of course I can't compare to you.

203
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,690
My Lord,

204
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,960
so, does your promise count

205
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,600
or not?

206
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,120
When did I promise you?

207
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,910
You just promised me

208
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,050
if all the flowers in the garden bloomed,

209
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,830
you would let me hide by your side.

210
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,500
Why can't I remember?

211
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,190
My Lord, you can't go back on your word.

212
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,750
You promised me!

213
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,460
I'll follow you, then.

214
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,110
The top-quality tassel. Come and have a look.

215
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,540
Princess, take your time.

216
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,810
You have such good taste.

217
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,270
This tassel is made of silk.

218
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,960
It's very smooth, soft, and light.

219
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,600
It's a perfect gift

220
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,480
for your husband.

221
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,370
Who said I'm giving it away?

222
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,660
Princess, no!

223
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,120
Have you heard that the Princess has no chance to be an imperial concubine again?

224
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,250
She is so beautiful.

225
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,050
But who would know she's a female demon?

226
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,410
Exactly! The Double Demons of Qingzhou

227
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,000
One is fierce and domineering, and the other can't get married.

228
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,660
I think they can marry each other.

229
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,670
It'll be counted as getting rid of the evils for the people.

230
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,470
That's right.

231
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,940
My Lady, you can't cause any more trouble.

232
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,810
Do you also think I can't get married?

233
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,950
No, of course you can.

234
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,560
Xiaocha.

235
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,060
Yes.

236
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,510
I want a matchmaker.

237
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,490
[Governor's Mansion]

238
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,120
Why are there so many ugly men?

239
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,380
Is there no decent-looking man

240
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,940
in Qingzhou City?

241
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,840
Qingqing, since the news of

242
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,740
you looking for a husband got out,

243
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,280
the threshold of our Governor's Mansion

244
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,840
has almost been worn out from all the visitors.

245
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,600
These...

246
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,630
are already the ones

247
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,560
who have been carefully selected.

248
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,120
Look.

249
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,850
Which one looks like it's been carefully selected?

250
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,950
I've tried my best.

251
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,210
When those men knew you were the one looking for a husband,

252
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,110
they either closed the door or pretended to be sick.

253
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,510
Some gave money to the painter

254
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,570
to have their portrait painted with a pockmarked face.

255
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,460
How about

256
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,910
taking a closer look?

257
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,940
No.

258
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,040
These men are really no good.

259
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,369
I don't like any of them.

260
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,010
You're making it so difficult for me.

261
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,410
What do you mean?

262
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,530
Is it hard for you to find a husband for me?

263
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,460
Brother,

264
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,890
do you also think I can't get married?

265
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,760
No, no.

266
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,280
How could I

267
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,330
say that about my fairy-like sister?

268
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,840
Since the news that you want to seek a husband

269
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,630
spreads throughout Qingzhou,

270
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,120
men in Qingzhou

271
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,760
flock to our mansion.

272
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,670
The gate of the Governor's Mansion

273
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,990
is going to be worn out.

274
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,080
Look.

275
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,430
Look at those people.

276
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,840
They all come to our mansion

277
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,900
to apply for the Princess's Consort.

278
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,230
Look, look. They're not bad, right?

279
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,770
There are really many people

280
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,530
who want to marry Princess.

281
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,460
Let them wait.

282
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,230
I have my own plan.

283
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,390
My Lord.

284
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,900
His Lordship, the imperial censor, said he had something important to do,

285
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,380
so he asked me to report

286
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,800
the case of the lost woman in the Wen family.

287
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,090
He has something to do.

288
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,910
He asked you to come

289
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,470
because he didn't want to come, right?

290
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,020
My Lord,

291
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,100
the case of the Wen family is closed.

292
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,210
The daughter of the Wen family

293
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,140
has been safely sent to Shengjing.

294
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,380
Also…

295
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,830
Deputy Censor Xie, wait a minute.

296
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,310
Ding.

297
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Come here.

298
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,550
Governor.

299
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:07,950
How is it?

300
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,390
That person has been sent to the Princess.

301
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,920
Okay.

302
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,650
But it is said that they were...

303
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,690
Okay.

304
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,510
Pay them more.

305
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,000
More money.

306
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Okay.

307
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,580
The case of the Wen family is solved.

308
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,070
The harem selection has ended successfully.

309
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,670
These are all pieces of great news.

310
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,680
It happens that the bright moon reappears in the city.

311
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,480
The people take it as a good omen.

312
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,270
Holding the Moon Worship Ceremony again

313
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,880
is what the people want.

314
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,180
Let's see who dares to stop it.

315
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,350
The fifteenth day is just in a few days.

316
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,150
Why don't we hold a make-up Moon Worship Ceremony?

317
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,240
Yes.

318
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,920
I will go and convey your message.

319
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,750
Go back then.

320
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:06,920
Wait.

321
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,180
In these days,

322
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,460
I'm going hunting in the outer suburbs

323
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,810
to relax.

324
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,430
I might stay there for a while.

325
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,450
There's been a lot of trouble in the city lately.

326
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,660
You need to strengthen patrols.

327
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,300
Avoid any more trouble.

328
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,300
Yes.

329
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,470
Go.

330
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,420
No.

331
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,980
I have to hide far away.

332
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,390
I can't let Qingqing find me.

333
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,560
My ears.

334
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:49,810
This...

335
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,180
This is so scary.

336
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,020
My Lord,

337
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,310
you asked us to act,

338
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,590
not to die.

339
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,960
-That's right.
-Yeah.

340
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,700
Well...

341
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,910
What a bunch of losers.

342
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,550
Who else wants to try?

343
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,480
The winner

344
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,390
can enter the next round

345
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,070
of my husband selection.

346
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,720
I'm willing to be a vegetarian.

347
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,580
Just don't pick me. Don't pick me.

348
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,120
Don't pick me.

349
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,640
You...

350
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,670
Me?

351
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,480
No, no.

352
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,360
It's him.

353
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,120
How dare you attack Princess?

[Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow]

355
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,930
If you hurt Princess, Governor will definitely punish you.

356
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,410
I didn't know Princess was selecting a husband.

357
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,410
If I offended you,

358
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,150
please forgive me.

359
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,230
Why would she listen to you and forgive you?

360
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,150
No one dared

361
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,950
to treat our Princess like that.

362
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,550
Princess, how do you want to punish him?

363
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,940
We don't have to punish him.

364
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,590
I'm gentle, kind, and friendly.

365
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,760
Since he didn't mean it,

366
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,260
we don't have to blame him.

367
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,180
My Lord,

368
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
am I right?

369
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,950
Thank you, Princess.

370
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,990
What's your name?

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,900

376
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,740
Why does this name also win my heart?

377
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,150
Xie Guichen.

378
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,950
I remember you.

379
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,270
You have to remember my face,

380
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,150
the most beautiful face in Qingzhou.

381
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,280
Next time you see me,

382
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,100
you must recognize me.

383
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,690
Xiaocha!

384
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,200
Let's go.

385
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,290
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

386
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,390
Who is it?

387
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,850
Who is it?

388
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,730
Daohuang, why do you scare me?

389
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,000
My Lord! My Lord! Where are you?

390
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,470
My Lord. My Lord.

391
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,090
I was reckless.

392
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,720
I didn't see anything.

393
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,930
I didn't see anything.

394
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,700
Stop!

395
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,110
Shame on you!

396
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,660
Come here. I have something to ask you.

397
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,680
Who allowed you to enter the inner hall?

398
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,010
I didn't mean it.

399
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,630
That renegade immortal, Daohuang,

400
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,720
suddenly scared me.

401
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,000
He kept chasing me. That's why I...

402
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,910
Didn't you say that as long as I'm here,

403
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,110
there will be no renegade immortal around here?

404
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,510
But there really was one.

405
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,870
Yun Zhaoyan.

406
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,090
I agreed to allow you to stay in the Imperial Censor's Mansion,

407
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,400
but I also warned you

408
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,840
to stay away from me.

409
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,360
It seems that you really don't care

410
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,510
what I said.

411
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
I won't offend you again.

412
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,310
My Lord,

413
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,200
don't kick me out.

414
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,200
If you act recklessly again,

415
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,350
I will never let you stay here.

416
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,420
Alright.

417
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,070
Go out and sweep the yard.

418
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,160
And get off work.

419
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,820
Don't wander around in the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

420
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,510
Okay, I'll go now.

421
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,150
Thank you, My Lord.

422
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,270
I didn't expect

423
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,470
she saw these hundreds of years.

424
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,750
My Lord.

425
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,890
Yun Zhaoyan, what are you thinking?

426
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,640
Don't go.

427
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,960
Don't leave Zhaoyan.

428
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,290
I miss you so much.

429
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:00,250
The moon will be full soon. I won't run around.

430
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,680
What gibberish is she talking about again?

431
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
This kid…

432
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,580
She didn't even take an umbrella when it was raining.

433
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,240
She just came back in the rain.

434
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,640
Mother.

435
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,280
Is it you?

436
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,510
Miss Yun is so unlucky.

437
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Whatever.

438
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,020
I'll give you a try of my strong medicine

439
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,550
to bring down the fever quickly.

440
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,660
Mother.

441
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,630
Don't go!

442
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,800
Don't go!

443
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,500
Chang Xi.

444
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,880
Mother.

445
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,550
Is it you?

446
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,230
Tonight, there is a full moon.

447
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,040
The mortals always draw an analogy between the full moon and the reunion.

448
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,080
Although we are separated by the Soul Collecting Lamp,

449
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,600
we can look at each other through lights.

450
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,050
I don't ask for much.

451
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,530
I just hope to be with you

452
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,470
on every full moon.

453
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,960
It turns out

454
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,600
everything was a lie.

455
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,230
Are you

456
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,720
by my side now?

457
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,560
Zhaoyan.

458
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,200
It's Master.

459
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,240
Yun Zhaoyan.

460
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,960
Did I overindulge you recently?

461
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,990
How dare you come uninvited?

462
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:32,920
You...

463
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,380
Xi.

464
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,340
What did you call me?

465
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,760
Where is Yun Zhaoyan?

466
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,430
Call her out to see me.

467
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Princess has been on patrol for a month.

468
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,070
You still look radiant and beautiful.

469
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,970
You're as vulgar as before.

470
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,170
You just can't appreciate my fairy-like beauty.

471
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,560
If all fairies were like you,

472
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,020
no one would want to be immortal.

473
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,360
You talk as if

474
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,360
you've seen the fairy in the heaven.

475
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,120
Ask Yun Zhaoyan to come out now.

476
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,200
I have a lot to tell her.

477
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,920
Princess, why don't you try the tea

478
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,400
and snacks in our mansion?

479
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,360
No need.

480
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,060
I really don't know what you're thinking about,

481
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,969
letting such a person in the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

482
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:19,880
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

483
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,639
Yun Zhaoyan

484
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,620
is mental.

485
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,400
You're not much less mental than her.

486
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,199
You...

487
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,270
I really don't get along with you.

488
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,360
I get unhappy whenever I meet you.

489
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,070
See the guest out. I have a lot to do in my Imperial Censor's Mansion.

490
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,239
My men

491
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,389
have no time to see the Princess.

492
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:46,670
If I can't find her here,

493
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:48,449
I'll have other ways.

494
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,480
Even the most arrogant fairy in the heaven

495
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,600
is not so overpowering.

496
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,690
Let go of me! I admit defeat!

497
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,190
My Lord.

498
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,830
We heard a noise.

499
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,680
Are you okay?

500
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,060
I'm fine. It shouldn't be a thief.

501
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:26,490
My Lord, you just came to Qingzhou City. There are no thieves here.

502
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,320
Yes.

503
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,470
I might believe you if you say there are demons or ghosts.

504
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,040
But thieves or robbers

505
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,640
dare not come to Qingzhou.

506
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:33,380
Why?

507
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,320
There are Double Demons of Qingzhou here.

508
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,490
One is the Imperial Censor,

509
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,790
and the other is the Princess.

510
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,200
When the bandits from the surrounding villages in a ten-mile area

511
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,460
hear the news about them,

512
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,000
they'll take a detour.

513
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,880
Yes.

514
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,270
The Princess is scarier than a tiger.

515
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,080
Yes.

516
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,220
She's scarier than a bear.

517
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,010
He doesn't believe us?

518
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,320
He's not afraid.
