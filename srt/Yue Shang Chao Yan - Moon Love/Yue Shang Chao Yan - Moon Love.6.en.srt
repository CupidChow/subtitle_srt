00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,860
[Episode 6]

4
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,320
Yun Zhaoyan.

5
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,310
Is it because I've been too lenient with you lately?

6
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,120
How dare you come uninvited?

7
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,199
You...

8
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,400
Xi.

9
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,310
What...

10
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
What did you call me?

11
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,320
How do you know that name?

12
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,770
Are you still holding a grudge against me?

13
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,720
Kui Ji?

14
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,030
You're Kui Ji?

15
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,920
Xi.

16
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,110
Do your eyes...

17
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,640
still hurt?

18
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,500
You're still coveting these eyes.

19
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,980
Please forgive me.

20
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,350
Forgive you?

21
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,240
Back then,

22
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,740
in the Soul Collecting Lamp,

23
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,600
you pretended to have a deep bond with me as mother and son.

24
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,700
Why do you still want to hurt me after coming out?

25
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,180
I was really...

26
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,850
Your concern for me was all a pretense.

27
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,680
It was just to deceive me

28
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,680
into breaking the Soul Collecting Lamp

29
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,990
and releasing you!

30
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,110
Say something!

31
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,510
Xi,

32
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,320
you must be careful in the future

33
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,560
not to attract trouble again

34
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,070
because of these eyes.

35
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,480
I've been a trouble

36
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,640
since I was born,

37
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
haven't I?

38
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,160
Master.

39
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,590
You seem to be tired and lax lately.

40
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,600
I dare not.

41
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,850
Recently, there has indeed

42
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,640
been a suspicious person around Ren Shique.

43
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,320
Tell me.

44
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,450
As far as I know,

45
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,290
Ren Shique never likes people getting close to him.

46
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,840
He never even allows outsiders to serve in his mansion.

47
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,740
But recently,

48
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,110
there's been a girl

49
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,350
named Yun Zhaoyan around Ren Shique.

50
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,240
She doesn't even try to hide her intention

51
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,760
of approaching him.

52
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,790
What's even stranger is

53
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,920
that Ren Shique actually allowed her to stay in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

54
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,450
A commoner girl?

55
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,480
I have seen her several times.

56
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,030
Hurry to investigate the background of that girl.

57
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,150
The most important thing is to keep an eye on Ren Shique.

58
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,080
Yes.

59
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,190
I see.

60
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,670
Don't shout.

61
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,440
Do you want everyone in Imperial Censor's Mansion

62
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,100
to know that you spent the night here last night?

63
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,450
My Lord,

64
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,560
do immortals need sleep too?

65
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,770
After descending to the mortal world,

66
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,720
I no longer have an immortal body.

67
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,530
It takes a lot of effort to maintain a mortal body.

68
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,880
Last night,

69
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,720
did I do anything to you?

70
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,800
They all say I'm fat.

71
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,409
I'm not fat at all!

72
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,600
My wife said

73
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,970
we're getting poor because I eat too much.

74
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,980
Xi,

75
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,920
I have fallen in love with a man in the mortal world.

76
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,830
You brat!

77
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,070
I've been wanting to teach you a lesson.

78
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,200
But I haven't found the opportunity.

79
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,720
I'll kick your ass today!

80
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,900
Yun Zhaoyan,

81
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,490
you are yourself now, right?

82
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,590
Last night, there were actually

83
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,440
so many renegade immortals who came to me.

84
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,570
Yun Zhaoyan,

85
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,730
you really are something.

86
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,540
You made such a mess here.

87
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,110
There are reasons.

88
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,080
Every time when I'm weak,

89
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,280
those renegade immortals

90
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,210
take advantage and occupy my body.

91
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,830
So,

92
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,960
I never dare to cry,

93
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,460
or drink,

94
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,200
or even fall ill.

95
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,360
So, that's why

96
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,960
you always seem so cautious?

97
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,640
But My Lord, with you by my side last night,

98
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,700
I felt relieved.

99
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,950
I had a good sleep.

100
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,330
By the way, My Lord,

101
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,640
I think I saw

102
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,130
that red-clothed renegade immortal last night.

103
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,540
She was standing by the bed, watching me.

104
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,570
And then...

105
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,640
I...

106
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,720
I don't remember anything.

107
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,960
It looks like she is related

108
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
to this matter.

109
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,920
If she occupied my body last night,

110
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,360
does that mean

111
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,880
you have met her?

112
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,310
No.

113
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,400
I haven't met her.

114
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,960
You mentioned before

115
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,540
that you wanted to stay by my side, right?

116
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,240
Yes.

117
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,800
Alright.

118
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,840
Then I'll allow you

119
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,340
to get closer to me every day.

120
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,000
Really?

121
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,200
Starting from today,

122
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,880
you'll be my personal attendant.

123
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,600
So, does that mean

124
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,430
I can stay by your side

125
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,290
every day from now on?

126
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,070
Don't think too much.

127
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,480
You once said

128
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,350
I am your talisman.

129
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
Then you'll be my bait.

130
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,000
Listen.

131
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,680
The red-clothed renegade immortal you saw beside me

132
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,520
is called Kui Ji.

133
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,630
So, her name is Kui Ji.

134
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,800
The next time you see her,

135
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
ask her

136
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,550
why she did that back then.

137
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Back then?

138
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,560
If you want to stay in my Imperial Censor's Mansion,

139
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,640
you must put in the maximum effort

140
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,840
to convey my words.

141
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,650
If you can't get the answer,

142
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,880
then don't stay here.

143
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
I see.

144
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
I definitely won't let you down.

145
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,680
My Lord,

146
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,720
you entrusted such an important task to me.

147
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,430
It makes me feel like

148
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,630
I'm indispensable

149
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,560
to you.

150
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,480
Allowing you to stay in Imperial Censor's Mansion

151
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,340
is already an extra favor from me.

152
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,280
I am still very grateful to you.

153
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
Now, I finally have a way

154
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,470
to deal with those renegade immortals.

155
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,310
Moreover,

156
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,550
since I came to Imperial Censor's Mansion,

157
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,000
more and more people

158
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
are willing to talk to me.

159
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,600
And I no longer have to be

160
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,080
as lonely as before.

161
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,000
My Lord,

162
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
you are truly my talisman.

163
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,560
Don't think too highly of yourself.

164
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,830
And don't overestimate your position in my heart.

165
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
My Lord!

166
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,470
Come with me.

167
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,200
My Lord.

168
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,470
Why...

169
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,120
Why did I hear a girl talking just now?

170
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,760
A girl?

171
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,530
How could there be a girl in my room?

172
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,280
My Lord,

173
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,780
what's wrong with you?

174
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,000
You...

175
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,440
You have a gray hair here.

176
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,070
How come?

177
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Where?

178
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,720
-Where?
-Take a closer look.

179
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,040
Wait. How come I have a gray hair?

180
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,150
You do. It's right there.

181
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,080
I don't.

182
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,350
Where is it?

183
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,160
Gray hair.

184
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,930
Let's take a look here.

185
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,600
These colors suit you.

186
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,790
Try them on later.

187
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,400
They will look very beautiful when made into clothes.

188
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:33,910
Okay.

189
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,840
Let's go over there and take a look.

190
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,440
Have you found out more about that Yun Zhaoyan?

191
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,400
Princess,

192
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,660
you seem to be quite concerned about her.

193
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,960
She and I

194
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,200
once lived together.

195
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,680
Later, she repeatedly ruined my plans.

196
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,280
Naturally, I need to gather more information

197
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,920
about such an inauspicious acquaintance

198
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,320
and be cautious.

199
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,080
I heard that not long ago,

200
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,840
she sneaked into Qingzhou City late at night,

201
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,520
disrupted the Chai family's engagement banquet,

202
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,710
and was thrown out.

203
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,400
Since then, she has been wandering around Qingzhou City,

204
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,530
staying in a morgue.

205
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,960
But for some reason,

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,120
she is now staying in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

207
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
She always uses

208
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,200
preposterous tricks

209
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,860
to gain sympathy from others.

210
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,080
The business at Xiaoxiang Pavilion is really good.

211
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Especially on the 15th of every month,

212
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,920
there are even more people.

213
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,800
Yes.

214
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,960
Ever since the city governor ordered the resumption of the Moon Worship Ceremony,

215
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,030
all the young ladies from prominent families

216
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,600
have been busy dressing up.

217
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,430
Everyone wants to outshine the others

218
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,560
at the ceremony.

219
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,130
Princess, look,

220
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,330
that's Miss Zhao from the Zhao family.

221
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,640
Not enough.

222
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,480
Still not enough.

223
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,910
The lips aren't red enough.

224
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,840
I need to put some rouge and powder.

225
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,580
My Lord.

226
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,120
My Lord.

227
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,310
The city governor sent an invitation

228
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,760
to the Moon Worship Ceremony,

229
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,490
inviting you

230
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,100
to preside over the ceremony,

231
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,000
and enjoy the grand event with the celebrities

232
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,730
and literati of Qingzhou City.

233
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,670
In the future,

234
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,840
don't bother me

235
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,750
with such trivial matters.

236
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,880
I heard

237
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,400
that this Moon Worship Ceremony will be exceptionally lively.

238
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,560
It will be a wonderful event in the mortal world.

239
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,890
My Lord, if you don't go,

240
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
wouldn't you be disappointing

241
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,720
the people's enthusiasm?

242
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,800
The city governor also said

243
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,080
if you attend,

244
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,200
it would help resolve the misunderstanding from before

245
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,660
when you banned the moon worship in the city.

246
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,560
Why should I be afraid of their misunderstanding?

247
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,600
My Lord,

248
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,120
this is the city governor's sincere gesture.

249
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,440
If you refuse,

250
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,480
when he comes here

251
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,010
and starts causing a scene,

252
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,520
even with your ten years of friendship,

253
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,430
you won't be able to handle him.

254
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,420
That makes sense.

255
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,099
That's right.

256
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,599
I will go now to inform the servant who brought the invitation

257
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,480
that Imperial Censor

258
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
will attend the Moon Worship Ceremony.

259
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,680
Wait.

260
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,750
I'll take Yun Zhaoyan with me.

261
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,510
Strange.

262
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,800
Where is my pearl flower?

263
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,720
Could it have been left in His Lordship's room?

264
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,330
-Miss Yun. Miss Yun.
-Miss Yun.

265
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,510
Well... Go away.

266
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,440
Miss Yun,

267
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,360
I heard that you are going with His Lordship

268
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,020
to the Moon Worship Ceremony.

269
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,240
I also heard

270
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,500
that you usually have trouble sleeping.

271
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,430
Here is a high-quality sleeping incense.

272
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,240
Just light a small stick every night,

273
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,070
and it will ensure you sleep soundly until dawn.

274
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,520
Wait.

275
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,280
Did you say

276
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm going to the Moon Worship Ceremony with His Lordship?

277
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,760
Yes.

278
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,560
Miss Yun,

279
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,320
we martial artists often speak in a way

280
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,120
that may offend others.

281
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,040
Please don't take offense.

282
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,880
I didn't mean it.

283
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,510
It was all unintentional.

284
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm going to attend the Moon Worship Ceremony with His Lordship.

285
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,160
I need to prepare.

286
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,600
She's quite happy.

287
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,040
What a lousy incense.

288
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,760
It didn't come in handy.

289
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,080
Now,

290
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,010
Qingzhou City has the moon,

291
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,920
and the streets are different from before.

292
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,650
Today's Moon Worship Ceremony

293
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,600
will surely be bustling with drums,

294
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,790
songs, and dances.

295
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,840
If Mother could see such a grand scene,

296
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,160
she would be extremely delighted, I think.

297
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Let's go.

298
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,180
Come and take a look, miss.

299
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,480
Zhaoyan.

300
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,310
Brother Xie?

301
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,710
You bought so many things.

302
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,840
Let me help you.

303
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,920
It's okay.

304
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,760
Brother Xie, you have so many things to do during the day,

305
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,490
and now you're out patrolling.

306
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,840
You really are hard-working.

307
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,520
It's okay.

308
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,350
We agreed to go together the other day,

309
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,150
but something came up suddenly,

310
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,560
and I was busy all night, so I couldn't come to see you.

311
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,080
Later, fearing you might worry,

312
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,010
I went to the morgue to look for you.

313
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,400
The Princess is so beautiful.

314
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,960
She's carrying a mirror on the street.

315
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,620
Why did she dress up like this?

316
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,070
Zhaoyan!

317
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,440
Lord Xie, where are you going?

318
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,310
Greetings, Princess.

319
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,760
Lord Xie,

320
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,380
didn't you see the stunning beauty

321
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,140
of mine?

322
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,830
I have something to attend to.

323
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,490
I won't disturb

324
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,950
your leisure.

325
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,530
Am I not pretty enough?

326
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,160
I was so scared.

327
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,870
Yun Zhaoyan.

328
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,650
Why are you in such a panic?

329
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,800
My Lord.

330
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,590
What took you so long?

331
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,080
Did you encounter another renegade immortal?

332
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,840
Zhaoyan.

333
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,200
His Lordship...

334
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,540
Why is he here?

335
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,640
My Lord.

336
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,480
Deputy Censor Xie,

337
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,210
aren't you supposed to be patrolling in the Wang Garden?

338
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,240
How come you have the time to return to Imperial Censor's Mansion?

339
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,640
Tonight, I am not on duty in the Wang Garden.

340
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,560
While patrolling the streets just now,

341
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,280
I happened to come across Zhaoyan.

342
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,040
She seemed to be startled by something.

343
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,240
I was worried that something might happen to her,

344
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,100
so I followed her all the way here.

345
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,010
Brother Xie, I'm fine.

346
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,430
I just made a mistake.

347
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,860
Now that I'm back at Imperial Censor's Mansion,

348
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,110
I'm safe here.

349
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,510
I'm glad to hear that.

350
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,740
We need more manpower in the Wang Garden.

351
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,230
You may go there now.

352
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,840
Yes.

353
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,540
I'll take my leave.

354
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,840
Zhaoyan.

355
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,870
I'll take these things

356
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,720
back to Grandma Long for you.

357
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,560
Thank you, Brother Xie.

358
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,280
Thank goodness Brother Xie didn't ask about what happened just now.

359
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,410
Haven't you seen enough?

360
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,440
Since you don't want

361
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,900
your Brother Xie to leave,

362
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,640
why don’t you just go with him?

363
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,050
No.

364
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,410
I'm only following you.

365
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,070
My Lord.

366
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,480
My Lord,

367
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,610
where are you going?

368
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,200
To the Wang Garden.

369
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,380
Don't follow me.

370
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,870
But just now, I saw a terrifying renegade immortal

371
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,850
next to the Princess.

372
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,350
Tonight, can I stay...

373
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,200
No.

374
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,080
But she was really scary.

375
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,110
If I can't stay with you,

376
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,160
I definitely won't be able to sleep peacefully.

377
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,350
With you around me,

378
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,350
I won't be able to sleep peacefully.

379
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,260
My Lord...

380
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,000
I heard that the Princess is also going to the Wang Garden.

381
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,100
So what?

382
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,880
Don't you always consider

383
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,000
spreading useless kindness

384
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,880
your duty?

385
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,320
I...

386
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,750
Why are you hesitating now?

387
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,770
The Princess is your old friend, isn't she?

388
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,840
I...

389
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,500
But...

390
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,600
Why did that renegade immortal

391
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,480
target the Princess?

392
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,120
And she has never liked me.

393
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,800
Should I go to the Moon Worship Ceremony?

394
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,460
What are you murmuring about?

395
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,760
Ma'am?

396
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,680
Um...

397
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,460
Um...

398
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,600
I have a task for you.

399
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,020
Go to the neighboring village and collect a corpse.

400
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,680
Do I have to do it tonight?

401
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,360
Can it wait until tomorrow?

402
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,440
Well, your rent.

403
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,390
I haven't received my salary yet.

404
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,200
Alright.

405
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,800
Ma'am,

406
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,870
it's late.

407
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,040
Where are you going?

408
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,680
I'm going into the mountains to gather Immortality Grass.

409
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,240
It's very rare.

410
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,880
If I miss this opportunity,

411
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,020
I'll have to wait for three years.

412
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,580
I'm old.

413
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,280
I want to live a few more years no matter what.

414
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,080
She really cherishes her life.

415
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,680
Anyway.

416
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,710
I'm going to finish the task assigned by her first.

417
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,290
Zhaoyan.

418
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,450
Brother Xie?

419
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,750
Why are you here?

420
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,030
You didn't go to the Moon Worship Ceremony?

421
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,560
I just came back from there.

422
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,120
I heard you came back from Imperial Censor's Mansion.

423
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,180
So I came to see you.

424
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,650
Let me help you.

425
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,590
It's okay.

426
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,840
I can do it myself.

427
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,830
Since you call me Brother,

428
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,110
we are friends.

429
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,990
Let me do it.

430
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,530
Thank you, Brother Xie.

431
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,720
How can you manage

432
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,470
such a heavy work alone?

433
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,410
I'm used to it.

434
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,920
Since I was seven,

435
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,350
I've been on the road.

436
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,600
Besides this kind of heavy work,

437
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,260
there was no other work for me.

438
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,040
Thank you, Brother Xie.

439
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,240
Do you have

440
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,290
any familiar friends in Qingzhou?

441
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,460
Actually,

442
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,320
there used to be one.

443
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,070
She's a little monster!

444
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,880
She's a little monster!

445
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,520
Little monster! She's a little monster!

446
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,050
She's not a little monster!

447
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,200
Don't come over! Don't!

448
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,720
Little monster!

449
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,550
I've told you

450
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,140
she's not a little monster!

451
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,510
-She is!
-She's not!

452
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,400
She's not a little monster!

453
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,640
She's not!

454
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,280
You shouldn't mention renegade immortals

455
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,360
anymore when you're outside.

456
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,680
They're not real.

457
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,190
But I really can see renegade immortals.

458
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,800
There's no such thing.

459
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,340
You made a mistake.

460
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,280
But I really...

461
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,320
I really can see them.

462
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,600
Nobody else can see them,

463
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,670
but you can.

464
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,720
Don't you think

465
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,300
you've been crazy all the time?

466
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,120
But...

467
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,710
I can't lie.

468
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,930
Yun Zhaoyan, you're driving me crazy!

469
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,600
Although she didn't want to

470
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,160
be friends with me long ago,

471
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,920
she was my only friend after all.

472
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,800
Now that she's being pestered by a renegade immortal,

473
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,080
I shouldn't just stand by

474
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,210
and do nothing.

475
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,270
What’s wrong?

476
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,880
Brother Xie.

477
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,470
I'm not struggling anymore.

478
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,560
I'm going to the Moon Worship Ceremony.

479
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,030
I'm leaving this to you.

480
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,300
[Yun's Mansion] [Morgue]

481
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,030
What's inside?

482
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,480
The body of an old lady from the neighboring village.

483
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,990
Just drag it into the courtyard.

484
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,040
I'm leaving now.

485
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,750
A body?

486
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,130
[Yun's Mansion] [Morgue]

487
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,310
My Lord,

488
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,880
the city governor has gone out hunting.

489
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,760
You are in charge of the city affairs.

490
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,960
You should have come out earlier to take charge.

491
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,810
Look.

492
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,650
In order to worship you,

493
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,440
the people prepared so grandly.

494
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,640
It's just the reappearance of the moon.

495
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,950
I've been guarding Qingzhou City for more than ten years,

496
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,120
and I've never seen them so attentive before.

497
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,980
It was all thanks to Miss Zhaoyan.

498
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,020
It was she who brought the moon back.

499
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,550
Don't mention her to me.

500
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,590
Greetings, Imperial Censor.

501
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:03,590
My Lord.

502
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,460
Look.

503
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,650
The people's aspirations have reached the moon.

504
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,230
This year, Qingzhou City

505
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,960
will surely be prosperous.

506
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,600
Does the moon

507
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,950
truly enjoy

508
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,210
these bright things flying up to the sky?

509
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,540
Why don't they

510
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,230
just ask these presumptuous Kongming lanterns

511
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,690
to fulfill their wishes?

512
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,160
But in the past,

513
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,670
when people worshipped you,

514
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,590
you never fulfilled their wishes either.

515
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,520
Why should I fulfill their wishes?

516
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,280
the Princess is here.

517
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,640
You are now

518
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,840
the most beautiful woman in the city.

519
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,560
What’s wrong with her?

520
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,160
Why is she dressed like this?

521
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,050
Is she possessed?

522
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,350
-Miss Yun.
-Miss Yun.

523
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,760
Are you going to see His Lordship?

524
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,000
We'll help you.

525
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,360
Just remember our kindness in the future.

526
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,520
Yes.

527
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,880
-Let’s go.
-You’re welcome. Let’s go.

528
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,070
Get out of the way.

529
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,120
Get out of the way.

530
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,360
Here comes a big shot!

531
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,280
The big shot.

532
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,980
Yun Zhaoyan.

533
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,880
Why did you come to me again?

534
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,360
Princess,

535
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,990
I didn't want to disturb you.

536
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,160
But I really can't

537
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,880
just stand by and watch you be beguiled

538
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,210
by a renegade immortal.

539
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,610
Again with the renegade immortal.

540
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,380
You haven't changed at all since you were a kid.

541
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,240
I know you hate me.

542
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,540
But I hope you trust me this time.

543
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,360
There has been a renegade immortal pestering you.

544
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,630
Don't believe her.

545
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,550
She's jealous of you.

546
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,480
She can talk?

547
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,760
No.

548
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,100
Give it to me.

549
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,400
Give it to me!

550
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,240
What are you doing?

551
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,970
Give it to me!

552
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,680
Yun Zhaoyan, let go!

553
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
Give me the mirror!

554
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:40,970
My Lord?

555
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,750
Didn't you say you're afraid of renegade immortals,

556
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,950
so you wouldn't come?

557
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
There has been a renegade immortal

558
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,400
pestering the Princess.

559
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,610
It's hiding in that bronze mirror.

560
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,080
What renegade immortal?

561
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,710
Nonsense!

562
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,480
My Lord.

563
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,650
Come with me.

564
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,850
I've told you

565
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,240
that there are some wandering renegade immortals

566
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,380
even I haven't met.

567
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,230
Their powers are so strong

568
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,230
that they can even appear by my side.

569
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,420
It's hard to distinguish whether they are good or evil.

570
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,560
Go back now.

571
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,710
My Lord.

572
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,430
My mother used to say

573
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,100
that one should always be kind-hearted.

574
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,330
In this world of karmic cycles,

575
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,720
the kindness you give

576
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,390
will always come back to you.

577
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,520
Besides, the Princess is my friend.

578
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,720
I can't give up on her.

579
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
My Lord, thank you for the reminder.

580
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,920
I'll find a way myself.

581
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,070
You...

582
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,240
My Lord,

583
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,680
just now, the Soul Collecting Lamp seemed to light up for a moment.

584
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,950
Could it be...

585
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,150
another renegade immortal appearing?

586
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,030
My Lord,

587
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,160
should we call Miss Zhaoyan here?

588
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,960
Why?

589
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,880
Miss Zhaoyan can see renegade immortals.

590
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,020
With her help,

591
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,430
Qingzhou City can be peaceful,

592
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,910
and you can be at peace too.

593
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,000
The peace of Qingzhou

594
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,680
is because of my protection.

595
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,090
What does my peace

596
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,520
have to do with her?

597
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
But, My Lord,

598
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,300
if the renegade immortal causes trouble again,

599
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,850
the people in the city will panic,

600
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,230
and rumors about you will spread again.

601
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,920
Earlier, they said

602
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,630
you destroyed the Moon Worship Ceremony

603
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,200
and offended the Moon God.

604
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:43,950
Ridiculous.

605
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,960
How could they know the mind of the Moon God?

606
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,360
In the whole world,

607
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,220
who could know it better than you?

608
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
But the common people don't know it.

609
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,440
Why should I care about their thoughts?

610
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,720
You're right.

611
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,670
With you here,

612
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,200
there's nothing to fear.

613
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,830
Come on, let's go on patrol.

614
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,880
Ma'am.

615
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,370
Aren't you going to gather herbs today?

616
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,000
Someone has already done it for me.

617
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,290
Who was this kind person?

618
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,560
Your sweetheart.

619
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,630
My sweetheart?

620
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:24,560
Yes.

621
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
The one...

622
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:28,550
who lives in the old mansion.

623
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,300
Xie...

624
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,639
You mean Brother Xie?

625
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,480
Yes.

626
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,690
It was him.

627
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,870
He came to the morgue to find you today.

628
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:37,070
But you weren't here.

629
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,320
He gathered the herbs for me.

630
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,719
I can see

631
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,670
that he must be fond of you.

632
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,550
Ma'am,

633
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,190
you've got it wrong.

634
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,250
Brother Xie and I don't have that kind of relationship.

635
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,630
I have clear eyes.

636
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,770
He cares a lot about you.

637
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,400
That's because Brother Xie

638
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,760
is inherently a kind-hearted person.

639
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,200
Today is the 15th.

640
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,920
There will be the Moon Worship Ceremony.

641
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,250
Although I'm not going to the Wang Garden,

642
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,550
I still need to pray at the morgue.

643
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,520
Go to the street

644
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,720
and buy some incense and candles for me.

645
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,600
You brat!

646
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,750
I've been wanting to teach you a lesson.

647
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,840
But I haven't found the opportunity.

648
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,600
I'll kick your ass today!

649
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,630
Yun Zhaoyan,

650
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,280
you are yourself now, right?
