00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,430
My Lord.

5
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,180
Brother, what took you so long?

6
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,920
You won't believe it.

7
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,990
You have no idea how difficult it was

8
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,260
to find the right direction in the city.

9
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,890
When the fog finally lifted,

10
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,230
I found

11
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,370
I got lost.

12
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,840
To my surprise,

13
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,150
a guy

14
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,540
suddenly came to me

15
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,650
and insisted on giving me the lamp.

16
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,540
Stop there.

17
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm here.

18
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,390
You...

19
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,550
You asked me to stop?

20
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:49,250
How dare you speak to me like that?

21
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,780
You're so like him.

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,250
You're really like him.

23
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,079
Like whom?

24
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,390
Like the city governor?

25
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:55,810
Wait.

26
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,740
What do you mean?

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,790
Give this

28
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,810
to Lord Ren Shique.

29
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,850
Why should I...

30
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,000
He asked me to give this to Ren Shique.

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,590
I questioned him

32
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,450
why I should do it.

33
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,610
Then he just disappeared.

34
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,430
How come there is someone

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,430
exactly like Ren Shique?

36
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,860
People are getting ruder and ruder.

37
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,870
Nowadays,

38
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,810
nobody respects me.

39
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,860
Looks like you saw

40
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,270
the noblest person in the world just now.

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,590
How come

42
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,340
your tone of voice is exactly like that person's?

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,020
In my city,

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,570
there should be no others

45
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,280
who disrespect me anymore.

46
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,090
The imperial censor alone

47
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:50,690
is so difficult to deal with.

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,970
Ren Shique.

49
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,010
You're responsible

50
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,010
for protecting

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,030

The fog has lifted.

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,760
The sun shows up.

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,160
Go away, go away.

56
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,410
You're so naughty.

57
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,140
The next time the Heavenly Dog eats the moon,

58
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,130
the Dog will come to the mortal world and eat you too.

59
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,140
Let's go.

62
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,370
The Heavenly Dog will eat the moon.

63
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,370
W-W-Well.

64
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,010
Qingzhou was in danger in the past few days.

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,769
It was His Lordship

66
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,740
who saved everyone in the city.

67
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:24,730
But...

68
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,860
Everyone in the city

69
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,940
only remembers that the moon was covered by the dark fog.

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,290
They didn't thank His Lordship at all.

71
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,050
His Lordship always keeps a low profile when doing good deeds.

72
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,280
So oftentimes, no one in Qingzhou City

73
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,370
is aware of what His Lordship did for them.

74
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,909
Because of the phenomenon of the Heavenly Dog eating the moon,

75
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,890
the Qingzhou City was in the dark all the time.

76
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,890
Everyone will always be afraid that'll happen again.

77
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,100
To be honest,

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,520
when the dark fog covered the moon,

79
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,860
I was so s-s-scared.

80
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,060
Let me tell you.

81
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,290
Well...

82
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,700
W-W-Why

83
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,570
was the dark fog called Heavenly Dog?

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,120
Because

85
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,320
t-t-the dark fog

86
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,590
ate like a dog.

How dare you call me a dog?

90
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,390
The moon phases will be complete only when all the nine moon phases are reinstated.

91
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,080
But now only eight moon phases are reinstated.

92
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,590
Then I will destroy myself

93
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,370
so that the ninth moon phase

94
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,110
will always be absent.

95
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,100
Then the balance of Yin and Yang in the world will be broken.

96
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,260
The tides will come in an disorderly manner.

97

Do you know

115
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,890
what was the thing I was the unhappiest about

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,440
after I saw those scary things?

117
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,400
What was it?

118
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,800
Well, it was that

119
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,940
no matter how much trouble I encountered in my life,

120
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,800
I couldn't drown my sorrows,

121
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,440
or cry aloud,

122
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,930
or feel down and get sick.

123
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,230
Didn't you say you found your talisman

124
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,230
when you just arrived in Qingzhou?

125
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,090
Now,

126
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,659
you can drink as much as you want to.

127
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,960
You can cry whenever you want

128
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,620
and do whatever you want to do.

129

He's here anyway.

Whatever demons come to you,

131
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,890
you don't have to be afraid.

132
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,659
If things were that simple,

133
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,450
it would be great.

134
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,450
Why did His Lordship

look so worried today?

136
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,120
Look at you.

137
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,120
In the past,

138
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,330
you hid yourself where others couldn't find you out of fear

139
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,790
and you were very careful.

140
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,960
Now you two are a couple.

141
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,900
How come you still do the same?

142
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,030
Because

I saw something scary.

But don't worry.

162
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,270
Don't be afraid.

163
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,830
It's not a big deal.

164
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not afraid.

165
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,640
I'm hugging you

166

Don't worry.

168
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,700
I'll protect you from now on.

169
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,350
I can't be afraid.

170
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,880
I shouldn't let

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,600
His Lordship worry about me.

172
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,840
I shouldn't let him worry about me.

173
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,170
Why are you still following me?

174
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,920
How many times have I told you?

175
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,790
Stop following me.

176
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,090
You've become a renegade immortal.

177

178
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
still have to make a wish on the moon?

I'm going to Imperial Censor's Mansion.

180

Do you know who lives there?

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,290
If I tell you,

182
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,360
you'll be scared to death.

183

Then...

184
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,940
Why are you going to

188

You look so drunk.

189
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,760
Aren't you afraid he'll scold you for that?

190
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,610
So you're a renegade immortal who can speak.

191
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,350
And you have a beautiful voice.

192
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,410
Let me see what you look like.

193
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,560
I didn't expect you to be such a handsome renegade immortal.

194
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,840
Why didn't you come to me earlier?

195
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,530
Now I'm looking at you

196
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,700
and I feel...

197
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
You look a bit like...

198
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,020
Like...

199
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,910
This is

200
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,120
the first thing you want to do?

201
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,280
You even wanted to flirt with a renegade immortal.

202
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,260
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

203
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,300
Yun Zhaoyan.

204
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,060
Were you

205
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,550
possessed by a renegade immortal again last night?

206
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,000
Why did you go into my inner hall without permission again?

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,860
I...

208
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,800
I...

209
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,160
Why am I here?

210
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,520
You've changed.

211
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,450
In the past, when you slept here,

212
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,150
you were so happy.

213
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,990
But now,

214
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,320
you just panicked.

215
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,250
Could it be that

216
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,900
you came across a handsome renegade immortal on the street

217
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,520
so you wanted to be in love with him instead of me?

218
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,010
I...

219
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,530
I...

220
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,640
I really don't remember anything.

221
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,430
Last night,

222
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,600
I was in the morgue.

223
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,830
All right.

224
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,640
You were drunk last night.

225
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,980
And you kept asking

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,530
the renegade immortal to stop following you.

227
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,290
I was drunk?

228
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,030
Last night,

229
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,390
did I scare others again?

230
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,420
Thanks to me,

231
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,450
I was with you and I brought you back.

232
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,150
Fortunately, you were there.

233
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,050
How was I

234
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,460
last night?

235
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,120
Last night,

236
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,750
I felt so bad.

237
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,060
You used all kinds of methods

238
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,270
to see

239
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,210
if I could resist the temptation.

240
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,290
My Lord.

241
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,050
Can I drink the tea in your hand?

242
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,360
Wake up.

243
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,370
Zhaoyan.

244
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,010
Zhaoyan.

245
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,390
My Lord.

246
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,690
Don't leave me.

247
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,070
If you leave,

248
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,050
I will

249
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,420
miss you very much.

250
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,240
Although we don't know

251
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,070
what will happen in the future...

252
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,760
So last night,

253
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,280
I was being weird again.

254
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,270
You played so many tricks.

255
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,060
I almost...

256
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,790
You almost...

257
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,780
I...

258
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,040
Forget it.

259
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,320
Get up and get dressed.

260
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,710
I didn't

261
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,450
do anything improper last night, right?

262
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,770
Yun... Yun Zhaoyan?

263
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,900
She just came out of His Lordship's room.

264
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,770
Did they...

265
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,280
T-T-This... Bei Wu! Bei Wu!

266
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,410
B-B-Bei Wu!

267
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,370
B-B-Bei Wu, Bei Wu.

268
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,130
Listen.

269
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,860
I just saw...

270
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,330
What's going on?

271
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,250
Lord Xie has been transferred from Imperial Censor's Mansion.

272
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,810
W-W-What?

273
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,460
He's been transferred from Imperial Censor's Mansion?

274
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,450
I was under Governor's order

275
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,800
to come to Imperial Censor's Mansion to assist Imperial Censor.

276
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,470
Now my mission has been completed.

277
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,530
I should leave now.

278
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,150
Lord Xie.

279
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,710
The other day I heard

280
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,530
that Guigui was going to retire.

281
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,430
Now...

282
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,780
Now you're leaving too.

283
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,220
G-G-Guigui?

284
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,540
Isn't he still a young boy?

285
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,490
Why is he retiring?

286
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,480
Anyway,

287
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,720
all good things will come to an end.

288
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,200
Don't be too sad.

289
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,160
We will

290
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,569
see each other again.

291
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,860
[Order]

292
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,440
Lord Xie...

293
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,910
L-L-Lord...

294
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,980
L-L-Lord Xie...

295
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,540
He's just left.

296
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,860
This...

297
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,170
Yun...Yun Zhaoyan first...

298
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,610
Now Lord X-X-Xie has also left.

299
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,740
Life is so unpredictable.

300
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,820
Are you done?

301
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,860
Lord Xie is going to Governor's Mansion.

302
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,390
He's not leaving Qingzhou.

303
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,770
G-G-Governor's Mansion?

304
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,610
Where do you think he's going?

305
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,340
You look ignorant all the time.

306
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,950
G-G-Governor's Mansion?

307
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,240
[Governor's Mansion]

308
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,730
Xie Guichen.

309
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,670
There's something

310
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,040
I must make clear

311
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,700
between us.

312
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,150
Okay.

313
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,190
You...

314
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,020
Look at you.

315
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,170
What did you do to Qingqing

316
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,290
to make her so crazy about you?

317
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,180
Today,

318
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,190
I came to deal with this.

319
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:36,820
Go ahead.

320
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,320
Since antiquity, a person's spouse

321
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,250
has been chosen by their parents and elder brothers.

322
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,650
I want to let Gu Qing

323
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,410
be my lawfully wedded wife.

324
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,830
So today,

325
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,850
I came to ask for your consent

326
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,450
and propose to Gu Qing.

327
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,550
Of all the women I know, Gu Qing

328
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,610
is the only woman that is so determined to follow her heart.

329
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,250
I grew up with no one to rely on.

330
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,800
Later I lived for others' will.

331
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,560
Before I met her,

332
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
I didn't know

333
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,740
being cared

334
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,770
and being loved

335
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,800
could bring me so much warmth.

336
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,820
In the past, I only knew that a gentleman would die for a bosom friend.

337
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,730
But now,

338
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,360
I'll always try my best

339
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,600
to make sure that I won't die

340
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:45,880
because

341
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,040
I'll protect Gu Qing forever.

342
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,140
Governor, please allow us to get married.

343
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,320
Today,

344
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,400
I won't speak to you as the city governor.

345
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,860
I'll say something to you

346
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,420
as her elder brother

347
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,210
and on behalf of her father.

348
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,610
After you marry Qingqing,

349
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,040
you must be very obedient to her.

350
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,080
Even if she is spoiled

351
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,540
bossy,

352
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,380
and irrational,

353
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,970
you should stay calm

354
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,090
and not scold her.

355
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,010
You have to let her know

356
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,450
that you will never abandon her

357
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,160
and that you'll always be there for her.

358
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:08,960
Otherwise,

359
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,790
she won't let you off.

360
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,180
Neither will I!

361
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,720
My Qingqing...

362
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:33,440
No one will whip me anymore.

363
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,930
My brother-in-law.

364
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,940
Gu Qing.

365
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,210
I will never let go of your hand again.

366
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,750
The moon phase is so changeable.

367
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,950
I don't know

368
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,370
how long the waning moon will last.

369
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,440
Kanxu.

370
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,400
What's the date today?

371
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,580
It's almost the end of the month.

372
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,100
So,

373
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,340
the moon phase will be its last quarter tomorrow night.

374
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,260
Yes.

375
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,010
Are you still worried about

376
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,580
the vacant position in Soul Collecting Lamp?

377
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,560
Actually, you don't have to be so worried.

378
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,570
Qingzhou City was still fine

379
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,970
in the past ten years when the moon couldn't be seen.

380
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,500
The city won't be doomed just because of a lack of a moon phase...

381
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,000
Kanxu.

382
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,430
You actually know it better than I do.

383
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,300
Although the moon couldn't be seen in Qingzhou in the past,

384
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,760
but the moon phases were in the mortal world.

385
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,160
But now the last quarter of the moon phase

386
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,210
will be incomplete because Han Ying

387
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,340
destroyed himself.

388
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,990
The mortal world

389
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,620
will definitely witness disasters.

390
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,680
The tides will come in an disorderly manner.

391
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,880
The cycle of the seasons will be broken.

392
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,600
You know that day

393
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,570
will come sooner or later, right?

394
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,860
Have you

395
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,750
made the decision?

396
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,540
God.

397
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,770
Please don't do that.

398
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,140
If you do that, you and Miss Zhaoyan

399
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,810
will be separated forever.

400
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,220
[Governor's Mansion]

401
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,210
Governor.

402
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,640
How's the situation in the coastal areas?

403
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,300
Since the eclipse of the moon,

404
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,870
the tides have been in an disorderly manner.

405
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,210
The coastal villages have suffered severe disasters.

406
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,090
Tens of thousands of people got homeless.

407
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,240
I'm afraid the refugees will

408
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,300
arrive in Qingzhou City in a few days.

409
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,020
Besides him,

410
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,700
who else can protect Qingzhou?

411
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,550
Miss Zhaoyan.

412
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,490
What are you looking at?

413
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,930
Good question.

414
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,470
What's up there?

415
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,600
Why does His Lordship like lying in the tree?

416
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,590
After Kui Ji jumped into the Soul Collecting Lamp,

417
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,250
God was lonely and helpless.

418
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,910
God was very naughty in his childhood.

419
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,070
He reused to stay at one place quietly.

420
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,530
He also didn't like to get along with other immortals in Heavenly Realm.

421
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,340
Surprisingly, he liked to

422
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,980
sleep on the branches of me, an old laurel tree.

423
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,730
He also liked to race against a rabbit.

424
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,880
Later,

425
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,430
the Heaven Emperor secretly ordered me and Wu Tu,

426
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,710
a tree and a rabbit,

427
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,100
to serve him.

428
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,530
Maybe it's because of this childhood habit of his.

429
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,840
Now,

430
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,770
God still likes to lie in the tree.

431
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,670
You followed His Lordship to the mortal world.

432
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,660
What about the rabbit Wu Tu?

433
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,800
In order to protect God,

434
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,490
Wu Tu died in Heavenly Palace.

435
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,440
I see.

436
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,620
If Wu Tu

437
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,050
had come to the mortal world and gone through difficulties,

438
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,380
he would be a handsome boy

439
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,970
just like you, right?

440
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,900
Not really.

441
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,100
Last time, you told me about His Lordship

442
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,820
under the tree, right?

443
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,040
Yes.

444
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,220
How time flies.

445
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
You and His Lordship have been through so many things.

446
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,040
By the way,

447
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,790
why did you

448
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,020
ask me to see you here?

449
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,780
I

450
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,010
want to ask about Soul Collecting Lamp.

451
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,540
Soul Collecting Lamp?

452
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,640
The other day I saw

453
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,730
His Lordship look sad on the city wall.

454
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:45,550
Then I knew

455
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,090
things are not over yet.

456
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,050
Guigui, please tell me

457
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,370
that there is one renegade immortal of the moon phase

458
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,630
which is always absent in Soul Collecting Lamp,

459
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,020
what will happen?

460
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,280
The tides will be in an disorderly manner?

461
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,740
The cycle of the four seasons will be broken?

462
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
If one of the moon phases is always missing,

463
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,300
the mortal world will be doomed.

464
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,110
Then

465
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,950
when will the moon phase

466
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,150
of Han Ying appear?

467
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,380
On the 30th of this month,

468
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,540
which is tomorrow.

469
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,050
Has His Lordship

470
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,370
made his decision?

471
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,010
Yun Zhaoyan.

472
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:26,210
I hope this place can be your shelter.

473
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,100
And from now on,

474
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,740
I'll be the last quarter of the moon and protect you.

475
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,550
My Lord.

476
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,220
I promised to protect you.

477
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,130
I don't know if letting you go now

478
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,630
is a kind of protection for you.

479
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,780
If I decide to leave,

480
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,970
how should I say goodbye to her?

481
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,010
My Lord.

482
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,600
The flowers are blooming.

483
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,060
My Lord.

484
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,670
You've finally come.

485
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,740
I don't want to see

486
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,630
you marry anyone else.

487
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,770
My Lord.

488
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,500
Has she felt that I'm thinking about her?

489
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:12,860
My Lord.

490
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,850
I'm here.

491
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,490
It's rare for you

492
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,810
to hear my call so soon.

493
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,220
I just want to see

494
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,910
what new trouble you can make.

495
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,120
My Lord.

496
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,020
Let's

497
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,940
walk around in Qingzhou tomorrow.

498
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,030
Why do you suddenly want to walk around in Qingzhou tomorrow?

499
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,130
Because

500
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,150
you have to

501
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,500
say goodbye to Qingzhou City.

502
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,240
You know everything?

503
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,280
There is one moon phase missing.

504
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,370
And you are the master of the moon.

505
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,000
You should hold the Soul Collecting Lamp

506
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,930
and let the moon phases return

507
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,150
so that you can ensure the stability of Qingzhou City.

508
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,390
But...

509
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,560
You should do that.

510
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,890
You are the talisman for the whole Qingzhou City.

511
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,350
I'll also be protected by you, right?

512
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,880
No one will whip me anymore.

513
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,610
Brother.

514
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:11,850
Qing.

515
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:13,730
Why are you here?

516
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,429
You're going to get married. Why were you eavesdropping?

517
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,389
You're like a child.

518
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,810
Brother.

519
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,520
I'm sorry, Brother.

520
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,350
Governor, you may rest assured

521
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,139
that I will never

522
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,790
let go of her hand again.

523
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,199
My good brother-in-law.

524
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,690
Gu Qing.

525
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,590
Hello, Lord Xie.

526
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,570
Lord Xie, are you waiting for Princess here?

527
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:14,970
I...

528
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,940
Who said I was waiting for her?

529
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,140
I was just passing by.

530
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,840
Just passing by?

531
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,960
Okay. Please be honest with us.

532
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,220
Princess is so spoiled and bossy.

533
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,630
How did you manage to win her love?

534
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,560
Who said she was spoiled and bossy?

535
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,740
She is not that kind of person.

536
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,800
You have no idea how scary she is.

537
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,130
When she first came to Qingzhou City,

538
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,380
She made us terrified.

539
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:40,750
She is

540
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,060
sometimes dramatic.

541
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,650
But that's because she has been given important responsibilities

542
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,970
since childhood. She has to be like that.

543
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,170
Otherwise, how could she protect herself?

544
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,030
Besides,

545
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,600
if she were as terrible as you said,

546
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,920
why had she never bullied you?

547
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,360
Did she ever bully you?

548
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,900
Aunts, what are you doing?

549
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,320
Mr. Governor.

550
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:05,890
Hello, Xie.

551
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,840
Mr. Governor.

552
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,070
Are you here to see me?

553
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:09,860
I...

554
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,730
I'm not.

555
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,660
I just...

556
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,040
I just want to see the spring scenery in the garden.

557
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,190
No, the summer scenery.

558
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:22,890
Okay, the summer scenery.

559
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,220
You even brought summer flowers with you.

560
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,180
Are you giving them to Qingqing?

561
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,320
I just plucked them on the path.

562
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,800
If you like them,

563
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,050
here you are.

564
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,130
So these flowers...

565
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:44,990
Actually, I...

566
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,600
Wait.

567
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,440
This...

568
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,190
Give them to me.

569
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,270
Okay.
