[Moon Love]

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,460
[Episode 10]

4
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,650
My Lord?

5
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,730
It really is you.

6
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,250
I was just about to come to you,

7
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,180
and here you are.

8
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,960
I have so much to tell you.

9
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,770
Enough.

10
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,259
I lowered myself to come here

11
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,150
because I have serious business.

12
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,960
Was there anything unusual

13
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,920
at tonight's lantern fair?

14
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,360
After all,

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,420
since you came to Qingzhou City,

16
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,079
renegade immortals from all over the immortal world

17
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,210
have gathered here.

18
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,720
My Lord,

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,160
they really have...

20
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,290
Don't interrupt me.

21
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,610
You watched the lantern fair tonight.

22
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,170
Do you think the lanterns were brighter,

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,970
or the moon

24
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,280
you saw as a child

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,520
was brighter?

26
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,079
Although I used to like

27
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,680
to pray to the moon as a child,

28
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,760
I had an eye disease and

29
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,130
never truly saw the moon.

30
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,650
By the way, My Lord,

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,400
aren't you tired of

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,640
standing at the top of that tree?

33
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,450
This is just the position and distance

34
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,510
that should exist between you and me.

35
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,750
Fine.

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,610
I know you're noble.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,010
But...

38
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,570
there are too many mosquitoes and bugs there.

39
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,170
You haven't answered my question yet.

40
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,570
How was the lantern fair?

41
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,079
Actually,

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,460
we didn't make it to the lantern fair.

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,960
You didn't make it?

44
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,079
Go on.

45
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,600
We didn't make it to the lantern fair.

46
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,079
so we just went for a walk by the Mirror Lake.

47
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,240
You went for a walk?

48
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,120
But there was a renegade immortal

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,380
who kept following me.

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,800
I had to pretend everything was fine.

51
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,000
It was tough.

52
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,070
I didn't even have the chance to have a good chat

53
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,150
with Brother Xie.

54
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,760
So,

55
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,390
this renegade immortal was really out of line.

56
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,730
Extremely out of line.

57
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,320
I had to make an excuse to leave.

58
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,070
Originally,

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,850
I wanted to go to Imperial Censor's Mansion to find you.

60
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,170
After thinking about it,

61
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,399
I decided it was too late

62
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,640
and I shouldn't bother you.

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
So, I came back.

64
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,890
Even if you had come,

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,650
I might not have helped you.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,390
But you're here now.

67
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,570
Thank you so much.

68
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,280
Now,

69
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,409
there should be no renegade immortals around.

70
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,070
I can finally get a good sleep.

71
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,200
I came

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,320
to ask you about the lantern fair,

73
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,610
not to put your mind at ease.

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
I know.

75
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,110
But as long as you're here,

76
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
I feel reassured.

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,720
I never expected you

78
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,750
to have such leisure and elegance.

79
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,080
It's so ugly.

80
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,080
Ugly?

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,830
But this flower was given to me by Brother Xie.

82
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,290
It's vibrant,

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,050
just like me.

84
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,480
So it's from Xie Zhihua.

85
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,720
Xie Zhihua?

86
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,560
Are you saying Brother Xie?

87
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,730
Why did you mention others

88
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,410
in such a beautiful scenery?

89
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,480
In my opinion,

90
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,800
the moonlight

91
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,740
is a hundred times more beautiful

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,430
than this flower.

93
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,010
Yes, indeed.

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,970
The moonlight tonight is truly beautiful.

95
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,490
My Lord,

96
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,140
could you accompany me

97
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,420
for a while longer to admire the moon?

98
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,650
Just for a while.

99
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,760
I came to ask you about the lantern fair.

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,210
Since you didn't see the lantern fair,

101
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,280
I came in vain.

102
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,370
You should rest.

103
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,470
I'm leaving.

104
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,680
The moonlight tonight

105
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,600
is truly beautiful.

106
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,770
It would have been nice to have a few more words with His Lordship.

107
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,930
At this late hour,

108
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,400
don't come to me, you renegade immortal!

109
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,320
Let me have a good sleep!

110
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,230
You...

111
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,000
You're a little fairy,

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,240
why did you make yourself look so frightening?

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,250
Leave me quickly.

114
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,600
I won't help you.

115
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,120
[Wanwan]

116
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,140
Love?

117
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,840
Do renegade immortals also fall in love?

118
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,800
When I see him,

119
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
time seems to slow down.

120
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,120
And my heart...

121
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,390
beats loudly.

122
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,000
Why does this feeling you describe

123
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,280
sound familiar?

124
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,320
It has been a whole night.

125
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,490
You still haven't finished talking about you and your sweetheart.

126
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,960
I'm going to Imperial Censor's Mansion.

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,320
Stay here in the morgue.

128
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,820
I'll figure out a way for you when I come back.

129
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm not running away.

130
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,080
I'm going to Imperial Censor's Mansion to work.

131
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,980
Do you dare to go in there?

132
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,120
At critical moments,

133
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,050
Imperial Censor is indeed useful.

134
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,670
[Lady Lan]

135
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,320
[Wanted]

136
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
She must be the witch

137
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,480
who came from Western Region before, isn't she?

138
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,120
I heard she's the person who finds spouses

139
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,760
for deceased young masters and misses

140
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,980
from wealthy families.

141
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,790
[Lost and Found]

142
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,730
She's a guest of honor of Old Madam Jia.

143
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,950
She is quite mysterious.

144
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,240
[Wanted]

145
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,440
That's an influential household

146
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,690
in Qingzhou City.

147
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,330
We can't afford to offend them.

148
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,240
[Qingbin Warehouse]

149
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,130
You didn't get scared away by His Lordship?

150
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,840
You said before

151
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,910
that your grandmother wants to help you choose a spouse.

152
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,540
Do you not want to follow her arrangement?

153
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,690
Are you still thinking about your little sweetheart?

154
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,130
But his family's property has been confiscated,

155
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,000
and he has been banished for ten years.

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,400
How can you be sure that he will come back?

157
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,160
Besides,

158
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,140
your grandmother's family is highly influential.

159
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,290
How can I persuade them?

160
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,440
I now work for Imperial Censor's Mansion.

161
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,370
If I go there and say something absurd,

162
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,410
it will cause trouble for His Lordship.

163
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,260
Don't...

164
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,480
Don't do this.

165
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,680
You look even scarier when you act cute.

166
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,730
Doesn't your heart belong to your little sweetheart?

167
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,930
How can you have improper thoughts towards His Lordship?

168
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,040
What nonsense are you talking about?

169
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,210
I don't feel that way

170
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,410
about His Lordship.

171
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,560
Alright.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,930
It really is difficult.

173
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,690
Let me think about it.

174
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:36,840
Yun Zhaoyan.

175
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,640
Yun Zhaoyan.

176
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,170
You...

177
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,940
My Lord!

178
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,520
In broad daylight,

179
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,220
what are you up to this time?

180
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,330
A renegade immortal came just now.

181
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,560
And now,

182
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,400
she might have been scared off by you.

183
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,720
There couldn't possibly

184
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,280
be a renegade immortal in my territory.

185
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,130
There was.

186
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,000
That renegade immortal

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,530
claimed to be Miss Wanwan from the Jia family.

188
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,960
The Jia family in Qingzhou City?

189
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,340
You can't do this!

190
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,320
Yun Zhaoyan.

191
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,520
How dare you speak to me like this?

192
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,550
I...

193
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,570
No!

194
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,530
You can't have improper thoughts!

195
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,000
Fine.

196
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,480
I promise you.

197
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,590
Did a renegade immortal just appear?

198
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,300
No matter what she said to you,

199
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,570
you must not agree.

200
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,800
But I...

201
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,450
The Jia family...

202
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,280
has indeed been acting strangely recently.

203
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,240
I've also heard some rumors.

204
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,480
However,

205
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,330
you can't meddle in their affairs.

206
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,330
My Lord,

207
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,320
did you come to me just to say this?

208
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,290
I...

209
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,340
I came to see

210
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,960
if you are too idle

211
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:16,720
and if I should give you more tasks.

212
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,040
I'm not idle.

213
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
I still have a lot of things to do.

214
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,680
I'm resting tomorrow.

215
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,730
Don't assign me any tasks.

216
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,460
Then it will depend on your performance.

217
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,710
How should I explain to Wanwan?

218
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,180
[Jia's Mansion]

219
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,540
[Old Madam Jia]

220
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,880
Old Madam.

221
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,240
We stored a miniature portrait of your deceased granddaughter

222
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,520
in the core of this jade pendant.

223
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,010
We will place it somewhere in Qingzhou City.

224
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,120
Any eligible man

225
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,880
who finds the jade pendant

226
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,700
can marry your granddaughter.

227
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,850
Thank you.

228
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,230
I hope you can find someone

229
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,130
who can understand her.

230
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
It seems Miss Wanwan is a bit anxious.

231
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,040
I will remake this jade pendant

232
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,140
and get this matter done for you as soon as possible.

233
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,790
What did Miss Zhaoyan do

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,970
that made you so angry?

235
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,370
She never has a day without making trouble.

236
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,530
Something may happen to the Jia family recently.

237
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,460
Send more people

238
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,770
to keep a close watch.

239
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,000
I've heard about it too.

240
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,400
The Jia family invited the witch from Western Region to Qingzhou.

241
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,560
Yun Zhaoyan said

242
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,160
that Old Madam Jia's granddaughter,

243
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,490
Wanwan, has come to her.

244
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,000
So, Old Madam Jia's granddaughter

245
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,860
is actually a renegade immortal?

246
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,130
The Jia family is one of the wealthiest families.

247
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,280
Old Madam Jia herself

248
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,450
is a heroic woman who has fought in battles.

249
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,330
But now,

250
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,130
they're actually believing in some witch from Western Region.

251
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,490
Those are just tricks.

252
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,080
Indeed.

253
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,470
We need to come up with an idea to completely eliminate

254
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,020
those decayed and contemptible tricks

255
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,760
like marriage arrangement with red threads.

256
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,850
The matter of the renegade immortal is something

257
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,370
that mortals simply cannot comprehend.

258
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,520
I'm afraid it won't be easy to handle.

259
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,260
But I think

260
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,360
Miss Zhaoyan

261
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,910
might be able to

262
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,100
help us with it.

263
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
But...

264
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,680
if she gets involved...

265
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,120
With you around,

266
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,010
Miss Zhaoyan will surely be fine.

267
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,800
Why don't you take this opportunity

268
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,050
to meet Old Madam Jia

269
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,370
and suggest her not to do it?

270
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,240
If she insists on it,

271
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,240
we can prepare in advance.

272
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,500
[Jia's Mansion]

273
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,400
Recently, some people

274
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,850
from the Western Region have come to Qingzhou City.

275
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,960
I heard that

276
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,520
they have some dealings with Jia's Mansion.

277
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,990
Old Madam Jia,

278
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,720
are you aware of this?

279
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,680
Imperial Censor, thank you for your concern.

280
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,640
It's a private matter of our family.

281
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,420
I will

282
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,400
handle it properly.

283
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,160
My Lord,

284
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,760
you don't need to worry.

285
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,160
You've always been reasonable.

286
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,920
Why would I worry?

287
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,170
It's just that...

288
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,230
"Concern can lead to confusion."

289
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,760
Old Madam,

290
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,030
please remember that.

291
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,400
Great tea.

292
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,480
It's a pity

293
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,000
that it was made with spring water

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
instead of fallen water.

295
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,450
It's not the right way.

296
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,920
It's a shame

297
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,300
to waste the good intentions of this tea.

298
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,080
Sorry to bother you.

299
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,410
I'll take my leave.

300
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,040
Take care, My Lord.

301
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,880
[Jia's Mansion]

302
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
[Jing Yao]

303
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,530
Wanwan.

304
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,090
I miss you so much.

305
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
You must be very lonely

306
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,040
up in heaven.

307
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,490
Don't worry.

308
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,080
I'll

309
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,770
come up with an idea.

310
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,110
Old Madam.

311
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:55,930
Old Madam.

312
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,690
There is someone claiming to be Jing Yao outside

313
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,720
asking to see you.

314
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,090
Why did he come back?

315
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,520
Old Madam,

316
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,000
I've returned from the border

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,410
and brought betrothal gifts

318
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,240
to ask for Wanwan's hand in marriage.

319
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,930
It has been ten years.

320
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,690
How has your family

321
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
been faring at the border?

322
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,240
In the second year at the border,

323
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
my parents fell ill and passed away.

324
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,490
They left my younger brother with me,

325
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,780
and he has found a job now.

326
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,710
We have managed to live relatively stably.

327
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,170
The Jing family was exiled

328
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,560
to the border and had its property confiscated back then.

329
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,360
Now that

330
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,550
the ten-year sentence is over,

331
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,400
you should

332
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,020
make plans

333
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,840
for a stable life.

334
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,160
Old Madam,

335
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,850
I promised Wanwan

336
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,780
that I would come back to marry her.

337
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,930
Wanwan

338
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,940
had fallen ill and passed away

339
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,090
three years after you left.

340
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,160
No.

341
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,560
No.

342
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,640
No.

343
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,200
You don't need to doubt me.

344
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,280
I wouldn't use the life of my own granddaughter

345
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,160
to deceive you.

346
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,120
Wanwan has been frail and sickly since childhood.

347
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,330
You know that.

348
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,770
Did...

349
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,060
Did she say anything before she passed away?

350
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,720
What she said

351
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,410
is none of your concern!

352
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,640
The Jia family has been loyal to the country for generations.

353
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,200
We can be considered

354
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,280
a reputable family.

355
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,720
Wanwan

356
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,090
was the only daughter of our Jia family.

357
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,520
Regardless of her current condition,

358
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,990
I won't allow her

359
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,490
to have any association with you,

360
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,280
whose background is stained!

361
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,040
No!

362
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,290
Old Madam.

363
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,370
I don't have any other intentions.

364
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,090
It's just that I made a vow with Wanwan.

365
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,130
Whether she is alive or dead,

366
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,840
I will never leave her.

367
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,570
Now that Wanwan has passed away,

368
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,520
I want to pay my respects to her.

369
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,640
You'd better give up.

370
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,530
The relationship

371
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,670
between you and Wanwan in the past

372
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,760
was nothing but childish talk without the consent

373
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,280
of parents and matchmakers.

374
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
In the future,

375
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,830
refrain from mentioning it

376
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,360
to avoid

377
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,050
tarnishing my granddaughter's reputation.

378
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,320
Old Madam.

379
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,560
I know,

380
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm from a humble family,

381
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,260
and I'm a sinner,

382
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,720
unworthy of Wanwan.

383
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,850
I have no other wishes,

384
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,420
just to see Wanwan once more.

385
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,950
Old Madam.

386
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,080
Old Madam!

387
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,840
Guards.

388
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,290
Drag him out

389
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:05,880
and lock him in the woodshed.

390
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,280
Old Madam!

391
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,800
Old Madam!

392
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,880
Wait for your punishment!

393
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,250
Old Madam.

394
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,400
Old Madam.

395
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,760
Since an old acquaintance has brought up the past engagement,

396
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,640
why don't we

397
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,320
take the initiative

398
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,210
and crush his wish?

399
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,580
Is everything

400
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,630
ready?

401
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,440
I've placed the jade pendant in Qingzhou City,

402
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,700
waiting for someone destined to find it.

403
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,130
Handle this for me properly,

404
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,360
and there will be a substantial reward.

405
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,880
Make sure

406
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,320
to act swiftly.

407
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,840
Wanwan,

408
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,770
didn't you say the jade pendant is by the broken bridge?

409
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,320
Why can't we find it?

410
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,800
Could it be

411
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,380
that the pendant has already been picked up?

412
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,250
Isn't that Brother Xie?

413
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,990
What does this mean?

414
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,970
Oh no.

415
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,360
Brother Xie!

416
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,640
Brother Xie!

417
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,680
Brother Xie was tied up by the jade pendant

418
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,720
and might be in trouble.

419
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,180
I have to find him quickly.

420
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,730
That's what happened.

421
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,880
I also asked Xu Xian and Bei Wu.

422
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,720
They said Brother Xie went to the city defense post

423
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,120
and hasn't returned.

424
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,670
He might have been trapped in Jia's Mansion

425
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,240
and manipulated into the arranged marriage.

426
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,930
My Lord!

427
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,280
Don't touch it.

428
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,460
You meddling in other people's affair was one thing,

429
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,480
but you also got a deputy censor of my Imperial Censor's Mansion into trouble.

430
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,230
I didn't want this to happen either.

431
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,320
Who would have known that Brother Xie happened

432
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,300
to pass by and picked up the jade pendant?

433
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,280
It's a heaven-sent match.

434
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,320
Isn't this a good thing?

435
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,870
My Lord,

436
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,610
now is not the time to be sarcastic.

437
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,150
You care about him a lot.

438
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,170
This is related to Wanwan.

439
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,630
I feel like I was the one

440
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,920
who got Brother Xie into trouble.

441
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,470
Miss Zhaoyan, don't worry.

442
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,570
His Lordship is also worrying about it.

443
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,170
Jia's Mansion affair is just a deceitful trick,

444
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,570
playing with deception.

445
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,160
My Lord,

446
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,120
are we going to the Jia's Mansion now?

447
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,160
There's no evidence for this matter.

448
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,890
We can only investigate first.

449
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,960
My Lord.

450
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,900
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

451
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,590
Ren Shique,

452
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,880
I was looking for you.

453
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,950
Princess, what can I do for you?

454
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,040
Rumors have been

455
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,890
circulating all day in the city.

456
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,450
What's going on?

457
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,480
Did you make mischief again?

458
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,600
What does this have to do with you

459
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
that made you come here personally?

460
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,360
I don't think Governor's Mansion

461
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,550
should meddle in it for now.

462
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,960
I am the Princess.

463
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
Of course I should meddle in.

464
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,040
Princess,

465
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,360
rest assured,

466
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,360
with His Lordship here,

467
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,240
everything will be fine in Qingzhou City.

468
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Well then,

469
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,920
if you need anything,

470
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,200
remember to come to me anytime.

471
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
Sure.

472
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,920
By the way,

473
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,600
is Imperial Censor's Mansion

474
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,000
off tomorrow?

475
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,520
I have something to attend to

476
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,050
and need to borrow someone.

477
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,630
Who do you want to borrow?

478
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,130
Well...

479
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,400
That...

480
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,290
That one whose last name is Xie.

481
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,170
He's quite skilled.

482
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,880
Just recently, a batch of new guards arrived

483
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,200
at our Governor's Mansion.

484
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,930
I want to call him to train them.

485
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,640
Deputy Censor Xie has not been at the mansion recently.

486
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,550
Where did he go?

487
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,930
If you don't tell me,

488
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,160
I'll find out myself.

489
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,070
There's no one

490
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,920
I can't find in the city.

491
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,660
Princess.

492
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,250
[Jia's Mansion]

493
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,760
My Lady.

494
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,290
I'm sick because I drink medicine all day.

495
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,950
I don't want to drink it today.

496
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,480
My Lady, you have been frail since childhood.

497
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,600
The doctor said, apart from needing rest,

498
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,420
you also need to take medicine every day for recuperation.

499
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,500
Leave it there.

500
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,960
I'll drink it in a moment.

501
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
By doing this, you'll kill the tree.

502
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm up here.

503
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,550
Who are you?

504
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,400
My name is Jing Yao.

505
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,210
It's from "This scene is like in a dream.

506
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,250
Isn't it a prosperous era like in Yao's time?"

507
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,640
My name is Wanwan.

508
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,800
It's from "Finding a place where no one is around,

509
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,200
and tying our hair into concentric knots."

510
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:31,370
[Jia's Mansion]

511
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,760
It looks like

512
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,410
the Jia family has already prepared everything for Wanwan.

513
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,810
My Lord!

514
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,790
Why are you going to the next door?

515
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,480
Never mind.

516
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,780
Rescuing Brother Xie is the priority.

517
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,410
Come in with me,

518
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,800
Miss Zhaoyan.

519
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,760
You must be Miss Yun,

520
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,240
who has been with

521
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,770
the Imperial Censor recently, aren't you?

522
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,850
I heard that

523
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,890
there was a strange girl who came to

524
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,890
Imperial Censor's Mansion in Qingzhou.

525
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,320
I'm originally from Qingzhou.

526
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,640
I just returned to live here.

527
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,400
There's nothing unusual about me.

528
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,110
I'm here

529
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,240
to ask you

530
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,890
if my colleague is at your mansion.

531
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,760
Miss,

532
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,020
where did you get this jade pendant from?

533
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,400
To be honest,

534
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,890
today, a colleague of mine accidentally found

535
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,760
this jade pendant in the bushes on the outskirts of the city.

536
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,220
What's your relationship with that person?

537
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,560
He is Lord Xie, my colleague

538
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,040
who works with me at Imperial Censor's Mansion

539
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,100
as a deputy censor.

540
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,170
Old Madam,

541
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,640
please let the person who found the jade pendant go.

542
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,520
By doing so,

543
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,450
you will also be letting Wanwan go.

544
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,970
Miss,

545
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,070
how did you know about

546
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,490
Wanwan's feelings?

547
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,040
Miss Wanwan told me herself.

548
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,310
She also wants me to convey to you

549
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,480
that she has already set her heart on someone,

550
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,320
and that person

551
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,050
is Jing Yao, who lives next door to the Jia family.

552
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,560
You were sent by Jing Yao to persuade me!

553
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,310
No, Old Madam.

554
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,160

556
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,480
Take this girl to the backyard

557

and lock her up!

please listen to me!

00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,540
What I said is true! Trust me!

561
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,010
Let go of me!

562

Old Madam,

00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,860
the auspicious time is approaching.

564
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,200
Let go of me!

565
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,760
Let me out!

566
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,120
Wanwan,

567
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,800
do you have a way to let me out?

568
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,640
What should I do?

569
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,920
Are you okay?

570
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,410
Could it be...

571
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,240
the ceremony has already begun?

572
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,360
Brother Xie?

573
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:17,510
♫In the cold moonlight, I'm willing to go to you♫

574
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,719
♫In the dim worldly affairs, my heart warms for one person♫

575
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:30,070
♫I'd rather endure numerous hardships with all my courage♫

576
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,480
♫I won't retreat, I'll swallow the regrets♫

577
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,530
Miss, do you want some flowers?

578
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,960
My Lord, do you want some flowers?

579
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,560
Tonight is the Dragon Boat Lantern Festival.

580
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,250
Buy a bouquet of flowers for your beloved girl.

581
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,750
[Zuiyin Tavern]

582
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,980
Princess,

583
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,770
isn't this inappropriate?

584
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,170
What do you know?

585
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,000
If you know yourself and your enemy well, you'll never be defeated.

586
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,480
I want to see

587
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,630
what means

588
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,250
that Yun Zhaoyan used

589
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,470
to win me.

590
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,900
Let's go.

591
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,930
My Lord,

592
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,720
I wonder if Old Madam Jia listened to

593
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,690
what you said today.

594
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,790
Old Madam Jia loves her granddaughter very much.

595
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,000
We don't know

596
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,720
what the outcome will be.

597
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,470
You can't do this!

598
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,710
Yun Zhaoyan.

599
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
How dare you speak to me like this?

600
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,830
I...

601
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,080
No!

602
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,050
You can't have improper thoughts!

603
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,310
My Lord!

604
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,730
Don't touch it.

605
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,720
You meddling in other people's affair was one thing,

606
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,440
but you also got a deputy censor of my Imperial Censor's Mansion into trouble.

607
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,440
I didn't want this to happen either.

608
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,930
Who would have known that Brother Xie

609
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,370
happened to pass by

610
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,010
and picked up the jade pendant?

611
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,550
It's a heaven-sent match.

612
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,630
Isn't this a good thing?

613
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,240
My Lord,

614
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,600
now is not the time to be sarcastic.

615
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,450
You care about him a lot.

616
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,340
This is related to Wanwan.

617
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,170
I feel like I was the one
who got Brother Xie into trouble.

618
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,400
It seems that what happened in Jia's Mansion

619
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,660
has already spread throughout the city.

620
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,050
These people

621
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,050
are all eager to seize

622
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,780
even the slightest advantage.

623
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,210
Our Imperial Censor hates

624
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,600
these superstitious methods the most.

625
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,620
Earlier, we were reminded

626
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,930
to be vigilant,

627
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,400
just to avoid the rumor from disturbing the people's minds.

628
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,320
But unexpectedly,

629
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,360
within half a day, it has already spread throughout the city.
