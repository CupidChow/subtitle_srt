[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

5
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,160
I've been so tired from fighting bandits these past two days that I've even lost weight.

6
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,250
I need to replenish myself today.

7
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,580
Your…

8
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,000
Your Highness.

9
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,710
Why are you here?

10
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,540
You are a guard in front of Ren Shique's hall,

11
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,890
aren't you?

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,079
My name is Xu Xian.

13
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,210
What can I do for you?

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm here to ask

15
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,550
if there's any news about Yun Zhaoyan.

16
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,490
There's no news about Miss Yun for now.

17
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,680
Alright.

18
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,079
When there is news,

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,650
remember to report it to Governor's Mansion.

20
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,829
Princess, you came at a bad time.

21
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,510
Lord Xie just went out on patrol.

22
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,700
He just went out?

23
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,730
What a pity.

24
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,400
By the way,

25
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,560
when he comes back,

26
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,760
tell him that

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,800
he still owes me something.

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,110
Make sure he comes to Governor's Mansion to return it to me personally.

29
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,230
Don't forget.

30
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,090
Imperial Censor's Mansion is really strange.

31
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,920
One escaped,

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,190
and the other one is hiding.

33
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,140
Lord Xie.

34
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
My Lord?

35
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,200
The Princess has left.

36
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,410
Lord Xie, why are you doing this?

37
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,670
Everyone in Qingzhou knows

38
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,510
about you and the Princess,

39
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,980
it's being talked about everywhere.

40
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,810
I don't understand

41
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,530
why you rejected the Princess.

42
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,660
The Princess is frank and sincere.

43
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,430
I'm not her suitable match.

44
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,380
What are you talking about?

45
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,600
Isn't it enough that the two of you are in love?

46
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,240
I'll take my leave.

47
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,330
My Lord,

48
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,350
My Lord, are you really going to officiate the wedding

49
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,330
for the granddaughter of the Chai family today?

50
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,350
Is everything arranged over there?

51
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,220
Of course. The Chai family is extremely grateful.

52
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,980
You must be

53
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,420
very puzzled by this matter, right?

54
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,350
Your behavior is indeed unusual.

55
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,140
But if it's for the one you love,

56
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,460
it's only natural.

57
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,190
It's natural,

58
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,020
but I cannot enjoy such feelings

59
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,280
as others do.

60
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,320
God, what's wrong with you?

61
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,440
Before, the more I advised you

62
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,460
not to reveal your identity as God Taiyin,

63
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,400
the more you acted against the heavens;

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,620
the more I warned you about the distinction between mortals and immortals,

65
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,560
the more you ran towards Miss Zhaoyan.

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,690
Now, I'm willing to bless you two,

67
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,150
yet you're hesitant instead.

68
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,310
It's actually Miss Zhaoyan who's truly brave.

69
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,260
She appears timid on the surface,

70
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,020
but when it comes to critical moments,

71
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,420
she dares to take a venture wherever she is.

72
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,510
[Chai's Mansion]

73
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,500
It's quite unusual.

74
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,430
Today, the person who's gonna officiate

75
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,750
the wedding ceremony is Imperial Censor.

76
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,510
Please come in.

77
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,230
But he

78
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,560
doesn't seem that intimidating, does he?

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,560
However,

80
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,540
why is the wedding, which should have taken place at the groom's house,

81
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,400
being held at the Chai's Mansion?

82
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,409
I heard

83
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,520
it was insisted upon by Old Madam Chai.

84
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,060
Maybe she has some obsession.

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,180
Are all the mortal wedding customs like this?

86
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,650
When you were at the Guanghan Palace,

87
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,340
you never spared a glance at the Mirror Pool.

88
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,310
Since you came to Qingzhou,

89
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,040
you prefer solitude even more.

90
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,080
How would you know about such lively affairs?

91
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,540
Today, thanks to Miss Zhaoyan,

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,620
I got to follow you to enjoy the joys of the mortal world.

93
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,280
If I ever return to the Heavenly Palace someday,

94
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,720
I'll definitely arrange for

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,980
a fairy to be your wife and accompany you.

96
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,200
Don't tease me.

97
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,680
I would take it seriously.

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,220
So impressive.

99
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,010
Long time no see.

100
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,830
Yes.

101
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,010
How have you been?

102
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,340
I'm fine.

103
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,470
Take good care of them.

104
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,830
Sorry, miss. I'm sorry.

105
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,520
Aren't you the crazy girl who barged in

106
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,450
on the engagement ceremony night?

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,920
It is her.

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,090
Looks like it's really her.

109
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,270
Why is it you again?

110
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,200
Miss,

111
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,980
what exactly do you want?

112
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
My name is Yun Zhaoyan.

113
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm here today at the request of an old acquaintance

114
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,800
to deliver a gift.

115
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,370
Isn't she the female official from

116
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,850
Imperial Censor's Mansion?

117
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,600
Why do you always cause trouble at others' happy events?

118
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,510
Exactly.

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,120
Imperial Censor took her into the mansion.

120
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,080
That must be because

121
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,680
she has some extraordinary qualities, right?

122
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,760
She always behaves so strangely.

123
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,980
Could it be that Imperial Censor...

124
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,840
I have left Imperial Censor's Mansion.

125
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,300
You shouldn't gossip about others anymore.

126
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,920
You've been kicked out of Imperial Censor's Mansion,

127

yet you are defending him.

128

She has been kicked out,

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,250

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,870
please sit down

189
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,530
and take your time to explain.

190
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,480
Please have some tea.

191
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,500
Old Madam.

192
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,700
Do you remember it?

193
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,670
This sword...

194
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,810
It was entrusted to me by an old friend to give to you.

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,460
The wedding dress from before

196
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,860
was also sent by him.

197
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,090
Is that person

198
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,910
Daohuang?

199
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,390
Chai Daohuang

200
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,790
was my husband.

201
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,080
When we got married,

202
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,680
we didn't have a proper wedding,

203
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,490
only a red wedding dress

204
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,090
that my mother secretly sent over.

205
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,850
Well, do you want to give it

206
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,460
to someone specific?

207
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,710
Is there anyone from the Chai family?

208
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,290
An old acquaintance of the Chai family, who wishes to

209
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,090
remain anonymous, asked me to deliver something.

210
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,160
I wore this very wedding dress,

211
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,010
and with heaven and earth as witnesses,

212
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,860
we became husband and wife.

213
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,990
But soon after,

214
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,530
there were frequent border conflicts.

215
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,440
With his martial prowess,

216
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,320
Daohuang enlisted.

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,960
I knew

218
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,880
he wanted to gain military merits

219
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,390
to earn my father's approval

220
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,550
and marry me honorably and openly.

221
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,410
So I pawned the wedding dress

222
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,100
and exchanged it

223
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,510
for this black iron sword

224
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,560
for him to protect himself.

225
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,900
When he left,

226
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,190
he said

227
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,800
he would definitely come back alive

228
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,270
with this sword.

229
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,580
But after he left,

230
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,950
there was no news of him anymore.

231
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,360
If Daohuang could see

232
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,400
his granddaughter's joyous wedding,

233
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,300
he would be as happy as I am.

234
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,300
Now, newlyweds,

235
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,040
bow to the heaven and earth,

236
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,120
bow to the parents,

237
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,730
bow to each other.

238
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,010
The ceremony is complete.

239
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,590
I knew

240
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,000
he wouldn't let me down.

241
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,600
The only thing I regret

242
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,170
is not being able to tell him in person

243
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,560
that the days we spent together

244
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,440
were without any regrets.

245
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,560
Others can't see you, but I can!

246
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,610
You want to repay me?

247
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,090
Daohuang,

248
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,020
thank you for your parting words to me.

249
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,510
We mortals

250
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,350
have only a fleeting existence.

251
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,710
Even though it may be difficult to stay together when we are alive,

252
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,200
it is still better than

253
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,530
hopelessly seeking reunion after death.

254
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,910
You were lucky to reunite with Old Madam,

255
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,450
so that you didn't let your beloved down.

256
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,750
Don't worry, Daohuang.

257
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,870
I will understand my heart clearly

258
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,580
and leave no regrets.

259
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,780
I will remember that

260
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,830
companionship is the most solid form of protection.

261
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,980
God Taiyin,

262
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,900
return to your position.

263
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,910
[Waning Moon]

264
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,190
My Lord.

265
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,300
Thank you

266
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,890
for what happened today.

267
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,220
Do you really

268
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,740
just have gratitude towards me?

269
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,180
I don't understand what you mean.

270
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,410
My feelings for you

271
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,480
were made clear back

272
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,230
when we were at Chai's Mansion.

273
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,760
She's with me.

274
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,060
Soon,

275
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,040
I will formally invite her back to my mansion.

276
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,350
Yun Zhaoyan.

277
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,069
I have developed human feelings for you.

278
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,500
Are you saying

279
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,119
you truly like me?

280
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,490
Does this sentence

281
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,890
hold any other meaning in the mortal world?

282
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,720
Though my heart has long belonged to you,

283
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,080
I fear.

284
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,820
I fear

285
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,030
I might become your burden,

286
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,310
causing you to once again fall into despair.

287
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,820
Who told you all of this?

288
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,210
My Lord,

289
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,320
the moon is nearing its full phase.

290
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,480
Sooner or later, you will have to return to the Moon Palace.

291
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,810
I don't want to be a source of worry for you.

292
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,200
In the past,

293
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
I always wished to stay by your side.

294
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,630
But now,

295
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,750
I only want to gaze at the moon in the sky

296
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,940
like I did in my childhood.

297
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,350
I just want you to be safe.

298
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,530
♫It's hard to distinguish what's good and what's evil, and it's hard to love or hate someone♫

299
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,620
♫We meet and part, coming to nothing♫

300
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,600
♫Puzzled, I'm too sad to play the guqin under the moon♫

301
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,340
♫I want to hear you talk about romantic things♫

302
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,410
♫In the cold moonlight, I'm willing to go to you♫

303
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,770
♫In the dim worldly affairs, my heart warms for one person♫

304
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:27,940
♫I'd rather endure numerous hardships with all my courage♫

305
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,550
Until today,

306
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,030
I was hesitating,

307
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,170
♫I won't retreat, I'll swallow the regrets♫

308
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,900
even considering being miles apart from you in another city.

309
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,450
♫In the cold moonlight, I put on clothes for you♫

310
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,120
But then I realized,

311
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,790
when you fell onto my boat,

312
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,170
♫The brush strokes may fade, but the love remains unchanged♫

313
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,590
or even

314
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,920
ten years before that...

315
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,810
♫We keep each other company hand in hand, leaving everything behind♫

316
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,090
No matter what challenges lie ahead,

317
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,960
I want to face them with you.

318
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,720
♫We live a happy and leisurely life in this world♫

319
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,920
But, My Lord,

320
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,020
the Soul Collecting Lamp is nearing fullness.

321
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,610
Don't you need to return to the Moon Palace?

322
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,230
I've been guarding the Moon Palace alone for a hundred years.

323
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,400
♫I'm a lonely person and tears trickle down my face♫

324
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
It's cold

325
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
and lonely there,

326
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,970
and there's nothing left that deserves my protection.

327
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,710
♫I dare not face so much sorrow♫

328
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,910
But if you don't return,

329
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,270
will you face...

330
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,530
♫Puzzled, I'm too sad to play the guqin under the moon♫

331
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,290

♫I want to hear you talk about romantic things♫

333
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,180

♫In the cold moonlight, I'm alone in the long night♫

335
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,110
It's just that this time,

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,750
♫The bitterness of lovesickness is only related to you♫

337
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,590
I don't want to passively accept it anymore.

♫We feel lonely at different places, seeming to be separated by a tall mountain♫

339

♫May a turn in fate bring fulfillment to our love♫

350
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,920

You don't want me to take my eyes back?

354
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,360
Kui Ji said that

355
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,340

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,840
and never part.

371
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:29,160
♫We live a happy and leisurely life in this world♫

372
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,990
Take a look.

373
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,310
Watch out!

374
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,660
It seems this distance

375
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,280
is the safest.

376
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,360
Being able to stay by your side

377
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,870
so freely

378
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,320
is wonderful.

379
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,020
From now on, I can go to

380
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,420
any mountain or lake.

381
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,530
I won't have to walk only along the edges

382
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,810
or sleep in corners anymore.

383
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,620
Because,

384
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,510
no renegade immortals will bully me anymore.

385
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,180
Yun Zhaoyan.

386
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,450
I want to take you to higher

387
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,030
and broader places.

388
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,640
Really?

389
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,250
Then I would love to see

390
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,770
that cold and lonely Moon Palace

391
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,310
you mentioned.

392
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,390
You're so greedy.

393
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,670
Let's go.

394
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,940
The moon is nearing its full phase.

395
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,340
There will inevitably be

396
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,850
some turbulence in the mortal world.

397
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,880
Why did the road that usually takes so long

398
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,340
seem to pass by so quickly?

399
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,030
Are you sure you still want to live in the morgue?

400
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:49,760
Yes.

401
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,040
My Lord, have you forgotten?

402
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,750
The morgue is my home.

403
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,740
Actually,

404
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,350
you can come to Imperial Censor's Mansion.

405
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,710
No way.

406
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,070
My Lord, what are you talking about?

407
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,500
Although

408
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,960
we have confessed to each other,

409
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,530
we cannot

410
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,440
overstep the bounds of propriety in the mortal world.

411
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,510
What I meant is,

412
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,480
you can continue to work at Imperial Censor's Mansion.

413
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,430
That way,

414
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,060
it will be convenient for me to protect you anytime and anywhere.

415
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,960
So this is what you meant.

416
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,830
Why?

417
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,790
Is there anything else on your mind?

418
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,790
Of course not.

419
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,330
But I do.

420
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,670
Are you saying...

421
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,850
[Yun's Mansion]

422
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,090
No, no, no!

423
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,830
My Lord.

424
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,280
My Lord! My Lord.

425
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,040
My Lord,

426
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,040
well...

427
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,350
Isn't it inappropriate for a single man and a single woman

428
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
to stay together at such a late hour?

429
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,090
Before, you came to my Imperial Censor's Mansion late at night,

430
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:09,020
insisting on sharing a bed with me.

431
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,100
At that time, I didn't notice

432
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,980
that you found it inappropriate.

433
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,480
We've already shared a bed before.

434
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,920
So, coming to you now

435
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,810
naturally isn't inappropriate.

436
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,230
Look at this shabby, rundown room of mine.

437
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,760
There's nothing appealing about it.

438
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,660
My Lord, please go back.

439
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,710
Yun Zhaoyan.

440
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,510
Is this how you treat

441
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,910
your talisman?

442
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,910
Of course not.

443
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,250
It's just that the talisman

444
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,680
doesn't need to be by my side all the time.

445
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,950
Why?

446
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,620
Aren't you afraid of renegade immortals anymore?

447
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,250
If a renegade immortal appears,

448
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,370
I'll immediately say your name.

449
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,240
They'll surely be scared off.

450
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,400
When you brought renegade immortals to Imperial Censor's Mansion before,

451
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,940
how many times did I warn you?

452
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,290
But you didn't listen.

453
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,850
So I don't need your consent

454
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,240
to come here either.

455
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,520
I'm thirsty.

456
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,720
Go get me a cup of tea.

457
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,920
My Lord!

458
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,030
Here's your tea.

459
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,830
Why are you keeping a withered flower?

460
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,350
It was Xie...

461
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,200
Xie?

462
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,200
Xie Zhihua?

463
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,750
I never expected you to have such leisure and elegance.

464
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:06,880
It's so ugly.

465
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Ugly?

466
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,200
But this flower was given to me by Brother Xie.

467
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,820
It's vibrant,

468
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,500
just like me.

469
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,680
So it's from Xie Zhihua.

470
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,080
Brother Xie said

471
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,540
that this flower shares my name,

472
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,790
also called Zhaoyan.

473
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,530
Zhaoyan?

474
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,510
Yun Zhaoyan,

475
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,910
this kind of flower in the mortal world

476
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,200
is just a wildflower.

477
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,580
Just throw it away.

478
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,920
No way!

479
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,520
Watch out!

480
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,270
Even if it's a wildflower,

481
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,270
it carries a beautiful meaning.

482
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,750
Isn't it beautiful enough

483
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,010
to have me by your side?

484
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,550
Why do you still need this withered flower?

485
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,460
For me,

486
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,330
this is a flower representing friendship.

487
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,610
It's different from having you by my side.

488
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,920
And...

489
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,500
My Lord,

490
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,230
you cannot always be

491
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,880
by my side.

492
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,620
Didn't I already give you...

493
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,790
Forget it.

494
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,200
Here.

495
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,980
Rest early.

[Impartial and Incorruptible]

497
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,530
The laurel hairpin is missing.

498
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,870
She might have already received it.

499
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,300
No, wait.

500
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,590
If she did, why didn't she wear it?

501
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,660
Could it be because she doesn't like it?

502
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,930
I should have given it to her in person.

503
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,030
That way,

504
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,260
I would have known if she likes it or not.

505
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,010
No, no.

506
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,690
What if she doesn't like it?

507
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,290
That would be so awkward.

[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

509
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,970
This is the first token of affection His Lordship gave me.

510
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,570
I must cherish it.

511
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,590
I never imagined

that one day,

00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,640
I would become the Moon God's beloved.

why did you come to the mansion so early today?

519
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,420
Because I wanted to see you earlier,

520
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,910
more than ever.

521
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,820

531
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,480

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,720
Too loud!

533
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,130
I could hear them!

Weren't you in the exterior hall just now?

00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,240

Such a teleportation spell

549
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,940
is hardly worth mentioning.

00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,690

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,590
that still bothers me when I think about it,

559
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,770
and the more I think about it, the angrier I get.

560
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,260
What is it?

561
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,230
You always talk about us being apart.

562
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:29,340
But actually,

563
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,230
we've never really been together.

564
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,970
We've never really held hands.

565
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:38,210
We haven't even

566
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:40,080
set off lanterns together.

567
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,480
I've been in the mortal world for ten years.

568
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,970
I haven't experienced

569
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,130
the common human feelings like these.

570
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,630
I don't care.

571
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,470
I want to hold hands now.

572
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,050
I want to set off lanterns now.

573
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:00,550
Alright, alright.

574
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,900
Let's go set off lanterns now.

575
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,620
[Chai's Mansion]

576
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,340
Please come in.

577
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,400
Where are you from? Where's your invitation?

578
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,360
How dare you!

579
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,810
Don't you know him?

580
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,710
I was ordered not to let

581
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,449
any random person come in.

582
00:34:25,489 --> 00:34:26,280
You...

583
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,840
You don't know him either?

584
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,270
I'm new here.

585
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,659
How would I know?

586
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:32,920
I only heard that

587
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,580
there was a crazy girl who had slipped in before,

588
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,600
and they all received punishment.

589
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,159
That's why we brothers were tasked

590
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,020
with guarding the gates closely.

591
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,699
How dare you!

592
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,199
How can a crazy girl

593
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,889
be compared to our city governor?

594
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,290
Get out of my way!

595
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,199
If you insist on barging in without an invitation,

596
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,030
don't blame us brothers

597
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,159
for being rude!

598
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,389
You...

599
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,140
Imperial Censor is here!

600
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,230
Welcome the officiant into the mansion!

601
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,040
Ren Shique, you stole my thunder!

602
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,230
You...

603
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,800
Let's go.

604
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,380
The patterns of the phoenix and peony

605
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,510
are both beautiful.

606
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,320
I don't know which one to choose.

607
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,630
Although the patterns on these fabrics are beautiful,

608
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,920
I don't particularly like any of them.

609
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,350
My Lady, you're not still

610
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:45,390
thinking about that unlucky old wedding dress, are you?

611
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,360
That dress is old,

612
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,480
but it's more exquisite

613
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,340
than any wedding dress I've seen.

614
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,010
The patterns are also novel and interesting.

615
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:53,710
My Lady,

616
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,840
please don't mention it again.

617
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,640
The family of the Young Master

618
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,520
is especially sensitive about that

619
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,610
unexplained unlucky wedding dress.

620
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,840
Since you genuinely want to marry him,

621
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,940
you should consider his feelings.

622
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,860
Hua treats me sincerely.

623
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,280
I understand.

624
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:11,650
I just feel a bit of pity about the dress.

625
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,630
What's there to be pity about?

626
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,630
In my opinion,

627
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,790
Master did the right thing

628
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,700
by throwing away the dress.

629
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,660
Mr. Chai threw the dress away?

630
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,760
How come it's you again?

631
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,760
Last time,

632
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,410
you disrupted Her Ladyship's engagement.

633
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,940
What are you up to this time?

634
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,570
Last time, disturbing your joyous occasion

635
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,980
was not my intention.

636
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,400
Today, I happened to pass by,

637
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,410
intending to congratulate you on your good match.

638
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,640
It's just that just now, I heard from this sister

639
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,550
that the wedding dress was thrown away.

640
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,350
In fact, it has its own significance

641
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,610
and shouldn't be discarded.

642
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,800
I don't care.

643
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,030
Master and Madam said

644
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,260
the most important thing right now is Her Ladyship's marriage.

645
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,760
Other past matters are not important.
