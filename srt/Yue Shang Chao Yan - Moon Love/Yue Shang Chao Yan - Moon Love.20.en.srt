I didn't call you. Why are you here?

190
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,450
Where's Yun Zhaoyan?

191
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,460
She...

192
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,870
She can't beat me in drinking,

193
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,890
so she ran away.

194
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,690
She's indeed not as good as me.

195
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,960
Don't move!

196
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,170
Don't move!

197
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,460
I'll go get her.

198
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,570
My Lord.

199
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,420
Look what Princess is like…

200
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,660
We really dare not…

201
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,790
Go to the Imperial Censor's Mansion to find Deputy Censor Xie.

202
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,720
He'll have a way.

203
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,140
Yes.

204
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,550
[Moon God Temple]

205
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,190
Why is a crescent

206
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,870
so dazzling for me now?

207
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,750
Han Ying.

208
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,220
We meet again.

209
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,990
You are Kui Ji.

210
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
It seems that you still remember me.

211
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,829
You evil fox

212
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,630
who doesn't know right or wrong.

213
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,790
When Chang Xi's eyes showed signs of abnormality,

214
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,790
you tried your best to conceal them.

215
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,569
You even trapped me with your power

216
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,069
in the Soul Collecting Lamp and stripped me of freedom

217
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:23,589
for hundreds of years.

218
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,630
Today, I will suppress you

219
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,140
in the Soul Collecting Lamp with my body.

220
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,920
No one can hurt Chang Xi anymore.

221
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,960
Thanks to you,

222
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,830
After I've lost hundreds of years of freedom and become a renegade immortal,

223
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,380
I'm still a shadow.

224
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,590
You have caused chaos at the Heavenly Realm.

225
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,100
You will never end well.

226
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,870
Chang Xi was the child of the Heaven Emperor and me.

227
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,540
He is the favored son of Heaven.

228
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,780
Just because his eyes can distinguish the six bodies

229
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,100
and recognize the different desires,

230
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,430
should he be destroyed?

231
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,830
Desires are born from the heart.

232
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,220
Good brings good, and evil brings evil.

233
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
It has nothing to do with those eyes.

234
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,030
Easy for you to say.

235
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,110
If you look at everything with evil eyes,

236
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,140
then everything you see is evil.

237
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,100
If you look at things with despicable eyes,

238
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,030
how can you see a fair and just thing?

239
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,300
If you go on like this,

240
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,700
immortals in the Heavenly Realm will distrust one another

241
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,390
and never have peace.

242
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,270
A shadow is a shadow.

243
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,390
You're so good at

244
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,820
bewitching all beings with grandiose platitudes.

245
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,750
You must have learned it from Heaven Emperor, right?

246
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,510
What a pity.

247
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,350
But you, as a shadow,

248
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,240
just scratched the surface of it.

249
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,800
Later, I found

250
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,660
what you were afraid of

251
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,110
was not the scandals of the Heavenly Realm being exposed

252
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,450
but

253
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,690
your inferiority complex and ambition being exposed.

254
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,550
Kui Ji,

255
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,230
what are you babbling about?

256
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,350
For thousands of years,

257
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,870
your heart has drowned in the abyss.

258
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,660
You just want to drag everything into the darkness.

259
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,310
On the surface,

260
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,470
you're the Heaven Emperor's secret pawn.

261
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
In fact,

262
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,840
you want more power

263
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,770
and you want to be seen, discovered, and respected.

264
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,330
That should be the basic desire

265
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,180
of a shadow.

266
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,790
This is what you see

267
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,330
with your despicable eyes.

268
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,140
Despicable?

269
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,580
No one in the Heavenly Realm

270
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,780
wants this pair of despicable eyes

271
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,390
more than you do.

272
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,740
The more you feel inferior,

273
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,480
the more scared you are.

274
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,630
The more scared you are,

275
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,570
the more you want to know

276
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,920
how others think of you,

277
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,300
and the more you want to control everything.

278
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,540
You want to control everything you can't do

279
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,130
since you were little.

280
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,060
Kui Ji,

281
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,390
are you really willing

282
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,850
to vanish completely

283
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,710
for this insignificant mortal woman?

284
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,550
This woman in the mortal world

285
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,760
She's a mortal woman,

286
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,300
but she can fill the void

287
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
in Chang Xi's heart and comfort him.

288
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,040
Fine.

289
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,950
I'll grant your wish.

290
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,190
Kui Ji,

291
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,110
it is a worthy death for you

292
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,070
because you owed me this.

293
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,330
But let me tell you,

294
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,450
I won't tolerate any sins.

295
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,750
Yun Zhaoyan.

296
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,030
It's your turn now.

297
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,740
Your biggest mistake

298
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,830
is to pray for those sinful eyes.

299
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,870
God Taiyin.

300
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,790
That is just a puppet I made

301
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,510
in the likeness of the humans.

302
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,260
What?

303
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,080
Can't you even recognize a puppet now?

304
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,660
Who are you?

305
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,090
I'm the shadow brother of Heaven Emperor,

306
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,010
Han Ying.

307
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,270
You're born to be different.

308
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,950
Plus, you had a pair of

309
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,780
unpardonable eyes.

310
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,500
No matter who has them,

311
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,790
I will

312
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,480
take them away.

313
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,100
My Lord.

314
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,750
[Moon God Temple]

315
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
Are you okay?

316
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,550
My Lord.

317
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,430
Kui Ji.

318
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,710
Kui Ji left.

319
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,740
She was blocking in front of me,

320
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,540
but there was nothing I could do.

321
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,800
She had never thought of hurting you.

322
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,350
Her love for her son wasn't accepted.

323
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:39,340
Zhaoyan,

324
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,020
listen to me.

325
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,520
Don't blame yourself.

326
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,480
You are the one

327
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,670
who untied the emotional knots

328
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,750
between my mother and me.

329
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,230
It's your own eyes

330
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,630
that helped you.

331
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,800
Zhaoyan!

332
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,100
Zhaoyan!

333
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,780
Zhaoyan!

334
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,320
Zhaoyan.

335
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,810
Can you hear me?

336
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,480
Zhaoyan, wake up.

337
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,180
Zhaoyan.

338
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,790
My Lord.

339
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,230
What's wrong with Miss Zhaoyan?

340
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,500
She's severely injured.

341
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,490
This...

342
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,630
Miss Zhaoyan's scar

343
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,360
is like a red brand.

344
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Could it be...

345
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,520
the Bronze Rod that caused it?

346
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,180
The Bronze Rod?

347
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,550
The Bronze Rod

348
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,570
is a weapon forged by the Heaven Emperor himself.

349
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,320
It is born by absorbing the spiritual energy of the sun and the moon.

350
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,580
It can kill the wicked and the heretics.

351
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,360
Why did it appear suddenly

352
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,070
and even hurt Miss Zhaoyan?

353
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,430
Have you heard of

354
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,560
Heaven Emperor's twin brother, Han Ying?

355
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,760
There is indeed a rumor in Heavenly Realm

356
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,800
saying that Heaven Emperor had a twin brother,

357
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,430
but no one has ever seen him.

358
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,190
Does he really exist?

359
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,810
He's the mastermind who bewitched my mother.

360
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,840
He has no shape or body

361
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,500
and has been in the dark,

362
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,820
following the Heaven Emperor's orders.

363
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,880
To protect Zhaoyan,

364
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,520
my mother

365
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,680
has already...

366
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,870
Is Kui Ji...

367
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,000
Is there any way

368
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,460
to heal this wound?

369
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,430
The Bronze Rod can kill an immortal with one blow,

370
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,650
let alone a human.

371
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,100
Miss Zhaoyan has been able to survive until now.

372
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,030
She must be protected by your eyes.

373
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,530
But judging by her current status,

374
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,700
she'll probably...

375
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,360
Kanxu.

376
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,330
As an old official of the Heavenly Realm,

377
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,340
you must know

378
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,240
or have heard of the way to rescue her, right?

379
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,400
I'm afraid the only person who can save Miss Zhaoyan

380
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,430
is the Heaven Emperor.

381
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,740
Heaven Emperor.

382
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,430
Fine.

383
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,560
I'll go beg the Heaven Emperor.

384
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,440
My Lord.

385
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,700
It takes days

386
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,500
for you to go there and come back.

387
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,900
Whether the Heaven Emperor is going to save her is also unknown.

388
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,780
Can Miss Zhaoyan hold on

389
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,330
until the day you come back?

390
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,110
I won't let anything happen to her.

391
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,170
Now,

392
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,200
it's my turn to protect her.

393
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,250
I'm taking her back to the Heavenly Palace.

394
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,910
If the Heaven Emperor doesn't save her,

395
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,330
the worst scenario

396
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,940
would be just like what I did in the Heavenly Palace back then,

397
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,170
that I'll rebel.

398
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,950
My Lord!

399
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,980
Kanxu, you...

400
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,030
Bringing a mortal to the Heavenly Realm

401
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,510
is against Heaven's law.

402
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,070
No one ever dared to do that.

403
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,370
Moreover, Miss Zhaoyan is a mortal.

404
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,960
she may not be able to withstand the fairy aura

405
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
and the criticism of all immortals.

406
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,940
My Lord!

407
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,680
I won't let anyone hurt her.

408
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,570
Could those so-called heavenly rules

409
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,850
be more important than her life?

410
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,550
Those old rules

411
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,240
should have been altered.

412
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,260
Come on, Kanxu.

413
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,200
Han Ying has escaped.

414
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,510
Guard the Soul Collecting Lamp

415
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,250
and wait for us.

416
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,620
My Lord.

417
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,620
Don't be so anxious, Mr. Governor.

418
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,190
Miss Yun went out yesterday and hasn't come back yet.

419
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,460
How can I not be anxious?

420
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,150
Qing went out all night and didn't come back.

421
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,060
Get Yun Zhaoyan out

422
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,580
for me.

423
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,540
Imperial Censor.

424
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,410
You...

425
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,270
Zhaoyan, are you alright?

426
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,950
I'm fine.

427
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,980
Did you hear it all?

428
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,250
He made it sound serious.

429
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,710
Don't take it to heart.

430
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,280
Let me send you back first.

431
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,510
I...

432
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,510
No need.

433
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,920
I can go back by myself.

434
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,380
I'm fine.

435
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,230
Yun Zhaoyan.

436
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,650
Princess wants to talk to you about something important at Zuiyin Tavern.

437
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,950
Zuiyin Tavern?

438
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,470
[Zuiyin Tavern]

439
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,590
Xie Guichen!

440
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,090
Ren Shique.

441
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,580
I didn't call you. Why are you here?

442
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,740
Where is Yun Zhaoyan?

443
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,870
She...

444
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,820
She can't beat me in drinking,

445
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,880
so she ran away.

446
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,550
She's indeed not as good as me.

447
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,540
Don't move!

448
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,200
I'll go get her back.

449
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,250
My Lord.

450
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,710
Look

451
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,030
what Princess is like…

452
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,300
We really dare not…

453
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,920
Go to the Imperial Censor's Mansion to find Deputy Censor Xie.

454
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,850
He'll have a way.

455
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,380
Yes.
