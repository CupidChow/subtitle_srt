[Episode 21]

4
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,600
G-Governor.

5
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,550
D-Don't worry, Governor.

6
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,789
Miss Yun

7
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,200
went out y-yesterday and still hasn't come back.

8
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,430
How can I not be worried?

9
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,160
Qing stayed out all night.

10
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,750
Ask Yun Zhaoyan to come out now.

11
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,680
Yun Zhaoyan!

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,150
You...

13
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,079
Where are they?

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,150
Did you see that?

15
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,240
They just suddenly...

16
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,800
Guigui.

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,900
Ren Shique and Yun Zhaoyan...

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,400
just...

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,320
They left.

20
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,800
I don't think I saw it wrong.

21
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,630
They left?

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,990
They left?

23
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,670
Where did they go?

24
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,840
Actually, I'm God Taiyin on the moon.

25
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,280
He... He really is not a mortal.

26
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,410
W-Who is not a mortal?

27
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,550
Chang Xi is really lawless.

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,240
He didn't come back on time

29
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,470
and he even brought back a mortal woman.

30
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,520
Heaven Emperor is too indulgent with him.

31
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,670
In my opinion, he should be removed

32
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,470
from his position as God Taiyin.

33
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,730
Also, that mortal woman should be...

34
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,230
Now it's quiet.

35
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,500
When you couldn't see things in your childhood,

36
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,700
you must also think it was noisy around you.

37
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,130
I'm going to Heaven Emperor now.

38
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,860
Wait for me here.

39
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,820
A fox flower?

40
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,120
Could it be it's my mother?

41
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,290
She spent 500 years here accompanying you.

42
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,550
After she passed away,

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,040
she came back here.

44
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,270
I thought

45
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,650
you would rather die

46
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,380
than come back.

47
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,190
She is Yun Zhaoyan

48
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,590
who you brought back from the mortal world?

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,150
Yes.

50
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,440
She was hurt by the Bronze Rod.

51
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,160
I...

52
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,540
I... beg you to save her.

53
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,320
Beg?

54
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,880
Chang Xi,

55
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,030
during the past ten years,

56
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,250
you would rather live in the mortal world

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,180
than return to the Guanghan Palace

58
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,200
or see me.

59
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,220
Now,

60
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,400
you're begging me,

61
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,580
but you still refuse to call yourself my son?

62
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,520
Back then, your mother was worried about you.

63
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,690
So she used her body to suppress Han Ying in the Soul Collecting Lamp

64
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,680
to keep you safe.

65
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,760
Now,

66
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,890
you have violated the heavenly rules

67
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,920
by bringing this woman to the Heavenly Realm.

68
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,860
Aren't you afraid of danger?

69
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,090
Ten years ago,

70
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,140
I treated my family

71
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,630
and everyone else in this world coldly.

72
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,690
Fortunately,

73
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,810
she came to me and stayed by my side.

74
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,320
I just want to be with the person I love.

75
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,310
So,

76
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,250
I will never give up.

77
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,610
I'm willing

78
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,270
to do anything

79
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,800
even if I have to go against the Heavenly Realm

80
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,200
that's like an empty shell.

81
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,760
Since you already have someone

82
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,320
you want to protect,

83
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,650
why don't you try

84
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,490
and see if you are capable

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,840
of retrieving the spilt milk?

86
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,590
The moon is peaceful.

87
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,630
Why bother asking someone else for help?

88
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,180
What does it mean?

89
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,230
I gave

90
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,650
the Guanghan Palace to you.

91
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,730
I promise

92
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,740
no one will come to disturb you from now on.

93
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,260
I...

94
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,450
Am I destined

95
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,160
to lose the person I love the most?

96
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,810
The moon is peaceful.

97
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,020
Why bother asking someone else for help?

98
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,630
Zhaoyan was hurt by the Bronze Rod.

99
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,600
It's a weapon created by absorbing

100
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,290
the sun and the moon's energy.

101
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:52,000
The sun gives the energy of killing.

102
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,860
The moon gives the energy of living.

103
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:57,730
The turn of the tide

104
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,700
and the change of the four seasons in this world

105
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,380
depend on the moon's energy.

106
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,880
Did Heaven Emperor mean...

107
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,970
My Lord, we meet again.

108
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,049
It's you.

109
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,960
Aren't you scared?

110
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,460
Why did you meddle in their business?

111
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,710
We can't give up just because we're afraid of getting hurt.

112
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,330
Don't you have any regrets

113
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,570
or something you can't get over?

114
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,420
Everyone tries to avoid me.

115
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,840
Why do you want to get close to me?

116
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,490
You are very important to me.

117
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,250
We will meet again.

118
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,970
Kui Ji,

119
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,710
you're finally here.

120
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,700
Come and possess me.

121
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,100
Don't make His Lordship so sad again.

122
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,420
My Lord,

123
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,930
this time,

124
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,730
you don't need to listen or look.

125
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,370
Let me protect you.

126
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,100
It's too cold in the Guanghan Palace.

127
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,110
I've never looked up

128
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,370
to see everything here

129
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,870
carefully.

130
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,720
I always hated myself because of the Eyes of Bane.

131
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,980
I pitied myself because my birth mother abandoned me.

132
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,480
I gave up on myself because Heaven and Earth couldn't tolerate me.

133
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,090
After spending only half a year with Zhaoyan,

134
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,080
I understand

135
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,810
the love and hate in this world

136
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,080
and have the guts to face the fear in my heart,

137
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,470
feel the pain of others,

138
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,870
and solve the problems of everyone.

139
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,010
The moon's hatred

140
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,270
has disappeared because of Zhaoyan's kindness.

141
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,310
So now,

142
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,510
Zhaoyan can definitely be blessed by the moon.

143
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,860
♫It's hard to distinguish what's good and what's evil, and it's hard to love or hate someone♫

144
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,060
♫We meet and part, coming to nothing♫

145
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,500
♫Puzzled, I'm too sad to play the guqin under the moon♫

146
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,050
♫I want to hear you talk about romantic things♫

147
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,170
Zhaoyan.

148
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,160
♫In the cold moonlight, I'm willing to go to you♫

149
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,360
My Lord.

150
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,480
♫In the dim worldly affairs, my heart warms for one person♫

151
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,440
My Lord, I miss you so much.

152
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,780
♫I'd rather endure numerous hardships with all my courage♫

153
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,120
I thought I could never see you again.

154
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,200
♫I won't retreat, I'll swallow the regrets♫

155
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,000
Zhaoyan,

156
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,050
you're finally back to me again.

157
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,260
♫In the cold moonlight, I put on clothes for you♫

158
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:31,940
This time,

159
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,480
I won't let you go again.

160
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,880
♫The brush strokes may fade, but the love remains unchanged♫

161
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,810
What is this place?

162
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,850
This is the Guanghan Palace.

163
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,280
The Guanghan Palace?

164
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,150
So I'm on the moon.

165
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,380
I didn't expect that such a cold place

166
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,650
can fulfill so many people's wishes.

167
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,080
I've lived on the moon for a few hundred years,

168
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,050
but I've never fulfilled anyone's wish.

169
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,330
Except yours.

170
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,350
You drank so much wine.

171
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,310
You wouldn't go back after making a scene in Zuiyin Tavern all night.

172
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,970
If someone with ulterior motives saw that, they'll gossip again.

173
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,750
Why aren't you talking?

174
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,180
Are you still mad at me?

175
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,430
Since you're asleep,

176
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,240
let me tell you what I really think.

177
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,670
Actually,

178
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,860
it's not that I don't like you.

179
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,530
It's just that I've been wandering all my life.

180
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,580
Only my master can be counted as my family.

181
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,200
I don't know his whereabouts now.

182
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,670
And I

183
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,070
have got involved in this trouble.

184
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,570
I'm worried...

185
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,050
I'm worried I'll get you implicated.

186
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,120
I can only

187
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,920

188
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:32,890
This way.

189
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,680
Her room is here.

190
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,400
Lord Xie, thank you so much.

191
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,180
No big deal.

192
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,960
Princess. Princess?

193
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,880
You're home, Princess.

194
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:49,930
Wake up.

195
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,630
Lord Xie,

196
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,150
please carry her inside first.

197
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,440
This...

198
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm going to prepare some hangover soup, okay?

199
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,490
Okay.

200
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,030
Thank you, Lord Xie.

201
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,060

202
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,730

204
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,050
[Visiting Card]

205
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,870
You're the most distinguished woman in Qingzhou.

206
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,580
How could you... do this again and again?

207
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,650
So?

208
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,560
Are you going to stay away from me again?

209
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,160
I heard what you just said

210
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,970
on our way back.

211
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,640
I shouldn't have been too close to you.

212
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,350
Xie Guichen, don't go.

213
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,440
You are the one I love.

214
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,990
I won't let you go.

215
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,980
No matter what happened to you in the past

216
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,079
or what problems you'll face in the future,

217
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,339
I want to be with you forever.

218
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,420
Xie Guichen,

219
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,920
clearly you don't want to leave me either.

220
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,050
Why do you always give up so easily?

221
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,319
Listen.

222
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,040
If you let me go,

223
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,590
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

224
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,040
Why are you giving me this look again?

225
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,280
Are you going to refuse me again?

226
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,820
Fine.

227
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,370
Then refuse me.

228
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,410
I already know your feelings anyway.

229
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,160
I won't give up.

230
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,930
If you're worried you'll have nowhere to go in the future,

231
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,730
you can come to Governor's Mansion.

232
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,050
We'll definitely welcome you.

233
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,140
You can

234
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,030
rest assured.

235
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,880
We both know our feelings for each other,

236
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,320
but we're hesitant about being together. I don't like it.

237
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,440
If so,

238
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,000
we will miss each other in the end.

239
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,500
Is this your answer after careful thinking?

240
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,370
I...

241
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,680
am willing to spend the rest of my life with you.

242
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,800
What?

243
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,690
Life is short.

244
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,790
I don't want to miss you anymore.

245
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,680
When the imperial censor asked me to go to you yesterday,

246
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,810
I was very hesitant.

247
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,440
I've been wandering all my life.

248
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,800
I was worried I couldn't

249
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,930
give you the peace that all women want.

250
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,020
So,

251
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,410
I didn't dare to get close to you.

252
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,640
But now I'm very glad

253
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,940
that I didn't miss you.

254
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,570
I'll come to Governor's Mansion to propose marriage another day.

255
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,450
Princess,

256
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,320
please wait a few days.

[Governor's Mansion]

258
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,510
Where are you?

259
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,850
Will you come back or not?

260
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,850
Do you still care about Qingzhou City or not?

261
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,390
Governor, you...

262
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,140
Get lost!

263
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,980
Ren Shique,

264
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,230
I don't care

265
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,790
where you are.

266
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,090
You could have told me that you want to leave.

267
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,720
But you left without saying goodbye.

268
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,190
Ren Shique,

269
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,380
can't you say goodbye to me before leaving?

270
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,080
From now on,

271
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,750
there will be no one in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

272
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,230
What should I do?

273
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,210
Why are you like this?

274
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,540
Brother,

275
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,970
Ren Shique has been away from Qingzhou City for just one day.

276
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,770
But you don't want to drink or eat. Is it necessary?

277
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,510
Who misses him?

278
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,770
What makes me sad is

279
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,340
he left Qingzhou City to me

280
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,400
just like this. I...

281
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,830
He didn't even say goodbye.

282
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,320
When did you become

283
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,800
so sentimental?

284
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,910
Right,

285
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,430
he even took Yun Zhaoyan, a citizen of Qingzhou,

286
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,250
away with him.

287
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,840
How inappropriate!

288
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,610
Qing.

289
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,510
Aren't you worried

290
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,940
about Yun Zhaoyan at all?

291
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,190
As long as Ren Shique is with her,

292
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,450
she won't be in danger.

293
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,550
Are you praising Ren Shique?

294
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
Sort of.

295
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,030
Although Ren Shique offended me

296
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,080
many times,

297
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,350
for Zhaoyan's sake,

298
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,110
I forgive him.

299
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,370
Right,

300
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
why did you come here in such a hurry?

301
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,750
Brother, go get ready.

302
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,630
Go to Imperial Censor's Mansion with me later to propose marriage.

303
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,360
Ren Shique has left.

304
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,680
Why should I go...

305
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,950
What did you say? Propose marriage?

306
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,760
My Gosh!

307
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,040
Stop messing around!

308
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,890
I'm not.

309
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,240
I like Xie Guichen from Imperial Censor's Mansion.

310
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,020
What's wrong with that?

311
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,170
I must marry him.

312
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,330
Actually,

313
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,990
I wanted to wait

314
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,940
till he comes to propose marriage.

315
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,560
But he's so handsome

316
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,420
and he's outside every day.

317
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,210
At the thought of that,

318
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,230
I'm really worried.

319
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,290
Ren Shique is not here now,

320
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,380
so I want to go to his mansion and take away his man.

321
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
What do you think?

322
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,350
Are you going to cry again?

323
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,030
You're so reckless!

324
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,980
This is not

325
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,120
your decision to make.

326
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,970
You're acting recklessly

327
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,600
because I've been indulgent with you.

328
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,270
Go back to your room.

329
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,300

No one is allowed to let you out!

331
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,710
It's my marriage. Of course it's my decision to make.

332

No matter what you say,

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
I must marry Xie Guichen!

In my previous life,

335
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,940
I must have saved too many villains.

336
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,900
That's why I've suffered so much.

337
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,240
It hurts so much.

338

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,530
Don't run so fast.

I'm grateful that you protected me with your life.

00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,330
we've been ordered to s-strictly guard Imperial Censor's Mansion.

376
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,360
We can't d-disobey the order.

377
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,990
T-That's right, Miss.

378
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,470
In that case,

379
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,270
we're going to break in.

380
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,670
Don't!

381
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,030
Guys.

[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

383
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,160
Hurry!

384
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,130
Guys.

385
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,140
Hurry!

386
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,110
Guys.

387
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,840
Guys, don't.

388
00:26:59,250 --> 00:26:59,970
Don't!

389
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:01,470
Don't.

[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

391
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,920
Don't.

392
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,130
Xie Guichen.

393
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,830
Princess, why are you here?

394
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,550
They're proposing marriage at the door. It's too noisy.

395
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,550
It made me feel something was wrong.

396
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,160
Then I thought about it.

397
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,400
A marriage is something between you and me.

398
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,470
It's better that I come to you myself

399
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,910
and discuss it with you in private.

400
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:41,950
Be careful!

401
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,280
♫It's drizzling in the mountain in spring under the bright sky♫

402
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,100
♫Swallows have brought back flowers♫

403
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,360
♫I'm enjoying the natural scenery and flying birds♫

404
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,920
♫It's kind of a life of leisure♫

405
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,060
♫In the mountain pavilion, I heard orioles singing♫

406
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,630
♫The pear blossoms near the waterside pavilion are as white as snow♫

407
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,250
♫The red clouds echo your makeup-free face♫

408
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,360
Wait.

409
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,550
♫I'm lost in this picturesque place♫

410
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,760
♫Ask the God of Matchmaking for a red thread♫

411
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,360
♫I've fallen for someone♫

412
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,020
I'm going

413
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,920
♫Peach blossoms are not as beautiful as your smiling face♫

414
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,990
to repay what I owe you.

415
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,530
♫With the breeze and the moonlight of the long night♫

416
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,780
♫Can I invite you here?♫

417
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,170
♫I've fallen for someone♫

418
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,270
♫Butterflies are not as beautiful as your eyebrows♫

419
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,740
♫Even a myriad of poems can't express my endless lovesickness♫

420
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,070
This is the Mirror Pool you mentioned

421
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,430
that allows us to see what's happening in the mortal world?

422
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,880
Although we all know each other,

423
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,910
it's really awkward...

424
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,690
to see this.

425
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,110
This... is normal.

426
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,530
Why...

427
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,750
Well, you've lived in the Moon Palace for over 400 years.

428
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,080
Did you often peep at this?

429
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,430
I know the principle of seeing no evil.

430
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,600
Zhaoyan.

431
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,200
We can see what's happening in the mortal world from the Moon Palace,

432
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,670
but they can't see

433
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,970
what's happening in the Moon Palace from the mortal world.

434
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,710
What do you mean?

435
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,230
Xie Guichen, wait!

436
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,190
You idiot.

437
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,580
I don't like a peaceful life.

438
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,560
I'm different from those girls in Qingzhou.

439
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,960
You were not drunk

440
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,720
just now?

441
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,690
I still feel dizzy.

442
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,380
We haven't got married yet.

443
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,220
Princess, don't cross the line.

444
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,500
Have a good rest today.

445
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,840
Just now, I should have asked him to stay

446
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
in Governor's Mansion and marry me.

447
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,580
I'm so mad.
