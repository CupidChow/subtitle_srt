4
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,740
♫The sound of the flute spreads like mist♫

5
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,030
♫The moonlight seems hazy because of what's on my mind♫

6
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,280
♫The wind is so brave to cross numerous mountains♫

7
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,300
♫That makes our meeting romantic♫

8
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:50,050
♫The petals in the sky are poetic♫

9
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,910
♫The memories make the night beautiful♫

10
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,290
♫The unfinished part has been finished♫

11
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,020
♫Because of you, I have lost all my regrets♫

12
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,620
♫I'm willing to become a breeze in the world♫

13
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,040
So beautiful.

14
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,200
♫I'll be with you in a dream♫

15
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,430
I mean

16
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,650
these petals are so beautiful.

17
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,329
♫Maybe in this life I came to meet you♫

18
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,900
♫Let our love transcend the bounds of time and space♫

19
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,670
♫Let our love transcend the bounds of time and space♫

20
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,030
You are my attendant.

21
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,240
Why do you get hurt so easily?

22
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,550
I'm still in danger of being coveted.

23
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,980
Now, if I don't stay away from this face

24
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,780
as beautiful as the morning sun,

25
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,810
I'm afraid

26
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,230
I can never stay away in this life.

27
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,920
If I don't tell him how I feel now,

28
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,990
maybe I won't have a chance in the future.

29
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,880
My Lord,

30
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,840
I think...

31
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,850
I have

32
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,870
special feelings for you.

33
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,290
I think...

34
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,060
I like you.

35
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,790
Yun Zhaoyan.

36
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,450
Do you really think

37
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,780
I am a god with a pure heart and few desires?

38
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,890
When you fell on my ship,

39
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,030
I thought I must stay away from you.

40
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,050
Later,

41
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,740
when you made

42
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,600
the renegade immortals in Qingzhou City restless,

43
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,880
I even wanted

44
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,430
to get rid of you completely.

45
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,020
Now,

46
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,050
it's like I've been

47
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,180
dragged into an abyss by you.

48
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,580
My Lord, you mean...

49
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,720
Don't walk to me anymore.

50
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,210
Go back to how we were.

51
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,440
Yun Zhaoyan,

52
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,360
you're a mortal.

53
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,570
The distance between you and me

54
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,750
is like that between you and the moon in the sky.

55
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,040
No matter how hard you try,

56
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,850
the moon can only be in the sky.

57
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,900
We can never intersect.

58
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,250
So,

59
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,370
I crossed the line.

60
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,240
You allowed me to stay in Imperial Censor's Mansion

61
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,159
and stay by your side.

62
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,090
You protected me

63
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,900
and supported me.

64
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,310
This has developed an inappropriate desire in my heart.

65
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,480
I thought

66
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,090
having Moon God's eyes

67
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,670
makes me special enough.

68
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,050
Now that I think about it,

69
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm still a mortal

70
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,180
in this world.

71
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,920
Remember to bandage your wound.

72
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm leaving.

73
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,570
Why

74
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,810
do I feel heartbroken here?

75
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,030
I thought

76
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,850
having Moon God's eyes

77
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,350
makes me special enough.

78
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,650
Now that I think about it,

79
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,060
I'm still a mortal

80
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,540
in this world.

81
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,250
Where is Xie Guichen?

82
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,520
I can't find him anywhere. Well...

83
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,490
My Lord.

84
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,940
Well...

85
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,820
Right,

86
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,610
have you seen Xie Guichen?

87
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,020
I've been looking for him, but I still can't find him.

88
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,550
Why are you looking for him?

89
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,810
I need to ask him

90
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,480
something important face to face.

91
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,370
Actually, there's nothing important.

92
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,460
Qing doesn't want

93
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,740
to drink or eat these days.

94
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,900
She has lost a lot of weight.

95
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,820
I asked around.

96
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,620
Xie Guichen

97
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,740
offended Qing.

98
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,630
If I can't see him today, I'll come tomorrow.

99
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,190
Your sister

100
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,650
is domineering

101
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,970
and arrogant.

102
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,810
She's really annoying.

103
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,330
I'm not sure

104
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,430
who offended whom today.

105
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,740
Go back and tell her.

106
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,820
From now on,

107
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,490
don't pester anyone

108
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,290
in Imperial Censor's Mansion again.

109
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,460
P-Pester?

110
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,860
Ren Shique, don't talk nonsense.

111
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,940
Qing is not

112
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,130
a shameless woman.

113
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,020
You can ask around

114
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,820
in Qingzhou City

115
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,060
to find out how the princess

116
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,990
pestered Xie Guichen

117
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,820
and made a mess in my mansion.

118
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,090
The people in Imperial Censor's Mansion are busy.

119
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,520
We don't want her

120
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,020
to cause us trouble again.

121
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:32,930
You...

122
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,240
Since you'll leave,

123
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,780
I won't argue with you.

124
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,180
Master.

125
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,440
Master.

126
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,400
I know you are here.

127
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,900
Master.

128
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,610
Master,

129
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,010
the bandits Yun Zhaoyan met

130
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,250
in the Moon God Temple today

131
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,580
were lured there by you on purpose, right?

132
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,660
They have confessed.

133
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,420
They said a man wearing a black robe asked them to do it.

134
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,800
I did it, so what?

135
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,620
Master,

136
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,030
why did you do that?

137
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,780
I already told you

138
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,780
Yun Zhaoyan is innocent.

139
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,490
Why do you want to hurt an innocent person?

140
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,790
An innocent person?

141
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,010
Everyone is a pawn.

142
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,890
Who is innocent?

143
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,080
Stop being compassionate.

144
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,760
Don't forget

145
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,990
who raised you.

146
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,630
Yes.

147
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,780
You raised me.

148
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,790
I'm indebted to you.

149
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,370
But Yun Zhaoyan showed me

150
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,020
even though she is alone and helpless,

151
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,720
she can still be a kind person.

152
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,630
You really have grown up.

153
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,680
You're no longer

154
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,360
the poor guy who was beaten up

155
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,870
and covered in injuries.

156
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,030
Master, you saved me

157
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,600
just to use me to harm others?

158
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,930
Harm others?

159
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,890
I don't even dare to show my face.

160
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,830
You can never understand this.

161
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,820
Your kindness

162
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,100
is just the expression of your weakness.

163
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,700
You know nothing about the truth.

164
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,250
You don't know

165
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,450
what true justice is.

166
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,130
I only believe what I saw with my own eyes.

167
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,390
Ren Shique and Yun Zhaoyan

168
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,100
have never hurt anyone.

169
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,200
What about those you can't see?

170
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,430
They are wrong?

171
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,030
They shouldn't exist?

172
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,160
No matter how hard they tried,

173
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,510
it's still useless?

174
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,170
Master,

175
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,360
can you tell me

176
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,270
who on earth you are?

177
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,920
Since you have disobeyed my order,

178
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,460
why are you even asking this?

179
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,300
I only have one question for you.

180
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,570
If one day,

181
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,960
I want to kill Ren Shique and Yun Zhaoyan,

182
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,670
who will you choose?

183
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,550
Master,

184
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,370
I can't use the sword in my hand

185
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,670
to hurt the innocent.

186
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,690
If you insist,

187
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,590
I won't resist.

188
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,900
But

189
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,790
I will stand in front of Yun Zhaoyan

190
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,140
and even Ren Shique firmly.

191
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,960
[Morgue]

192
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,520
Zhaoyan,

193
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:55,920
I'm sorry.

194
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,270
I put you in danger.

195
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,560
I hope

196
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,860
I can make up for it.

197
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,300
What are you thinking about? You're so absorbed.

198
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,670
Brother Xie,

199
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,650
I didn't even notice you came.

200
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,380
I heard

201
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,580
you met bandits in the southern suburbs.

202
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,370
Luckily, His Lordship arrived in time

203
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,810
and saved me.

204
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,530
What happened to your hand?

205
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,930
It's nothing.

206
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,450
I'm already used to it.

207
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
You should be careful in the future.

208
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,400
This is for you.

209
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,010
In the future,

210
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,560
if you are in danger,

211
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,150
smash this.

212
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,250
Then

213
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,460
I'll go there to save you

214
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,320
as fast as I can.

215
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,890
No need for this.

216
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,980
I can handle it myself.

217
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,050
Don't misunderstand.

218
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,590
I'm doing this

219
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,910
because I feel guilty.

220
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,180
Guilty?

221
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,500
Yes.

222
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,820
The southern suburbs are within my jurisdiction.

223
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,390
You were in danger

224
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,630
because of my inadequate precautions.

225
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,710
Brother Xie, never mind.

226
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,000
I insisted on going.

227
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,610
His Lordship was there. I'm fine, right?

228
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,230
Are you getting along well

229
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,320
with His Lordship?

230
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,050
Same as before.

231
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,330
That's good.

232
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,730
Since you're fine,

233
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,970
I should go back.

234
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,290
Remember,

235
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,090
if you are in danger,

236
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,730
summon me with this.

237
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,319
I will.

238
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,530
Nuo.

239
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,210
Why did you leave me behind yesterday?

240
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,110
The bandits yesterday

241
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,890
looked like the bad guys you met before.

242
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,450
So you were very scared, right?

243
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,800
Alright, I forgive you.

244
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,610
Nuo.

245
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,270
Did he recall something?

246
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,990
Nuo.

247
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:32,330
Nuo.

248
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,030
Nuo

249
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,000
disappeared in the blink of an eye.

250
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,810
Nuo?

251
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,680
This name sounds very familiar.

252
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,790
Miss.

253
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,210
Who are you?

254
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,060
Again.

255
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,530
Ma'am,

256
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,780
I'm Yun Zhaoyan,

257
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,470
a tenant living in the morgue.

258
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,890
Ma'am.

259
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,670
Ma'am, are you okay?

260
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,920
Ma'am, don't scare me.

261
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,920
Get up first.

262
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,760
Are you okay?

263
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,110
Sit.

264
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,020
Ma'am, you scared me.

265
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,680
Usually, you are very aggressive.

266
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,020
Why are you so scared

267
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,540
of a gong's sound?

268
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,700
You know nothing.

269
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,340
I remember when I was little, someone told me

270
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,990
the sound of gongs

271
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,950
indicates the bandits are coming.

272
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,110
Better safe than sorry.

273
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,960
Can't you see everyone at my age

274
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,020
is gone?

275
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,820
Only I

276
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,660
am still here on the street.

277
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,460
There is a reason for that.

278
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,040
Yes.

279
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,500
Ma'am,

280
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,690
you will live a long life.

281
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,800
Those who take your longevity medicine

282
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,260
will also live a long life.

283
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,830
I'm leaving then.

284
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,290
Next time,

285
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,550
you can't forget my name again.

286
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,820
My Lord.

287
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,180
His Lordship warned me

288
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,010
not to take a step forward again.

289
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,480
But why was my heart

290
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,440
still beating so fast when I saw him?

291
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,410
No.

292
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
I can't covet him like this anymore.

293
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,080
If this continues,

294
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,590
I'll lose him, who is my talisman.

295
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,020
Why are you here?

296
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:42,940
Right,

297
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,950
it's all your fault. You left me in the Moon God Temple.

298
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,320
So I accidentally

299
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,820
confessed my feelings to His Lordship.

300
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,260
Do you know how regretful I am now?

301
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:55,590
I...

302
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,450
I wasn't refused by him.

303
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,220
I...

304
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:00,780
His Lordship...

305
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,370
just told me to stay away from him.

306
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,040
S-Stop laughing.

307
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,200
You're not even half his height.

308
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,960
Kid, you know nothing.

309
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,990
Right,

310
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,640
did you come to me

311
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,140
because you have a clue about your sister?

312
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm talking to you.

313
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,340
He left again.

314
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,130
Do you have a clue or not?

315
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,840
Princess,

316
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,560
calm down.

317
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,620
Princess.

318
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,620
Calm down.

319
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,090
Maybe Lord Ren just made an indiscreet remark.

320
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,350
An indiscreet remark?

321
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,140
He slandered me maliciously.

322
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,490
How can I not get even with him?

323
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,220
Princess, please think twice.

324
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,680
Have you thought about the consequences of going in like this?

325
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,310
Nuo,

326
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,360
do you have a clue about your sister or not?

327
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,940
Miss Yun.

328
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,380
Miss Yun, why are you here?

329
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,870
I've been looking for you.

330
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,130
What's the matter?

331
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,450
Ms. Long at the doorway of Imperial Censor's Mansion

332
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,420
fainted.

333
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,500
Fainted?

334
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,020
She has been sent to the morgue.

335
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,780
Nuo,

336
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,320
I need to go back to check on her.

337
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,280
Wait for me here.

338
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,100
Nuo?

339
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,420
My name is Bei Wu.

340
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,640
How could she make such a mistake?

341
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,290

[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

Princess.

370
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,160
Princess,

371
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,440
didn't you say you wanted to teach Lord Ren a lesson?

372
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,390
Why did you

373
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,230
teach Lord Xie a lesson instead?

374
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:59,320
Don't tell anyone

375
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,840
about what you saw just now.

376
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,430
Got it.

377
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,010
But Princess, where is your whip?

378
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
I left it inside.

379
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,410
Do you want me to get it back for you?

380
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,270
No need for that.

381
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,570
I'll come and get it next time.

382
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,590
Doctor.

383
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,220
She has come to the end of her life.

384
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,420
You'd better tell her family members

385
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,030
to see her for the last time.

386
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,090
Doctor, goodbye.

387
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,810
Ma'am.

388
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,490
Do you have any wish?

389
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,230
Well.

390
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,350
After I die,

391
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,640
don't leave me in the mass grave.

392
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,980
Just bury me in the empty area

393
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,460
next to the Moon God Temple.

394
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,690
I want to wait for my brother there.

395
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,080
Brother?

396
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,530
Yes.

397
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,490
My brother asked me to wait for him there.

398
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,430
But he didn't come back.

399
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,730
Ma'am,

400
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,000
do you still remember

401
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,960
your brother's name?

402
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,040
It's strange.

403
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,960
I remembered it clearly before.

404
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,690
I repeatedly told myself to remember it,

405
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,210
but I've still forgotten.

406
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,970
You're looking for your sister?

407
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,540
Ma'am,

408
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,390
is your brother's name

409
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,780
Nuo?

410
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,560
Nuo?

411
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,470
Yes.

412
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,810
His name is Nuo.

413
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,520
It's been so many years.

414
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,810
Has he already forgotten to come back to me?

415
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,340
Or

416
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,340
is he already...

417
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,920
Ma'am,

418
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,730
Nuo has never forgotten to look for his sister.

419
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,500
Wait here.

420
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,800
I'm going to bring him here to see you now.

421
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,080
Nuo!

422
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,860
Nuo.

423
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,450
I remember

424
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,050
he was clumsy.

425
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,110
When our mother was not with us,

426
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,080
the braid he made for me

427
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,170
looked like a steamed bun.

428
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,500
Nuo!

429
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,220
Your sister is waiting for you.

430
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,660
I've been looking for medicine

431
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,900
to gain immortality.

432
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,380
Nuo, where are you?

433
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,620
Show up now!

434
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,060
I want to live a longer life.

435
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,350
I'm going into the mountain to collect the immortality herb.

436
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,940
That thing is very rare.

437
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,750
I'll have to wait another three years

438
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,330
if I don't go now.

439
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,740
Nuo!

440
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,950
Nuo!

441
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,470
Nuo, where are you?

442
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,180
Nuo.

443
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,980
What's wrong?

444
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:08,970
My Lord,

445
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,950
I found Nuo's sister.

446
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,410
Ms. Long is Nuo's sister

447
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,110
who has been separated from him for 60 years.

448
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,740
I have to find Nuo as soon as possible.

449
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,940
Okay, let me help you.

450
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,340
Hold on tight.

451
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,210
Take a good look. Where is Nuo?

452
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,670
My Lord, I saw him.

453
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,050
Nuo is there.

454
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,320
Ma'am,

455
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,340
your brother you've been waiting for

456
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,120
is back to see you.

457
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,420
Nuo,

458
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,540
she has been waiting for you.

459
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,170
Her hair has turned grey.

460
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,360
The clouds are floating.

461
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,940
The moon is watching.

462
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,670
The rattle drum is spinning.

463
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,680
Sister, be good.

464
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,440
Sleep now.

465
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,260
The clouds are floating.

466
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,210
The moon is watching.

467
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,270
The rattle drum is spinning.

468
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,530
When the people in Qingzhou are worshiping the moon, the children are playing.

469
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:42,290
The brother is spinning the drum and his sister is smiling.

470
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,520
My brother taught me all these.

471
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,000
My family finally came to me.

472
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,270
Nuo.

473
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,890
Say goodbye

474
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,850
to your sister.

475
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,060
The brother is spinning the drum

476
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,260
and his sister is smiling.

477
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,400
Sister, be good.

478
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,360
Sleep now.

479
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,340
The clouds are floating. The moon is watching.

480
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,940
The rattle drum is spinning.

481
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,360
When the people in Qingzhou are worshiping the moon, the children are playing.

482
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,010
The brother is spinning the drum and his sister is smiling.

483
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,660
Nuo.

484
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,150
You've found your sister.

485
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,500
Now,

486
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:58,960
go where you want to go.

487
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,730
It seems Nuo

488
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,850
has found his sister.

489
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,890
The Soul Collecting Lamp will be complete soon.

490
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,550
Also, I will go back soon.

491
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,580
God Taiyin,

492
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,180
collect the immortal.

493

[Waning gibbous moon]

494
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,780
My Lord,

495
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,880
Ms. Long in the morgue died.

496
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,390
During the past ten years,

497
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,250
she finally found someone

498
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,340
to accompany her.

499
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,260
Now,

500
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,940
she's alone again.

501
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,690
My Lord,

502
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,670
you can't accompany her for long.

503
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,530
You'd better stay away from her as soon as possible.

504
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,530
Actually, I'm also

505
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,450
heartbroken.

506
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,260
You guys have many companions.

507
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,870
But the livelier it is in the lamp,

508
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,040
the lonelier it is

509
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,540
outside the lamp.

510
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,790
Ten years ago,

511
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,190
it was like this in the Guanghan Palace outside the lamp.

512
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,430
I think...

513
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,260
it was the same to her.

514
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,630
Ma'am,

515
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,200
this time,

516
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,090
you are no longer lonely.

517
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,400
Nuo will be watching you in heaven.

518
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:39,720
[To Little Zhaoyan]

519
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,100
It's Ma'am's handwriting.

520
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,280
[Long's Pharmacy]

521
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,000
Little Zhaoyan,

522
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,880
actually,

523
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,940
I always remember you.

524
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,360
I thought there was a fire somewhere.

525
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:03,970
Who are you?

526
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:06,290
But as I get older,

527
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,550
I always forget others' names.

528
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,660
Isn't her name Yun Zhaoyan?

529
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:11,820
I...

530
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,820
am Yun Zhaoyan.

531
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,080
Thank you

532
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,140
for accompanying me during the final stage of my life.

533
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,540
There is nothing I can leave to you.

534
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,220
I'll leave this morgue to you,

535
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,280
so that you can settle down.

536
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,360
Ma'am.

537
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,840
You finally remember my name.

538
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,150
But you still forgot

539
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,740
this morgue

540
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,110
is my home.

541
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,080
People die.

542
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,050
The bonds in this world

543
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,460
will disappear as they die.

544
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,250
You don't need to be too sad.

545
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,580
Yes.

546
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,420
One day,

547
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,510
you will leave too, right?

548
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,950
My fate has been decided.

549
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,380
But unlike mortals,

550
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,860
my lifespan is longer.

551
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,440
So,

552
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,350
you should only care about yourself.

553
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,170
Although I

554
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,660
feel a connection with you,

555
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,340
we are still different

556
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,130
since I'm a mortal

557
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,370
and you are a god in heaven.

558
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,950
My Lord.

559
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,850
Don't take a step forward again.

560
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,810
I'm worried...

561
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,580
I'm worried I can't help

00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,020
running to you like before.

563
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,480
Tell me.

564
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,810
Does H-His Lordship

565
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,880
like Miss Yun?

566
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,110
Of course. We all know that.

567
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,570
Yes.

568
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,080
I knew it

569
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,130
when I told their fortunes last time.

570
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,270
His Lordship just wouldn't admit it.

571
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,390
You knew that by telling fortunes?

572
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,500
I thought they're meant to be together

573
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,780
when I first saw Miss Zhaoyan.

574
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,660
F-Fortune-telling?

575
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,440
It's l-love at first sight.

576
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,890
Love at first sight?

577
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:03,770
Was he able to see things?

578
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,860
-How could it be...
-Well...

579
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,120
How could you say this?

580
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,900
His Lordship couldn't see things at first.

581
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,300
How could he fall in love?

582
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,560
It must be because of this.

583
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,820
The people are afraid of him.

584
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,950
But Miss Yun is not afraid of him.

585
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,820
He thought she's special because he has never seen anyone like her.

586
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,610
That makes sense.

587
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,410
But it seems that doesn't make sense either.

588
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,000
What do you think?

589
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,640
How would I know what His Lordship is thinking?

590
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,290
But

591
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,180
I think maybe it's because there were anomalies

592
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,870
after Miss Yun appeared.

593
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,070
We can see the moon in Qingzhou City now.

594
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,820
His Lordship's eyes have recovered too.

595
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Anyone can be attracted by Miss Yun.

596
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:39,050
She's quite pretty.

597
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:42,300
T-That's not right.

598
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,830
I've been in Qingzhou City for over ten years.

599
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,600
It was windy and rainy frequently.

600
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,830
But His Lordship doesn't think

601
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:50,470
it was because of us.

602
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:52,290
T-That's right.

603
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,230
Is it b-because

604
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,310
His Lordship is s-shy?

605
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,590
He was seen by you secretly last time.

606
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,240
That figure...

607
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,620
Be careful.

608
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:11,440
Alright.

609
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,660
How can you ask

610
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,140
about His Lordship's matters?

611
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,740
Where did you ask about them?

612
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,460
It's none of your business.

613
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,450
Tell us some inside information.

614
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,150
You know nothing.

615
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,800
His Lordship has lived for so many years.

616
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,040
He thinks he has seen through everything in life,

617
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,790
but he always believes men are born evil.

618
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,460
Finally, there is someone

619
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,670
who can make His Lordship feel warm

620
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:37,110
even when she's being nosy.

621
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:41,230
Looks like the iceberg is about to melt.

622
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,580
So noisy. I've heard enough.

623
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,610
I'm leaving.

624
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,190
Try harder!

625
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:54,490
Whether they can be together depends on you.

626
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,130
What about Miss Yun's thoughts?

627
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,370
I think Miss Yun

628
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,910
likes Lord Xie.

629
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,140
No, I don't think so.

630
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,770
M-Make a bet.

631
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,890
Wager on it.

632
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:07,400
Do you want to make a bet?

633
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,330
Let's make a bet.

634
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,580
Let's go.

635
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,240
Let's go.
