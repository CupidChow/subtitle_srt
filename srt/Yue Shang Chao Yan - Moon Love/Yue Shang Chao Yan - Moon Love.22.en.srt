[Episode 22]

4
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,390
I wonder how Miss Zhaoyan and His Lordship are doing.

5
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,670
What...

6
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,430
What just happened?

7
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,100
I was lured out by a weird shadow.

8
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,820
I chased it to the city gate and it disappeared instantly.

9
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,310
A weird shadow?

10
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,330
Could it be that someone intentionally led you out?

11
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,280
Intentionally?

12
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,740
Do you like it here?

13
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,820
Yes, I do.

14
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,250
When I was a child, I always made wishes to the moon.

15
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,340
I never thought that one day

16
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,570
I could come to the Moon Palace.

17
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,550
Do you have any regrets?

18
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,840
I allow you to be a little greedy

19
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,320
and say your regrets in front of the Moon God.

20
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,829
My biggest regret is

21
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,860
that I couldn't accompany you

22
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,320
during the past 400 years,

23
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,730
leaving you alone

24
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,180
in this cold and lonely Moon Palace.

25
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,700
Zhaoyan.

26
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,420
do you know what is at the center of the Mirror Pool?

27
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,140
Let's go.

28
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,480
The center of the Mirror Pool is the heart of the moon.

29
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,810
In there,

30
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,190
all the wishes

31
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,510
of those who pray to the moon are stored.

32
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,290
Now, let me show you

33
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,810
the most beautiful wish

34
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,510
in my heart.

35
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,340
I didn't realize

36
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,990
I was so special to you.

37
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,000
You've been special to me for a long time.

38
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,320
My Lord, is this a common occurrence in the moon?

39
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,740
Not really.

40
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,830
I'm afraid there's trouble in the mortal world.

41
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,200
Well, Qingzhou...

42
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,020
Stay here, and I'll be right back.

43
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,500
Look at the moon!

44
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,790
Oh no! The moon is gone again!

45
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,270
It looks like the moon is going to be eaten!

46
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,770
It's a bad omen. Let's go home.

47
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,020
Let's go!

48
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,940
Hurry! Let's go!

49
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,200
Let's go.

50
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,150
Heaven Emperor.

51
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,970
I know what you want to ask me.

52
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,820
Han Ying was born with me.

53
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,820
He can only gain his true self

54
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,900
by relying on someone else's entity.

55
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,510
He is destined to assist me.

56
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,700
Thus, he has become

57
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,360
my weapon in the shadows for thousands of years.

58
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,390
Heaven Emperor.

59
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,750
I have confirmed

60
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,540
that the rumor circulating in the Heavenly Palace is true.

61
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,120
Rest assured.

62
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,630
I will alleviate your worries as I have in the past

63
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,850
and eliminate that pair of eyes for you.

64
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,750
Wait.

65
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,560
Do we really need to go this far?

66
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,180
Heaven Emperor.

67
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,100
You hold the highest position in the entire world.

68
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,430
You must not disregard the natural order.

69
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,900
From the beginning,

70
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,130
you should not have interacted with that fox demon Kui Ji.

71
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,550
Chang Xi's existence

72
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,360
is already a sign of your mercy.

73
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,020
But his Eyes of Bane will inevitably cause

74
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,740
great turmoil in the Heavenly Realm in the future.

75
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
He can't stay in the Heavenly Realm.

76
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,740
You are an illusory being.

77
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,160
How could you understand the heart of an ordinary person?

78
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,960
At this point, things have become like this.

79
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,550
I can't absolve myself from the blame.

80
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,920
Han Ying hurt my mother.

81
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,500
This time,

82
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,430
I absolutely won't let him escape again.

83
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,730
Go and do what you firmly believe is right.

84
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,650
Go.

85
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,030
Go and protect the one you love dearly.

[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

87
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,180
When His Lordship was here,

88
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,180
nothing weird like this ever happened.

89
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,540
I guess even God

90
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,940
is afraid of His Lordship, the Night Guard.

91
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,380
Do you think His Lordship will come back?

92
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,140
He will.

93
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,380
Why are you so sure?

94
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,860
Why am I so sure?

95
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,750
Though His Lordship seems to be cold-hearted and ruthless,

96
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,860
I know that in the past ten years,

97
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,060
he has always been dedicated

98
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,990
to Qingzhou City.

99
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,850
If he sees Qingzhou in its current state,

100
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,880
he will definitely come back.

101
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,810
You're right.

102
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,780
So do you think Yun Zhaoyan will come back too?

103
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,940

They will both come back.

We are going back now.

112
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,270
There may be troubles in Qingzhou.

113
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,370
Are you afraid?

114
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,600
No.

115
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,650
Before I was seven, I couldn't see anything.

116
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,880
After I turned seven, I have been able to see renegade immortals.

117
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,410
I've been through so many terrifying things.

118
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,260
Now, with your hand in mine,

119
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,690
there's nothing to be afraid of.

120
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,700
However,

121
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,500
before we go back,

122
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,220
I need to temporarily

123
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,520
seal your memories of the Moon Palace.

124
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,160
Because nothing from here

125
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,240
can be taken back to the mortal world.

126
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,240
You people from the Moon Palace are so petty.

127
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,530
You don't even leave me a single memory.

128
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,580
I'll never come back.

Did you come back to see me?

My Little Zhaoyan has grown so much.

137

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,680
I miss you so much.

140
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,360
I've always been by your side.

141
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,340
But I can't see you.

142
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,360
You just need to remember my words forever.

00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,380
It's all over now.

151

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,110
As long as you want to see me,

154
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,940
I will appear by your side.

155
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,090
That's enough.

156
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,020
You talked as if

157
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,640
you had been parted by death.

158
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,020
Why are you all here?

159
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,390
We're worried about you two.

160
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,120
You disappeared one moment

161
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,850
and then suddenly reappeared.

162
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,340
With you two not around,

163
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,250
the weather outside

164
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,890
has been crazy.

165
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,570
I'm sorry

166
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,210
for making you worry again.

167
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,090
My Lord, what should we do now?

168
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,560
Sorry for leaving without saying goodbye

169
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,350
and making you worried.

170
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,310
The weather is abnormal, and there will be a huge disaster.

171
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm afraid I can't handle it alone.

172
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,440
From now on,

173
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,210
I'm afraid I will need your help

Deputy Censor Xie.

176
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,840
Take the people from the Imperial Censor's Mansion

177
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,310
and go calm the citizens

178
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,870
to prevent further unrest.

179
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,460
Yes.

180
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,220
My Lord, it was my fault.

181
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,780
I was deceived by the illusion and chased after it,

182
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,040
which allowed Han Ying to take advantage

183
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,920
and shatter the Soul Collecting Lamp.

184
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,360
Han Ying is a shadow,

185
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,710
without form or substance.

186
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,140
This time, he must have devoured other renegade immortals

187
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,700
within the Soul Collecting Lamp, resulting in this outcome.

188
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,150
So, have those renegade immortals...

189
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,580
Don't worry.

190
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,170
Until the very end,

191
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,580
there is always hope.

192
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,190
Since Han Ying

193
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,980
is still coveting your eyes,

194
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,900
this time,

195
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,820
I won't let you get hurt again.

196
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,450
Forget that. Let's go home.

197
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,550
Go take a look.

198
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,140
Yes.

199
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,920
Is there something you want to say?

200
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,210
I always feel that everything happening now

201
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,280
seems to be related to Master.

202
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,930
Your master?

203
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,350
[Impartial and Incorruptible]

204
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,400
My Lord.

205
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,270
I think

206
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,100
everything happening now

207
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,290
might be related to my master.

208
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,370
What do you mean?

209
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,820
When I was a child, I almost died on the frontier.

210
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,770
He saved me, taught me martial arts,

211
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,300
and that's why I'm still alive today.

212
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,760
After we came to Qingzhou,

213
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,940
he first had me keep an eye on you.

214
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,000
Then, after discovering the abnormality in Zhaoyan,

215
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,790
he shifted his target to her

216
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,300
and repeatedly tried to hurt her.

217
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,870
I think this is his goal.

218
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,550
Is there anything special about your master?

219
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,920
He always wears a black robe,

220
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,390
and his whereabouts are unpredictable.

221
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,920
Although I was saved by him,

222
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,780
I have never

223
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,480
seen his true face.

224
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,100
Han Ying was born with me.

225
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,140
He has no form or substance,

226
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,130
so he can only rely on someone else's entity.

227
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,690
Your master's name is Han Ying.

228
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,230
He's not an ordinary person.

229
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,760
Naturally, it’s impossible for him

230
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,240
to let you see his face.

231
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,619
After all,

232
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,460
he is just a shadow.

233
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,930
A shadow?

234
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,109
I have never been allowed

235
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,970
to do anything beyond his orders.

236
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,880
I don't want to harm you or Zhaoyan,

237
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,339
so he wants to get rid of me.

238
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
I suppose

239
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,300
I am also just a shadow

240
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,900
that works for him.

241
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,420
The drastic changes in Qingzhou City

242
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,680
are all because of him.

243
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,140
We should find an opportunity

244
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,740
to lure him out into the open.

245
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,460
My Lord,

246
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,670
I...

247
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,220
I have a risky plan.

248
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,880
Han Ying's target is Zhaoyan.

249
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,980
And Zhaoyan's eyes can see things

250
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,940
that others cannot.

251
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,140
If she can help...

252
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,180
Enough.

253
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,980
I won't let Zhaoyan take the risk again.

254
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,150
Besides,

255
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,720
she has already suffered too much

256
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,050
because of these eyes.

257
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,520
I'm sorry for being reckless.

258
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,430
Let's talk about it later.

259
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,470
Why did you suddenly come to me with this?

260
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,580
I think

261
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,770
I need to end this with him.

262
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,450
Brother Xie.

263
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,100
Zhaoyan.

264
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,750
I need your help with something.

265
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,100
What is it?

266
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,850
Can you help me deliver this letter to the princess?

267
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,240
[To Princess]

268
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,560
[To Princess]

269
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,910
What is so mysterious about it?

270
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,540
I can pass on the message for you.

271
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,420
There's no need to send a letter.

272
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,620
It's a matter between girls,

273
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,770
so it’s not appropriate for you to convey it.

274
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,330
Alright then, I will make sure to deliver it.

275
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,540
You must not peek.

276
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,140
Don't worry.

277
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,330
[Governor's Mansion]

278
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,450
Princess,

279
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,890
there's a letter for you.

280
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,200
What?

281
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,300
Ren Shique is back?

282
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,550
And he wants to meet me at the city gate?

283
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,140
He left without a word

284
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,020
and now he’s back,

285
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,790
arrogantly summoning me to see him.

286
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,990
What's so great about him

287
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,300
becoming the Moon God?

288
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,950
What god?

289
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,480
Don't ask if you don't understand.

290
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,300
So, Governor, should we reject him?

291
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:30,690
Let's go to the city gate.

292
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,740
I want to meet this Ren Shique

293
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
and see how he will explain himself.

294
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,900
I'd like to know

295
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,320
if he still acknowledges me as the city governor!

296
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,670
Xiaocha, get the carriage ready.

297
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,220
Let's take the shortcut to the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

298
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,980
Yes.

299
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,740
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

300
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,710
My Lord!

301
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Bad news, My Lord!

302
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,510
What happened?

303
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,530
The princess said

304
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,030
that the city governor has invited you to meet at the city gate.

305
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,790
It looks like he wants to accuse you of something.

306
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,960
What's there to be afraid of?

307
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,290
My Lord, don't mind him.

308
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,500
Never mind.

309
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,980
Since I'm back,

310
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,530
I should inform him anyway.

311
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,830
I'll be right back.

312
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,570
Stay and guard the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

313
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,260
Yes.

314
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,720
Let me see you out.

315
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,470
Be careful, My Lord.

316
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,570
Come in.

317
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,100
Stop looking. No one is here.

318
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,230
Hurry up.

319
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,850
Ren Shique has already gone to the city gate for the meeting.

320
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,380
Are you really going to risk yourself as bait?

321
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,180
Doing so

322
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,620
might cost you your life.

323
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:01,070
I have no other choice.

324
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,700
Qingzhou is already in peril due to these eyes,

325
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,920
with strange phenomena and imminent danger.

326
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,720
I cannot hide under protection.

327
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,580
I had to trick His Lordship into leaving to lure Han Ying into the trap.

328
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,500
Don't worry.

329
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,500
If there’s any danger later,

330
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,630
I will handle it.

331
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,550
Yun Zhaoyan,

332
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,410
today, I'll be there for our appointment.

333
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,110
What has been happening lately?

334
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,900
The weather has become increasingly strange.

335
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,020
Didn't you see how terrifyingly dark

336
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,830
the moon was last night?

337
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,980
Let's go. Something might happen tonight.

338
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,580
Let's go.

339
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,220
My Lord.

340
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,540
Why are you here?

341
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,790
I'm here for my appointment with the city governor.

342
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,880
I found it a few days ago

343
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,140
while searching in the Moon God Temple.

344
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,330
It should be useful.

345
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,710
It looks like you have completely

346
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,460
severed ties with your master.

347
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,140
I can’t let innocent people

348
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,420
get involved anymore.

349
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,600
Yun Zhaoyan,

350
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,310
are you sure that Han Ying will really be

351
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,180
particularly interested in you?

352
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,590
I'm so special

353
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,470
and easily noticeable in this open area.

354
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,440
He should be able to notice me.

355
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:41,090
You overestimated yourself again, didn't you?

356
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,830
Oh no, I want to leave.

357
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,090
I want to leave too.

358
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,510
You...

359
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,320
You can't leave. You are the bait.

360
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,650
But I suddenly remember

361
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,930
that my mother said one should not act rashly.

362
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,750
Is that all your mother told you?

363
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,410
There were other things, but I can't remember them.

364
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,580
That's the direction of the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

365
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,850
Could it be

366
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,140
that Zhaoyan is really using herself as bait

367
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,370
to lure Han Ying out?

368
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,750
Let's go.

369
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,320
Yun Zhaoyan,

370
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,380
you deliberately led me here.

371
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,680
Does this mean you have made up your mind?

372
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,300
Yun Zhaoyan,

373
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,390
this time it's my turn to protect you!

374
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,540
You overestimated yourself.

375
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,470
I'm telling you, stop trying to scare me.

376
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,370
I've seen many renegade immortals like you.

377
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,500
His Lordship will be here soon

378
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,660
to execute you.

379
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,220
The city is in darkness right now.

380
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,920
He has no time to protect you.

381
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,950
How about

382
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,130
I take your eyes right now?

383
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,980
My Lord!

384
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,900
Are you alright?

385
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,590
Princess.

386
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:46,650
Princess!

387
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,680
My Lord!

388
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,190
Chang Xi,

389
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,840
do you still think I am the shadow I used to be?

390
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,250
You can't destroy me.

391
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,710
Where I exist,

392
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,190
one begets two, two begets three, and three begets all things.

393
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,530
Renegade immortals, heed my command!

394
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,230
Kill the Moon God!

395
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,050
Chang Xi,

396
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,060
you want to protect Qingzhou,

397
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,310
but can you bear

398
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,300
the weight of the world's sins?

399
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,010
Lin Nian!

400
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,960
Do you remember

401
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,530
that Mrs. Lu said

402
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,910
there is no mother in the world

403
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,640
who doesn't care for her child?

404
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:58,030
Yiling!

405
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,300
Do you remember Sister Tianyu,

406
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,700
who threw herself into the fire to save you?

407
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,800
Daohuang!

408
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,300
His Lordship is the one

409
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,830
you all wanted me to protect with all my might!

410
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,810
Shut up!

411
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,420
Focus and listen to my order!

412
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,670
Mortals, stay away!

413
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,380
Yun Zhaoyan!

414
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,080
You are just a mortal.

415
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,260
Do you think you can influence renegade immortals with words?

416
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,340
That's pure delusion!

417
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,310
Chang Xi,

418
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,430
stop resisting.

419
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,910
Today will be the day you die!

420
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,940
Nuo.

421
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,360
The person who lives in my heart

422
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,470
is right in front of you.

423
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,310
Bi Luo.

424
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,420
Wanwan.

425
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,170
Lin Nian.

426
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,330
Daohuang.

427
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,830
Huixin.

428
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,120
Jing Ting.

429
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,190
Don't forget your true selves.

430
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,540
The people who care about you are still here.

431
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,650
Don't you remember?

432
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,820
My Lady.

433
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,410
Why does all of this feel so familiar?

434
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,450
Zhaoyan.

435
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Mother?

436
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Come.

437
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,340
Mother, I miss you so much.

438
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:22,980
Zhaoyan.

439
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,410
You are a big girl now.

440
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,540
You shouldn't cling to your mother.

441
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,670
Father?

442
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,790
Zhaoyan,

443
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,060
your father and I are very proud

444
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,850
that you can face everything in this world

445
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,370
while we are not around.

446
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,440
But this world is truly terrifying.

447
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,890
Is it still terrifying when your loved one is by your side?

448
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,600
I have met the person

449
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,320
who made me face my fears with kindness.

450
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,620
Father, Mother,

451
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,980
you must not leave me again.

452
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,790
Silly girl, you still have a long way to go.

453
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,100
As long as you always remember my words

454
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,280
and keep kindness in your heart,

455
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,540
one day,

456
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,030
the kindness will return to you.

457
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,000
My Lord!

458
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,970
Step aside! You renegade immortals!

459
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,200
Do you really want to be completely disintegrated

460
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,800
for this mere mortal?

461
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,020
This Bronze Rod is a weapon

462
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,850
forged by Heaven Emperor himself,

463
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,570
imbued with the essence of the sun and moon.

464
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,940
It can cut down traitors and rebels.

465
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,110
Thank you.

466
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,160
♫In my dream♫

467
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,120
♫I jumped and forgot myself♫

468
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:41,740
♫Hearing whispers of mountains and rivers in the mortal world♫

469
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,230
♫The sea is infinite, and I returned to this old place♫

470
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:50,790
♫Mayflies are most afraid of being affectionate♫

471
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,070
♫They spend the rest of their lives separately♫

472
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,580
-My Lord!
-Zhaoyan.

473
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,510
Are you alright?

474
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,690
I didn't expect

475
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,060
that in the end, it was they who saved me.

476
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,110
My lord,

477
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,360
Han Ying has not dissipated yet.

478
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,430
Nine phases can achieve completion, and eight phases have returned.

479
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,600
Now,

480
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,750
I have lost my physical form forever.

481
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,750
Then I shall end it all with my self-destruction,

482
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,990
leaving one phase of the nine incomplete.

483
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,210
This world will lose the balance of yin and yang,

484
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,870
the tides will be in disarray,

485
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,700
and there will never be a time of completion.

486
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,340
It turns out Miss Zhaoyan has already gotten the hairpin.

487
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,850
But why didn't she tell His Lordship?

488
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,000
My Lady.

489
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:14,330
Why does all of this

490
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,909
feel so familiar?

491
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,179
Zhaoyan.

492
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,210
Mother?

493
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,100
Come.

494
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,300
Mother, is it you?

495
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:31,870
Did you come back to see me?

496
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,810
My Little Zhaoyan has grown so much.

497
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:41,850
What's wrong?

498
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,639
Mother, I miss you so much.

499
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,250
I've always been by your side.

500
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,920
But I can't see you.

501
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,820
Silly girl.

502
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:55,650
Zhaoyan.

503
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,590
You are a big girl now.

504
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,700
You shouldn't cling to your mother.

505
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,670
Father?

506
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,810
Zhaoyan,

507
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,310
your father and I are very proud

508
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,180
that you can face everything in this world

509
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,670
while we are not around.

510
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,900
But this world is truly terrifying.

511
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,740
Is it still terrifying when your loved one is by your side?

512
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,090
I have met the person

513
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,610
who made me face my fears with kindness.

514
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,560
My Little Zhaoyan has become so brave.

515
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,310
Father, Mother,

516
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,400
you must not leave me again.

517
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,080
Silly girl,

518
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,780
you still have a long way to go.

519
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,660
As long as you always remember my words

520
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,730
and keep kindness in your heart,

521
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,170
one day,

522
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,250
the kindness will return to you.

523
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,530
We will always be with you.

524
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,650
Zhaoyan,

525
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,820
hold the hand of the one by your side tightly,

526
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,190
and be braver.
