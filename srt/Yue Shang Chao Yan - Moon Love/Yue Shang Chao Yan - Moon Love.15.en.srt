194
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,970
I can do it alone.

195
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,930
Be careful.

196
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,620
I heard you say

197
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,030
all you want to said to Ren Shique was "Thank you."

198
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,410
It was a lie, wasn't it?

00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,770
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

200
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,670
Zhaoyan.

201
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,650
Brother Xie.

202
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,330
Last night,

203
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,850
you should have known

204
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,310
why I came to the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

205
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,710
Princess has told me.

206
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,930
Sorry, Zhaoyan.

207
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,780
At first,

208
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,540
I have been investigating

209
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,470
your relationship with His Lordship.

210
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,410
I didn't expect

211
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,410
that it would put you in such danger.

212
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,370
Danger?

213
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,690
I'm long used to

214
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,450
inexplicable dangers.

215
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,440
But, Zhaoyan, don't worry.

216
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,040
This happened because of me,

217
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,740
so I will risk my life

218
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,050
to protect you.

219
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,620
It's not that serious, Brother Xie.

220
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,670
Can I know who will harm me?

221
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,130
He seems to have some history with His Lordship.

222
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,100
And he wants to investigate a special person through His Lordship.

223
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,640
If I'm not mistaken,

224
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,320
that person should be you.

225
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,930
I don't know anything else.

226
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,609
Since you are so honest,

227
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,050
I don't want to hide anything from you anymore.

228
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,270
Follow me.

229
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,490
That weird Yun Zhaoyan

230
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,640
has not only swept

231
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,400
the cold Ren Shique off his feet

232
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,420
but also enchanted Deputy Censor Xie.

233
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,860
I have to be careful.

234
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,100
No.

235
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,440
I need to talk to Ren Shique.

236
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,720
What's wrong?

237
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,110
Brother Xie.

238
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,530
Actually,

239
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,140
I can see things that others can't.

240
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,740
Things that others can't see?

241
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,900
I can see renegade immortals.

242
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,320
Renegade immortals are immortals who have made mistakes.

243
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,050
Their spirit bones were taken away,

244
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,140
so ordinary people can't see them.

245
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,930
But they still have feelings for the mortal world,

246
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,190
so they stay in the place they care about.

247
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,280
The place they care about?

248
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,290
Brother Xie, don't be nervous.

249
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,280
They only follow the people they care about quietly

250
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,410
and never disturb irrelevant people.

251
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,050
I kind of have some entanglements with them,

252
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,980
so I can see them.

253
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,850
Zhaoyan.

254
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,890
Did you tell me

255
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,540
about renegade immortals

256
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,020
because

257
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,880
I lied to you?

258
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,550
Of course not.

259
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,100
I know you hate nonsense.

260
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,830
I didn't want to tell you this,

261
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,160
but I can't explain

262
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,670
my relationship with His Lordship if I don't tell you this.

263
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,500
Anyway, that's why

264
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,700
His Lordship allowed me to stay at the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

265
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,630
And I needed to stay by his side

266
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,490
to avoid the renegade immortals' entanglement.

267
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,110
What does Master have to do with the renegade immortals?

268
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,280
Master has never shown his real face.

269
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,070
Could it be

270
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,510
that he's also transformed from a renegade immortal?

271
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,570
Brother Xie, actually,

272
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,950
there is a renegade immortal lying there.

273
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,090
There's nothing here.

274
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,290
Look.

275
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,680
I knew it was hard to explain.

276
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,080
Forget it.

277
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,370
You must be scared.

278
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,710
But that's all I was hiding from you.

279
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,460
I'll get going.

281
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,900

[Qingbing Warehouse]

283
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,120
You're slacking off again.

284
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,050
My Lord,

285
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
I think

286
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,030
I have

287
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,040
special feelings for you.

288
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,240
Don't chase me.

289
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,480
I'm here.

290
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,880
Leave now!

291
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,360
Actually, you don't have to do this.

292
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,090
You have protected me

293
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,470
more than enough.

294
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,370
I just…

295
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,730
I'm happy

296
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,910
to have been able to stay at the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

In the future,

298
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,130
I'll return to what I was like before.

299
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,060
Since you are so presumptuous,

300
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,360
I'll tolerate you one more time.

301

302
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,240
Stop following me.

303
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,290
The date you meet the person on your mind

304
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,600
hasn't been set yet?

305
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,290
Will you leave

306
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,050
after all your wish is granted?

307
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,380
If only Kui Ji could

308
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,430
express her feelings to His Lordship just like me!

309
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,010
Then, he will know

310
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,690
what danger she meant

311
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,270
and whether it's related to the danger Brother Xie mentioned.

312
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,580
Daohuang!

313
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,760
I know it's dangerous for me to think like that.

314
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,890
Don't worry. I won't lend my body

315
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,690
to the renegade immortals.

316
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,940
If they stay in the mortal world in my place forever,

317
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,880
I will never see His Lordship again.

318
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,860
Imperial Censor,

319
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,240
you told me you'd leave Qingzhou.

320
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,820
Does it still count?

321
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,150
Look.

322
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,920
Qingzhou City is in a very stable state now.

323
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,330
You can rest assured

324
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,880
and go back to where you came from.

325
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,640
Are you here to care about where I should be?

326
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,460
Aren't you leaving Qingzhou?

327
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,360
Why do you still keep Yun Zhaoyan by your side?

328
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,940
You are not obsessed with her, are you?

329
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,140
Why are you so interested in this matter?

330
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,080
It's just

331
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,280
Qing said a few drunk words last night,

332
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,930
so I'm worried about you.

333
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,540
I just want to tell you

334
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,150
that many things can't be forced.

335
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,910
Yun Zhaoyan should never

336
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,730
be the reason why you want to stay in Qingzhou City.

337
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:21,330
You seem to care a lot about her.

338
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,900
Look into my eyes.

339
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,130
My eyes

340
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,400
have seen a lot of people.

341
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,650
As long as I look into their eyes,

342
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,130
I'll know what they're thinking.

343
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,100
So, that Yun Zhaoyan…

344
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,760
I can tell it at a glance.

345
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,340
What did you see from Yun Zhaoyan?

346
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,630
Her eyes...

347
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,190
are not simple

348
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,150
and full of evil energy.

349
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,460
When I look into those eyes,

350
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,180
I knew the person owning them

351
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,520
was definitely not a good person.

352
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,870
It turns out you hate those eyes so much.

353
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,850
That kind of evil thing.

354
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:26,800
Of course I…

355
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,840
Did I say something wrong?

356
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Why did he invite me out again?

357
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,040
So what if you know martial arts?

358
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,680
Seriously.

359
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
He doesn't respect me at all.

360
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,560
Renegade immortal…

361
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,170
Sir.

362
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,010
Brother Xie.

363
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,870
Brother Xie!

364
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,050
Zhaoyan.

365
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,870
You…

366
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,080
The one you mentioned last time,

367
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,140
that renegade immortal…

368
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,600
is he

369
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,660
still here?

370
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,530
He said he helped you once.

371
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,160
Helped me?

372
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,900
I don't know what he meant,

373
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,490
but renegade immortals are not that scary.

374
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,090
After all, they are deities.

375
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,880
Besides, not all renegade immortals

376
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,250
are fierce

377
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,690
and bleed from their noses, mouths, ears, and eyes.

378
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,220
Wait.

379
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,900
I don't want to hear it anymore.

380
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,480
Then,

381
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,630
can you see them all the time?

382
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,690
Actually, I wasn't used to it at first.

383
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,220
If they suddenly appear now,

384
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,050
I will still be shocked.

385
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,780
Then,

386
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,140
how did His Lordship trust you?

387
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,250
His Lordship?

388
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,450
To me,

389
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,240
he's very special.

390
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,130
In the past,

391
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,190
I always thought we had similar experiences,

392
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,650
so we were the same people.

393
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,710
But now that I think about it,

394
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,330
I have never understood the real you.

395
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,610
I'm not

396
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,410
a very good friend to you.

397
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,930
Brother Xie, don't say that.

398
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,540
I'm grateful that you can forgive me

399
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,500
for keeping it from you for so long.

400
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,880
Besides,

401
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,100
I'm not that afraid of the renegade immortals anymore.

402
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,790
That's good.

403
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,320
I think

404
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,880
I will gradually get used to all this, too.

405
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,840
Okay.

406
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,140
I'm leaving.

407
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,020
It's okay.

408
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,450
I can get used to it.

409
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,120
I can.

410
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,050
Renegade immortals…

411
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,830
Do such things really exist?

412
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,620
Let go of me!

413
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,130
Xie Guichen, it's me!

414
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,250
I didn't mean to offend you, Princess.

415
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,840
I thought

416
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,850
I met something nonhuman.

417
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,400
Of course I'm not human.

418
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,570
I am

419
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,650
a fairy.

420
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,500
What are you doing?

421
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,500
Why are you avoiding a fairy?

422
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,910
Are you shy?

423
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,720
Let me see.

424
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,850
Even if you're a fairy,

425
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,970
you're the sneaky kind.

426
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,500
I really can't stand this kind of shock.

427
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,910
Princess, if you don't have anything special,

428
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,090
in my opinion,

429
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,040
you should stop wandering in front of the Imperial Censor's Mansion

430
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,130
and leave early.

431
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,720
What?

432
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,330
Do you feel ashamed of yourself

433
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,790
in front of a fairy like me?

434
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,730
Just think of me

435
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,930
as a damsel who looks exceptionally beautiful.

436
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,660
Told you.

437
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,790
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

438
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,110
Why are you leaving the Imperial Censor's Mansion so early?

439
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,820
Did I reveal your secret

440
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,970
to Yun Zhaoyan yesterday?

441
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,520
Do you want me to explain it to her?

442
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,850
No need.

443
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,610
We

444
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,540
have confessed to each other.

445
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,830
So soon?

446
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:38,000
I thought it would be intense.

447
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,570
How about we go to Zuiyin Tavern

448
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,730
to celebrate?

449
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,550
Just take it as a celebration

450
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,430
of your newfound relief.

451
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,490
Let's go!

452
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,250
Go!

453
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,130
No need.

454
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,710
Xie Guichen.

455
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,540
Don't play hard to get with me.

456
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,560
You'll fall for me sooner or later.

457
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
When you think about it at that time,

458
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,290
don't be ashamed with egg on your face.

459
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,080
I don't have the energy to mess around with you today.

460
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,050
But I haven't...

461
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,250
Go home and rest.

462
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,429
He rejected me and touched my shoulder.

463
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,530
What does that mean?

464
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,179
He turned me down and gave me another chance?

465
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,500
As expected from the man I like,

466
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,699
he's so difficult to get.

467
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,320
Looks like

468
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,000
I need to work harder.

469
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,100
Why did you come to the morgue

470
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,670
in the middle of the night?

471
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,540
Princess.

472
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,010
Princess, think more about it.

473
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,070
Princess.

474
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,690
Don't act on impulse.

475
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,890
Princess, calm down.

476
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,570
It might just be a slip of the tongue by Lord Ren.

477
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,820
A slip of the tongue?

478
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,370
He slandered me maliciously.

479
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,030
How can I not get even with him?

480
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,730
Princess, please think about it.

481
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,190
What the result will be if you go in like this?

482
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,960
Princess.

483
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,240
Maybe I shouldn't have told Qing that?

484
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,790
Ren Shique,

485
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,750
good luck.

486
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,320
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

487
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,780
Princess.

488
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,270
Didn't you say you wanted to teach Lord Ren a lesson?

489
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,190
Why did you teach Lord Xie a lesson in the end?

490
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,340
Don't tell anyone

491
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,880
what you saw just now.

492
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,510
Got it.

493
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,920
But, Princess, where is your whip?

494
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,010
I left it inside.

495
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,180
Do you need me to get it back for you?

496
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,280
No need.

497
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,530
I'll come and get it next time.

498
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,920
I didn't hear anything from the Imperial Censor's Mansion. Is it over?

499
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,080
Did Qing lose?

500
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,270
She even lost her armor?

501
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,290
Lord Xie,

502
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:44,250
I'm here to retrieve my whip.

503
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,890
Did you find my whip today?

504
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,400
No.

505
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,810
I have to calm down.

506
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,010
I don't care.

507
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,260
I don't care.

508
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,930
Princess.

509
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,070
I'm here...

510
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,310
Why am I here?

511
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,710
Princess, if you don't have anything special,

512
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,830
I'm leaving.
