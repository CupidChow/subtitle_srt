Let's go flower viewing.

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,070
Let's go.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,400
A bunch of kids who made a fuss over nothing!

10
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,350
Thank you, my Lord,

11
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,270
for taking me back to the morgue.

12
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,680
Take it as a reward

13
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,220
for solving the case.

14
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,480
If His Lordship

15
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,079
can send me home every day, that would be great.

16
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,620
What good things are you thinking about?

17
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,350
Why are you giggling like that?

18
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,280
Nothing.

19
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,000
I just suddenly feel

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,550
that being able to be with you feels

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,160
even better than I thought.

22
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,570
I'm glad you know it.

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,400
I will work harder

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,870
to help you find Kui Ji.

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,760
I won't cause any trouble

26
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
or make you angry again.

27
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,880
From now on,

28
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,370
when you're not at Imperial Censor's Mansion

29
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,050
or by my side,

30
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
behave properly.

31
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,280
Don't ever let this kind of thing

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,350
happen again.

33
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,480
It's too dangerous.

34
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,160
Yes.

35
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,579
Well...

36
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,840
What is it?

37
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,670
I have…

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,320
Forget it.

39
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,320
My Lord.

40
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,450
Take care when you go back home.

41
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,780
[Yun's Mansion] [The morgue]

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,240
Zhaoyan.

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Brother Xie.

44
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,880
You just came back?

45
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,840
You didn't come back all night.

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,170
I was worried about you,

47
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,580
so I came to check on you.

48
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,510
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,210
I caused you trouble again.

50
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,470
Why do you say so?

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
I just went back to the mansion.

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,079
I heard Bei Wu tell Xu Xian

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
that you took His Lordship to Jia's Mansion to save me.

54
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,070
I should thank you.

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,400
No.

56
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,630
Brother Xie, you've helped me a lot.

57
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,980
I have to thank you more.

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,080
We're friends.

59
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,310
It's only right

60
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,460
to help each other.

61
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,880
Thank you for your kindness, Brother Xie.

62
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,800
However,

63
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,240
I'd better

64
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,110
not trouble people around me,

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,100
especially you, Brother Xie.

66
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,840
So,

67
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,860
you have found the one,

68
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,690
and you want him to protect you forever?

69
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,990
I'm relieved

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,300
to see you're okay.

71
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:05,840
Well,

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll go back now.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,110
Princess.

74
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,800
Xie Guichen.

75
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,030
What do you come back so late?

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,690
Princess, you always come uninvited.

77
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
It doesn't match your noble status.

78
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,400
You should go back.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,260
Give me back my handkerchief.

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,810
This is my personal belonging.

81
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,610
I never give it to others easily.

82
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,280
If you want the handkerchief back,

83
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,800
I'll get it washed and sent back.

84
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,800
Why did you come here in person?

85
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,430
What are you doing?

86
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,300
Do you think I came here

87
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,490
just to get the handkerchief back?

88
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,190
Your wound

89
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,670
needs some more ointment.

90
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,700
Otherwise, it'll be hard to heal.

91
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,310
Thank you.

92
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,140
Don't get me wrong.

93
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,810
I'm just being grateful.

94
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,040
After all, you got hurt because of me.

95
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,159
I'd rather

96
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,880
others owe me

97
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,400
than I owe others.

98
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,720
Why do you look like that?

99
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,570
Did you get rejected by Yun Zhaoyan again?

100
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,090
You eavesdropped on us?

101
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,400
It's so easy to guess. Do I really need to eavesdrop?

102
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,080
What?

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,530
You want to mock me again?

104
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,360
I'm more than happy.

105
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,040
I mean… I'm not gloating over your misfortune.

106
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,970
Actually, in my opinion,

107
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,640
your feelings towards Yun Zhaoyan

108
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,290
are more like guilt

109
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,800
than love.

110
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,720
You simply used her before.

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,580
Then, you found out that she was honest with you.

112
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,080
So, you wanted to treat her better to make it up for her.

113
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,750
Am I right?

114
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,659
Indeed, I should feel guilty for her.

115
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,590
Maybe

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,960
you just

117
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,750
treat her

118
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,580
as someone who's in the same circumstances as you?

119
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,760
In the same circumstances?

120
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,350
Besides,

121
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,990
no couples who have mutual affection

122
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,780
behave like you two.

123
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,490
Then, Princess, what do you think

124
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,770
a couple with mutual affection

125
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
should behave like?

126
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,680
At least they should be like us.

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,760
My Lord.

128
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,880
My Lord.

129
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,960
Madam Lan is such a troublemaker.

130
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,430
It took us a lot of effort

131
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,920
to clean up her mess.

132
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
The city guards searched for her all night

133
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,760
to catch her near the city gate.

134
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,030
She's now in prison.

135
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,720
But...

136
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,230
unfortunately, her accomplices escaped.

137
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,770
By the way, my Lord,

138
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,680
Jing Yao has decided

139
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,950
to settle down in Qingzhou.

140
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,050
He'll continue his old business:

141
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,450
opening an art workshop.

142
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,520
Why don't you watch

143
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,930
your manners now?

144
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,640
I can't believe you claimed to be steady and composed.

145
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,520
My Lord,

146
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,590
who am I running errands for?

147
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,560
I was so busy that I even caught a cold.

148
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,950
This is the first time

149
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,230
I experienced the feeling of being sick.

150
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,710
There is ginseng in the warehouse.

151
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,570
I heard it's good for the mortal world's illnesses.

152
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,560
As expected, after being an imperial censor in Qingzhou City for a long time,

153
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,590
you've become more humanlike.

154
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
Madam Lan is trying to scare people by pretending to be a god.

155
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,220
She didn't know that when it comes to the bluffing tricks,

156
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,380
you are the most...

157
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,280
You're right.

158
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,140
Foxes are best at deception.

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,760
My Lord, that's not what I meant.

160
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,120
My Lord.

161
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,200
Don't follow me.

162
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,080
It's not just the deceived who are sad.

163
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,090
Maybe so are the liars.

164
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,470
The person who can solve the mystery has appeared,

165
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
but when can His Lordship's emotional knots

166
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,290
be untied?

167
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,450
[Governor's Mansion]

168
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,790
Xiaocha.

169
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,520
Isn't that Qing's food?

170
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,050
Why hasn't it been touched?

171
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,240
I don't know what happened to Princess.

172
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
She went out just now,

173
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,660
and she locked herself in the room after she came back.

174
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,010
That is so strange.

175
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,460
No wonder it's so quiet today.

176
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,890
Could something trigger her

177
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,610
a few days ago

178
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
when we looked for a husband for her?

179
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,670
It doesn't seem like it.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,090
She seems to be lovesick.

181
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,440
Sick?

182
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,210
Why didn't you take care…

183
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,920
Lovesick?

184
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,910
Who does she love?

185
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,480
Make it clear!

186
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,600
Don't run.

187
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,580
Then, Princess, what do you think

188
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,830
a couple with mutual affection

189
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,560
should behave like?

190
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,880
At least they should be like us.

191
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,680
The thought of being able to see His Lordship

192
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,440
makes a tiresome chore like cleaning

193
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,070
feel easier.

194
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,800
But

195
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,150
even if I have feelings for His Lordship,

196
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,120
would he also have feelings for me?

197
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,060
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

198
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,080
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

199
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,420
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

200
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,150
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

201
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:42,960
My Lord.

202
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,250
Who told you to do these things?

203
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,320
It's the Governor's order.

204
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,030
The Governor said

205
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,880
the facade of the Imperial Censor's Mansion

206
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,350
represents the dignity of the imperial censor.

207
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,560
So, we have to clean it

208
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,080
before patrolling today.

209
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,520
Gu Lang

210
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,680
always does these useless things.

211
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Be more careful next time.

212
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,910
Be careful not to hurt other people.

213
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,600
Yes.

214
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,440
Thank you, my Lord,

215
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,640
for saving me.

216
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,640
Are you okay?

217
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,260
Also,

218
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,640
can you be more careful when you walk?

219
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,820
Don't always look down.

220
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,470
Is he concerned about me?

221
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,050
By the way, my Lord,

222
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,440
you

223
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,250
rarely go out of the inner hall.

224
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,080
Why are you

225
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,320
at the gate today?

226
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,920
That's because…

227
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,080
it was too noisy out the gate.

228
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,400
So,

229
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,730
I came out to have a look.

230
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,100
Why are you still standing out here?

231
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,730
I have something to tell you.

232
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:53,790
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

233
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,020
They are busy with patrolling the streets.

234
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,630
I asked you here today

235
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,880
for this matter, too.

236
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,240
Every year, the Governor of Qingzhou City will take the lead

237
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,400
in patrolling the streets

238
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,860
and appeasing the people.

239
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,040
They always like to play this kind of boring gimmick.

240
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,640
I see.

241
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,520
But what does that

242
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,280
have anything to do with me?

243
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,800
Lord Guigui

244
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,240
got sick a few days ago.

245
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,640
He's still in bed and refuses to get up.

246
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:44,350
So, you have to replace him

247
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,670
to stay by my side.

248
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,840
Stay by your side?

249
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,920
Don't overthink.

250
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,740
I keep you by my side

251
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,400
just in the hope that you can help me find Kui Ji.

252
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,760
My Lord,

253
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,630
how about

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,320
I get sick again?

255
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,490
I can have some soup.

256
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,680
Then,

257
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,520
I can be by your side

258
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,320
and wait for Kui Ji to possess me.

259
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,040
That way…

260
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,390
I can sleep by your side.

261
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,320
No need.

262
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,240
In the future,

263
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,990
there will be a chance for us to find out the truth.

264
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,680
Let's go.

265
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,260
Let's get prepared first.

266
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,520
What should we prepare?

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,830
My Lord.

268
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,270
Raise your arms.

269
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,250
As my personal attendant,

270
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,200
remember to follow me closely

271
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,060
when we patrol the streets later.

272
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,720
If we get separated,

273
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,020
and you meet a renegade immortal,

274
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,430
it won't be as simple as losing dignity.

275
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
I understand.

276
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,660
Is there anything else I need to do?

277
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,360
If there's strong light,

278
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,240
you have to hold an umbrella for me.

279
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,650
The scorching sun

280
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,040
is annoying.

281
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,240
In my opinion,

282
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,950
although you seem to take everything in stride,

283
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,080
you actually have

284
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,350
your own dislikes and preferences.

285
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,480
Then, this way, you

286
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,040
are no different

287
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,520
from a mortal.

288
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,080
As God Taiyin,

289
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,810
how can I be the same as a mortal?

290
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,920
You look

291
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,990
exceptionally

292
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,530
like a mortal nobleman today.

293
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,870
I'm really nervous

294
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,359
whenever I think of patrolling with you later.

295
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,640
If you're afraid,

296
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,520
put your hand

297
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,790
here.

298
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,560
Let's go.

299
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,990
Hello, everyone.

300
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,750
Governor.

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,750
Mr. Governor.

303
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,500
Mr. Governor.

304

305
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,520
My Lord.

306
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,540
The people are so enthusiastic.

307
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,240
Just smile a little.

308
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,600
Is it necessary?

309
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,720
Yes.

310
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,110
Imperial Censor.

311
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,560
Okay.

312
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,280
My Lord.

313
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,480
I told you

314
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,840
to follow me closely.

315
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,510
Let's go.

316
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,370
Those Eyes of Bane

317
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,120
are really with Yun Zhaoyan.

318
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,400
Xie Guichen is of some use after all.

319
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,560
Yun Zhaoyan. Ren Shique.

320
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,010
Just wait.

321
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,670
The real torment those eyes will bring

322
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,740
has just begun.

323
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,920
Today,

324
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,040
I troubled you again.

325
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,140
As my personal attendant,

326
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,960
protecting you

327
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,400
is just what I should do.

328
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,310
But

329
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,350
many people

330
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,080
saw you holding my hand.

331
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,040
That way…

332
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,500
When did I ever care about what others think?

333
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,640
I'm thirsty.

334
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,840
If you really feel guilty,

335
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,430
go get me a cup of tea.

I...

342
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,840
I was

343
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,880
distracted.

344
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,080
I was thinking about how you helped me out of a tight spot,

345
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,140
so I didn't pay attention to my steps.

346
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,360
Now…

347
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm not thirsty anymore.

348
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
Y-You can go back now.

349
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,880
Well,

350
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,060
rest early.

351
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,600
I'm leaving.

352
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,680
I saw everything just now.

353
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,960
What did you see?

354
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,000
Miss Zhaoyan

355
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,070
looked so shy.

356
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,800
You're still sick, so you must be mistaken.

357
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,160
Actually, I always think

358
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,930
Miss Zhaoyan is quite pitiful.

359
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,680
She doesn't look normal,

360
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,870
but she's kind

361
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,040
and interesting.

362
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,120
If someone could always take care of her

363
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,040
in Qingzhou City,

364
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,840
what a great thing it would be.

365
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,440
On most days,

366
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,920
I thought you just liked

367
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,240
teasing Miss Zhaoyan.

368
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,940
Now that I think about it,

369
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,260
you've been different since long ago.

370
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,170
You never cared about anyone,

371
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,720
but Miss Zhaoyan could always piss you off.

372
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,980
What's interesting is

373
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,030
no matter how you alienated her,

374
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,690
Miss Zhaoyan seemed to be invincible.

375
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,180
Actually, I quite like Miss Zhaoyan.

376
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,640
I always felt

377
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,640
you looked so much like a human

378
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,500
when you were bickering with her.

379
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,360
Now that I have to be a human,

380
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
isn't it better for me to behave more humanly?

381
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,400
Yes.

382
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,210
There's nothing wrong with being a human.

383
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,110
But my Lord,

384
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,120
when you fell into the mortal world voluntarily back then,

385
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,050
you did it out of anger and impulse.

386
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,960
The Heaven Emperor was furious with your behavior.

387
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,000
I wonder

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
if he'll allow you to stay in the mortal world for long.

389
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,890
Heavenly Realm.

390
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,360
Human world.

391
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,900
I wish

392
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,180
I was born a mortal.

393
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,350
My Lord.

394
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,910
You may leave.

395
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,310
Guichen!

396
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,670
Master.

397
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,740
When Ren Shique was on patrol,

398
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,910
I saw Yun Zhaoyan.

399
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,460
I didn't expect that ordinary-looking woman

400
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,660
to turn out to be kind of special.

401
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,130
No wonder not only does Ren Shique care about her so much,

402
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,150
but my disciple is also bewitched.

403
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,790
She made both of you

404
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,970
be willing to do anything for her.

405
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,120
Master.

406
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,780
Zhaoyan…

407
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,900
She is a kind girl.

408
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,060
Ridiculous!

409
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,480
Our mission

410
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,740
is to uphold justice in heaven and earth.

411
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,030
But you forgot everything

412
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,040
because of your personal feelings.

413
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,650
You trust others so easily.

414
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,480
You really disappoint me!

415
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Maybe

416
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,040
I treated you too well

417
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,610
and made you forget what you were like before.

418
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,630
Master.

419
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,400
I never forgot

420
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,440
you saved me,

421
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,040
who was lonely and helpless ten years ago,

422
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,320
and taught me martial arts.

423
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,180
That's why I'm still alive today.

424
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,690
But Master,

425
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,310
what does Zhaoyan

426
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,900
have to do with your so-called justice?

427
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,220
I have never seen your face clearly.

428
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,120
Neither do I know

429
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,760
what you asked me to investigate Ren Shique and Yun Zhaoyan

430
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,920
for.

431
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,400
Since you're questioning me now,

432
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,430
I'll do

433
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,920
the rest myself.

434
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,780
You're really good at concealing your whereabouts

435
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,000
and being a spy.

436
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,680
Why do you say so?

437
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:21,090
You often come in here late at night.

438
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,140
Do you think I know nothing?

439
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,720
I came here

440
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,710
I have my own reasons to be here.

441
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,160
Why did you do that?

442
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,280
I did it for someone.

443
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,400
For whom?

444
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,720
Please forgive me, my Lord.

445
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
I can't reveal his identity.

446
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,720
I don't even know

447
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,600
what his real identity is.

448
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,040
Aren't you afraid of

449
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,050
dying in the Imperial Censor's Mansion for this person?

450
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,210
If you want to kill me,

451
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,500
just do it.

452
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,070
Go.

453
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,210
Thank you, my Lord.

454
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,490
How do you want to deal with Deputy Censor Xie?

455
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,880
Tell him not to leave the Imperial Censor's Mansion.

456
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,670
Use Xie Guichen as bait

457
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,590
to lure out the mastermind

458
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,990
and see what that person really wants to do.

459
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,890
Could it be the Heaven Emperor?

460
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,320
His Lordship's handwriting

461
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,160
is as good-looking as his looks.

462
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,040
Kui Ji.

463
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,590
You finally showed up.

464
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,120
What's wrong?

465
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,520
Just now,

466
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,120
I met Kui Ji.

467
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,360
Did she

468
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,440
say anything?

469
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,580
She said back then, she was bewitched by someone,

470
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,240
and her mind was manipulated.

471
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,360
It wasn't her intention

472
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,310
to take your eyes.

473
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,860
Then, who was that person?

474
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,480
I asked her several times,

475
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,010
but she refused to tell me that person's name.

476
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
However, she said

477
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,400
she hoped you could live in peace.

478
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,080
Judging from her expression,

479
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,440
she was indeed terrified.

480
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,840
Mother.

481
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,490
Why are you sad about Father again?

482
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,120
No.

483
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm not sad.

484
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,550
But I clearly heard what you're thinking.

485
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,400
You are definitely sad.

486
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,750
Because of fear,

487
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,970
she's afraid to tell the truth.

488
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,250
And yet she wanted me to live in peace?

489
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,330
Who knows

490
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,560
if this is an excuse for her guilty conscience?

491
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,920
My Lord.

492
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,560
Forget it.

493
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,960
Maybe the truth I want to know

494
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,280
will make me suffer more.

495
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,560
My Lord,

496
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,440
will you trust me for once?

497
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
I think

498
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,800
Kui Ji has her reasons.

499
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,000
Looking into her eyes,

500
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,730
she was full of concern for you.

501
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,720
She had no malice at all.

502
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,310
She also reminded you

503
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,220
that there was danger around you.

504
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,330
If she really wanted to hurt you,

505
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,240
why did she ask me to remind you?

506
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,790
Do you really think those simple words

507
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,940
can dispel my grudges for the past ten years?

508
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,800
But...

509
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,950
didn't you also

510
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,670
suspect that

511
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,870
taking your eyes was not Kui Ji's intention?

512
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,000
That's why you wanted me to ask about the truth, isn't it?

513
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,320
If that's not the truth,

514
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,680
why didn't she tell me back then?

515
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,860
It seems

516
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,680
she doesn't care about my hatred towards her.

517
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,410
Nor does she care about

518
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
the agony I've suffered

519
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,920
for the past ten years.

520
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,210
It might be, as she said,

521
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,780
that there might be

522
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,540
some unknown danger?

523
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,350
My Lord.

524
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,430
I know you have been

525
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,320
confused and wronged these years,

526
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,880
but you couldn't tell anyone.

527
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,480
You said

528
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,120
I couldn't understand your pain.

529
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,760
But I want to tell you

530
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,560
that I can relate to you.

531
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,880
Because

532
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,280
I spent the same ten years with you.

533
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,650
Why can't you trust her once?

534
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,240
Just like you trusted me.

535
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,110
You were the one

536
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,310
who protected me before.

537
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
From now on,

538
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,800
let me protect you instead.

539
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,720
After all,

540
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,280
I have your extraordinary eyes.

541
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,670
With my eyes,

542
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
you can see so many horrible things.

543
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,570
How can you still smile?

544
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,670
If I were you,

545
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,040
I would rather not be able to see

546
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,510
or hear.

547
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,960
My Lord.

548
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,680
This time,

549
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,070
you don't have to listen

550
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,510
or look.

551
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,910
Let me protect you.

552
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,940
My Lord.

553
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,330
Are you feeling better?

554
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,760
I'm fine.

555
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,310
But you don't look well.

556
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,600
Kanxu.

557
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,080
The emotional knots that have been bothering me for over ten years

558
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,610
have finally come to an end.

559
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,480
Are you talking about Kui Ji?

560
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,120
Did she appear?

561
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,160
She told Yun Zhaoyan

562
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,800
that she didn't mean to take my eyes.

563
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,280
She was bewitched.

564
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,000
That's why she did the thing

565
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,600
that made her regret so much.

566
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,880
You mean

567
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,710
someone bewitched Kui Ji?

568
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,679
She refused to say

569
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,000
who the one who bewitched her was, no matter what.

570
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,989
Looks like we need to go back to the Heavenly Palace

571
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,920
if we really want to know the truth about this matter.

572
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,389
Back to the Heavenly Palace?

573
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,770
Are you monitoring Ren Shique?

574
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,040
Is he your target?

575
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,510
Whether he is or not doesn't matter.

576
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,720
The Imperial Censor already knew I was monitoring him.

577
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,450
I will leave the Imperial Censor's Mansion soon.

578
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,600
I'm afraid

579
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
I won't return to Qingzhou anymore.

580
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,280
Don't worry.

581
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,240
Based on what I know about Ren Shique,

582
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,280
he is

583
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,960
extremely arrogant.

584
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,790
I think he will keep you in the Imperial Censor's Mansion

585
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,360
and torture you slowly.

586
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,740
If you're afraid that you have nowhere to go,

587
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,720
you can come to the Governor's Mansion.

588
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,240
You'll be warmly welcome at our place.

589
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,400
I can give you

590
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,370
that sense of security.

591
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,880
Security.

592
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,960
Just based on our short contact,

593
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,350
you trust me and believe that I'm a good person?

594
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,430
I trust you.

595
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,390
Trust me?

596
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,590
My Lord.

597
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,360
Yun Zhaoyan.

598
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,440
How long do you want to stay here in the Imperial Censor's Mansion?

599
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,630
No.

600
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,680
I told you I would protect you.

601
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,440
I must keep my promise.

602
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,280
From now on,

603
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,520
wherever you are,

604
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,400
I will be there.

605
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,070
You can't get any more

606
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,960
useful information from Kui Ji.

607
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,120
In your opinion,

608
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,400
what's the use

609
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,480
for me to keep you?

610
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,160
But...

611
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,130
Of course I'm useful.

612
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,820
I have your eyes.

613
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,760
After all,

614
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,340
I'm an exceptional talent in Qingzhou City.

615
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,480
Well,

616
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,780
the Qingbin Warehouse can't operate smoothly without me.

617
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,840
I also took care of

618
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,120
the plants.

619
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,630
They

620
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,240
don't want me to leave, either.

621
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,440
What else?

622
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,710
I told you,

623
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,280
I'd listen

624
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,860
and look in your place.

625
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,280
You can't live without me, either.

626
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,830
Besides...

627
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,880
I mean,

628
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,570
I just want to stay by your side.

629
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,880
My Lord, what do you mean?

630
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
I don't want to leave.

631
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,400
I have nowhere else to go

632
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,280
other than this place.

633
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,100
I mean,

634
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,720
take the money

635
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,870
and renovate the morgue

636
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,100
inside and out.

637
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,120
Since

638
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,670
you regard that shabby place

639
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,570
as your home,

640
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,570
it should at least look like a home.

641
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,240
This is your monthly salary.

642
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,240
My…

643
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,880
My Lord, do you mean...

644
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,820
I can stay in the Imperial Censor's Mansion?

645
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,000
Yun Zhaoyan.

646
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,320
Now, my eyes are on you.

647
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,120
My eyes

648
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,610
are unique in the heaven and on the earth.

649
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,300
So naturally,

650
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,000
you're a precious person in the mortal world.

651
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
From now on,

652
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,640
stay in Qingzhou City.

653
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,710
[Xie Guichen]

654
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,520
Dear deities,

655
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,570
no matter who of you hears my prayer,

656
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,480
please bless His Lordship to get over his emotional knots

657
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,130
and become happy every day.

658
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,160
Moon God, may you bless me, Gu Qing.

659
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,970
My love journey has been uneventful lately.

660
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,920
Hope it can continue in the future.

661
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,680
Look, Princess.

662
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,600
Isn't that Yun Zhaoyan?

663
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,430
Whose name did you write?

664
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,360
Princess.

665
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,180
What a coincidence.

666
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,650
You're here, too?

667
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,250
Whose name did you write?

668
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,560
Xie Guichen.

669
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,140
Yun Zhaoyan, you've been a coward since you were young.

670
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,100
It seems that in terms of marriage,

671
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,760
you'll lag behind me, too.

672
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,440
Of course. Naturally, I can't beat you in anything.

673
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,180
By the way,

674
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,620
I'm sorry about

675
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,460
about the bronze mirror before.

676
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,380
I had no choice.

677
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,700
Of course it was your fault.

678
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,000
But…

679
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,610
I don't think you did it on purpose.

680
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,450
You're such a coward,

681
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,120
yet you barged into the Governor's Mansion.

682
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,080
You must have had a reason.

683
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,560
I'll make myself accept

684
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,360
your apology.

685
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,790
[Governor's Mansion]

686
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,950
After all the days I spent hunting,

687
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,710
I finally had a good sleep.

688
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,130
In Qingzhou City, Ren Shique could take care of the business affairs

689
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,380
and Qing the family affairs. I'm not even needed.

690
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,860
No.

691
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,790
If this goes on, I'll be sidelined.

692
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,030
Where is my dignity as the City Governor?

693
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,430
Am I right, Ding?

694
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,450
Governor.

695
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,960
Recently, many strange cases have been solved in Qingzhou City.

696
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,280
It's a good thing that everyone should celebrate.

697
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,480
Why don't we

698
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,030
bring forward the the annual Street Patrol and Resident Visits

699
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,120
to today?

700
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,470
By then, you can also...

701
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,330
Yes! Go, now.

702
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:28,280
Ask everyone to get it done.

703
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,840
I

704
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,360
am going to patrol the streets and visit the people.

705
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,100
Yes.

706
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,030
Xiaocha.

707
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,420
Isn't that Qing's food?

708
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,670
Why hasn't it been touched?
