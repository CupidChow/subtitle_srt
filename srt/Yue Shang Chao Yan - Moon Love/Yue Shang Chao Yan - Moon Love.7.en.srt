00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,630
they mocked me and insulted me.

193
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,710
Her hands are so scary.

194
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,710
I wonder if she can make clothes anymore.

195
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,980
Of course not.

196
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,470
Look at her.

197
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,610
What are you doing?

198
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,580
Why?

199
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,970
Jing Ting.

200
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,440
Fang Qin has been wanting to tell you this.

201
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,110
I heard that Master Jing Ting

202
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,310
is drawing a very complicated pattern.

203
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,000
Her hand is injured.

204
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,830
Otherwise, the new pattern would have been made long ago.

205
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,250
It's really tough for her. Look at her.

206
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,430
What are you doing?

207
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,730
What are you doing?

208
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,630
You were popular in the city because of your craftsmanship.

209
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,310
People in the city wouldn't care about your appearance.

210
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,420
Instead, they would admire you.

211
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,670
Jing Ting.

212
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,780
Fang Qin

213
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,830
asked me to tell you

214
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,170
that you'd always be the signature of Jingyi Store.

215
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,660
She will finish the Ruyi Phoenix pattern

216
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,020
for you.

217
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,650
Although your appearance has been damaged,

218
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,630
your skills will last forever.

219
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,900
Thank you.

220
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,870
[Jingyi Store]

221
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,590
God Taiyin.

222
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,270
Return to your place.

223
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,150
Why am I dressed like this?

224
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,310
Prepare a carriage for me. I want to go home.

225
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,790
Princess, you specifically told me

226
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,150
that you wanted to show everyone

227
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,670
your beauty.

228
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,600
You specifically asked the carriage not to follow you.

229
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,590
I want to go back. I want to go back!

230
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,610
Go back to your business.

231
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,320
How did he see me?

232
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,870
I happened to be patrolling the streets.

233
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,470
Princess,

234
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,330
you seem to get into some trouble.

235
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,160
Let me send you back.

236
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,190
Lord Xie,

237
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,750
just pretend you didn't see me today.

238
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,970
Don't remember me like this.

239
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,850
I didn't see you today.

240
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,840
I'll take my leave.

241
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,750
Princess.

242
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,910
Princess, you're finally back!

243
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,390
I couldn't find you.

244
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,550
Are you okay?

245
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,870
How did you come back?

246
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,350
Lord Xie from theImperial Censor's Mansion sent me back.

247
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,040
Princess, look at this.

248
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,560
I have no choice.

249
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,090
Please forgive me.

250
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,810
Yun Zhaoyan left this in our mansion.

251
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,710
Princess.

252
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,340
That girl we ran into just now was Yun Zhaoyan.

253
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,110
That Yun Zhaoyan!

254
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,840
She wanted to take my mirror away again and again.

255
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,330
However,

256
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,740
after my mirror was taken away,

257
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,060
I haven't heard

258
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,690
those strange voices again.

259
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:48,970
My Lord,

260
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,830
why did you suddenly show up at the Governor's Mansion?

261
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,390
Were you worried about my safety?

262
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,530
I knew you were my talisman.

263
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,790
I was just passing by.

264
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,430
Don't be so full of yourself.

265
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,390
Just passing by?

266
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,180
Fate must have brought us together!

267
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,640
By the way, My Lord, since the incident of Jing Ting,

268
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,850
I haven't slept well

269
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,360
for a long time.

270
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,030
Can you...

271
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,070
No.

272
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,150
My Lord, I'm so sleepy.

273
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,190
Please help me.

274
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:30,980
Just...

275
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,130
You...

276
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,360
You really have no shame.

277
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,560
Somehow,

278
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,390
since I became your bait,

279
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,700
other than Kui Ji,

280
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,830
all the other renegade immortals came to me in groups.

281
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,710
It's harder for me to sleep well.

282
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,450
Is that my fault?

283
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,300
Of course not.

284
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,030
It's just that this way,

285
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,370
I can't focus

286
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,170
on helping you find Kui Ji.

287
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,310
I allowed you to stay in the Imperial Censor's Mansion,

288
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,010
but don't push your luck.

289
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,190
I know.

290
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,690
But that night,

291
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,000
we didn't disturb each other.

292
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,730
Don't mention that night again.

293
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,990
What you need to do now

294
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,390
is to help me find Kui Ji as soon as possible.

295
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,800
Then, My Lord,

296
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,130
please tell me more

297
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,130
about Kui Ji.

298
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,700
If you want to know more about Kui Ji,

299
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,530
go ask Guigui.

300
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,880
Also,

301
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,950
you...

302
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,080
Yun Zhaoyan.

303
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,660
Are you listening to me?

304
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,080
Yes, I am.

305
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,110
I will help you find…

306
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:51,990
You...

307
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,370
My Lord?

308
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,600
My Lord.

309
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,280
Now, you like to rest in the tree?

310
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,110
Someone is inside.

311
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,060
I see.

312
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,300
Is that a special reward from you?

313
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,950
After Jing Ting went back to the Soul Collecting Lamp,

314
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,080
the moon phase will be fuller tonight.

315
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,310
I didn't expect

316
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,780
the one who made the moon look full

317
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,270
would be Miss Zhaoyan.

318
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,540
She is not as important as you said.

319
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,300
Fine.

320
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,650
My Lord, you can see things now.

321
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,440
Have you remembered anything from the past?

322
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,540
You old man.

323
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,600
I can't hide anything from you.

324
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,590
You'd be capable, too, if you lived a thousand years.

325
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,690
But I still can't see those renegade immortals.

326
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,210
Including Kui Ji?

327
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,890
The more clearly you see some things,

328
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,770
the more disappointed you are.

329
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,390
Guigui,

330
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,690
do you know what the most boring thing in the mortal world is?

331
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
Time in the mortal world

332
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,060
is like a white horse crossing a gap.

333
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,640
It's a rapidly changing world.

334
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,970
I'm still very interested,

335
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,570
so I don't think it's boring.

336
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,310
People's lives are too short.

337
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,330
Sincerity

338
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,340
can last but a few years.

339
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,890
The gods' lifespan is long.

340
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,510
So if they're unpredictable,

341
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,950
it's just normal.

342
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,090
In the world,

343
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:55,970
humans and

344
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:56,850
gods

345
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,110
are all the same.

346
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,310
But right now,

347
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,330
there seems to be someone

348
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,530
who can last forever.

349
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,440
Yun Zhaoyan.

350
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,220
In my opinion,

351
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,540
you treat Miss Zhaoyan

352
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,290
differently.

353
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,520
She's just

354
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,820
bait to find Kui Ji.

355
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,160
How many times do I have to tell you?

356
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,940
But she has

357
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,210
your eyes on her.

358
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,210
But how could I forget

359
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,260
the end of those eyes?

360
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,900
Those eyes

361
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,640
and that person…

362
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,230
I should have stayed far away from them.

363
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,760
Otherwise, I would regret it

364
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,160
like when I was in the Heavenly Palace.

365
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,380
From now on,

366
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,150
unless it's related to the renegade immortals,

367
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,550
I won't have much contact

368
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,180
with Yun Zhaoyan

369
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,340
on other matters.

370
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,550
Sometimes, in the mortal world,

371
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,690
the more you want to avoid something,

372
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,240
the more you can't avoid it.

373
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,980
Yun Zhaoyan...

374
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
is just bait.

375
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,610
Yes!

376
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,590
She's just a bait.

377
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,620
Guigui.

378
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,790
I was looking for you.

379
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,370
His Lordship said

380
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,950
I can ask you

381
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,380
for details about Kui Ji.

382
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,710
I am waiting for you here, Miss Zhaoyan.

383
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,240
Is that a bad memory?

384
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,230
In the Moon Palace,

385
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,080
there is a Guanghan Palace.

386
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,670
That's where His Lordship used to live.

387
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,660
His Lordship

388
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,830
was born by a fox demon, Kui Ji, with the Heaven Emperor

389
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,590
when he was experiencing hardships in the mortal world.

390
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,350
His name is Chang Xi.

391
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,730
He was born with peculiar eyes.

392
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,710
He can see through the desires of all beings.

393
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,870
But because of that,

394
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,230
he was often caught in trouble.

395
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,390
You tattletale by telling the Holy Man

396
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,790
I was the one who ate three heavenly fruits yesterday.

397
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,730
But you did eat the heavenly fruits.

398
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,810
[Little Chang Xi]

399
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,140
You weren't at

400
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,990
the heavenly tree yesterday.

401
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,550
How do you know who ate it?

402
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,470
Did you use your eyes

403
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,680
to pry into our minds again?

404
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,160
Yes.

405
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:37,910
Exactly.

406
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,530
He's just like his mother.

407
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,750
They are both monsters.

408
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,330
I think

409
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,700
his mother abandoned him

410
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,370
because of his eyes.

411
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:46,790
Look.

412
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,960
His eyes!

413
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,420
Stop!

414
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,720
Father!

415
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,490
[The Heaven Emperor]

416
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,330
His Lordship

417
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,790
was punished by the Heaven Emperor  because of that thing

418
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,250
and went to the Moon Palace

419
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,670
to guard the Soul-locking Lamp.

420
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,480
Chang Xi.

421
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,490
Unexpectedly, on a full moon night ten years ago,

422
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,370
Kui Ji

423
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,350
appeared in the Soul Collecting Lamp.

424
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,330
Mother.

425
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,580
Is that you?

426
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,710
His Lordship was bewitched by Kui Ji

427
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,540
because he missed his mother so much.

428
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,300
He smashed the Soul Collecting Lamp

429
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,750
and let the renegade immortals escape everywhere,

430
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,480
which caused a great disaster.

431
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,520
Mother.

432
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,590
It's really you.

433
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,070
You're really in the Soul Collecting Lamp.

434
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,610
Chang Xi.

435
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,510
Mother.

436
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,280
Since those eyes are the bane,

437
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,110
I will take them back.

438
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,140
God.

439
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,330
[Wu Tu]

440
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,840
Wu Tu.

441
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,260
God.

442
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,380
Don't come over.

443
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,400
No.

444
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,880
God, be careful.

445
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,160
Kanxu!

446
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,110
Kui Ji, how dare you!

447
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,210
I'm Kanxu.

448
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,610
[Kanxu]

449
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,870
Greetings, Heaven Emperor.

450
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,450
A century of reflection

451
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,390
has not improved you much.

452
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,550
The Soul Collecting Lamp

453
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,310
is where the renegade immortals of the moon phase return.

454
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,950
Now you've destroyed it,

455
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,630
and the renegade immortals are scattered everywhere.

456
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,350
They will cause chaos in the mortal world.

457
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,170
Chang Xi,

458
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,010
you caused this disaster.

459
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,970
You will be the one to deal with it.

460
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,750
You are not allowed to return to the palace

461
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,150
before all the renegade immortals return.

462
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,170
At that time,

463
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,870
His Lordship was so discouraged

464
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,180
that he gave up his eyes

465
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,040
and stayed in the mortal world.

466
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,560
That's what happened.

467
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,620
That's where

468
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,690
you got your eyes.

469
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,710
The nine moon phases are transformed from the renegade immortals in the Soul Collecting Lamp.

470
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,910
When the renegade immortals all return

471
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,310
and the Soul Collecting Lamp is back to normal,

472
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,030
the moon phase can also be full.

473
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,900
Then,

474
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,080
His Lordship can go back to the heaven.

475
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,160
It's just because of Kui Ji,

476
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:55,910
he...

477
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,010
he doesn't want to go back.

478
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,590
I can't believe his mother

479
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,110
could do such a thing to him.

480
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,850
Didn't Kui Ji leave any words

481
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,390
before she disappeared?

482
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,980
Maybe she had her reasons.

483
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,650
Until now,

484
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:19,820
no one knows

485
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,620
why Kui Ji did that.

486
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,080
No one knows how Kui Ji was trapped

487
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,140
in the Soul Collecting Lamp, either.

488
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,320
It's just His Lordship was so pitiful.

489
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,470
Since then,

490
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,260
he has buried all the past in his heart,

491
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,960
and has never

492
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,670
stepped into the Moon Palace for ten years.

493
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,360
His Lordship was hurt by his mother

494
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,110
and then abandoned.

495
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,850
How sad could he be?

496
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,800
But it's strange.

497
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,350
The way Kui Ji looked at His Lordship

498
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,700
was the same as the way my mother looked at me

499
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,910
before she died.

500
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,770
There was even more sadness in her eyes.

501
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,120
She didn't look like

502
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,320
someone who wanted to hurt their child.

503
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,420
Miss Zhaoyan,

504
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,370
if you can solve His Lordship's problem,

505
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,370
that would be a great relief for him.

506
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,470
My Lord.

507
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,070
You're here.

508
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,910
Didn't I ask you to look for Kui Ji?

509
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,240
What are you doing here?

510
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,440
By the way,

511
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,480
I have something to tell you.

512
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,440
What is it?

513
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,180
When I met Kui Ji before,

514
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,050
she looked at you silently,

515
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,380
looking very sad.

516
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,630
It didn't seem like she was faking it.

517
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,110
I was wondering

518
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,350
if there might be some misunderstanding

519
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,230
between her and you.

520
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,160
Or maybe she has her reasons?

521
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,540
She has her reasons?

522
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,170
If you're always restrained

523
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,970
by the past resentment,

524
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,760
then

525
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,880
you will never be happy.

526
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,290
Be restrained by the past resentment…

527
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,790
Since those eyes are the bane,

528
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,900
I will take them back.

529
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,470
Yun Zhaoyan.

530
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,100
Indeed, I can't get along with you too much.

531
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,720
You don't know

532
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,260
what suffering I've experienced in the past.

533
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,460
You thought they were so minor

534
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,010
that just a few words can make me forgive them.

535
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,310
You want me to forget

536
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,450
what I've suffered in the past

537
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,730
just by a look from her?

538
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,550
You're too full of yourself.

539
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,630
My Lord, I didn't…

540
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,150
Since there are no renegade immortals here,

541
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,430
get out of my sight.

542
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,580
Stop talking nonsense here.

543
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,340
I'm sorry.

544
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,150
I just want you

545
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,980
to feel better.

546
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,120
Kui Ji.

547
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,820
Come to me!

548
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,900
Kui Ji.

549
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,540
Kui Ji.

550
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,389
You're finally here.

551
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,130
If you stay away longer,

552
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,420
His Lordship would be so sad.

553
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,550
Every time when I am weak,

554
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,870
those renegade immortals

555
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,130
will seize the chance and occupy my body.

556
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,340
So,

557
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,270
I never dare to cry

558
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:53,780
or drink.

559
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,050
Come and possess me.

560
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,080
I'm ready.

561
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,560
Make it clear with His Lordship.

562
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:16,550
Don't make him so sad again.

563
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:30,060
Get up. I'll take you home.

564
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,900
Sir, what would you like to order?

565
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,460
Do you have any wine?

566
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,310
Yes, we have all kinds of wine here.

567
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,910
What kind of wine do you want?

568
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,390
I want the strongest wine.

569
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,150
Okay. Wait a moment.

570
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,370
Come and possess me.

571
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,530
I'm ready.

572
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,950
Make it clear with His Lordship.

573
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,460
Don't make him so sad again.

574
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,950
Zhaoyan, are you inside?

575
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,820
I can't believe a lady from a family of officials

576
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,450
would end up like this.
