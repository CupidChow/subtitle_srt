00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,530
He almost hurt Zhaoyan.

376
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,660
How dare he do that

377
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,950
in front of you!

378
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,970
Does he know something?

379
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,120
Let's go.

380
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,650
Ren Shique.

381
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,040
Why didn't you light the lamp at night?

382
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,400
I almost fell down.

383
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,560
You came uninvited

384
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,410
and went into my inner hall without permission.

385
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,090
It's so late. Why are you here?

386
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,660
I have something important to ask you.

387
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,870
I'll give you half an hour.

388
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,400
Should I wear it?

389
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,960
Does His Lordship

390
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,910
know I already have the hair stick?

391
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,450
If he doesn't,

392
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,850
should I return it to him first

393
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,660
and wait for him to give it to me?

394
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,250
Forget it.

395
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,540
Let me wear it now.

396
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,290
Tell me.

397
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,000
A confidant of mine from Shengjing

398
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,190
told me

399
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,090
something about you.

400
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,740
Confidant?

401
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,390
You have a confidant?

402
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,900
Well, it's Han Lu.

403
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,240
Han Lu?

404
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,850
I’m Han Lu.

405
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,850
I saw her standing here alone.

406
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,050
I'm sorry I made her feel uncomfortable. I didn't mean to.

407
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,310
What?

408
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,160
What he said is true?

409
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,380
I knew you were hiding something from me.

410
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,690
You really want to know about my past?

411
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,520
Don't look at me this way.

412
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,440
Your stare has made me feel terrified.

413
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,320
You

414
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,080
have always been acting weird.

415
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,480
Being with Yun Zhaoyan

416
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,900
makes you even weirder.

417
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,280
I'm not an ordinary mortal.

418
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,740
I am actually...

419
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,070
I'm actually the God of Taiyin in the moon.

420
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,710
Ren Shique.

421
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,320
Do you think I'm a fool?

422
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,760
How could you fool me like this?

423
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,450
You don't know how sincere I am to you?

424
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,780
Since you don't believe me,

425
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,750
please go back.

426
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,120
Fine, fine, fine.

427
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,640
I believe you're the God Taiyin.

428
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,000
But you're a god

429
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,370
while Yun Zhaoyan is a mortal.

430
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,700
How can you be together?

431
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:44,370
You didn't

432
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,900
plan to be together with Yun Zhaoyan forever in the first place?

433
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,640
Over the thousands of years,

434
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,400
she's been the first person

435
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,070
that I really want to protect.

436
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,820
I want to protect her forever.

437
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,180
I'll do it

438
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,610
whatever the cost.

439
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,650
Fine, fine, fine.

440
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,110
You are now a couple.

441
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,410
But the rules in the mortal world

442
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,200
and the rules in heaven won't let you off.

443
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,480
For her,

444
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,610
I dare to go against the world.

445
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,620
His Lordship is willing to risk everything for me.

446
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,780
I also want His Lordship to be safe and happy.

447
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,870
But

448
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,100
I always got him into serious trouble

449
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,410
because of my greed.

450
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,770
Okay, as you please.

451
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,280
Bye.

452
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,870
You two are a perfect match.

453
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,590
Both of you often appear and disappear suddenly.

454
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,580
You scared me.

455
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,280
You heard us?

456
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,850
He was exaggerating.

457
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,540
Just ignore what he said.

458
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,880
Let me walk you back first.

459
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,350
I...

460
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,170
No need.

461
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,610
I can go back on my own.

462
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,130
I'm fine.

463
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,910
What he said just now is true?

464
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,210
It can't be.

465
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,230
How could it be true?

466
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,730
What are you doing?

467
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:18,010
Just now, I saw Miss Zhaoyan and His Lordship were sad

468
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,200
when Miss Zhaoyan left.

469
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,330
Is it because of you?

470
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,920
You are just

471
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,970
an attendant in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

472
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,430
Are you questioning me?

473
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,160
As the governor of the city,

474
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,130
can't you tell?

475
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,560
You stubborn old man.

476
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,960
Why haven't you changed?

477
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,230
You still don't know what is right and what is wrong.

478
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,420
What?

479
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,450
Don't assume

480
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,000
you can be rude to me

481
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,190
just because I'm polite to Ren Shique.

482
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,730
Do you know that Miss Zhaoyan

483
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,800
is the only person

484
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,610
who can get His Lordship to let go of his painful past?

485
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,540
Their love story

486
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,540
won't have a happy ending.

487
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,770
Ren Shique

488
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,160
has been bewitched

489
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,560
by Yun Zhaoyan's eyes.

490
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,030
He has fallen into an abyss.

491
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,490
Even if it's an abyss,

492
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,390
as long as they are together,

493
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,720
things will get better and better.

494
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,080
You...

495
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,960
Shut up!

496
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,220
If you weren't a mortal, I would...

497
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,570
If I weren't a mortal?

498
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,900
What do you mean?

499
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,990
Why did you and Ren Shique

500
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,740
talk weird today?

501
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,120
What else did he say?

502
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,130
He also said that he's the God Taiyin.

503
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,970
Who would believe that?

504
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,770
Did he really say that?

505
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,300
Are you questioning me again?

506
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,940
How disrespectful!

507
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,760
I tried my best to stay by his side in the past,

508
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,000
and I was always worried that he would kick me out.

509
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,560
Now I can stay by his side.

510
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,730
But I don't know how to face him.

511
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,890
Who is it?

512
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,070
Who are you?

513
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,860
Are you

514
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,570
Lord Night Guard

515
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,450
everyone in the city is afraid of?

516
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,320
Lord Night Guard?

517
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,150
How dare you call me that in front of me!

518
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,540
I...

519
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,410
Why not?

520
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,500
Do you think I'm as timid as Yun Zhaoyan?

521
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,800
You are as cold and callous

522
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,030
as you were in the Moon Palace.

523
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,950
Are you still Yun Zhaoyan?

524
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,490
Of course not.

525
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,750
I'm not as weak as her.

526
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,740
If you have nothing to do here,

527
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,290
please leave.

528
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,640
Yun Zhaoyan.

529
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,060
Have you forgotten

530
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,390
that if the renegade immortal knows I’m the Moon God,

531
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,810
they wouldn't dare

532
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,150
to stay with me for so long?

533
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,160
Who said the renegade immortal doesn't dare to disguise themselves in front of you?

534
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,750
There may be some renegade immortal who dare to make trouble around me.

535
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,750
But I have more ways

536
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,550
to make those renegade immortals disappear.

537
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,730
So you're really powerful.

538
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,160
By the way,

539
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,570
why

540
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,910
did you come to her late at night?

541
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,420
Don't you think

542
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,010
being with her is tiring?

543
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,080
I see.

544
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,120
Let Yun Zhaoyan talk to me for a few minutes.

545
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,920
She's fine.

546
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,680
Go back.

547
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,130
Do you know

548
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,250
how I made Bi Luo disappear back then?

549
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,670
How?

550
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,440
I'll tell you now.

551
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,520
♫It's hard to distinguish what's good and what's evil, and it's hard to love or hate someone♫

552
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:25,699
♫We meet and part, coming to nothing♫

553
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:32,110
♫Regardless of the chaos and fate♫

554
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,840
♫I only love you with deep affection♫

555
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,370
♫I'm a lonely person and tears trickle down my face♫

556
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,540
♫I dare not face so much sorrow♫

557
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:56,380
♫Puzzled, I'm too sad to play the guqin under the moon♫

558
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:02,210
♫I want to hear you talk about romantic things♫

559
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,420
Ding.

560
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,830
Everything is good.

561
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,580
How come he just didn't have that invitation letter?

562
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,800
You are the governor of Qingzhou City.

563
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,430
Everyone will be in awe when they see you.

564
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,180
You're right.

565
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,830
I am always

566
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,310
indifferent to fame and fortune.

567
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,660
I always stay away from those unnecessary manners and glories.

568
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,360
Today,

569
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,920
I came here

570
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,780
to attend Chai family's wedding.

571
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,400
Did I make everyone know I would go?

572
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
No.

573
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,940
I only let you go with me.

574
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,300
I'm not like Ren Shique

575
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,580
who likes to attract much attention to everything he does.

576
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,600
I am

577
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,500
always

578
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,240
indifferent to fame and fortune.

579
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,270
I value peace and tranquility.

580
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,780
Let's get out of the way.
