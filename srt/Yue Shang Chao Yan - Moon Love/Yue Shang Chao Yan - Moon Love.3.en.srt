Don't flatter yourself.

Who are you to bargain with me?

31
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,020
I saw a woman in red

00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,930
around you.

33
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,710
Now you believe me, right?

34

You must know who the renegade immortal in red is.

What does she look like?

36
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,860
She wears red clothes.

37
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,330
Her face is exquisite.

00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,990
She was looking at you sadly.

39
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,670
You saw her

41
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,260
I saw her face clearly beside the lake during the day.

42

But she is so special.

43
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,770
Other renegade immortals dare not get close to you.

has been looking at you silently.

46
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,970
Maybe she wants something.

Yun Zhaoyan,

48
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,890
if you can see her now,

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,030
tell her

50
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,180
to stay away from me.

51

Otherwise, I won't spare her.

But she's not around you now.

53

he only treats me like an old friend.

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,340
Great.

191
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,440
What a coincidence.

192
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,220
Ren Shique,

193
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,860
you've never seen the scene of selecting concubines.

194
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,900
All types of women in Qingzhou

195
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,370
will gather together.

196
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,720
Looking at them

197
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,620
is a feast for the eyes.

198
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,970
Every time I think about it,

199
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,090
I feel

200
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,080
calm.

201
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,640
How come the imperial censor

202
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,160
is not angry with the city governor today?

203
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,560
G-Get ready anytime.

204
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,890
I'm tired.

205
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,720
You may leave.

206
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,440
Governor.

207
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,620
Governor, go back first.

208
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,530
Ren Shique,

209
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,130
be... be wary of Yun Zhaoyan.

210
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,360
I saw a woman in red

211
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,150
around you.

212
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,200
She

213
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,170
wears red clothes.

214
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,700
Her face is exquisite.

215
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,590
She was looking at you sadly.

216
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,900
I don't have

217
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
what you want anymore.

218
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,910
Why are you still following me?

219
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,850
[Governor's Mansion]

220
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,890
Today is a sunny day.

221
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,650
I should go to the taverns in Qingzhou

222
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,370
to taste their new wine.

223
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,280
What a pity.

224
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,980
After the shrew in my family comes back,

225
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,380
my good days will come to an end.

226
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,620
[Gu Qing]

227
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,460
Qing.

228
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,060
Why... Why are you back in advance?

229
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,300
Of course I came back

230
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,230
to prepare for the selection of concubines.

231
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,620
I want to go to Shengjing

232
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,020
and make everyone there amazed by me.

233
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,710
Right, Brother,

234
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,240
you just mentioned "the shrew".

235
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,900
Were you talking about me?

236
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,960
Do you want peanuts?

237
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,560
The selection of concubines is just around the corner.

238
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,760
Everything in the mansion must be taken seriously.

239
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,320
The people from Shengjing

240
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,050
will come here to issue an edict.

241
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,040
We can't let them look down on us.

242
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Qing,

243
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,330
you are really determined to become a concubine.

244
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,440
If you enter the palace,

245
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,050
you'll have to compete with a bunch of women.

246
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,760
Brother,

247
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,080
don't worry.

248
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,360
With my beauty and wisdom,

249
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,840
I can be successful wherever I go.

250
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,910
I'm worried you'll make a mess in the palace.

251
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,400
I was born

252
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,090
to be in the spotlight.

253
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,980
I'll only shine more brightly in the future.

254
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,100
Brother.

255
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,580
Just watch

256
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,810
how I'll make a stir in Shengjing.

257
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,680
The selection of concubines will last for three days in Chuxiu House.

258
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,680
Princess, you must go there on the first day.

259
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,200
No.

260
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,480
Only the last one can amaze everyone,

261
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,190
so that those who fail will be convinced.

262
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,650
We should

263
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,020
enjoy a hot spring experience outside the city for three days.

264
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,670
I'll come back in three days

265
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,890
to take the first place at one stroke.

266
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,950
It's been a while.

267
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,590
The people in the city have become politer.

268
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,210
I'm just passing by,

269
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,990
but they're making way for me.

270
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,800
They really admire me.

271
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,660
Yes.

272
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
For you to look more beautiful for the selection of concubines,

273
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,370
the people

274
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,540
dare not delay you in enjoying the hot spring experience.

275
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,010
After I return,

276
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,070
I will generously reward everyone in Qingzhou City.

277
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,720
[Chuxiu House]

278
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,000
Sister.

279
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,800
Zixi,

280
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,520
why are you still up at this hour?

281
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,200
Sister,

282
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,790
[Wen Zixi] [Wen Zimo]

283
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,520
we're about to enter the palace.

284
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,250
I'm so happy that I can't sleep.

285
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,810
Everyone says

286
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,280
the Wen family

287
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,680
is blessed by Moon God.

288
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,780
That's why both of us have been selected at the same time.

289
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,690
Why don't we

290
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,340
go to Jing'an Hall to pray

291
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,220
before we go to Shengjing?

292
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,480
I pray

293
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,210
both of us can gain the emperor's favor successfully.

294
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,560
I pray

295
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,170
the Wen family

296
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,240
can prosper.

297
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,089
It's late.

298
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,240
Chuxiu House has a rule

299
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,770
that no one can leave without a reason.

300
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,770
We can go worship

301
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,319
tomorrow.

302
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,000
Tomorrow,

303
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,349
I'll have to learn the palace etiquette from Ma'am.

304
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,650
I don't have time to go.

305
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,670
Let's go secretly

306
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,730
and come back secretly.

307
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,320
Okay?

308
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,640
I'll

309
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,510
ask our father to ask for a leave for you

310
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,370
and remove your name from the list

311
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,560
to get you out of this

312
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,420
so that you can be safe for the rest of your life. What do you think?

313
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,200
No.

314
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,800
The shortlist

315
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
has already been delivered to Shengjing.

316
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,560
It can't be changed.

317
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,520
Besides,

318
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,410
the palace is a great place.

319
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,720
I can enjoy a high position and great wealth there.

320
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,120
I can also be with you.

321
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,160
I will love it.

322
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,520
Sister,

323
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,980
tell me.

324
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,830
After we enter the palace,

325
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,110
will we still

326
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,930
be together every day like this?

327
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,640
I'm afraid

328
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,570
we'll live

329
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
very far from each other.

330
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,970
Let's go now. Let's make it quick.

331
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,640
Let's go.

332
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,600
You naughty girl,

333
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,330
you're wearing my shoes again.

334
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,260
Then you wear mine.

335
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,290
Sister,

336
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,560
are you okay?

337
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,520
I'm fine.

338
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,720
You are weak,

339
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,480
but you're still wearing thin clothes.

340
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
You know what?

341
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,280
Today,

342
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,240
when I made the wish,

343
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,440
I also said I hope

344
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,770
my sister

345
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,780
can be much healthier in the future.

346
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,950
Sister,

347
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,890
did you make any special wish?

348
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,680
I...

349
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,290
I forgot my basket.

350
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,610
Wait for me here.

351
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,600
I'm going back to get the basket.

352
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I'll be back soon.

353
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,720
Zixi.

354
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,760
My Lord!

355
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,920
My Lord!

356
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,450
My Lord,

357
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,620
something happened.

358
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,610
Wen Zixi, the second daughter of the Wen family,

359
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,800
has just been selected to go to Shengjing.

360
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,920
But last night,

361
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,520
she disappeared in Chuxiu House for no reason.

362
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,760
As expected,

363
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,900
the people are saying

364
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,050
it's because you offended Moon God.

365
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,080
I think you spread the rumor.

366
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,880
My Lord.

367
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,050
The details sound complicated and confusing.

368
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,280
Besides, something was wrong with the Soul Collecting Lamp last night.

369
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,330
Maybe

370
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,990
a renegade immortal did it.

371
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,400
It would be great if you go take a look.

372
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,830
Are you sure a renegade immortal did it?

373
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,940
My Lord,

374
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,040
if we can't find Miss Zixi

375
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,480
within three days,

376
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,940
the Wen family will be in big trouble

377
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,820
if Shengjing blames us.

378
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,600
It'd be great if it wasn't a renegade immortal who did it.

379
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,570
If it was,

380
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,850
we should subdue him as soon as possible.

381
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,680
Since we are not sure

382
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,640
if it was done by a renegade immortal,

383
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,810
ask Xie Guichen

384
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,010
to investigate it.

385
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,840
Now we're in the middle of selecting concubines.

But this matter is too serious.

387

If we can't find Miss Zixi,

388
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,270
I'm afraid it won't end well.

389
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,070
You take care of this.

If you encounter a problem,

just send more men.

-What happened?
-What happened?

432
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,320
It's said that

433
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,840
Wen Zimo is jealous of Wen Zixi.

434
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,040
She's worried Wen Zixi will outshine her

after they enter the palace.

436
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,410
So,

437
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,170
she hid her.

438
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,280
Indeed, Wen Zimo

439
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,830
is no match for Wen Zixi in every aspect.

452
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,010

But this matter is weird.

462
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,640
If Wen Zimo really wanted to do it,

463
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,960
why did she have the guts

00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,770

485
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,930
What trick are you trying to play now?

486
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:50,080
I just want to help the Wen family solve the problem.

487
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,370
Besides, it can quash the rumor.

In this way,

My Lord,

499
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,630
you're broad-minded.

500
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,240
Just let bygones

501
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,050
be bygones.

502
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,850
But today,

503
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,720
I accidentally saw

504
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,160
your little secret.

505
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,560
It proves that fate brought us together.

506
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:34,160
We should cherish it.

507
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,440
Fate brought us together?

508
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,840
Yes.

509
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,360
Otherwise, how did I

510
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,760
meet you again and again?

511
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,330
My Lord,

512
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,960
I...

513
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,130
want to ask you for a small favor.

514
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:55,090
Can I enter Imperial Censor's Mansion?

515
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,200
Otherwise, I can't guarantee

516
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,430
if I'll tell someone accidentally.

517
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,400
You seldom interact with other people.

518
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,680
You don't want everyone else in the city

519
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,560
to gossip about this, right?

520
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,150
You saw it wrong.

521
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,220
I saw it clearly.

522
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,850
My Lord, just now,

523
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,290
you were like this.

524
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,830
Then they...

525
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
became like this.

526
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,190
Anyway,

527
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,960
if the people in Qingzhou City know

528
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,200
you're capable of doing this,

529
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,860
I wonder if they'll visit you in your mansion.

530
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,610
Who would believe the nonsense

531
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,530
of a suspicious outsider who has no relatives?

532
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,370
Besides,

533
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,030
do you think the people in Qingzhou City

534
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,560
will believe you, a crazy woman,

535
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,030
or me, the imperial censor?

536
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,720
Then I'll tell them.

537
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,550
I'm going to tell them now.

538
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,800
I bet you wouldn't dare to do it.

539
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,460
Why wouldn't I dare?

540
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,390
I really saw it.

541
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,500
Even if what you said is true,

542
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,120
you should think about

543
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,910
your own ability and courage

544
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,190
and see if you can bear the consequences.

545
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,860
Leave now!

546
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,230
Don't think I don't know who you are.

547
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,180
You are the envoy sent by Moon God

548
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,940
to give me eyes back then.

549
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,000
Back then, I prayed to Moon God

550
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,350
to give me a pair of eyes.

551
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,650
But the eyes you gave me

552
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,480
allow me to see renegade immortals.

553
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,800
You took it wrong.

554
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,850
You should give me an explanation.

555
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,980
However,

556
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,820
if you let me enter Imperial Censor's Mansion,

557
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,290
I will let it go.

558
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,620
I won't tell on you.

559
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,860
You

560
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,920
made up such a story at one go.

561
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,700
I'm impressed.

562
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,980
Yun Zhaoyan,

563
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
do you really want to stay by my side?

564
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,400
Yes.

565
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,500
I want to stay by your side.

566
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,080
But it's not because of you.

567
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,620
If it weren't for the eyes, I...

568
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,970
Since you hate the eyes so much,

569
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,890
I'll gouge them out for you.

570
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,530
My Lord,

571
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,640
what do you mean?

572
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,620
If I gouge the eyes out for you,

573
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,180
you won't be able to see

574
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,780
those scary things anymore.

575
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,290
Isn't that good?

576
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,130
Come here.

577
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,960
Forget it.

578
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,300
I'll keep the eyes.

579
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,350
But I'm a man of my word.

580
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,370
Don't... Don't come near me!

581
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,280
I'll scream if you come any closer.

582
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,000
I have a loud voice.

583
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:56,760
I...

584
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,770
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

585
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,570
He left?

586
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,460
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

587
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,160
My Lord,

588
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,380
you can't expose your abilities anymore.

589
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,370
Luckily, she hasn't guessed too much.

590
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,680
If you break the heavenly rules again,

591
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,640
your body won't be able to bear it.

592
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,090
She's just an ordinary mortal.

593
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,640
How dare she threaten me!

594
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,360
I was just trying to scare her,

595
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,720
but she got frightened.

596
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,800
My Lord,

597
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,720
you can't be

598
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,360
as impulsive as you were ten years ago.

599
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,880
You can't give her the eyes

600
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,210
or gouge them out just because you want to.

601
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,450
You already know?

602
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,130
It's rare to see you so restless.

603
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,770
I guess

604
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,930
Miss Zhaoyan must...

605
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,990
Don't mention her!

606
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,660
My Lord.

607
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,660
You can't be so fierce to a girl.

608
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,040
Finally, a woman wants to stay by your side.

609
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,450
You should control yourself

610
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,040
and keep her by your side.

611
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,230
She has ulterior motives.

612
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,700
It doesn't matter.

613
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,680
Since Miss Zhaoyan can see renegade immortals

614
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,860
and knows you are special,

615
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,640
if you keep her by your side,

616
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,510
perhaps your doubts about Kui Ji

617
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,580
can be cleared up.

618
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,380
What if the truth is more heartbreaking

619
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,350
after we clear up the doubts that have existed for years?

620
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
Kanxu.

621
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,990
Yes.

622
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,250
Will you feel uneasy

623
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,710
when you're by my side?

624
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,490
I used to be a thousand-year-old osmanthus tree on the moon.

625
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,210
I'm lucky that I can serve you.

626
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,140
Now I'm in the mortal world.

627
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,700
I have a young appearance that I've never had before.

628
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,640
My worldly wish has come true.

629
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,010
Why would I feel uneasy?

630
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,880
Due to what happened to Wu Tu back then,

631
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,940
I've been unable to sleep or eat well.

632
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,410
But because of my eyes, Wu Tu...

633
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,510
My Lord,

634
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,530
Wu Tu and you have met again

635
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,090
in the mortal world, right?

636
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,200
Besides, he comes to you every day.

637
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,240
You can't do this.

638
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,360
Bei Wu, Xu Xian,

639
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,280
I really have something important to tell him.

640
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,340
Today, I don't want

641
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,040
to see Wu Tu.

642
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,720
I can't believe Wu Tu.

643
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,230
His Lordship is not feeling well today.

644
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,920
Governor, please come another day.

645
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,640
Ren Shique,

646
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,740
are you going to handle

647
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,270
Chuxiu House's case or not?

648
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,990
[Chuxiu House]

649
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,850
Ren Shique,

650
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:03,170
you don't want to see me, right?

651
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,920
I can do it myself.

652
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,220
That night,

653
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,300
we went to Jing'an Hall together.

654
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,820
But somehow,

655
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,200
even with a lamp in our hands,

656
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,400
the surrounding environment was dark.

657
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,400
On our way back from praying,

658
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,180
Zixi said she left the basket in Jing'an Hall.

659
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,390
She told me to wait for her here.

660
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,090
After that,

661
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,180
she never came back.

662
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,790
We've searched everywhere in Chuxiu House.

663
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,080
We only found that shoe.

664
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,540
The embroidered shoes in Jing'an Hall

665
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
are yours?

666
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,560
Yes.

667
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,590
But we share

668
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,900
many things.

669
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,740
This case...

670
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,700
It's so scary.

671
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,350
You should

672
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,480
handle the case.

673
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,160
Yun Zhaoyan,

674
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,940
how dare you offend the imperial censor!

675
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,100
He is so angry.

676
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,950
I'm afraid it'll be harder

677
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,400
to enter Imperial Censor's Mansion.

678
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,010
Ma'am.

679
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,960
You are...

680
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,170
Yun Zhaoyan?

681
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,640
Ma'am, you finally remember me.

682
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,630
Sit down and eat.

683
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,980
You still have the mood to eat?

684
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,900
Have you heard about what happened to the daughters of the Wen family?

685
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,199
Everyone in the city knows it.

686
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,360
I even offended the imperial censor because of this.

687
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,440
You offended Lord Night Guard?

688
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,600
I thought

689
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,540
you went there to help him.

690
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,199
Yes.

691
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,300
I wanted to frighten him.

692
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,770
But I forgot

693
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,560
as I got angry.

694
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,480
Let me teach you.

695
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,030
If you want to ask someone for help,

696
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,560
you should help him solve a problem.

697
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,330
If I help His Lordship solve the current problem,

698
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,670
to return the favor,

699
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,370
he

700
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,810
will let me stay by his side, right?

701
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,900
Ma'am, you have a point.

702
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,480
I'm going out.

703
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,570
Remember to leave the door unlocked.

704
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,590
What's the rush?

705
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,860
[Chuxiu House]

706
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,800
Jing'an Hall.

707
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,570
Is anyone here?

708
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,270
Just spit it out if you have something to say. Don't scare me.

709
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,110
Why are you doing this?

710
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,730
In this life,

711
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,680
I decided too many people's fates arbitrarily.

712
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,330
In the end, only regrets are left to them.

713
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,690
Now I hope they can leave as they wish

714
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,230
and be free from worldly things.

715
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,520
By the way, Lord Ren,

716
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,750
Miss Zhaoyan asked me

717
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,840
to tell you something.

718
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,650
Her?

719
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,840
Ma'am.

720
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,760
Who are you?

721
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,960
Ma'am, I'm Yun Zhaoyan.

722
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,690
I currently live in the morgue.

723
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,070
Did you pay the rent?

724
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,840
Ma'am,

725
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,520
we reached an agreement, right?

726
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,500
I help you with the work in the morgue

727
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,430
so that I don't need to pay the rent.

728
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,680
This seems to be true.

729
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,280
Then get back to work.

730
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,480
Ma'am,

731
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,690
I have a good idea.

732
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,310
It can allow me to pay the rent

733
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,460
and stay in Qingzhou City safely.

734
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,580
You are a young girl.

735
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,750
Why do you want to live in the morgue?

736
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,550
After I earn enough money,

737
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,110
I'll leave.

738
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,940
You'll move out of the morgue?

739
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,360
You little girl,

740
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,800
you'll marry into a family here?

741
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,050
Ma'am, what are you thinking?

742
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,840
I... Anyway, the first step is to work in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

743
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,120
So you're targeting someone in Imperial Censor's Mansion.

744
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,360
Imperial Censor's Mansion is not an ordinary place.

745
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,880
You're a young girl.

746
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,380
How can you get in?

747
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,210
Actually, I've found someone

748
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,390
who can help me solve my current problem.

749
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,100
My Lord,

750
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,600
since the day the Soul Collecting Lamp was lit,

751
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,660
I've been thinking about something.

752
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,050
You've been in the mortal world for ten years.

753
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,000
Don't you want to return to the Heavenly Palace at all?

754
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,810
I don't.

755
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,080
Yes.

756
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,600
I know why you don't want to return to the Heavenly Palace.

757
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,680
But if you continue to stay in the mortal world,

758
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,800
you'll become more like a mortal.

759
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,530
Where did you learn such nonsense?

760
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,420
How can a god be like a mortal?

761
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,100
My Lord,

762
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,860
you haven't noticed this.

763
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,010
You've become more like a mortal

764
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,730
since you were angered by Miss Yun that day.

765
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,650
Now you've learned to tease the city governor.
