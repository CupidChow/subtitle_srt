Qingzhou.

4
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,890
I'm back.

5
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,500
Every year during the Mid-Autumn Festival,

6
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,220
it is the time when the people of Qingzhou return to their hometown.

7
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,790
This is because, on this day,

8
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,550
the entire city's residents hold osmanthus branches

9
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,990
and gather at the Wang Garden

10
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,620
to pray to the Moon God for their wishes to come true.

11
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,500
This custom has been continued for over a thousand years.

12
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,870
However, the moon worship ceremony ten years ago

13
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,460
was unexpectedly interrupted,

14
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,790
and everyone's wishes went unfulfilled.

15
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,170
Only a blind girl

16
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,180
had her long-cherished wish granted

17
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,550
and regained her sight.

18
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,940
The one whom the Moon God

19
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,540
bestowed special favor upon

20
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,620
was me,

21
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,690
Yun Zhaoyan.

22
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,090
But regaining sight

23
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,610
is not as amazing as I imagined.

24
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,990
Why did it follow me here?

[Episode 1]

26
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,149
Don't come over!

27
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,649
Don't come over!

28
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,140
Don't come over!

29
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,940
What do you want?

30
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,410
I can't give you anything!

31
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,740
Enough!

32
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,360
What exactly do you want?

33
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,100
I'll give you everything!

34
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,390
Others can't see you,

35
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,640
but I can!

36
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,180
At least you are an immortal from heaven.

37
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,820
Although you were punished and had your divine bones taken away,

38
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,890
you shouldn't willingly degrade yourself

39
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,890
to the mortal world to intimidate people, should you?

40
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,140
Here.

41
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,760
When did you put this wedding dress in here?

42
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,810
What...

43
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,520
What do you mean by this?

44
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,240
You've been chasing after me for so long.

45
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,190
Could it be that you want to...

46
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:37,020
marry me?

47
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,030
No, no, no!

48
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,159
We're on different paths, humans and immortals.

49
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,960
Besides, I'm only seventeen.

50
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,680
I...

51
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,870
You're not giving it to me.

52
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,750
Well, do you want to give it

53
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,390
to someone specific?

54
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,550
Is there anyone from the Chai family?

55
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,980
An old acquaintance of the Chai family, who wishes to

56
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,780
remain anonymous, asked me to deliver something.

57
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,180
Today we have a joyous occasion in our family, and it's inconvenient to receive guests.

58
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,700
Miss, please leave.

59
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,200

60
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,659
Father.

61
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,860
Wait.

62
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,860
What is it?

63
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,460
It was sent by an old acquaintance.

64
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,090
Is this wedding dress for me?

65
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,660
What a beautiful wedding dress.

66
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,660
The embroidery and material are of the highest quality.

67
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,060
Unfortunately, it's old.

68
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,780
Today is my daughter's engagement day.

69
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,820
Not only did you intrude without permission,

70
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
but you also brought this filthy thing,

71
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,180
breaking the convention.

72
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,880

73
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,120
Throw this unidentified person out.

74
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,710
I knew it.

75
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,480
I have helped you fulfill your long-cherished wish.

76
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,640
Now I am going to Wang Garden to pay homage to my parents.

77
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,580
Stop following me.

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,200
My Lord!

81
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,910
My Lord, come back!

83

The Soul Collecting Lamp lit up!

84
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,620
Qingzhou,

85
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,000
a place with no peace even for a moment.

86
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,420
Moon God!

87
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,190
Today should be the night of the full moon.

88
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,140
It should have been an auspicious day

89
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,540
for the whole city to worship the moon and pray for blessings.

90
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,970
But in our Qingzhou City,

91
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,620
we haven't seen the moon for ten years!

92
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,540
May the Moon God

93
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,830
bring back the moon to us!

94
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,260
If Qingzhou continues to be without the moon for a long time,

95
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,220
there may be disasters ahead!

96
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,100
The Moon Worship Ceremony!

97
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,750
The Moon Worship Ceremony!

98
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,340
The Moon God will definitely bless us.

99
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,650
Mother,

100
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,980
I have never been able to see the moon since I was little.

101
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,260
Will the Moon God

102
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,730
not bless me?

103
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,230
Silly child.

104
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,390
Worshiping the moon doesn't necessarily require seeing it.

105
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,320
As long as you are devout,

106
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,640
the Moon God will hear your wishes.

107
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,350
Can I ask the Moon God

108
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,050
to let me see you?

109
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,480
Yan,

110
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,310
perhaps there will be such a day in the future

111
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,330
when you will not only see me

112
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,430
but also many wonderful things

113
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,060
in this world.

114
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,350
Yan,

115
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,020
in the future,

116
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,040
no matter what unknown things

117
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,700
you encounter,

118
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,980
don't forget to keep good intentions

119
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,820
and treat others with kindness.

120
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,480
Moon God,

121
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,340
I am Yun Zhaoyan.

122
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,310
Ten years ago, my family had a sudden accident,

123
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,750
and I had to leave my hometown.

124
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,480
I have no roots in Qingzhou now.

125
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,430
Today marks the tenth anniversary of the passing of the Yun family.

126
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,560
I came back to pay homage to my parents.

127
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,060
Moon God,

128
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,630
please bless the spirits of my father and mother in heaven

129
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,850
and prevent them from suffering in the mortal world.

130
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,190
Besides that,

131
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,030
I have one more small request.

132
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,620
Ten years ago, I regained my sight

133
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,690
because you gave me these eyes.

134
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,620
I'm very grateful.

135
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,510
But I beg you to take them back.

136
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,870
Because...

137
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,190
the renegade immortals are really terrifying.

138
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,200
Miss,

139
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,320
you have too many wishes.

140
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,500
Hurry up.

141
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,300
Okay.

142
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,140
Besides that,

143
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,630
Moon God, I have many words

144
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,290
that I want you to convey to my father and mother.

145
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,300
The moon in the sky is far away from you.

146
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,240
How can she hear

147
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,810
your prayers?

148
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,330
Lord Night Guard. It's Lord Night Guard.

149
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,480
Lord Night Guard?

150
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,830
He is the imperial censor of the city,

151
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,250
prohibiting any moon worship ceremonies in the city.

152
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,550
He rarely goes out during the day, and is quite fearsome.

153
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,350
Everyone calls him Night Guard.

154
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,890
My Lord.

155
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,500
You shouldn't speak recklessly.

156
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,060
His Lordship has expressly forbidden

157
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,420
any moon worship ceremonies in Qingzhou City.

158
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,740
Why are you knowingly defying this order today?

159
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,570
My Lord,

160
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,130
tonight's Moon Worship Ceremony

161
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,140
is an age-old tradition in our Qingzhou City,

162
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,670
passed down for centuries.

163
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,410
It is intended to pray for the blessings of the Moon God over our land,

164
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,960
to reunite families, and to offer solace for grief.

165
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,660
However, since you came to Qingzhou,

166
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,850
the Moon Worship Ceremony has been banned for ten years.

167
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,050
Well...

168
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,800
Recently, things in the city have not been going well,

169
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,530
and strange occurrences are frequent.

170
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,080
It is probably because of this.

171
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,200
So we took the liberty

172
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,740
to request blessings from the Moon God.

173
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,350
She doesn't deserve the fortune

174
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,300
in the mortal world.

175
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:11,920
My Lord,

176
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,690
don't say that.

177
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,900
By doing so,

178
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,100
you will incur divine wrath.

179
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,890
Then today

180
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,780
I will defy the divine rules.

181
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,550
My Lord!

182
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,530
If you insist,

183
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,460
then I'll have to

184
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,920
kill myself to prove my determination.

185
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,510
You should stab here.

186
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,900
Otherwise,

187
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,550
you won't die.

188
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,030
He's blind.

189
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,380
My Lord,

190
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,900
what happened today has been solved.

191
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,010
It's almost dawn.

192
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,030
Let's go home.

193
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,580
God doesn't bless Qingzhou!

194
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
I know where it is!

195
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,070
How come I forgot it too?

196
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,590
Why are you laughing for no reason?

197
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm thinking about the girl just now.

198
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,010
She's really sharp.

199
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,430
No one in Qingzhou City has noticed

200
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,410
that there is something wrong

201
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,660
with your eyes.

202
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,820
I wonder how she found out.

203
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,250
You old man,

204
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,860
behaving so recklessly today.

205
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,260
Find a way to get back home by yourself.

206
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,870
My Lord, didn't we agree

207
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,440
not to mention my age?

208
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:40,990
My Lord,

209
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,570
you don't really want me to walk home, do you?

210
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,650
My Lord? My Lord!

211
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,740
The altar at Wang Garden has been destroyed.

212
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,350
I am going home to pay homage.

213
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,100
Stop following me.

214
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,380
Farewell.

215
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,760
You want to repay me?

216
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,510
Forget it.

217
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,020
Daohuang! you are ungrateful!

218
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,470
Night...

219
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,620
Lord Night Guard?

220
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,530
It's her?

221
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,900
Do you usually

222
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,770
call me that?

223
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,350
I heard that from others.

224
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,860
Why are you following me?

225
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,580
I'm not following you.

226
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,070
I was pushed down.

227
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,660
It was...

228
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,420
Where is he?

229
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,200
Aren’t you going to get up?

230
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,830
I fell too hard just now.

231
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,640
Can you give me a hand?

232
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,850
Me? Give you a hand?

233
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,420
I...

234
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,670
Thank you, My Lord.

235
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,030
You...

236
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,650
You...

237
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,410
Let go!

238
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,160
This...

239
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,210
My Lord, your hand...

240
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,920
is so cold.

241
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,650
My Lord.

242
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,180
My Lord,

243
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,490
are you okay?

244
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,380
My Lord,

245
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,220
isn't she the girl from just now?

246
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,500
How did you fall into our boat?

247
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,980
So, the repayment Daohuang mentioned

248
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,060
was to give me a ride on this boat.

249
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,220
This boat is heading towards

250
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,370
the south of the city, right?

251
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,300
I happen to be heading there too.

252
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,510
Could you give me a ride?

253
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,270
I haven't been back to Qingzhou City for ten years.

254
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,770
I'm not familiar with the route now.

255
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,360
My Lord, what do you think?

256
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,900
It's none of my business.

257
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,790
Can't we discuss this?

258
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:25,950
My Lord,

259
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,110
I'm taking it as a yes.

260
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,130
We're going the same way anyway.

261
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,660
Let's give this girl a ride.

262
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,900
You are so kind.

263
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,960
[Token]

264
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,330
Imperial Censor's Token.

265
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,290
So this is what it looks like.

266
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,930
Why can you, a mere commoner, recognize this token?

267
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,900
I've only touched it and never seen it.

268
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,970
To be honest,

269
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,390
ten years ago,

270
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,540
I was the Young Lady of Imperial Censor's Mansion.

271
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,070
My father...

272
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,380
We don't have a Young Lady like you in our household.

273
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,230
I meant ten years ago.

274
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,900
My Lord, you're so young.

275
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,720
How could I say you're my father?

276
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,130
If you don't want to be the Young Lady of the river,

277
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,010
you'd better shut up.

278
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,380
Oh.

279
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,180
By the way, My Lord,

280
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,240
my name is not "a mere commoner." My name is Yun Zhaoyan.

281
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,590
I'll disembark at the Southern Office later.

282
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,610
I won't bother you for the rest of the journey.

283
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,500
Help!

284
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,340
Help!

285
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,640
Where is he?

286
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,680
Why did he disappear?

287
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,720
I'm sorry.

288
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,210
I'm sorry.

289
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,140
Get to the shore!

290
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,690
Help!

291
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,380
When renegade immortals see His Lordship, they disappear?

292
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,970
Miss.

293
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,740
Are you okay?

294
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm fine.

295
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,630
His Lordship...

296
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,020
What happened to His Lordship?

297
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,870
Just now, he...

298
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,000
My Lord, don't abandon me!

299
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,680
He's really gone.

300
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,350
Let's go.

301
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,130
Wait for me!

302
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,190
Miss.

303
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,110
Why can't I move?

304
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,010
We're leaving.

305
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,460
-You're on your own for the rest of the journey.
-Wait.

306
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,390
My bag!

307
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,410
Here!

308
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,620
Why do I feel like

309
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,630
I've seen His Lordship somewhere before?

310
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,670
Did I remember it incorrectly?

311
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,660
There's still a long way to go back.

312
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,120
I hope renegade immortals

313
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,760
don't come looking for me.

314
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:07,990
[Yun's Mansion]

315
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,320
[Yun's Mansion]

316
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,500
Father.

317
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,740
Mother.

318
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,730
Mother, I'm scared.

319
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,750
[Yun's Mansion]

320
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,640
I thought something was on fire.

321
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,540
Who are you?

322
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,210
I'm just here to pay homage to my parents.

323
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,860
Why is someone even interfering with this?

324
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,280
Young lady,

325
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,740
do you have some kind of serious brain illness?

326
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,740
The bodies here are all of those without any children.

327
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,670
Why are you here to pay homage to your parents?

328
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,010
Isn't this Yun's Mansion?

329
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,500
Look carefully, this is clearly a morgue.

330
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,130
[Morgue]

331
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,800
When did this place become a morgue?

332
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,850
[Yun's Mansion]

333
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,340
Who would set up a home in such an ominous place?

334
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,380
This place is not ominous at all.

335
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,910
Hurry up and leave. Don’t cause trouble here.

336
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,910
Ma'am,

337
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,250
could I stay here for the night?

338
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,780
No.

339
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,100
Ma'am, I can work for you.

340
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,730
The work here involves carrying coffins

341
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,990
and burying the dead.

342
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,420
No problem, I’m very good at it.

343
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,630
You can do that too?

344
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,450
Fine.

345
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,650
Just one night.

346
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,280
Thank you, Ma'am.

347
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,730
Ma'am.

348
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,820
Aren't you living here?

349
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,260
No.

350
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,040
It's ominous.

351
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,760
[Yun's Mansion]

352
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,490
Daohuang,

353
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,590
slow down.

354
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,190
Where are you taking me?

355
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,940
Where am I?

356
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,930
It's a dream.

357
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,550
Thank goodness it's a dream.

358
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,220
It was all because I was too tired yesterday.

359
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,280
In broad daylight,

360
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,140
I had such a scary dream.

361
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,750
My Lord,

362
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,070
here's your tea.

363
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,980
My Lord, be careful with your eyes.

364
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,040
It's better to put on your blindfold.

365
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,620
The person we really need to be careful of is here.

366
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,020
Mr. Governor is here!

367
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,000
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

368
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,260
Ren Shique, you are too brutal!

369
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,150
My dear Imperial Censor,

370
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,410
when will you leave Qingzhou City?

371
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,170
You have an eye problem...

372
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,140
I didn't tell anyone about it.

373
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,670
But your hearing is very good.

374
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,440
Haven't you thought about

375
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,640
going outside of the city?

376
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,280
I know supervising officials

377
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,620
and patrolling Qingzhou at night

378
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,910
is tough.

379
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,900
But now, everyone in Qingzhou City

380
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,340
is afraid of you.

381
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,000
Do you know what they call you behind your back?

382
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,390
Lord Night Guard.

383
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,450
You know it?

384
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,390
Last night,

385
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,430
when the commoners were secretly performing their ritual,

386
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,750
you could have just turned a blind eye.

387
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,970
Of course,

388
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,250
I don't like that old priest either.

389
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,380
But you shouldn't have destroyed the altar

390
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,220
for no reason.

391
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,590
The people in the city

392
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,230
are filled with grievances.

393
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,990
They've all come to me.

394
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,220
How am I supposed to handle this?

395
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,670
The common people

396
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,650
are always full of complaints.

397
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,360
Don't pay it any mind.

398
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,310
The moon in the sky is always

399
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,430
more frequently seen in its crescent phase than in its full phase.

400
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,030
It can't protect you anyway.

401
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,530
My Lord!

402
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,900
Something happened!

403
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,790
I knew it.

404
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,460
Is someone beating the drum to report injustice again?

405
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,300
What happened?

406
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,210
Something happened to the Lu family.

407
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:06,860
See?

408
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,110
Lu Qingchi from the Lu family achieved the top scholar title,

409
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,820
and in a few days, he will return to Qingzhou City to pay respect to the officials and honor his ancestors.

410
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,070
In the northern hall of Lu's Mansion,

411
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,060
there are several clusters of long-dead day lilies.

412
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,380
Because they are unsightly,

413
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,510
the gardener wanted to dig them all up.

414
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,430
Strangely,

415
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,870
no matter whether he cut or chopped them,

416
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,530
not a single leaf fell from the flower clusters.

417
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,080
Instead, where the blade struck,

418
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,580
there was some fresh red sap flowing out.

419
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,610
This has stirred up fear among the people in the city,

420
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,070
and rumors are spreading.

421
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,320
So weird.

422
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,710
It seems there was a reason for the lamp

423
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,040
lighting up last night.

424
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,310
What lamp?

425
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,820
My Lord,

426
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,210
such weird phenomena

427
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,810
need to be resolved quickly.

428
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,680
What should we do?

429
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,380
Ma'am.

430
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,140
Why are you sticking these things

431
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,540
in my morgue?

432
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,620
I can see things that others cannot.

433
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,380
These talismans are used to suppress them.

434
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,270
Young lady,

435
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,940
you are quite interesting.

436
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,750
Why didn't I notice

437
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,530
anything special about you?

438
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,380
I knew you wouldn't believe it.

439
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,340
Today during the day,

440
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,480
I had an even more terrifying dream.

441
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,140
As the saying goes,

442
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,800
"What one thinks about during the day, one dreams about at night."

443
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,750
But you often come to the morgue too.

444
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,200
Haven't you ever had nightmares?

445
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,390
Having nightmares is a mental illness

446
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,850
for which there is no cure.

447
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,940
You have to solve it yourself.

448
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,620
You might as well think about the cause

449
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
of the dream.

450
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,300
Then, based on the cause, try to find a solution.

451
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,960
The one who started the trouble is usually the best person to resolve it.

452
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,960
The one who started the trouble is usually the best person to resolve it?

453
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,140
Lu Qingchi achieved the top scholar title.

454
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,980
He could have celebrated it at the Xing Garden in Shengjing.

455
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,380
Why did he insist on returning to Qingzhou City,

456
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,300
parading through the streets, paying respect to the officials, and honoring his ancestors?

457
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,940
It seems he's quite fond of showing off.

458
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,900
I heard he's well known of being a filial son.

459
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,460
But his mother is elderly and it's not suitable

460
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,220
for her to travel long distances to reunite with him.

461
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,510
So, he insisted on returning to Qingzhou

462
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,640
to perform a ritual of gratitude by kneeling and bowing.

463
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,310
The love between mother and son...

464
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,490
He was just lying to himself and others.

465
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,540
Harder.

466
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,060
Yes.

467
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,400
My Lord,

468
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,550
there is indeed something wrong here.

469
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,940
Don't blame me for talking too much.

470
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,060
When people are around, don't use any skills

471
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,450
that ordinary people don't understand,

472
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,180
in case of arousing suspicion.

473
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,580
Tell them to leave us.

474
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,140
Mr. Huang.

475
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,110
The Imperial Censor is here to inspect.

476
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:39,310
Tell all unrelated personnel to leave.

477
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:39,870
Yes.

478
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,530
Come with me.

479
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,590
Hurry.

480
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,820
My Lord.

481
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,870
Have them clear away all these rootless weeds.

482
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,420
Afterward, don't plant other plants here.

483
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,630
Yes.

484
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:53,210
[Imperial Censor's Mansion]

485
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,750
Stop!

486
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,440
Miss,

487
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,620
are you okay?

488
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,770
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

489
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,980
What are you talking about?

490
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,510
The carriage almost hit you.

491
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,370
Why are you apologizing instead?

492
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,340
My Lord?

493
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,380
My Lord.

494
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,590
My Lord,

495
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,060
we meet again.

496
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,350
You?

497
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,290
My Lord, this time,

498
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,070
I truly have a matter

499
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,600
as important as saving a life to ask you about.

500
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,890
It's that girl who fell from the sky.

501
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,730
I recognized her voice.

502
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,220
Why do I run into you

503
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,620
every time the sun rises?

504
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,300
Perhaps

505
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,120
it's related to my name.

506
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,390
Guards.

507
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,730
Get her out of here!

508
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,630
My Lord!

509
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,400
You cannot turn a blind eye when someone is dying!

510
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,450
My Lord! My Lord!

511
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,110
Ten years ago, on the night of the moon worship,

512
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,300
did we meet

513
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,180
at Yun's Mansion?

514
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,160
Ma'am.

515
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,790
Who are you?

516
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,810
Why are you sticking these things

517
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,300
in my morgue?

518
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:19,990
Ma'am,

519
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,090
I am the one staying here overnight.

520
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,470
Isn't that person named Yun Zhaoyan?

521
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,740
I...

522
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,540
am Yun Zhaoyan.

523
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,340
You are Yun Zhaoyan?

524
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,200
Why is she so forgetful?

525
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,080
This is a morgue.

526
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,090
Why would anyone be willing to stay in a morgue?

527
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,630
I am here to pay homage to my parents.

528
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,090
When did your parents come to the morgue?

529
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,410
It's not about when.

530
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:54,960
Well,

531
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,070
this place was originally Yun's Mansion,

532
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,340
my home.

533
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,290
Where did you go afterwards?

534
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,960
After I was seven, I went to many places.

535
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,260
But I always caused trouble for others

536
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,110
and was forced to leave.

537
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,340
Later,

538
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,340
everyone thought I was weird

539
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,890
and no one was willing to take me in.

540
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,410
Weird?

541
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,720
I can see things that others cannot.

542
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,370
This young master

543
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,510
has a striking appearance,

544
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,490
with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes.

545
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,820
What about his family background?

546
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,090
He came from a top-notch family.

547
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,520
And what about his character?

548
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:38,940
He...

549
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,590
Only I can see them.

550
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,240
But they always bully me.

551
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,900
These talismans are used to suppress them.

552
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,970
My Lord!

553
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,500
My Lord, come back!

554
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,420
The Soul Collecting Lamp lit up!

555
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:57,980
My Lord.

556
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,580
My Lord, your descent to the mortal world as a mortal is a trial.

557
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,920
You should be careful.

558
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,380
If you expose your immortal identity,

559
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,190
you will incur heavenly punishment.

560
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,640
Did you just say

561
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,470
the Soul Collecting Lamp lit up?

562
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,200
Could it be that renegade immortals are about to appear?

563
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,590
So what?

564
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,810
You've been here in Qingzhou for ten years.

565
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,450
You patrol every night,

566
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,940
but the Soul Collecting Lamp

567
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,460
has never lit up once.

568
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,200
Yet, on this Mid-Autumn Festival night, it suddenly did.

569
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,410
There is no moon in the sky.

570
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,550
How can it be the Mid-Autumn Festival?

571
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,760
Although there is no moon,

572
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,520
as long as you are in Qingzhou,

573
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,410
I think...

574
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,660
it will be fine.

575
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,630
The heaven can't accommodate the moon,

576
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,790
so the moon refuses to bless Qingzhou.

577
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,470
My Lord, you always refuse to admit your true thoughts.
