00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
Who is the best subject
to the King?

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,460
One who becomes
a great general

3
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,520
and conquers Liao Dong.

4
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,900
One who is skilled in martial arts
and protects the King.

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,500
One who is willing
to die for the King.

6
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
(Under Yuan's subjugation,)

7
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,390
(the Goryeo King selected
young boys)

8
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,490
(and closely trained them to be)

9
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,590
(his royal guards called
the Kunryongwe.)

10
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,690
(He allowed these boys
to reside in the palace)

11
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,870
(and always kept them
within his reach.)

(SONG Ji-Hyo)

15
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,300
Your Majesty.

16
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,320
The Princess from Yuan
has arrived at the port.

17
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,000
It is time to go meet
your Queen, Your Majesty.

18
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,720
The court subjects
are waiting, sire.

19
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,260
I haven't finished playing.

20
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,540
Wait outside.

(A Frozen Flower)

24
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,770
Stop!

25
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,570
Stop there!

26
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,170
Stop!

27
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,400
Han-Baek!

28
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,020
You've gone mad over a girl!

29
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,440
How dare you run away!

30
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,270
Chief!

31
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,420
I beg of you.

32
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,100
Please let us go.

33
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,500
Strike me down first
if you must go.

34
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,870
I have no appetite.

35
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,940
Just one spoon, sire.

36
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,290
You must regain your strength.

37
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,290
That'll do, lad.

38
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,390
Just one spoon, please?

39
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,740
Why you...

40
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,140
There.

41
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,140
You may go.

42
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,340
Your Majesty?

43
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,500
Hmm?

44
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,500
Won't you please reconsider?

45
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,170
I won't hear any more
on this matter.

46
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,480
As the Chief,

47
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,670
I'm partly responsible
for his actions.

48
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,490
If you must behead him,

49
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,120
punish me in the same regard.

50
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,020
I said, enough!

51
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,500
I beg of you, sire.

52
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,000
Chief.

53
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,340
Come in.

54
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,560
Brother!

55
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,790
Han-Baek!

56
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,490
Listen carefully.

57
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,000
The King has generously
spared Han-Baek's life.

58
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,270
However...

59
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,590
there will not be
a second chance.

60
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,560
Anyone who disgraces
the Kunryongwe's honor...

61
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,840
will pay with his life.

62
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,900
Yes, sir.

63
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,760
Thank you, sir!

64
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,990
I thought that was the last time
seeing you.

65
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,040
What a relief.

66
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,740
Chief!

67
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,200
Very impressive, sir.

68
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,570
How did you manage
to free him?

69
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,000
He's one of us, we can't
abandon him for one mistake.

70
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,220
The law says to behead the fool
who messes with a court maid.

71
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,820
It's the King's command.

72
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,400
The King's command?

73
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,720
Why of course.

74
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
What?

75
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,700
Stop clouding the King's
judgment

76
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,570
with pillow talk, sir.

77
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,400
Stop.

78
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,060
If you speak ill of
His Majesty again...

79
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,540
I'll have your head.

80
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,940
The honeysuckle tea
worked marvelously.

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,940
My fever has subsided
drastically.

82
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,970
It's a relief, sire.

83
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,140
I shall request another batch.

84
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,970
How did you know that
honeysuckle works on fevers?

85
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,390
My late father used to drink it

86
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,970
when he got colds.

87
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,470
I see.

88
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,270
What would you have done?

89
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,600
Sire?

90
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,700
If you were Han-Baek,

91
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,910
would you have left
the palace too?

92
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,140
You too have lived here
for over years.

93
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,140
Wouldn't you wanted to
run away from here?

94
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,270
How can I ever think of
leaving

95
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,539
as you are here, sire.

96
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,540
Her Majesty, the Queen.

97
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,160
Have you slept well, sire?

98
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,700
Welcome, my Queen.

99
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,300
I brought some medicine
to bring down your fever, sire.

100
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,040
No need to bring it in person.

101
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,100
I shall leave in peace, sire.

102
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,560
My physician prepared
this

103
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,170
specially for you, sire.

104
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you for your generosity.

105
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,940
I heard an envoy
from Yuan is coming.

106
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,460
Yes.

107
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,830
What more will they demand

108
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,840
on account of
the royal heir issue?

109
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,560
It worries me so.

110
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,840
Worrying will not solve anything.

111
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,570
With all due respect, sire...

112
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,940
Perhaps you should make
more effort for an heir...

113
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,840
Shall I take in
another royal concubine?

114
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,500
You wanted to see me?

115
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,440
I heard you took care of
something I should've done.

116
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,770
Pardon?

117
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,400
My maid who was arrested for
running away with a guard.

118
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,440
I heard she's alive
thanks to you.

119
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,620
I wanted to thank you
for what you did.

120
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,240
No, Your Majesty.

121
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm certain the King made
the decision with you in mind.

122
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,400
We both know that's not true.

123
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,600
However, remember this.

124
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,870
There's much clamor
over the royal heir issue.

125
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,670
Your service to the King can be
misunderstood at times like this.

126
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,070
So be careful.

127
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,240
The spring sun
is stunning, sire.

128
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,600
We should've come here earlier.

129
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,840
It's nice to be out
from the palace.

130
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,340
That sachet...

131
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,340
I haven't seen it in a while.

132
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh, this?

133
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,620
Do you remember, sire?

134
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,900
You wore that
when you first came from Yuan.

135
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,170
Its amazing that
it still carries its scent.

136
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,840
My Queen.

137
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,970
Would you care to sing?

138
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,670
Sire?

139
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,300
The Goryeo song you
always used to sing.

140
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,570
Its so unexpected,
youre making me blush.

141
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,840
What about you, Chief HONG?

142
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,140
Would you like to hear
the Queen sing?

143
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,670
See? He wants to hear it, too.

145
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,900
We'd be so obliged.

146
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,370
Oh, dear...

147
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,570
Will you leave?

148
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:55,200
Will you leave me?

149
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:05,470
How will I live without you?

150
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:17,700
If you leave me now?

151
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:27,600
I wish to keep you from leaving.

152
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:35,290
Will you not return
if I look sad?

153
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,760
- You okay?
- Yes, sire!

154
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,340
Stop them!

155
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,000
Protect the King!

156
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,280
Escort the King!

157
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,340
- Bring me my sword!
- But, sire!

158
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,600
Bring it now!

159
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,640
Your Majesty!

160
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,760
Escort the Queen!

161
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,860
Your Majesty!

162
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,980
Hurry!

163
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,120
HONG Lim, HONG Lim!

164
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,660
Are you okay?

165
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,260
Yes, sire.

166
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:03,180
Sire!

167
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
Your Majesty!

168
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,040
How is he?

169
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,210
He is still unconscious, sir.

170
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,390
Only days until the Yuan
envoy arrives,this is a tragedy!

171
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,690
You!

172
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,510
How dare you sit here
with a straight face!

173
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,210
How did you allow this tragedy
to fall upon the King?

174
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,410
You still call yourself
the Chief of the Kunryongwe?

175
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,910
I will have you and others

176
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,190
personally responsible for this!

177
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,990
Chief HONG?

178
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,360
His Majesty is calling for you.

179
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,420
Are you okay?

180
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,560
Did you get your wound treated?

181
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,390
I deserve to die, sire.

182
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,560
My incapacity to fulfill my
duties brought you harm.

183
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,990
Please have me executed.

184
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,160
No, dear lad.

185
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:24,230
If you weren't there to save me,

186
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,460
I'd already be dead.

187
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,620
Your Majesty...

188
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,960
Chief...

189
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,980
Did you find out?

190
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,480
Just as we expected, sir.

191
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,790
Remember the raid
against the Japanese?

192
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,820
The Privy Council is claiming...

193
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,620
the remnants who escaped
are behind this.

194
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,660
What are the ministers saying?

195
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,180
What would the fools say?

196
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,580
They're all waiting on Lord CHO.

197
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,820
The court is filled
with scoundrels.

198
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,520
Perhaps we can ask the King
to put Lord CHO on trial?

199
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,310
Lord CHO is
under Yuan's protection.

200
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,490
We can't touch him
without proper proof.

201
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,060
Let's say that the Japanese
are behind this for now.

202
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,990
Act as usual and
obtain the evidence discreetly.

203
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,010
The Goryeo King shall
pay respects...

204
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,060
to the Yuan Emperor's demands!

205
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:01,080
Long live the Emperor.

206
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:06,980
A royal letter to my son-in-law,
the King of Goryeo.

207
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,480
The Father of Yuan
who unified the world...

208
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,480
Knew welI the will of Heaven...

209
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,180
and took in all nations
under him.

210
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,380
A century has passed...

211
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,220
in alliance with Goryeo
through matrimony.

212
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,690
Now, the Goryeo King
is without an heir…

213
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,220
The woes of the citizens...

214
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,140
Are of my great concern.

215
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,140
Thus, I have decided
to enthrone...

216
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,840
Lord Kyungwon as Crown Prince,

217
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,390
and stabilize the Goryeo court.

218
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,240
Also, to fight off barbarians...

219
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,840
Who threaten Yuan...

220
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,240
Dispatch soldiers...

221
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,320
And maidens...

222
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,320
In respects to thy father nation!

223
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,810
Sending soldiers and maidens

224
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,910
will not last long.

225
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,090
Yuan will make even more demands
using the heir issue as an excuse.

226
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,080
Hence, appointing Lord Kyungwon
as the Crown Prince quickly...

227
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,280
and stabilizing the court
is the most viable option, sire.

228
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,590
Any other thoughts?

229
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,290
I have something to say.

230
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,720
Are you the King's subjects?
Or Lord Kyungwon's subjects?

231
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,720
My lack of virtue
has left me without an heir.

232
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,540
However!
His Majesty is yet young.

233
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,590
But you ask to enthrone one
who is not of direct descent?

234
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,220
Tell him to give up the throne!

235
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,220
That's what you all really
want to say, is it not!

236
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,190
You've drunk much, sire.

237
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,320
I shall sleep here, tonight.

238
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,860
Return to Yuan.

239
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,160
As you may already know...

240
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,490
I am incapable of taking a woman.

241
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,820
Hence,
to get an heir is hopeless.

242
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,360
Eventually, everything will be
as Yuan wishes.

243
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,860
If Lord Kyungwon becomes
the Crown Prince...

244
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,920
I shall be a king only in name.

245
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,920
What glory would there be
at my side?

246
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,360
Before things get worse...

247
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,160
Go back to your home country.

248
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,660
I am now a citizen of Goryeo.

249
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,160
How could I leave this palace
that I call home?

250
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:20,360
Then how much longer will you
endure this humiliation?

251
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,090
My Queen.

252
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,220
Yes?

253
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,260
We are not without options.

254
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,910
For the future,
it's the only way.

255
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,390
Your Majesty...

256
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,870
What are you saying, sire?

257
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,370
Who else can I trust but you?

258
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,360
I want you to serve the Queen.

259
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,970
No, sire!

260
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,240
I cannot do it.

261
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,370
His Majesty has arrived.

262
00:25:48,510 --> 00:26:06,740
Ten o'clock!

263
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,110
Go in.

264
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,170
Did you serve the Queen well?

265
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,840
Forgive me, sire.

266
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,570
You couldn't do it?

267
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,840
There are only two chances left.

268
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,140
So pull yourself together.

269
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:45,790
May I ask a question, sire?

270
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,270
You may.

271
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,970
Why did you choose me?

272
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,940
The child she'll have

273
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,340
must be as fair as you.

274
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:19,170
Midnight.

275
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,670
I will do it.

276
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,110
Morning, lad.

277
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,920
Have you slept well, sire?

278
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,550
Yes, indeed I have.

279
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,820
And you? How does it feel
to become a man?

280
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,190
What was it like to hold
a woman for the first time?

281
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,540
There is nothing to say, sire.

282
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,420
I served in accordance
to your orders.

283
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,420
I wish to visit Byuklan-do
for a few days.

284
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,650
Why?

285
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,820
I've been neglecting
my duties as the Chief.

286
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,850
I'd like to personally investigate
the attack, sire.

287
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,790
Not interested.

288
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,970
One of the biggest merchants
around

289
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,840
suddenly disappeared.

290
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,940
He went out to meet
some noble person...

291
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,520
and was never seen after that.

292
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,520
Do you know where
merchant MA's family is?

293
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,800
I have something
to report, sire.

294
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,500
What is it?

295
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,410
A merchant who smuggled
Japanese weapons

296
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,500
was found dead.

297
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,750
His name is MA Young-Gil.

298
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,210
It's possible

299
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,330
that the perpetrators killed him
to cover their tracks.

300
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,429
Have you found any ministers
who are connected to him?

301
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,929
We are investigating, sire.

302
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,300
It could be the lead we need.

303
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,670
When did Chief HONG say
he'll be back?

304
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,470
He's running quite late.

305
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,010
Please go inside and rest, sire.

306
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,770
It's getting late.

307
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,930
What if something
happened to him?

308
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,670
Go check on him, Seung-Ki.

309
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,330
Yes, sire.

310
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,000
HONG Lim?

311
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,030
What brings you here, sire?

312
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,200
I was anxious.

313
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,230
What were you doing this late?

314
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,380
I was so worried

315
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,200
something had happened to you.

316
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,970
Is something the matter?

317
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,400
No, sir.

318
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,470
You must be going
through a lot.

319
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,670
Let's return to the palace
at daybreak.

320
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Chief?

321
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,890
What's that you're hiding?

322
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,240
Should'nt you be preparing
for the banquet?

323
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,190
It's been cancelled, sir.

324
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,390
Why?

325
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,120
Just a moment ago His Majesty
went back to see the Queen.

326
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,890
- Why?
- She's said to be quite ill.

327
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,250
You have a high fever.

328
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,060
You must have exhausted
yourself

329
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,350
during the ritual.

330
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,420
Wait.

331
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,550
It could be a sign of
morning sickness.

332
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,850
Perhaps you're pregnant?

333
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:16,120
Forgive me, sire.

334
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,050
Actually...

335
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,220
my menstruation started
a few days ago.

336
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,920
So you have not conceived?

337
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,750
No, sire.

338
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:37,240
There'll be a feast to pray
for the royal conception soon.

339
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,290
Keep this a secret for now.

340
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:45,020
Yes, sire. I'll arrange the
consummation date after the feast.

341
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,590
Honeysuckle tea
is good for fevers.

342
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:55,470
Make some for the Queen.

343
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,950
Yes, Your Majesty.

344
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:02,450
But drinking too much won't
make a difference, sire.

345
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,770
What do you mean?

346
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,990
Chief HONG took some
this afternoon.

347
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,950
Was it not meant
for the Queen, sire?

348
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,490
Where are you going?

349
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,990
Were you not asleep, sire?

350
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,420
No.

351
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,190
I have something to
finish up in my room.

352
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,190
The honeysuckle tea
you gave me earlier...

353
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,490
Yes?

354
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,750
It worked well on my cold.

355
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,690
Why dont you send some
to the Queen?

356
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,650
I'm sure the court physician
will serve her well, sire.

357
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,750
You're right.

358
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,220
It wouldn't look good for you
to send her some.

359
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:27,550
You both went throug
ha lot of trouble.

360
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:33,150
However, despite your efforts,
the result was inadequate.

361
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,520
A new date for consummation
has been set.

362
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,020
But...

363
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,120
I am reluctant this time.

364
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,120
It had a great toll
on the Queen's health.

365
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:53,620
I fear it could make things worse.

366
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,890
So let us postpone this
for a while.

367
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,390
What do you think, my Queen?

368
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,550
What could I say,
Your Majesty?

369
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,550
Do as you wish, sire.

370
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,290
What do you think, lad?

371
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,450
I shall do as you command.

372
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,520
I apologize for coming
without notice, Your Majesty.

373
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,010
No need.
What brings you here?

374
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,120
I heard you were sick

375
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,290
and came to check your condition.

376
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:19,050
Thank you for the honeysuckle tea
you sent through Bo-Duk.

377
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,150
Any court subject would
do the same.

378
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,650
Ah, here...

379
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,520
What's this?

380
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,650
It is a perfume sachet.

381
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,450
A sachet?

382
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,950
I heard during the attack...

383
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,520
you lost your treasured sachet.

384
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,390
I found a similar one during
my rounds outside the palace.

385
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,390
How very thoughtful.

386
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,390
It's nothing, madam.

387
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:00,890
I'll leave you to rest.

388
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,330
We, all your subjects

389
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,570
and your people pray for

390
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:27,350
you having a prince who can
succeed to the Royal line.

391
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,270
Long live the King!

392
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,590
We pray!

393
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,490
Tae-Ahn has become
almost Goryeo people.

394
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,320
He dances well.

395
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,150
Well...

396
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,450
How did you find your sachet?

397
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:02,030
My brother brought me

398
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,190
a similar one from Yuan.

399
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,490
I see.

400
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,690
Perhaps we shouldn't have
held this feast.

401
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:15,540
What if the Queen really
bears a child?

402
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,520
If such feasts had worked,

403
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,620
there would already be an heir.

404
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,920
Look at those concubines.

405
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,150
Even Buddha's grace won't
get them an heir.

406
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,520
But it's so quiet in palace.

407
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:41,590
Because His Majesty's
so concerned about heir.

408
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,270
In any case, we must enthrone
Lord Kyungwon at once.

409
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,150
Hence, we need
solid grounds to do so.

410
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,720
How about...

411
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,670
bringing in the Queens brother?

412
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,250
Lord Tae-Ahn?

413
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,020
Chief!

414
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,550
The flower cakes are delicious.
Try some.

415
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,820
No thanks.

416
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,220
All set to perform
the sword dance?

417
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,020
Yes, sir.

418
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,020
Let's go.

419
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,520
Chief HONG?

420
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,250
Ah...

421
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,700
- Welcome.
- Your Majesty.

422
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,370
May I offer up a drink,
Your Majesty?

423
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:34,870
I beg you for the first time.

424
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,150
Please.

425
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:41,370
I don't want to ruin
this enjoyable atmosphere.

426
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,440
Please rise and enjoy
the festivities.

427
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,750
Your Majesty.

428
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:48,740
Even the late King took pleasure

429
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,790
in singing and dancing at times.

430
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,020
Will you grace us a song?

431
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:59,290
This is for you.

432
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:05,390
What is it, Your Majesty?

433
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:08,390
It is a handkerchief
I embroidered myself.

434
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,750
I hope you
always keep it on you.

435
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,390
I'll be here again
at midnight, tomorrow.

436
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:34,270
I went in to a shop

437
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:41,950
to buy some flower cakes.

438
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:54,420
A man grabbed my wrist.

439
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:05,920
If word got out

440
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:13,310
the young errand boy

441
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:19,310
would have told.

442
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:28,270
I shall go to sleep there, too.

443
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:40,110
I shall go to sleep there, too.

444
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,340
I went into a temple

445
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:53,820
to light it.

446
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,240
The temple owner

447
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:06,320
grabbed my wrist.

448
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,340
If word got out

449
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:17,890
the temple,

450
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:25,250
the young monk

451
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:31,050
would have told.

452
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:40,000
I shall go to sleep there, too.

453
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:51,990
I shall go to sleep there, too.

454
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,440
Try tile fish from Jeju Island.
It's delectabIe.

455
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,920
I will get it myself, sire.

456
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,920
You don't eat
the good food on purpose.

457
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,790
Try it.

458
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:09,720
Yes, sire.

459
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:17,490
The new clothes suit you well.

460
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,420
Do you like it?

461
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,090
Yes, sire.

462
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,720
A delightful gift for you

463
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,340
shall be arriving tomorrow.

464
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:35,790
The Sub-Chief to see you, sire.

465
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,290
What brings you here?

466
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,150
I've come to
make a report, sire.

467
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,510
About what?

468
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,130
We found out who MA smuggled
weapons to before getting killed.

469
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,620
Who is it?

470
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,190
Minister KI Won-Hong's
steward, sire.

471
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,190
KI Won-Hong?

472
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:16,190
Lord Kyungwon wants a signed
covenant from the ministers.

473
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:21,550
That will surely change
the Emperor's mind.

474
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,850
We all support Lord Kyungwon.

475
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:28,790
But will we be enough?

476
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:33,860
Right under our noses.

477
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,990
Treacherous fiends!

478
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:24,650
Your nephew's birthday?

479
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,150
Of course you should go.

480
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:29,220
Thank you for your permission,
sire.

481
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:32,250
It would be splendid if you could

482
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,850
grace us with your presence.

483
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,120
How long will you be staying?

484
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,850
I dare not leave
the palace for long, sire.

485
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,690
Good morning, sir.

486
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:52,890
Cleanse your troubling thoughts
and rest easy at home.

487
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,420
Make preparations to go, then.

488
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,590
Thank you, sire.

490
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,350
I've come to report
on the tailing last night.

491
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,550
The Sub-Chief
has already informed me.

492
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:30,570
He said you left for
the palace earlier.

493
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,620
Why report to me so late?

494
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,250
Forgive me, sire.

495
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,070
I arrived very late.

496
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,220
I was afraid to wake you.

497
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,790
You've been in my chambers
for over years.

498
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,690
Since when did you
use formalities?

499
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,020
This is the horse?

500
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,450
Yes, Your Majesty.

501
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,450
She's a real beauty.

502
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,950
Chief HONG will be so pleased
to see her.

503
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:27,420
Please forgive me,

504
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,250
but it may be a better
horse than your own.

505
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:35,750
Bring Chief HONG at once.
I want to see him ride it.

506
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:42,170
Where did Lord Tae-Ahn go
at this late hour?

507
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:46,720
It's not like the Queen
comes here everyday.

508
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,390
I heard he's been
up to something as of late.

509
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,220
Chief HONG!

510
00:56:56,190 --> 00:56:58,590
I apologize for startling you.

511
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,250
Leave us, Bo-Duk.

512
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,750
Yes, Your Majesty.

513
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,490
How did you...

514
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,790
I heard that chief HONG
went out at sunset.

515
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,290
Okay, leave.

516
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,690
Do you have something to say?

517
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,490
Offer me a drink, Your Majesty.

518
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,230
When will we ever get
to meet like this, again?

519
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,460
I'll pour you a drink
before you go.

520
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,460
Do you know
how much I despised you?

521
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,190
When I first came from Yuan...

522
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,590
I only had the King to depend on.

523
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:47,890
But he only had eyes for you.

524
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,930
It was only natural
that I resented you.

525
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:01,960
I made this myself.
Try it.

526
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,260
Flower rice cakes?

527
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:10,460
It's a Yuan custom

528
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,560
to give this to the one you love.

529
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:19,360
I've always wanted to make this
like other women.

530
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,930
Here, try it.

531
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:55,030
You don't like it?

532
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,030
No, Your Majesty.

533
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:03,830
It's exquisite.

534
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,190
Your Majesty.

535
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,690
Why do you only
favor chief HONG?

536
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,260
Am I not better than him?

537
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,690
What are you talking about?

538
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:26,690
I do favor you, too.

539
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:31,960
I want to serve
Your Majesty tonight.

540
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,760
They say 'The King is the land.'

541
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,260
Please allow me.

542
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,830
Leave.

543
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,160
What brings you here, sire?

544
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,890
Where have you been all night?

545
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,060
I asked you where you were.

546
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:53,390
I read a book on military tactics
in the library.

547
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,030
Which book was that?

548
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,530
'The Six Secret Strategies', sire.

549
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:09,560
Which among the six
did you find most amusing?

550
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,890
The politic and
the raid strategies, sire.

551
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:19,330
What was the raid strategy about?

552
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,530
What was it about?

553
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,210
It dealt with tactics
that can be used

554
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,690
when facing enemies on hills.

555
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:59,130
If you stayed up
reading on military tactics...

556
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,260
you must've practiced
your combat skills, too.

557
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,830
Bring your sword
to the Kunryong court.

558
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,830
Draw your sword!

559
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:33,130
I am yet no match for you, sire.

560
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:35,730
Winning is not the issue.

561
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,850
I want to test

562
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:42,690
how you've refined your skills as
the Chief of guards.

563
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,030
Draw your sword!

564
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,460
Dare not go easy on me
because I am the King!

565
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,860
How will you cut down
the enemies like this?

566
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,860
The sword must move with soul,
not technique!

567
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,260
No use reading on
military tactics all night.

568
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:11,860
The problem is your heart.

569
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:22,530
You are
Chief of the Kunryongwe.

570
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:26,260
Show me true loyalty
from the heart.

571
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:52,360
Minister KI, Lord CHO, and others
are gathered at Wonheung Temple.

572
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:53,860
What?

573
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,990
I think there's something big
going down, sir.

574
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,260
Lord Tae-Ahn is there, too.

575
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,760
I'm very grateful
for all your help.

576
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,280
Especially,

577
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,850
Lord Tae-Ahn for his willingness
to join our cause.

578
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:27,190
When the Emperor sees this...

579
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,150
it will be of great help
to Lord Kyungwon.

580
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:31,490
Lord Tae-Ahn.

581
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,130
You've done much
for our country.

582
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,060
Who's there?

583
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:56,710
Get down from your horse.

584
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,730
- Run, sir.
- Okay.

585
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,730
Your Majesty.

586
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:44,660
What happened?

587
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,090
He confessed everything, sire.

588
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,960
The Lord Kyungwon's
secret envoy had this.

589
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:13,160
Everyone who signed here
plotted to kill me?

590
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

591
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:22,790
What about the Queen's brother?

592
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:28,290
Lord Tae-Ahn also conspired
to enthrone Lord Kyungwon.

593
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,490
There's not one man I can trust.

594
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:03,490
I'll have a banquet in few days.

595
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:09,790
And cut all of their heads there.

596
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:15,990
But I'll not let Tae-Ahn die in
the banquet

597
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:18,660
because of Queen.

598
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:23,390
You're going to kill him
in his house.

599
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,890
All rise for His Majesty the King.

600
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:42,029
You may all be seated.

601
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:49,290
I've arranged this banquet
today...

602
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:52,060
To celebrate the victory

603
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:55,780
of our troops dispatched to Yuan.

604
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,930
Though they are fighting for
a foreign country...

605
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:01,920
they stand bravely at the front,

606
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,760
showing the valor of our army.

607
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:08,190
It's comforting somewhat.

608
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:10,190
Now.

609
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:16,390
Let us drink to
our soldier's safe return!

610
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:20,460
Hail, our gracious King!

611
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:25,090
Check your weapons.

612
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,060
And remember
who you're assigned to.

613
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:55,010
Lord CHO, how about telling
His Majesty a good sentence?

614
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,590
What a good day!

615
01:10:57,790 --> 01:11:03,530
No, I think
Minister KI should do that.

616
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,030
Okay.

617
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,090
Your Majesty?

618
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,310
I, KI Wong-Hong...

619
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:15,510
Would like to say something
on this euphoric day.

620
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:20,830
I wish you to bear an heir
and live a long life, sire.

621
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:25,680
Thank you.
I wish you a long life as well.

622
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,660
Hail, my gracious King.

623
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:35,960
Now, let us all toast
to the King!

624
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:42,760
Long live the King!

625
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,530
Stop the music!

626
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:13,160
Your attention!

627
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:18,050
With Goryeo's fall
as a tributary state to Yuan...

628
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:21,350
I've endured much humiliation
and disgrace.

629
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:25,130
I trust you all feel
the same as I do.

630
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:27,330
But, within this room...

631
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,290
there are some who take pride
in being puppets to Yuan.

632
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:38,090
As our young men are dying
in the savage land...

633
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:41,890
they believe
it should be celebrated.

634
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,390
Here today!

635
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:48,230
I shall rid of all such traitors!

636
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,360
And set the court right!

637
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:56,890
Kill them!

638
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,880
Kill off every one of them!

639
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,280
Out of my way!

640
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:43,940
Your Majesty... Please...

641
01:14:18,510 --> 01:14:20,070
Listen carefully.

642
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:24,510
I just executed
a group of conspirators.

643
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:30,570
But Lord Tae-Ahn was
also among them.

644
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:32,990
Pardon?

645
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,560
Your brother...

646
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:39,360
He was among
the group of collaborators.

647
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,280
What are you saying, sire?

648
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,060
Lord Tae-Ahn...

649
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:49,230
Chief HONG went to
execute him, now.

650
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,230
Chief HONG!

651
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,380
I am the Queen's brother!

652
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,410
Though
I may have done wrong...

653
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:04,410
how can the King have me killed?

654
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:09,020
Take the King's orders in stride,
like a royal family.

655
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,910
Chief HONG!

656
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:18,910
Why would I have signed it?

657
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:23,010
It's because I was worried
about her future.

658
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:26,290
For the sake of the Queen...

659
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:30,120
Please do not kill me.

660
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:38,530
I did what you want me to do.

661
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:41,070
He accepted it?

662
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:44,030
Yes.

663
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,570
Good job.

664
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,400
What happened to my brother?

665
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,230
Answer me.

666
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,870
Did you really kill my brother
with your own hands?

667
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:27,670
Lord Tae-Ahn is alive.

668
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:29,730
What?

669
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:36,470
He and his family are
headed for Yuan now

670
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,170
Is that true?

671
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:43,230
Yes.

672
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:49,730
Cover it.

673
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,600
No need to bring me his head.

674
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,300
Forgive me, sire.

675
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,600
Chief HONG...

676
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:14,020
Did he truly let
Lord Tae-Ahn go?

677
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:17,100
I saw with my own eyes, sire.

678
01:17:24,870 --> 01:17:27,300
I've asked you both here...

679
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:31,300
to discuss and conclude
our postponed matter.

680
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:35,030
Things have stabilized.

681
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:40,030
So, I'd like to resume
the consummation.

682
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:46,530
What do you think, my Queen?

683
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:49,200
Why all of a sudden, sire?

684
01:17:52,230 --> 01:17:55,610
I'm resuming what was postponed.

685
01:17:55,690 --> 01:17:57,630
Why be so surprised?

686
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:06,300
But, your partner
will not be HONG Lim this time.

687
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,800
It's Seung-Ki.

688
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:16,530
The result was not good
with HONG Lim.

689
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,720
Seung-Ki is also one of my
most trusted men.

690
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,370
I hope you understand.

691
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,300
Have you gone mad, sir?

692
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,820
How can you humiliate me so?

693
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,700
This cannot be, Your Majesty.

694
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:33,230
Why are you doing this, sire?

695
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,530
HONG Lim...

696
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:41,030
Do you really not know why
I made such decision?

697
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:49,930
It's a royal order.

698
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:55,230
I will set
the consummation date soon.

699
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,200
Who is it?

700
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,770
Let's leave the palace.

701
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,000
Anywhere,
if we can leave the palace.

702
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,390
Let's run away from here!

703
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:41,970
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

704
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,960
Where do you want to go?

705
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,350
Yuan? Hide in the hills?

706
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:47,650
Ill follow you anywhere.

707
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:52,000
Take me away from here, please.

708
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:58,000
Please go back.

709
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:00,770
If he finds out you're here,

710
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,950
your life will be in danger.

711
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:04,330
It doesn't matter.

712
01:20:04,730 --> 01:20:07,000
I have nothing more
to be afraid of now.

713
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,130
But, I am afraid.

714
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,670
Do not come for me again.

715
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,330
I will live only as
the King's subject from now on.

716
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,730
Your Majesty.

717
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,570
I deserve to die.

718
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:56,540
I was blinded by foolish desires

719
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:59,850
and betrayed and humiliated you.

720
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,080
This is the very sword
you granted me.

721
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:12,910
Please take my life with it.

722
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:17,850
I shall seek your forgiveness
in death.

723
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:29,080
You've given away something
more precious than life.

724
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,210
What good would it do
to take your life, now?

725
01:22:04,610 --> 01:22:06,910
Has Chief HONG
retired to his room?

726
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,910
He is still
in the back garden, sire.

727
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:47,480
Luckily, she will be fine.

728
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:50,610
No need to worry, Your Majesty.

729
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:01,080
I will ask you just one thing.

730
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:09,480
Your liaisons with the Queen...

731
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,580
Was it all impulsive lust?

732
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,310
Yes.

733
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,310
Your Majesty.

734
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:34,450
Go serve at the border
in a few weeks.

735
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:40,810
It will help you forget about
everything here.

736
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,810
You didn't sleep all night.

737
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:01,010
Stay and rest.

738
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:52,450
Your tunes
have become rather dull.

739
01:24:56,310 --> 01:24:58,450
Do it again.

740
01:25:55,710 --> 01:25:58,010
Do you know where this is?

741
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:01,810
Where is it, sire?

742
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:09,350
I dreamt of hunting through
the Liao Dong plains with you.

743
01:26:10,710 --> 01:26:14,510
It was so vivid,
I wanted to paint it.

744
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:23,780
Then that is me riding behind?

745
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,280
Why? Do you not like it?

746
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:36,780
Perhaps it would be better...

747
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:39,350
if I was shooting an arrow, too.

748
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:45,050
Now that you mention it,
that'll suit better..

749
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:50,910
Are you leaving tomorrow?

750
01:26:52,210 --> 01:26:53,250
Yes, sire.

751
01:26:54,510 --> 01:26:58,410
Our soldiers dispatched to Yuan
will be returning in two weeks.

752
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:01,580
I will hold a big banquet.

753
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,080
Why don't you leave
after that?

754
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:07,410
No, sire.

755
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,250
I will leave as scheduled.

756
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,080
Who is it?

757
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:37,450
Chief HONG?
It's me Bo-Duk.

758
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:41,150
What is it?

759
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:43,980
I have something
urgent to tell you.

760
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:48,850
Go back.

761
01:27:56,050 --> 01:28:00,110
I'm so sorry. Chief HONG.

762
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:02,310
I said Go back.

763
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:06,010
The Queen wants to see you.

764
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:09,150
I don't want to.

765
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:13,810
Please, just one time.

766
01:28:14,110 --> 01:28:16,010
Please.

767
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:32,280
I cannot see her.

768
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:34,850
Just go.

769
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,550
But Chief...

770
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:41,880
The Queen has conceived.

771
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:47,550
It's been a Iong time.

772
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:11,050
I'm so sorry.

773
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:22,640
I was troubled whether to tell you

774
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:25,950
just before your departure.

775
01:30:27,910 --> 01:30:29,950
Does His Majesty know?

776
01:30:31,210 --> 01:30:33,210
I haven't told him yet.

777
01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:37,350
I doubt he'll welcome
this child, now.

778
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:41,010
I fear it will
only harm the child.

779
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:43,980
No, Your Majesty.

780
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:49,510
The King will truly accept
the child as his own.

781
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:00,450
Please keep strong.

782
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:03,450
I shall be going, then.

783
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:12,850
HONG Lim.

784
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:18,920
Secretary HWANG?

785
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,300
Yes, Your Majesty?

786
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,700
Where are
the military tactic books stored?

787
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:11,650
You!

788
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:15,980
How could you humiliate
me like this!

789
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:19,150
And you call yourself a man!

790
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:21,810
What did you promise me?

791
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,700
You said you'll never
meet her again!

792
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,200
But...

793
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:31,400
How can you do this to me!

794
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,570
Queen.

795
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:41,700
What should I do with him?

796
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,230
That lewd fool!

797
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,070
What shall I do with him?

798
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:54,400
Say something!

799
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:58,170
It's all my fault, sire.

800
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:02,070
My affections for him
led me to seduce him.

801
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:05,570
Punish me instead, sire.

802
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:07,230
No, Your Majesty!

803
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:10,900
The Queen is without fault!

804
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:16,470
I sought her,
unable to fight my love for her.

805
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:19,300
Take my life, sire.

806
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:26,300
What?

807
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,470
Did I hear love?

808
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:39,630
Did you... say
you love the Queen?

809
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:41,900
Yes.

810
01:34:44,700 --> 01:34:46,300
I love her.

811
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,500
Say it again.

812
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:57,130
Did you just say
you're in love with the Queen?

813
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,070
Yes.

814
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,630
I love the Queen.

815
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:11,470
You've gone mad with lust!

816
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,630
Sub-Chief!

817
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:16,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

818
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:19,830
Have him castrated!

819
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:24,370
But sire...

820
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:27,570
Cut it off at once!

821
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:30,630
Your Majesty...

822
01:35:31,130 --> 01:35:33,720
What are you waiting for!
Cut it off!

823
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,500
Please, Your Majesty!

824
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,200
Kill me, Your Majesty!

825
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,820
Forgive him, sire!
I'll never meet him again.

826
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,920
Just kill me instead!

827
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,220
Forgive him, please!
It'll never happen again!

828
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,220
Your Majesty!

829
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:51,350
No! No!
Your Majesty!

830
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:53,380
- I'd rather die, sire!
- Forgive me, sire!

831
01:35:55,410 --> 01:35:58,930
Kill me instead!

832
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:01,150
Castrate him now!

833
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:03,980
Sire!

834
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,700
Please don't!

835
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:08,800
Sire!

836
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:11,310
No, Your Majesty!

837
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:17,550
Sire!

838
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:23,020
Your Majesty!

839
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:25,670
I have an urgent matter
to inform you.

840
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:30,270
What is it?

841
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:36,390
Your Majesty...

842
01:37:36,470 --> 01:37:38,400
Congratulations, sir.

843
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:42,730
The Queen
has finally conceived!

844
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:51,270
The long awaited heir
has finally come.

845
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:56,330
What a blessing
for the royal family, sire.

846
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:12,420
I need you to do something.

847
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:13,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

848
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:17,570
The Queen has conceived a child.

849
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:19,070
Sire?

850
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:26,570
You know very well
whose child it is.

851
01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:30,470
For that child to become
truly mine...

852
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,570
What should be done?

853
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:43,630
When the night falls...

854
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
eliminate everyone involved.

855
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:49,430
Yes, Your Majesty.

856
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:55,470
But, what about chief HONG?

857
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:19,370
Now we're same.

858
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:27,470
Who would find you,
if I don't.

859
01:39:29,570 --> 01:39:31,670
I suggest a simple thing.

860
01:39:33,070 --> 01:39:35,200
Let's get back to the first place.

861
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:39,260
If you come back,

862
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,670
I'll give you everything.

863
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:47,970
Even this country.

864
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,700
I must save Chief HONG.

865
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:02,830
Do you know why the King
summoned me earlier?

866
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:05,870
He said he'll accept
this child as his.

867
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,830
How can there be two fathers?

868
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:16,750
The moment this child
becomes the royal heir...

869
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:19,530
everyone who
knows of this will die.

870
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:23,650
Quickly, take this to Han-Baek.

871
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:26,370
And follow Chief HONG to
Eunjung Temple.

872
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:30,370
But, Your Majesty...

873
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:34,520
If the King accepts
this child as his...

874
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,370
Will you not be safe?

875
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,800
Why bring calamity upon yourself?

876
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,870
There is no time.

877
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,500
Go, now!

878
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,530
Your Majesty...

879
01:40:58,230 --> 01:40:59,370
No! Please!

880
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:28,590
Chief!

881
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:32,390
Chief!

882
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:38,880
Let's get out of here.

883
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,660
Wear this.

884
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:43,780
How did you come here?

885
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:46,060
The Queen told us.

886
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:48,860
What?

887
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,860
We have to get out of here first.
Hurry up.

888
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:54,360
The Queen?

889
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:55,780
What are you talking about?

890
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:58,230
Please stand up.
We don't have time.

891
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,660
How's she?

892
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,060
How is the Queen?

893
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:06,830
The Queen went out of palace.

894
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:32,290
Forgive me, sire.

895
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:49,130
Chief!

896
01:42:52,490 --> 01:42:54,680
Are you okay, sir?

897
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:56,460
Hurry! Take him inside.

898
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:00,760
Where is the Queen?

899
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:02,630
What?

900
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:04,760
Where is the Queen?

901
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:06,630
The Queen?

902
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:11,130
Didn't you bring her with you?

903
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:14,210
What are you saying, sir?

904
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:16,790
The Queen is not here, Chief.

905
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:18,690
What?

906
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:22,790
Forgive us.
We lied to you.

907
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:40,990
Where is HONG Lim?

908
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:43,990
I do not know, sire.

909
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:52,380
Don't you want your child
to see the light of day?

910
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,110
Tell me where HONG Lim is.

911
01:43:57,310 --> 01:43:59,950
I do not know.

912
01:44:00,030 --> 01:44:02,450
Take my life if you must, sire.

913
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:07,110
I can't let you die so easily.

914
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:11,180
If you give a birth,

915
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:16,150
I'll raise him as a son of
whom did high treason.

916
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:20,010
You should see that.

917
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:24,180
Talk to me.

918
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:28,610
I don't know.

919
01:44:32,110 --> 01:44:36,680
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to hear from you.

920
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:46,350
Let's go.

921
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:48,030
Let me go.

922
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:49,630
- Come on!
- What are you doing?

923
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:52,230
- Let her go!
- Your Majesty!

924
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:54,280
How dare you!

925
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,700
What are you doing, Chief?

926
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,510
Please listen to me.

927
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:00,200
- Chief
- Where are you going, sir!

928
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:03,680
- Chief!
- Chief!

929
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:05,780
Out of my way!

930
01:45:05,980 --> 01:45:07,900
It's what the Queen wanted!

931
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:09,550
Don't do this!

932
01:45:10,150 --> 01:45:11,370
Out of my way!

933
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:14,370
Do you really think
you can save her?

934
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:16,570
I came here because of you, sir.

935
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:18,080
Please get off the horse.

936
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:20,250
Out of my way, now!

937
01:45:21,150 --> 01:45:23,050
If you must, then go.

938
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:25,750
But...

939
01:45:26,110 --> 01:45:28,250
What will you do
after bringing her here?

940
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:31,410
All is lost.

941
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,250
What can you do for her?

942
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,750
Do you think
you can make her happy?

943
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:50,910
- Chief!
- Chief!

944
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:34,980
Where is HONG Lim?

945
01:47:38,380 --> 01:47:40,810
Where is HONG Lim?

946
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:47,010
How much more
do you think you can endure?

947
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:50,710
Tell me where he is!

948
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:03,550
He already left.

949
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:07,680
Why are you doing this?

950
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:12,280
How dare you!

951
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,950
Heads on stakes!

952
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:45,380
There are heads on stakes!

953
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:16,370
Today...

954
01:50:17,240 --> 01:50:19,290
in recognition of

955
01:50:19,370 --> 01:50:22,060
our dispatched soldiers to Yuan...

956
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:24,200
I have arranged this banquet.

957
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:27,460
I will see to our soldiers

958
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:29,700
fighting for Goryeo alone.

959
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:33,460
I want all of you
to mark this occasion.

960
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:37,860
Drink to your hearts' content
and enjoy!

961
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:41,470
Long live the King!

962
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:37,560
You look exhausted, sire.

963
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,840
Please retire to your chambers.

964
01:51:40,570 --> 01:51:43,700
Do you really think
Chief HONG will come?

965
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:23,100
Your Majesty.

966
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:28,600
Please take down the heads
hanging over the castle wall.

967
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:32,040
It's not a matter of your concern.

968
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:34,240
Now, go.

969
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:38,440
Everything happened
as you wanted, sire!

970
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:43,600
So, please let Chief HONG go.

971
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,040
Sub-Chief?

972
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:49,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

973
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:53,500
Escort the Queen
to her chambers.

974
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:55,670
Yes, sire.

975
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:45,900
I shall leave in you peace.

976
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:51,540
You're the only one left, now.

977
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:57,540
Pardon?

978
01:53:58,210 --> 01:54:00,840
Everyone involved has died.

979
01:54:01,770 --> 01:54:04,270
You are the only one left.

980
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:07,040
What do you mean, My Queen?

981
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:14,340
You know perfectly why
Han-Baek and Bo-Duk were slain.

982
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:20,340
Eventually, you will be silenced
in secrecy, too.

983
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:40,810
There is no one else who can
stop His Majesty's madness.

984
01:54:41,610 --> 01:54:43,730
Release him

985
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:46,110
from his pains tonight.

986
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:50,510
I am the Princess of Yuan.

987
01:54:51,670 --> 01:54:54,030
If Lord Kyungwon succeeds
to the throne...

988
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:58,810
I shall at least
guarantee your life.

989
01:55:22,540 --> 01:55:23,740
Out of my way.

990
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:26,040
I came to see the King.

991
01:55:26,770 --> 01:55:29,130
Why'd you come here?

992
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:31,040
You're wanted for high treason.

993
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:32,970
Let me through.

994
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:34,740
We can't, sir.

995
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:38,040
Please leave
before anyone sees you.

996
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:40,340
I do not wish to strike you.

997
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,510
Out of my way.

998
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:44,210
No, sir!

999
01:55:54,770 --> 01:55:59,630
Chief, Han-Baek, and the others
were not traitors?

1000
01:55:59,710 --> 01:56:03,690
If what you say is true,
it affects us, too.

1001
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:06,830
But why are you
telling us this, now?

1002
01:56:06,910 --> 01:56:09,710
If I hadn't kept it
a secret till now...

1003
01:56:10,510 --> 01:56:12,470
do you think you'd be alive?

1004
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:19,640
Chief HONG!

1005
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:33,840
Sir!
Chief HONG has returned!

1006
01:56:34,370 --> 01:56:35,220
What?

1007
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:38,240
He's engaging the guard
at the court!

1008
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:20,270
Where have you been?

1009
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,970
You've been through a lot
haven't you?

1010
01:57:47,140 --> 01:57:48,840
Why are you standing there?

1011
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:51,810
Come and sit by me.

1012
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:58,770
I came to take your life, sire.

1013
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:04,570
Pick up your sword, sire.

1014
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:08,640
It is my final show of respect.

1015
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:14,740
Why did you do it, sire?

1016
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:20,140
How can you do that
to the Queen?

1017
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:25,740
Pick up your sword, sire!

1018
01:58:28,610 --> 01:58:30,310
You fool.

1019
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:37,810
Shall I strike first, sire?

1020
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:40,610
Stand up, Your Majesty.

1021
01:58:56,970 --> 01:58:58,170
Fine.

1022
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:01,840
If killing me
will ease your anger...

1023
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:05,970
then try and kill me!

1024
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:50,210
Do you really think
you can beat me?

1025
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:53,310
I've been cut to my roots.

1026
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:59,310
There is nothing left
for me to fear.

1027
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:23,030
You castrated fool!

1028
02:00:23,110 --> 02:00:25,160
Was love so important?

1029
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,940
You led me to feel love.

1030
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:31,010
I couldn't be more grateful!

1031
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:43,340
- Your Majesty!
- Stay back!

1032
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:48,010
Anyone who intervenes
will be the first to die!

1033
02:01:48,610 --> 02:01:49,580
Sire!

1034
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:21,910
Nobody moves until I say so!

1035
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:27,310
I will give you one last chance.

1036
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:30,310
Drop your sword and surrender.

1037
02:02:32,910 --> 02:02:35,410
Then I shall spare your life.

1038
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:38,380
It is too late, sire.

1039
02:02:39,810 --> 02:02:41,710
Finish me, sire.

1040
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:44,210
Fine.

1041
02:02:46,010 --> 02:02:47,510
I'll kill you.

1042
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:12,110
What is going on?

1043
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,230
You cannot enter, Your Majesty.

1044
02:03:15,310 --> 02:03:16,610
Please go back.

1045
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:30,900
Let me ask you one thing.

1046
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:34,600
Have you, at least once...

1047
02:03:36,030 --> 02:03:38,600
Felt love for me?

1048
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:46,030
Have you...

1049
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,400
Even once...

1050
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:54,100
Thought me to be your love?

1051
02:04:00,330 --> 02:04:01,770
No, sire.

1052
02:04:05,130 --> 02:04:07,770
Not even once!

1053
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:24,760
Not yet!

1054
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:47,250
- Your Majesty!
- No!

1055
02:05:47,330 --> 02:05:49,130
Out of my way!

1056
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:59,130
HONG Lim!

1057
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:01,920
Escort the Queen
to her chambers!

1058
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,250
HONG Lim!

1059
02:06:03,330 --> 02:06:06,250
Let go of me!

1060
02:06:06,330 --> 02:06:08,620
HONG Lim!

1061
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:10,130
Take her, now!

1062
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:15,050
How dare you!
Let go of me!

1063
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:21,560
How did this happen!
HONG Lim! HONG Lim!

1064
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:06,000
The King has just passed away
in the hands of an assassin.

1065
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:10,500
And we killed the assailant.

1066
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:13,800
Quickly move the bodies...

1067
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:17,400
and make sure
none of this gets out.

1068
02:07:19,030 --> 02:07:20,230
Yes, sir.

1069
02:08:01,860 --> 02:08:05,630
The palace looks really great
up here.

1070
02:08:06,660 --> 02:08:07,730
Really?

1071
02:08:09,230 --> 02:08:11,360
Do you know
where the court is?

1072
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:15,560
The court where you live, right?
Where is it?

1073
02:08:16,060 --> 02:08:17,060
My home?

1074
02:08:18,130 --> 02:08:20,560
My home is right there.

1075
02:08:20,990 --> 02:08:22,110
What do you think?

1076
02:08:22,190 --> 02:08:25,910
It's great.
I would love to live there.

1077
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:28,690
Then how about living together
in our entire life?

1078
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:30,460
Yes, Sire!
