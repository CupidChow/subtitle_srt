1
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Go! Go! Go!

2
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,320
Li.

3
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,200
What took you so long?

4
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,000
I just killed two useless servants.

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,920
It took some time.

6
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,120
Just kidding.

7
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,840
Your birthday is coming.

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
I prepared a birthday gift for you.

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,920
Really?

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,640
I made it myself.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,800
Do you like it?

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,080
I like whatever Li gives me.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,080
Besides,

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,680
you made this yourself.

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,080
Li,

16
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,200
This bracelet is unique in the world.

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,280
My birthday is coming.

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,680
I also prepared a gift for you.

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,000
I hope you'll be happy on my birthday.

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,600
Let me help you.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,240
How is it? Is it pretty?

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,160
Yes.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,680
From now on,

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
I will give this bracelet a new meaning.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,920
and let them know

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,440
this is the representative of the Saint Girl.

27
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,320
I'm scared of you when I see this bracelet.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,680
Yes.

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,040
Huaiyou.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,440
I went to your room to look for you.

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,120
but you weren't there.

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
There you are.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,760
What's wrong?

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Are you in a bad mood?

35
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,640
I brought you roasted scorpion.

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,040
I scolded you yesterday because of the invincible East.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,560
I apologize.

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,640
Li,

39
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,520
You don't have to apologize to me.

40
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,200
If you really need a bodyguard,

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,600
I'll convince myself to accept it.

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,040
But...

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,360
please don't be cold to me

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
because of him.

45
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
I yelled at you yesterday

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,400
because I was in a bad mood.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,200
It's because of Momiko.

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,400
Speaking of which, I can't remember.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,680
When did she come to me?

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,880
Do you remember?

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Li,

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,240
You've lost your mind this time. It's really serious.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,840
Seven years ago, when we took back the Yinyang Sect,

54
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
Chief saw a girl from the Western Region

55
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,080
was severely punished in the sect.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,120
and couldn't bear to see her suffer.

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,000
So I kept her.

58
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
for three years before I became your personal maid.

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,080
Don’t you remember?

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,600
You have such a deep relationship with Chief?

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,560
Li,

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
If you are really sad because of me,

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,640
I'll sneak into the Criminal Investigation Bureau

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,600
to kill her

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,840
No need.

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,280
Let her be alone.

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,079
Alright.

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
Don't be in a bad mood.

69
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,400
Have some roasted scorpion.

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,720
Okay.

71
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm back.

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
The emperor has no Ye.

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,240
The emperor has no Ye.

74
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,200
Where is he?

75
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
Lord Wuye.

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Where is he?

77
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,720
The Emperor has no Ye.

78
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,520
What are you doing?

79
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,200
You can open your eyes now.

80
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,280
So many.

81
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Is it spicy chicken again?

82
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,800
And pine corn.

83
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,680
When did you prepare this?

84
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,440
How did you know I like it?

85
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,720
I always listened to others’ advice.

86
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,720
So I think

87
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,800
more and more blurred in my eyes.

88
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,840
I don't trust them anymore.

89
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,680
I believe in my heart.

90
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,760
I know better

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,640
what you like.

92
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
Try this.

93
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
How did you know I wanted this the most?

94
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,920
What is this?

95
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,440
Open it and you'll know.

96
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,120
This is a sky lantern.

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
I think you might

98
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,800
you might get the answer today.

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
or get nothing.

100
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,440
It won't be easy no matter what.

101
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
So I prepared this.

102
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,159
The emperor has no Ye.

103
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
Do you know what you're doing now

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,320
is like flirting with girls?

105
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,280
Seducing girls?

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
What is flirting?

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,880
If you have any wishes,

108
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,240
you can write on it.

109
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,560
Let's write together.

110
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,840
What are you writing?

111
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,640
So mysterious.

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,160
Of course.

113
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,080
I hope I can be happy every day.

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,040
Don't you have any wishes to write?

115
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,040
You're done.

116
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,120
Let's play it.

117
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,640
Let's go.

118
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
Cheer up, everyone.

119
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Once the password is here,

120
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,680
Action immediately.

121
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,680
Yes.

122
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,120
The emperor has no Ye, look.

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,040
The sky lantern is flying.

124
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,720
The signal is here. Let's go.

125
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,640
Why are there so many sky lanterns suddenly?

126
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
How many people want this?

127
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,120
The emperor has no Ye.

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
I searched Hongye's room.

129
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,280
It was clearly cleaned.

130
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,400
But we found an unfinished page

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,120
in the charcoal pot ashes.

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,200
This drawing

133
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,320
looks like Wangyue Palace.

134
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
How's your investigation?

135
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,920
I heard from Mo Huaiyou that

136
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,600
after I entered the night sky,

137
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,080
I've been with you for three years.

138
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,920
Chief,

139
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Your father Jiang Gang is the one who is investigating this time.

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,200
If you're sad,

141
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,240
If I use Miaoyou

142
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,840
with Miaoyan

143
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,400
to find out what he said.

144
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600
You'll believe me one day.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,040
Although I came to this world

146
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,720
I was forced to have various identities and relationships.

147
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
But what kind of person do you want to be?

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,640
What kind of person do you want to be?

149
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I have the final say.

150
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Let's go.

151
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,440
You haven't visited me for a long time.

152
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,840
You're pissing me off.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,520
I think you want to piss me off.

154
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,840
and inherit the throne as soon as possible.

155
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,720
Rock, paper, scissors.

156
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,840
I won. Truth or Dare?

157
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,600
As usual. Truth.

158
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,160
Have you ever thought about

159
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,800
to do a fire business with Miaosheng?

160
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,240
What?

161
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,120
You want to do firearms business with Miao Song?

162
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,240
I’ll break your legs.

163
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,840
Don't.

164
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,880
I was just asking.

165
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,920
Ask.

166
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,960
Don't ask.

167
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,840
Although we're the devil in the martial world at night,

168
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,200
but he is nothing.

169
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
I'll kill whoever I see.

170
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
Rock, paper, scissors.

171
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,120
Can I take some gifts this time?

172
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,040
Your status in Jianghu is not good recently.

173
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,880
Nothing.

174
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,840
It's empty.

175
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,320
It's empty.

176
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,680
You took all my stuff.

177
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,480
It's still empty.

178
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,920
Boring.

179
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
Take it easy.

180
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,320
Save some for me.

181
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,000
The totem of Wangyue Palace.

182
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:09,520
Lord Ming Peng.

183
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,160
Lord Hengming Peng.

184
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,280
Feng Ang.

185
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:16,960
Army Dragon Zhang Changhao Lei.

186
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,920
Mansion.

187
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,560
Wai Yong Peng.

188
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,160
Wai Yong Peng.
