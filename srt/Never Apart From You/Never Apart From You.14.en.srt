1
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,440
It's been a long time.

2
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,160
Jun Wu Ye, stop it.

3
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,200
My lord, please wait.

4
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,680
What are you waiting for?

5
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,840
I think

6
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,960
he's bewitched by that witch.

7
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,840
Guards!

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,800
Your Excellency!

9
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

10
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,479
What do you want?

11
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,759
Please give me more time.

12
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
even for an hour.

13
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,800
If Wu Ye

14
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,600
Wu Ye still couldn't find anything.

15
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,840
I

16
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,640
I'm willing to bear the punishment with him.

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,039
You...

18
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,560
I believe he's not

19
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,320
who doesn't tell right from wrong.

20
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,520
He is willing to risk

21
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,880
for this.

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,160
As his brother,

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,080
I dare not.

24
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,880
You...

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,960
The emperor has no Ye.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,560
How long are you going to keep this up?

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,360
Please take a look.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,640
My lord.

29
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,960
The medicine in the stomach

30
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,120
is indeed delayed.

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,079
Based on the time of digestion and poisoning,

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,000
Jiang Ruoli wasn't the one who poisoned him.

33
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,040
The Emperor has no Ye.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,800
I knew you could do it.

35
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,440
Li,

36
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,079
Go back for a few days.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,760
I have some work to do.

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,800
I'll go with you.

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,079
Now I've cleared my name.

40
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,480
Li,

41
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
Go back first.

42
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,320
I'll come to you later.

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,440
Why do I feel like you're kicking me out?

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
He's kicking you out.

45
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
He committed a serious crime of dismemberment

46
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,560
He must be punished in the Criminal Investigation Bureau.

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,520
My lord,

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,800
Didn't you promise Wu Ye not to mention this?

49
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,240
Can you...

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,800
for the sake of our years working together,

51
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,480
for the sake of our years working together?

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,600
Come on.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,640
Arrest Jun Wu Ye!

54
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,280
Wait.

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,360
Don't touch him!

56
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,280
My lord.

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
It's Miaoyou's Gu-infected mark.

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
Hongye.

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,760
It's a red leaf.

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,560
[Jiang Ruo Li]

61
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,520
The evidence is solid that he colluded with Miaoyou.

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,600
This is a capital crime.

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,320
Come on.

64
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,000
Take this witch

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,560
to be executed.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:43,840
Yes.

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,240
Not me

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,800
Governor Zhao

69
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,720
The emperor has no Ye.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,360
How dare you!

71
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,320
I haven't discussed your crime with you.

72
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,200
Move!

73
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,240
Take him away!

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

75
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,760
Move!

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
The emperor has no Ye.

77
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:56,840
Wu Ye.

78
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,079
Wu Ye.

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,360
Magistrate Zhao

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,280
Stop chasing

81
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,920
It's not wise to chase after him now.

82
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,080
Let's think about it.

83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,600
The emperor has no Ye.

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Is that you?

85
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,640
Jiang Ruoli.

86
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,279
You won't get

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,959
what I can't get.

88
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,240
It really wasn't me.

89
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,240
She just told me

90
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,320
a bunch of nonsense.

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Then he died.

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,240
How dare you deny it?

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,040
Your Excellency,

94
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,800
we searched Hongye in advance.

95
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,320
There's no drug possession.

96
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,040
Don't touch him.

97
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,080
My lord.

98
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,520
It's Miao Heng's Gu-infected mark.

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you doing?

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
The Emperor has no Ye.

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
Li, are you alright?

102
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
I'm fine.

103
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,200
Are you okay?

104
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,560
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,720
We can't stay here for long. Let's go.

106
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,360
Okay.

107
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,760
You haven't changed yet. Don't peek.

108
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,960
What's wrong?

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,880
Nothing, I just scratched it.

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,120
Waiter.

111
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,040
Have you seen these two people?

112
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,000
They look familiar.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
These two are wanted criminals.

114
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
Those who don't report

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,920
will be punished severely.

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,840
We found a trace of a suspicious man in the city.

117
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,480
Why are you still searching here?

118
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,120
My lord.

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,440
If you lose the criminal,

120
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,600
you'll be held responsible.

121
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,240
Has he left?

122
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,240
Yes.

123
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,080
That's good.

124
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,200
We have to leave the city as soon as possible.

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,880
Okay.

126
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,720
You shouldn't have broken into the prison for me.

127
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,080
I got you into trouble.

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
In this situation,

129
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,480
It's true that

130
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,159
to be

131
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,400
to be a good criminal.

132
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,280
is a betrayal.

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,640
But my mother also said

134
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,280
to be a good official,

135
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,520
to be a good official.

136
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,920
That's the ability to tell right from wrong.

137
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,720
I broke into the prison

138
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,920
because I couldn't stand

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,480
you were framed.

140
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,720
But

141
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
you shouldn't do this for me.

142
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,720
You said it yourself.

143
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,000
what kind of person you want to be.

144
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,440
What kind of person do you want to go with?

145
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,640
is up to you.

146
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,880
This

147
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,360
is consistent with my point of view.

148
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,760
So don't blame yourself.

149
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,760
This is my choice.

150
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,320
I hope the truth will come out soon.

151
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,680
In this way,

152
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,880
you can go back

153
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,960
to the Criminal Investigation Bureau.

154
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,120
Thanks to you

155
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,640
The mushrooms are ready.

156
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,400
You eat first.

157
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm not hungry.

158
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
You eat.

159
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,480
You're not hungry?

160
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,320
You haven't eaten anything all the way.

161
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,360
I have.

162
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,520
When picking mushrooms,

163
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,080
I ate two wild fruits.

164
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,480
When did you eat wild fruits?

165
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,040
Why didn't you tell me?

166
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:38,960
Ming Peng.

167
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,280
Peng Jun.

168
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,280
Tong Ming.

169
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,760
Feng Ang is stable.

170
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,040
Steady.

171
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,720
Changhao Lei.

172
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,600
Wai Yong Peng.
