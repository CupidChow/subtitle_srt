1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,360
Open the body.

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
and do a comprehensive examination.

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,760
You want to open my mother's body?

4
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,840
Do you know what you're talking about?

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,680
The crime of slaughtering a corpse?

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,480
This is an unfilial offence.

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,440
Punish him according to the law.

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,640
Execute?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,160
How dare you

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,280
in front of me?

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,800
It's so treacherous.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,600
and disregard people.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,160
What are you up to?

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,560
What am I thinking?

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,160
Think about it.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,200
If I really wanted to hurt your mother,

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
I wouldn't have tried so hard to defend her.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,480
Besides,

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,360
didn't you want to find out the cause of your mother's death?

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,520
In this world,

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,160
there are many deaths that can't be seen on the outside.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,080
What if she died from lime?

23
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,760
What if she was dry drowning?

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,960
If she had cerebral haemorrhage

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,760
gastric perforation caused acute abdominal diseases.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,160
The pancreas rupture caused digestive endocardia to dissolve internal organs.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,320
Can you tell?

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,800
I know you care about the dead.

29
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,759
But

30
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:33,720
Only dissection

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,240
is the only way to find out the cause of death.

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,320
How could a saintess like you

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,840
know these?

34
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,160
I know a lot of things.

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
I have to explain everything to you.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,920
What I want to do is to find out the truth

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,759
and clear my name.

38
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,479
You want to help your mother find the murderer

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,039
and comfort your mother's soul in heaven?

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,759
I hope you won't talk big.

41
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't worry.

42
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,000
I’ll find out the cause of death for you.

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,880
Aunt Luo has been dead for a while.

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,560
Why is your body not rotten at all?

45
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,160
Mother.

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,400
Please bless me.

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,240
I believe her decision is right.

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,240
There's no blood on her head.

49
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,800
and the stomach is fine.

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,840
The liver, spleen, kidneys are fine.

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,800
The lungs are fine too.

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
What happened?

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,600
It's okay.

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,960
Why is my heart still beating?

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
No way.

56
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,760
Could it be a medical fake death?

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,240
Then my anatomy will become

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,680
Murder.

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,280
Jiang Ruoli, what's wrong?

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,360
I'm fine.

61
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,680
What is this?

62
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,400
Something is flying out.

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,120
Go after him!

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,840
What's with that bug?

65
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,560
The Emperor has no Ye.

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,120
You must be careful.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,520
Why isn't he back yet?

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,960
Did something happen?

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,480
No, I have to find him.

70
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,040
The emperor has no Ye.

71
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,400
The king has no Ye.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
Where did he go?

73
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,280
It's getting dark.

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,800
Don't be in danger.

75
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,800
What the hell is this place?

76
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,960
Demon, I finally caught you!

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,600
You lost your mind.

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,600
You deserve it.

79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
The guard beside you ran away.

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Mo Huaiyou is not here either.

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,000
You lost all your power. Die!

82
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,600
Help! Help!

83
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,520
Who are you?

84
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,160
Evil woman.

85
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
You must have killed my father.

86
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,480
We need to think about it.

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,080
While she's out of control,

88
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,360
while she's out of control.

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,240
Father!

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
My father.

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
Who is your father?

92
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Stop pretending!

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,920
Help! Murder!

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,600
Shut up!

95
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,640
You just came back.

96
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
my father died.

97
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,960
Who else could it be?

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Who is your father?

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
I don't know him.

100
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
Okay.

101
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,760
Now,

102
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
to bury you with my father.

103
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,640
Oh, no. Are we really going to die here?

104
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,640
Jiang Ruoli, are you okay?

105
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
I can walk by myself.

106
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,720
Li,

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Can't I kill him?

108
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Of course not.

109
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,040
You and Jun Wu Ye went to Taohua Town.

110
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,280
to Taohua Town?

111
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,159
That's...

112
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,480
I was out of my mind.

113
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,680
I went to Taohua Town

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,480
because I'm going to look for the cure.

115
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,600
It's not that I don't want to take you.

116
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,600
No, it's too late.

117
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,000
We don't have much time.

118
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,000
But Li,

119
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,920
it's a bit serious

120
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,159
is a bit serious.

121
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,200
Why can’t you handle the son of the Second Elder?

122
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,760
Evil woman, die!

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,000
So that was the son of Second Elder.

124
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,760
Why did he kill me?

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,240
The Second Elder suddenly died.

126
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,680
They think it’s related to you.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
They want to seize power.

128
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,840
Miss.

129
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,160
Chief just said

130
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,840
to discuss something important.

131
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,760
Hurry up.

132
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Li.

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,400
I'll come back to see you

134
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
I'll come back to see you.

135
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,080
It's okay.

136
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,840
Go back to your work.

137
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,760
You don't have to come back.

138
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,080
Go.

139
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,000
What are you doing?

140
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,440
I feel much better after taking the antidote.

141
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,600
She even sutured my mother.

142
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,720
Mother.

143
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,440
Hey.

144
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,560
I want sugar-coated haws.

145
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,440
Okay, I want to eat sugar-coated haws.

146
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,200
I'll buy it for you.

147
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,920
Okay.

148
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,680
Sit here.

149
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,160
Mother.

150
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,720
When are you coming back?

151
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,400
I'll be back soon.

152
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,640
Wait for me here.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,560
Master.

154
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,600
Are you really not waiting for him?

155
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,680
No.

156
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,360
It's too dangerous for you

157
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
is too dangerous.

158
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,720
The Criminal Investigation Bureau

159
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
is not suitable for a large-scale operation.

160
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,440
If I go alone,

161
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,520
to go there alone.

162
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,080
Master.

163
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,360
How about I go with you?

164
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,000
No need.

165
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
You said you would take me to investigate the case at night

166
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,960
When did you decide

167
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,080
the order of the Criminal Investigation Bureau?

168
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,760
How could you get hurt in such a small case?

169
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,840
Who are you

170
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,040
to investigate the case with me?

171
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,480
Shut up!

172
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,800
Stay home and reflect on your mistakes.

173
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,920
When you deserve it,

174
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,040
take it back.

175
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,680
Mother.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,160
There you are.

177
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,920
Did you find that bug?

178
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
What is this?

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
Why is it in a human heart?

180
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,280
Have you heard of Moon Palace?

181
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,640
Moon Palace?

182
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,280
Lord Ming Peng.

183
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,480
Feng Ang.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,920
Long Zhang Changhao Lei.

185
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,720
Wei Yong Peng.
