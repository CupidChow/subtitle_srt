1
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,240
Help! Help!

2
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,000
He's here! He's here! He's here!

3
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,080
Where is he?

4
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,239
The fork road to Taohua Town is right ahead.

5
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,960
I went left in my previous life.

6
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,560
and met a wolf pack.

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,480
and almost died.

8
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Right.

9
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,440
Because of the lesson of my previous life

10
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,880
In this life, Wu Ye

11
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,160
I chose to go right.

12
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,960
But I didn't expect to go right.

13
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,960
Wait.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,640
There's a snake on the right. It's a snake. It's a snake. It's a snake.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
Snake!

16
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,759
Are you okay?

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,120
Wait.

18
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,200
Are you crazy?

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,759
It's a poisonous snake.

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,160
You need to suck it like this.

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,800
Snake venom will enter the body

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
through the mucosa.

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Does it hurt?

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,440
No.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,760
Hang in there.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,160
Let me squeeze the snake venom for you.

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,240
Hang in there.

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,440
This scheming witch

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,680
be so kind?

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,200
He must be up to something.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
I remember squeezing the snake poison

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
to squeeze from the nearer end to the wound.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,680
She's not like the witch

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,320
who slaughtered an innocent witch?

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,040
She looks like a naive girl.

36
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,160
There should be some herbs to detoxify the snake.

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Wait for me.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,000
She's really treating me.

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,840
Does she really want to save me?

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,960
All right, this should do it.

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,640
She could have killed me while I was poisoned.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,960
What are you looking at?

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
Nothing.

44
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,360
Thank you.

45
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,840
Oh no.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Your poison is detoxified.

47
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,280
I'm getting infected.

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,000
Eat up.

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Let's go. It's getting late.

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,200
He must have suffered a lot

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
to investigate the truth.

52
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,520
I have to help him.

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,040
As long as you follow the glowflies in the night,

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,880
we can reach Taohua Town.

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,920
Fireflies?

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,160
Yes, follow it.

57
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
Be careful. There's a big secret here.

58
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,360
Let's play it by ear.

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,400
In my previous life,

60
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
[I didn't pass the gate.]

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,280
I don't know where I was sent to.

62
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
This time I know

63
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,000
only newbies can enter Taohua Town.

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,159
I can only let you play this with me.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,640
It's okay.

66
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,800
The most important thing is to find out the truth of your mother.

67
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,400
There must be another test inside.

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,200
Be careful.

69
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,120
Don't worry.

70
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm prepared.

71
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,000
You have.

72
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Brides,

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
please stay.

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,560
Life is meaningless.

75
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,240
Why bother to die?

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Life is different from Qin.

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,360
We are willing to die together.

78
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,480
Life is different from Qin.

79
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,640
We are willing to die together.

80
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,640
Those who love each other will be together.

81
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,560
Brides, please.

82
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,440
Why is it still so fragile this time?

83
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,960
The Fluffy Fireflies will spread the blinding incense.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,440
If you're barren,

85
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,200
you can only see barren.

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
They must kiss.

87
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,080
and have a peace of mind.

88
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,360
Clear my eyes.

89
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
Are you shy?

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,920
Okay, I won't look.

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,280
Kiss.

92
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,480
We have to break in.

93
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,240
You don't want to save your mother?

94
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,880
Fine.

95
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I can see it.

96
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
I can see it too.

97
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,400
She can easily change my mind.

98
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
He can see now.

99
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,720
Does it mean...

100
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,240
Forget it.

101
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,800
I think I'm overthinking.

102
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,400
It's not easy to change someone's heart.

103
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,560
Thank you

104
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,600
Thank you.

105
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,520
The people in front

106
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,760
to continue their unfinished relationship.

107
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,160
After they get married,

108
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,560
they will go to the forest.

109
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,000
I remember your mother is there too.

110
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,640
What is this place?

111
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
Why is it so deserted?

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
I saw Li come in.

113
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,039
Why did he disappear in a blink of an eye?

114
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,360
Newbies here

115
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
were lovers

116
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,760
but not meant to be together.

117
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,200
You made a wish to be with me forever.

118
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,880
It's not easy

119
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,960
to get together at this moment.

120
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,080
But to get married,

121
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,880
you have to pass the test of the tree of marriage.

122
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,360
Please.

123
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
Congratulations.

124
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Bow to each other.

125
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,640
Hey.

126
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,800
I've prepared glowing powder.

127
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,040
Sprinkle the powder on the tree later.

128
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,200
the tree will light up.

129
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Look.

130
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,160
What should we do now?

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,800
Guys.

132
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,880
Whatever.

133
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,160
Let's go.

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,000
Hello.

135
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
What's wrong with them?

136
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
Why didn't the tree light up?

137
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,080
Are they not in love?

138
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,680
They are definitely not true love.

139
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,280
Ming Peng.

140
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,480
Feng Ang.

141
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,760
Zhang Changhao Lei.

142
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,200
Yong Peng.

143
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,720
Wai Yong Peng.
