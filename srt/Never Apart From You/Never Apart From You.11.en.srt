1
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,120
Go back to the bureau

2
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
I'll go back to my night

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,040
We will never meet again.

4
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Li.

5
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,400
Li.

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,200
What's wrong?

7
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Are you unhappy?

8
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,400
I went to the cakes shop here

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
to buy you some cloud cakes.

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,680
It's for you to eat on the way.

11
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:23,920
Thank you.

12
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,600
Give it to me.

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,160
Let's go.

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,280
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

15
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,640
Goodbye, Jiang Ruoli.

16
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,080
I didn't expect that I wanted to harm you.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,560
I was too careless.

18
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,560
I didn't realize it.

19
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,479
Not only you,

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm with her every day.

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,360
I didn't see it.

22
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,040
By the way, Li,

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,200
how do you deal with the people of the Criminal Investigation Bureau?

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,960
Didn't you hate them the most?

25
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,720
Li.

26
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,520
Recently,

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,840
you're hiding more and more from me.

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,520
Unlike before,

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,000
you were eager to share everything with me.

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,920
But I know

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
You have your reasons.

32
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,720
That's why I won't ask you anymore.

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,680
You can tell me when you want to.

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Thank you.

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,640
What's wrong, Li?

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,520
Is it not good?

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,760
I specially found it.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,160
It is said that the ingredients are very good.

39
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,840
No, it's delicious.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,800
That's good.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This time,

42
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
she should be mad at me.

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
But she and Mo Huaiyou grew up together.

44
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,480
Who am I?

45
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,240
That's right.

46
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,840
They are childhood sweethearts.

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
A match made in heaven.

48
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,480
Who do you think you are?

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
What are you doing here?

50
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,280
Go back to the Criminal Investigation Bureau

51
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,120
When it comes to love,

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,480
sometimes,

53
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,320
you have to be impulsive.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,840
Men

55
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,120
sometimes he's too prideful.

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,960
But in the end,

57
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,040
you'll find that

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,280
That's nothing.

59
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,840
Not yet.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,760
Be strong in front of others

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,440
Tears behind you

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,360
To be honest,

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,079
there are at least three pairs in the Criminal Investigation Bureau

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,560
and three couples

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,040
are all set up by me.

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,760
So in my opinion,

67
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,280
Senior.

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,640
Love.

69
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,440
I have an urgent leave.

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,440
If you find anything,

71
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,800
you send a letter to me by pigeon.

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,720
Another one.

73
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,880
Li.

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,880
Li.

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,040
I brought your favorite cloud cakes.

76
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,200
Come out and have some.

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,880
The invincible east.

78
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,720
Guardian Mo,

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,440
You failed to protect Saintess.

80
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
How dare you come back?

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,320
I'll kill you!

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Guardian Mo.

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm not a night guard.

84
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,240
I'm just a personal guard of the Saint Girl.

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,720
I only listen to you.

86
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,320
I'll teach you a lesson for Li.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,080
You?

88
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,000
You want to die?

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,640
Stop!

90
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,840
Li, go back first.

91
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,040
Li.

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,720
Go back first.

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,120
Li,

94
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,840
Haven't you found out the truth?

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,120
Why did you come back?

96
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
The truth is not as simple as we thought.

97
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,440
My mother was ordered to investigate

98
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,200
because the bureau

99
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,240
knew that

100
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,840
in the night.

101
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,440
So this matter

102
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,080
is not just a guard

103
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,800
as a guard.

104
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,440
If you are so honest,

105
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Aren’t you afraid

106
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,320
I colluded with Miaoyou.

107
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,240
Why are you standing there?

108
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,400
Do you want my treat?

109
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,240
What's wrong?

110
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,200
It hurts.

111
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
He hit my tendon just now.

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,920
I can't lift my hand.

113
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,200
So nosy.

114
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,200
It's okay. I can massage it myself.

115
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
Take it off.

116
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,920
If you don't,

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,120
if you don't take it off?

118
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Looks like she still cares about me.

119
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,160
Ouch!

120
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,440
It hurts!

121
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,560
It hurts.

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,400
Are you done?

123
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,200
Yes.

124
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,920
Can you move your hands?

125
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,200
Yes.

126
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,400
I want to eat sunflower seeds now.

127
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,320
Peel it for me.

128
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,640
You lied to me with this for so long.

129
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,760
If you still want to

130
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,159
stay here to investigate the case,

131
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,960
from now on,

132
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,200
are mine.

133
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,280
my personal servant.

134
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,280
Jiang Ruoli,

135
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,200
No.

136
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,200
Goodbye.

137
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,200
Saintess.

138
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
You can go to bed now.

139
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,960
Go.

140
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
My Lord.

141
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,080
I'm impressed.

142
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,320
What?

143
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,040
You're willing to lower your voice

144
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,640
you're willing to lower your voice.

145
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
You're a master.

146
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
I stay here to investigate the case day and night.

147
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,440
I can investigate wherever I want.

148
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,840
I did this

149
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,840
is for...

150
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,840
to

151
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,320
to be with you.

152
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
That's what I miss.

153
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
Actually,

154
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,600
I don't blame her.

155
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,840
I must have done not enough

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,280
that made her misunderstand.

157
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,480
You carefully prepared this table.

158
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,360
I prepared them for you

159
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,640
for you.

160
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
He finally got it.

161
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,080
Are you sure? I made this based on my preference.

162
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,480
I didn't expect she likes spicy food.

163
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,880
Everyone in the gang knows

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,200
Saintess doesn't like spicy food.

165
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,040
If you don't believe me,

166
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
you can ask her yourself.

167
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,480
Li,

168
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,760
In the past,

169
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
I thought you liked light food too.

170
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,400
I didn't know until now

171
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
that

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
you've been taking care of my preferences.

173
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,600
He worked so hard to cook this table.

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,240
If I just say no,

175
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,920
if I say no?

176
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,520
Why? You don't like it?

177
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,040
No.

178
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,360
Of course I like it.

179
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,640
Actually

180
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,280
A letter from the Criminal Investigation Bureau

181
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,040
Stop torturing me.

182
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,680
I promise you to investigate the case

183
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
The Criminal Investigation Bureau wrote that

184
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,040
The white ink dye is a Miao dye

185
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,720
Wangyue Palace

186
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,640
It's actually Miaoyou who sneaked into the Central Plain.

187
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,640
We haven't found anything else.

188
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
So,

189
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,400
the person who ordered Hongye to contact Wangyue Palace

190
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,000
is most likely

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,400
is the one who colluded with Miaoyou overnight.

192
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,760
It seems that

193
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,600
we need to start with the people around Hongye.

194
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,320
I'll go to Mo Huaiyou

195
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,400
with Mo Huaiyou later.

196
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,520
Is it between men

197
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,000
or a fight between men?

198
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,600
Let me do it.

199
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,880
Come on.

200
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,480
Hello. Hello.
