1
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,480
When your mother is settled,

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,080
you must come back and meet me.

3
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,360
Let's go to Wangyue Palace together.

4
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,360
It's nothing. It's just a minor injury.

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,600
I'll recover in a few days.

6
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,840
The antidote in your arms

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,800
Actually...

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,039
after you eat this,

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,280
the poison will be detoxified.

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,960
As you wish.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
After I leave,

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Take care.

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,560
You too.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,240
Here's your lunch box.

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Eat on the way.

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,040
Cold.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,800
You mean...

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,240
Ling...

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,200
Master's death may be related to Wangyue Palace.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
I plan to keep investigating along Wangyue Palace.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
Master said

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,800
this case is dangerous.

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,280
If something happens to her,

24
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,640
she won't let you take over.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,640
Besides, you've been investigating the case without permission

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,400
you've violated my master's order.

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,160
and not disobeying my master.

28
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,200
and act like a son.

29
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,079
Senior, you know

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
No one can stop

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,760
can stop me.

32
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,640
Forget it.

33
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
I know a little about Wangyue Palace.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,640
The evil here

35
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,160
is far better than the night.

36
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800
They are good at using Gu.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,200
Its poison is extremely evil.

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,640
There is no cure in this world.

39
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,200
You will die if you go alone

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
I'll report to Governor Zhao

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,840
Gather the entire Criminal Investigation Bureau

42
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,600
to investigate Wangyue Palace.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
Senior.

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,240
I will also tell them

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,440
to make preparations for seven days.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,400
If you have anyone

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,560
if there's anyone you want to see,

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,240
if you want to meet someone.

49
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Someone you want to see.

50
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,240
Who misses me?

51
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
I don't think so.

52
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,200
But you've been afraid of cold these days.

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,200
Is it because of the wound?

54
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Miss, what's wrong with this wound?

55
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
I was just playing with the cat in the backyard.

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,000
and got caught.

57
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,080
How big is this cat?

58
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,720
It's okay. It's just a small wound.

59
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
as long as it's not infected.

60
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,600
But Hongye,

61
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,720
you're getting more and more skilled with dressing.

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,040
You taught me well.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,440
When did you learn

64
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,080
when did you learn it?

65
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
That Invincible Oriental.

66
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,159
I see.

67
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,680
If you have time,

68
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,360
can you teach me?

69
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I want to learn too.

70
00:04:59,159 --> 00:04:59,880
Sure.

71
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,440
Jun.

72
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,960
Li.

73
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
Huaiyou.

74
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,440
Li,

75
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,040
Do you remember what day it is today?

76
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
Don't tell me you forgot.

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,480
How could it be?

78
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,280
Today is

79
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,040
my birthday.

80
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,000
Your birthday?

81
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Of course I know.

82
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Both of them are impossible.

83
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,240
Today is

84
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,680
the day you worship night.

85
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,400
Look at this and you'll remember.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,760
Open it.

87
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,440
It's been 12 years.

88
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,880
You're still excited when you see this.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,200
You said you wanted this for a long time.

90
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,880
I asked someone to bake it for you.

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,360
I will never forget it.

92
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,120
12 years ago, I escaped from the tower of the Western Region.

93
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,760
I wandered on the streets of Midland.

94
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,240
and was humiliated.

95
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,040
It's you.

96
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
You saved me

97
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,560
they saved me.

98
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,680
You said

99
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,320
If you feel scared,

100
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,880
Just bite it.

101
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,159
He's also a poor man.

102
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,960
Back to that street,

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,640
and kill all those

104
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,360
who bullied me.

105
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,880
Li,

106
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,040
Do you remember what you told me

107
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,760
after killing the last person?

108
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,840
You said Huaiyou.

109
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,600
Why are so few people bullying you?

110
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,400
I haven't had enough fun yet.

111
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,240
Since then,

112
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
I've been very grateful to you.

113
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,240
I thought you protected me when I was young.

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,040
I'll protect you when I grow up.

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,400
Li, why don't you eat?

116
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,680
I just had dinner.

117
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,360
I'll keep this as supper.

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,640
I'll enjoy it alone later.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,640
Okay.

120
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,960
By the way, Li,

121
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
Well...

122
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,040
Invincible East!

123
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,600
Where did he go?

124
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,880
He said his master had something to do.

125
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,280
He asked me to give him a few days off.

126
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,440
I think he should be back by now.

127
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

128
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,360
You've really changed.

129
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,920
I... I haven't changed.

130
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
A little guard is on leave.

131
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,800
and you agreed?

132
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,160
Shouldn't it be a harsh punishment

133
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,480
and make him suffer?

134
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,880
How did you end up like this, Li?

135
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
I've fallen.

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
The invincible East

137
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,200
is different from us.

138
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't be influenced by him.

139
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,840
What's wrong?

140
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,960
I can give anyone a holiday.

141
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,240
I can punish whoever I want.

142
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,200
What are you doing? You mean...

143
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,360
I will be affected by a mere guard?

144
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,280
Is that possible?

145
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Do you want to die?

146
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
You're just a guard.

147
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,080
Fine.

148
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,520
This is the Li in my heart.

149
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
Cheers.

150
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,840
Cheers.

151
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,120
Li.

152
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
Don't leave this time.

153
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,920
Hongye! Hongye!

154
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,720
Miss.

155
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,200
The wine is getting cold.

156
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,840
Heat a new bottle.

157
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
Yes.

158
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,480
I do care about him.

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,400
I deserve to die.

160
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,040
Hongye, why are you so careless?

161
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,760
Hurry up. Take Guardian Mo to change.

162
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,480
Yes.

163
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,880
Li, no need.

164
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,560
Guardian Mo.

165
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,960
Let me help you get changed.

166
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,880
Li,

167
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,960
You won't leave without saying goodbye this time, will you?

168
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
Of course not.

169
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,760
I came back to see her.

170
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,120
Okay, wait for me.

171
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,400
Is the emperor without Ye?

172
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,440
The emperor has no Ye.

173
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,760
You're back so soon.

174
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,560
Why aren't you coming in?

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm just a guard.

176
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,240
I dare not disturb you and your childhood sweetheart.

177
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,400
What are you talking about?

178
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,560
Come in.

179
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,200
No need. Take care.

180
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
and hold hands with your hand.

181
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,040
and drink hot wine.

182
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,640
The emperor has no Ye.

183
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
Li.

184
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,360
Li.

185
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,560
Peng Jun.

186
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,440
Changhao Lei.

187
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,880
Wai Yong Peng.

188
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:43,800
Society.
