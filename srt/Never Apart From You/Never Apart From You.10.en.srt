1
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,880
Look at my handsome face.

2
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,200
is ready.

3
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,880
Don't sleep tonight.

4
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,360
People will come to save you at night.

5
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,800
How did they know?

6
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,720
You set this up.

7
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,120
You think I have an accomplice?

8
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,320
You need to catch the person who saved me.

9
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,400
I want to catch the person I should catch.

10
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,600
Don't be afraid then.

11
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,600
Li, run!

12
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,880
At this point,

13
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Surrender now!

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
It's dangerous. Let's go.

15
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Miss.

16
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,960
Hongye.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,680
Run!

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Run!

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,920
Hongye.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,560
Leave me alone. You go first.

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,440
No.

22
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,880
I can't leave you behind.

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,079
Hongye, listen to me.

24
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,880
This is a trap set by the bureau.

25
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,040
They used you as bait

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,200
Listen to me. Leave me alone.

27
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,079
Run!

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,079
Oh no! The culprit ran away!

29
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,880
Search!

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,760
Hongye.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,079
Do you see it?

33
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,960
Who is the one who deserves to die?

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,160
Hongye, you...

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,640
Why?

36
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Hongye.

37
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,920
She's under my jurisdiction now.

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,400
I don't care about you

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,360
I kill my servant in the middle of the night.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,960
It's none of your business.

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,840
Mo Huaiyou, leave.

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,480
Li,

43
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,280
I order you as the late Saint Girl.

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,880
Back off.

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,920
What's going on?

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,520
Actually, I knew

47
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,920
you're not the murderer.

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
Because in the last life,

49
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,760
when I fought Jiang Ruoli,

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,680
I saw a birthmark on her neck.

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,600
It's a red leaf.

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,560
I verified it in the mountainous valley.

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,880
You don't have this birthmark.

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,640
Go to Taohua Town and ask the matchmaker.

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,600
I heard it.

56
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,600
If you can ask that question,

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,960
it means you didn't know.

58
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,880
In that case,

59
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,040
there's only one possibility.

60
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,680
Someone is pretending to be you.

61
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,079
He must be the closest person to you.

62
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,160
He knows all your habits.

63
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,440
This matter can't be investigated thoroughly.

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,880
If the murderer wants to protect himself,

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,560
he would kill the insider first.

66
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,880
and have no evidence.

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,200
So you've been

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,040
for the past few days, right?

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,480
Do you know how scared I was?

70
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,600
I don't want to do that either.

71
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,040
I'm sorry. I won't lie to you anymore.

72
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,240
Do you think I can still trust you?

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,320
Wu Ye.

74
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,960
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

75
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,480
That's right.

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I was the one who went to Wangyue Palace to learn sorcery.

77
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,800
I killed Luo Qiuhan.

78
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,880
I was also the one who hid her body in Taohua Town.

79
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,640
You killed me with my mother's body.

80
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,320
Did you do it too?

81
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,120
What do you think?

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
Hongye.

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,120
Why did you do that?

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,800
Are you shocked?

85
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,080
You're right.

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,800
You are a high-ranking saintess.

87
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,880
Why would you pay attention to my mindset?

88
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,080
You have no idea

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,560
I hate you so much.

90
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,520
Huaihuai.

91
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,000
Li.

92
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,159
Wait for me!

93
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,280
Li!

94
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,360
Guardian Mo. Li.

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,760
Didn't you say you wanted to eat this for a long time?

96
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,240
I baked it for you.

97
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,040
Hongye.

98
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,240
Guardian Mo, you want to see me?

99
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,640
Ah Li has changed a lot recently.

100
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,080
Do you know what happened?

101
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,800
I imitate you day after day.

102
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,680
and remember every detail of you.

103
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,680
so that one day

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,520
to replace you one day.

105
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
I didn't expect

106
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,920
you changed a lot

107
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
you changed a lot.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,760
I became a gentle sheep.

109
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,760
I thought I could get rid of you easily.

110
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
It's okay. It's just a small wound.

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,240
It'll be fine as long as it's not infected for a few days.

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,680
I didn't expect you to be so lucky.

113
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,240
Now my plan failed.

114
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,080
Winner takes all.

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,880
Do whatever you want.

116
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,480
You're quite ambitious.

117
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,320
But you didn't confess entirely.

118
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,040
You killed the criminal officer

119
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,720
and attempted to become the Saintess.

120
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,680
I'm afraid you want to rebel with Miaoyou privately.

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,280
I don't understand what you're talking about.

122
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,880
You're tough.

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,640
He used all his tricks

124
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,960
Not a word.

125
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,600
Take her and Bai Mo Ran

126
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,960
to the Criminal Investigation Bureau.

127
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,640
There are plenty of ways in the prison.

128
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,680
I don't believe she won't confess.

129
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,520
Jiang Ruoli and Miao Song

130
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,040
Even if it's not related,

131
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,120
she's still the Saintess of the Demon Sect.

132
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,240
She has done many evil things.

133
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,680
It's better to keep a distance from her.

134
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
Jiang Ruo Li is not a villain.

135
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,960
There are many misunderstandings about her.

136
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,280
But we've been through thick and thin together

137
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,480
for so long.

138
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,120
I know better than anyone

139
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,680
she is actually a kind-hearted girl.

140
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,320
If you have the chance to contact her,

141
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,159
he will change his mind.

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,840
I'm afraid there's no one

143
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,880
who treats me like her.

144
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,360
Oh.

145
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,280
Are you tempted?

146
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,960
Li.

147
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Why are you looking at me?

148
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,960
Go coax him.

149
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,080
Li.

150
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,120
Li!

151
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,800
Li.

152
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,720
Where are you going?

153
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,640
What does it have to do with you?

154
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,320
What's wrong?

155
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,480
You're not talking?

156
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,960
Have you ever thought

157
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,560
you didn't discuss anything with me

158
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
and treated me like a pawn.

159
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,440
How did I feel?

160
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,080
I didn't take you as a pawn.

161
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,880
I asked the Criminal Investigation Bureau

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,640
to clear your name.

163
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,760
But if I tell you,

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,960
if I tell you,

165
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,080
the plan won't be executed.

166
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,880
So you lied to me and used me

167
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,080
to help you act?

168
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,679
No.

169
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,640
All right, the Emperor has no Ye.

170
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,240
The show is over.

171
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,040
I found the real culprit you're looking for.

172
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
From now on,

173
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
we have nothing to do with each other.

174
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,320
Go back to your bureau

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,520
I'll go back to my night

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,280
We'll never meet again.

177
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,560
Ming Peng.

178
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,400
Feng Lang.

179
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,760
Feng Ang is stable.

180
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,960
Mansion.

181
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,200
Wai Yong Peng.
