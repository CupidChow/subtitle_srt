1
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Moon Palace?

2
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,080
I know a little about it.

3
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
The evil here is far better than the night.

4
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,400
They use Gu.

5
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,680
Its poison is extremely evil.

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,960
There is no cure in the world.

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,680
You will die if you go alone.

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,920
Li.

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,960
Why do you call me Li?

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,560
Am I really dying?

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,520
Don't talk nonsense.

12
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,960
You'll be fine.

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,280
You may not believe me.

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,680
I'm not from this world.

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,200
I came here

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,600
to help you find out the truth of your mother's death.

17
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,400
Now it seems that I can't help you.

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,960
I’ll go to Wangyue Palace to find the antidote for you.

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,759
You want to go to Wangyue Palace alone?

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Are you crazy?

21
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,560
No!

22
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,520
It's too dangerous if no one helps you.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,680
I won't let you die no matter what.

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,440
It's very quiet here.

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,680
It's weird.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,600
The security is too tight.

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,000
If we break in like this,

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,600
we might alert them.

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,440
I can't let him risk his life.

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm better now.

31
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,520
It's not that cold.

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Really?

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,960
Why don't we come back tonight?

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,160
The security is so tight now.

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,880
It'll be bad if we get caught.

36
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,160
But you... Don't worry.

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,840
I can hold on for another day or two at most.

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,720
It doesn't matter.

39
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,200
Li,

40
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,360
Hand over the antidote.

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,840
Those who break into Wangyue Palace

42
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,040
will be killed.

43
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,160
Wait.

44
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,360
Li.

45
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm Jiang Ruoli, the Saintess of Night.

46
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,880
Let's see who dares to fight.

47
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
The Leader of Wangyue Palace, Bai Mo dye.

48
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,480
Greetings, Saintess.

49
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,440
Since you know my name,

50
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,960
you must have heard of my tricks.

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,280
We came here just to remove the Gu poison.

52
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,800
We don’t intend to start a dispute.

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
Please give me the antidote

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,040
and let us go.

55
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
Saintess, it's not that I don't want you to leave.

56
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,120
The problem is

57
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,800
this poison can’t be detoxified.

58
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,000
Li.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,560
Saintess.

60
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,000
I just want to check the situation.

61
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,360
Don't worry.

62
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,080
The Moon Palace doesn't dare to provoke the night.

63
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,680
You can’t delay the poison.

64
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,080
This medicine can only delay the poison

65
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,600
and keep her alive for seven days.

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
If she wants to be cured,

67
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,080
how?

68
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
we still need the Ice Silkworm Gu.

69
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,280
to fight poison with poison.

70
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,680
Frost Silkworm Gu.

71
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,159
I have it in Wangyue Palace.

72
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,600
But this little guy

73
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,400
needs the flesh and blood of a living person.

74
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,560
in seven days.

75
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,159
Within seven days,

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
the host needs to soak in ice water

77
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,960
and bear the pain of sucking bones and marrow.

78
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,200
If a weak person can't bear it,

79
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
it's not a big deal to die.

80
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,200
we won't be able to raise the ice silkworm.

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,880
In my palace,

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,160
you are the best host.

83
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,160
Master.

84
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
The new pupa is here.

85
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,800
Give him five more taels.

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,080
Buy tea.

87
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,880
What is the pupa?

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,080
We need to make the Snow Phantom.

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,840
Just kill him.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why did you buy it?

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,400
It's just a crooked way.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,960
not evil.

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,760
The Moon Palace

94
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,520
is different from the night you killed innocent people.

95
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,560
Could it be that the murderer who killed my mother

96
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,880
not Wangyue Palace?

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,160
Saintess doesn't have much time.

98
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,840
Would you like to be the host?

99
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,600
as soon as possible.

100
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
The pain of these seven days

101
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,159
for the past seven days.

102
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,400
Let me ask you one last time.

103
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,400
Are you sure you want to be the host?

104
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,080
So loyal.

105
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,160
When the Ice Silkworm wakes up,

106
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,880
will crawl into your body

107
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,680
and walk along your meridians.

108
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,680
suck blood, eat marrow,

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
and kill each other.

110
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,960
In this pill,

111
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,280
tens of thousands of icy silkworms.

112
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,560
They will grow and fight in your body.

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,200
There's only one left.

114
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,560
This is called cultivating Gu.

115
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,080
Why are you here?

116
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,880
Did something happen to Li?

117
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,560
There are only two alive Ice Silkworm Gu.

118
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,680
From today on,

119
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,960
you don't have to be immersed in ice and snow anymore.

120
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,320
How is Ah Li?

121
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,440
She woke up.

122
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,320
The first thing she woke up

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,040
to see you.

124
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
I'll go find her now.

125
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,480
But look at you.

126
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
Saintess.

127
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,200
I advise you to rest in bed.

128
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,600
Why won't you let me see him?

129
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,800
What did you do to him?

130
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,760
The emperor has no Ye, the emperor has no Ye.

131
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,080
Li.

132
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,800
Emperor Wu Ye.

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,800
Did they do anything to you?

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,640
No.

135
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
I heard that he wanted to save me.

136
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,480
to raise the Ice Silkworm Gu.

137
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,560
You can't...

138
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,760
Of course not.

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
Look at me.

140
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,600
Do I look like a person who keeps Gu?

141
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,520
The so-called Ice Silkworm Gu

142
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,040
is not kept by living people.

143
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,240
It's actually a few top herbs.

144
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,880
Put them together.

145
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
so that it can be detoxified.

146
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,960
Right, Master Bai?

147
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,640
The most important medicine

148
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,600
It's called Wan-in.

149
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
not a living person.

150
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,360
You must have heard it wrong.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,800
That's good.

152
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,240
What's wrong?

153
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Nothing.

154
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,280
I saw you frowning just now.

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,560
Are you uncomfortable?

156
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,640
No.

157
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,680
Li. Li.

158
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
Saintess is fine.

159
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
She's just weak.

160
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,880
and fainted.

161
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,080
Qianxiao.

162
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,480
Peng, Jun.

163
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,480
Tong Ming.

164
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,400
Feng.

165
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,160
Feng Ang is stable.

166
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,120
Tong Chang Hao Lei.

167
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,200
Wai Yong Peng.
