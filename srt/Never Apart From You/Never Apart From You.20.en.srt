1
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,560
He's here. He's here.

2
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:09,840
He's here. He's here.

3
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,280
Are you looking for me?

4
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,080
You prayed all night in the hall.

5
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,680
Li, I thought about it all night.

6
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,200
The Chief is not here.

7
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,360
I can’t live without a master.

8
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,600
Li,

9
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,479
Let's get married.

10
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,200
You promised me.

11
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
What a pair.

12
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,000
Li,

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
You have no idea

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,880
how long I've been waiting for this day.

15
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,000
The auspicious time has come.

16
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,880
The wedding ceremony starts now.

17
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,000
Congratulations, Guardian Mo.

18
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,160
Congratulations, Saintess.

19
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,080
While you were away,

20
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,360
countless nights,

21
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,720
When I think that you will leave me,

22
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm sweating.

23
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
It feels like

24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,160
falling into a dark abyss.

25
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,840
For the past 12 years, I've never been in so much pain.

26
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,079
Please forgive me for asking for a marriage.

27
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,680
Fortunately, this day came.

28
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,160
Fortunately, you are by my side.

29
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
Guardian Saintess.

30
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,240
Bow to heaven and earth.

31
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,760
Li.

32
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,480
Huaiyou.

33
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,920
Actually...

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,560
Don't say anything, Li.

35
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,880
Let's worship the heaven and earth first.

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,520
Okay?

37
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,280
Bow to each other.

38
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,960
Wait.

39
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,800
The emperor has no Ye.

40
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Li.

41
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
You lied to me again.

42
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,280
The emperor has no Ye.

43
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,320
How dare you come here?

44
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Kill him!

45
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,560
Wait.

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
Don't worry.

47
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,159
Let's stop here.

48
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,200
Li.

49
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,640
I know you killed Chief.

50
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,159
You did all this.

51
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,520
right?

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,760
Why?

54
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,159
Li.

55
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:47,680
I...

56
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,520
Chief.

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,680
It’s really Chief.

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
It's really the Chief.

59
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,000
How is that possible?

60
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
Guardian Mo.

61
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,360
Explain it.

62
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,840
The Criminal Investigation Bureau

63
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,960
has never caught Chief Zhong.

64
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,960
and no one pretended to be Chief.

65
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,440
I said that

66
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,400
to make you worry.

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
to ask for directions.

68
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,640
That day, you pretended to go to the hall

69
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,240
to pray for the Chief.

70
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,040
In fact,

71
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,000
is to verify the body.

72
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
The totem you worship

73
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,480
is actually Chief’s coffin.

74
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,360
Mo Huaiyou did all this.

75
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,720
Boring.

76
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,480
Take it easy.

77
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,800
Save some for me.

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,800
The drawing of Wangyue Palace.

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,560
Guardian Mo.

80
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,440
What's the matter?

81
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,360
Who died?

82
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,120
But...

83
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
we've seen the divine edict.

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,080
That's God's Sage.

85
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,960
It's a miracle.

86
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,640
Right?

87
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,480
Yes.

88
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,240
Yes.

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,640
This flower is from the Western Region.

90
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
It's called the Nether Flower.

91
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,280
As long as its pollen is on your eyes,

92
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,680
it will affect the brain.

93
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,160
and hallucinate.

94
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,280
And this kind of illusion

95
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,640
listen to others.

96
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,920
How dare you slander me with just a flower?

97
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,080
It looks like a ghost flower.

98
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,560
Yes, it is.

99
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Thirty years ago,

100
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,320
I saw this thing

101
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,240
I saw this.

102
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,240
You pretended to pray for Chief Zhong.

103
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,120
to build a totem

104
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,360
to

105
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
in secret with Miao Song.

106
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
The Chief discovered your plot.

107
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,040
You killed him in a hurry.

108
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,800
But the injury on Chief’s body is too obvious.

109
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,480
It must be you.

110
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,120
You sealed his body

111
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
under the secret bed of this coffin.

112
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,000
You made my father disappear

113
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
and made a divine decree.

114
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,480
This nonsense framed Lord Wu Ye.

115
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,960
and spread the poison of Snow Phantom to Wangyue Palace.

116
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,640
and asked Hongye to disguise me

117
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,200
to help you

118
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,440
to eliminate your dissidents in the sect.

119
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,760
You even killed the Criminal Officer.

120
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,720
Luo Qiuhan.

121
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,200
You want me to practice Gu in Wangyue Palace?

122
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
I have to be with Li all the time.

123
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,600
I don't trust other Midlanders.

124
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,760
We both came from the Western Region.

125
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,560
It's best for you to practice Gu.

126
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm willing to do anything for you.

127
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,280
Master.

128
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
I do.

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,360
Arrest Jun Wu Ye.

130
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,520
Tell him not to spread false rumors here.

131
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,000
What are you waiting for?

132
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,120
The emperor has no Ye.

133
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,080
You're alone.

134
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,920
Do you really think

135
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,400
You're not allowed to act wildly

136
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,520
The Criminal Investigation Bureau is gathering at the foot of the mountain

137
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,320
They want to arrest

138
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,360
and Mo Huaiyou.

139
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,360
colluding with Miao Heng is a capital crime.

140
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,000
None of your business, stay out of it.

141
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
Or you'll be considered an accomplice.

142
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,360
The emperor has no Ye.

143
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
What you just said

144
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
is just your speculation.

145
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
Do you have any evidence?

146
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,040
Evidence?

147
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,960
Just check the cause of Chief’s death.

148
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Mo Huaiyou.

149
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,160
Do you dare to do an autopsy?

150
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,840
Sure.

151
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,000
Lord Ming Peng.

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,200
Gen Mingpeng.

153
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:15,840
Feng.

154
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,200
Feng, Ang, steady.

155
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,440
Wai Yong Peng.

156
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:27,680
Wai Yong.

157
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,040
Society.
