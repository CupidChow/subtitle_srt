1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,240
The world will be in chaos

2
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,080
The Imperial Court ordered the Criminal Investigation Bureau to take charge of civil affairs

3
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,560
But the top gang in Jianghu colluded with foreign enemies at night

4
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,040
and ambitious.

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,800
Criminal Officer Luo Qiuhan

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,400
was ordered to investigate the collaboration with foreign enemies

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,960
but was murdered.

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,600
His son, Wu Ye, took office in danger.

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,560
and tracked down the murderer.

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,240
I finally found the fairy of the night.

11
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,440
[Jun Wuye looked into his chest unbelievable.]

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,039
I can't hold on.

13
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:33,200
Fall on the ground.

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,680
Jiang Ruoli looks like a winner.

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
Squat down.

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
pour wine on Wu Ye's body.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,160
Looking at the eyes that Jun Wu Ye was unwilling to die,

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,160
Someone fainted.

19
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,960
Anyone from the medical school?

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,759
What happened?

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,600
I majored in forensic.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,600
What's wrong?

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,280
What happened?

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,400
What's going on Excuse me

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,200
He was fine just now.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,160
Why did he faint?

27
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,360
Is he okay?

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,000
Is he okay? Why isn't he moving?

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,800
Should we call 120?

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,039
We have to find a professional.

31
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,320
Yes.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,520
He was fine just now.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,600
I think I saw electric sparks.

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,880
Why is she...

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,000
Stay away from her.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,760
What's going on?

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,680
That woman.

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,400
Take them to the hospital.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,040
I didn't notice.

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,800
What's that sound?

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,440
Where is this?

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,800
What a strange place.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,680
I was electrocuted when I saved someone.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
And this dress.

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,079
What's going on?

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,000
This place is...

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,640
The sun and the moon are in the same light.

48
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,440
The sun and moon are symbolized day and night.

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,960
The saintess Jiang Ruo Li was in red.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,160
cold and bloodthirsty.

51
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,400
He danced so well.

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,040
What's going on?

53
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm in this novel.

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,680
Saintess.

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,720
Flaming Whip.

56
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,880
Darn it.

57
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,120
I'm really Jiang Ruoli.

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Saintess, please spare my life.

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,520
You may leave.

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,240
Yes.

61
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,720
What day is it today?

62
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,960
The Lantern Festival.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,440
The Lantern Festival?

64
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,440
Did you find

65
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,240
at the corner today?

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,640
who was stripped off?

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,079
Yes.

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,040
According to the novel,

69
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,000
the King Wuye was completely black after his rebirth.

70
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,560
He gave up his duty as a criminal officer.

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,280
and sneaked in during the Lantern Festival.

72
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,600
to assassinate Jiang Ruoli.

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Evil woman, die!

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,600
Wait, you killed the wrong person.

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm not Jiang Ruo Li.

76
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,720
What's the life-saving trick

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
What are they?

78
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,880
It's too late.

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,560
I'm really from the modern time travel.

80
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,360
My name is Zhou Li.

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm not lying.

82
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,320
I majored in forensic.

83
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,240
I'm a good person.

84
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,960
You may leave now.

85
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,680
Yes.

86
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,800
The witch killed so many people.

87
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,880
How can we let them go?

88
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,360
Get up.

89
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,640
It's a misunderstanding.

90
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,200
It seems the Saintess is really possessed.

91
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,600
Not only nonsense,

92
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,280
but also lose face.

93
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,800
I know your secret.

94
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,240
You were born again.

95
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,560
How do you know?

96
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,400
You are the Emperor Wuye.

97
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,960
Your mother is a criminal officer.

98
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,080
I received a tip-off

99
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,600
that someone colluded with Miao Heng at night.

100
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,560
So she was ordered to investigate.

101
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,280
and ended up dead.

102
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,200
You were killed

103
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,400
to help your mother fulfill your mission.

104
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,280
Before you died,

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,800
That's why the heavens

106
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,159
and brought you back to your mother's mourning hall.

107
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,320
Am I right?

108
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,080
I don't care what sorcery you have.

109
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,159
Since you dare mention my mother and me,

110
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,240
why didn't you dare to mention it?

111
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,880
Both of us died because of you.

112
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,640
Because... Because I'm not the murderer.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,200
According to the novel,

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
the truth is far beyond our expectation.

115
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,760
If I help him find out the truth,

116
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,160
my fate will be changed.

117
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,280
I was also framed.

118
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,160
Then tell me

119
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
who killed my mother?

120
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,080
I don't know.

121
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,080
How dare you fool me!

122
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,440
Miss.

123
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
Miss.

124
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,880
Oh no.

125
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
Hide now.

126
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,120
Miss.

127
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,960
I don't know who the murderer is,

128
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,360
but I know

129
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,159
your mother's body is hidden in Taohua Town.

130
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,560
Really? I can help you find clues.

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,400
Trust me.

132
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
She can tell the truth.

133
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,360
Open your mouth.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,440
Don't worry.

135
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
I'll give you the antidote every day from now on.

136
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,000
Cover me.

137
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,880
Miss!

138
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,159
Are you okay?

139
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,680
Okay.

140
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,600
Sorry.

141
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,800
Miss.

142
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,120
I...

143
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,880
Have you seen enough?

144
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,680
I deserve to die.

145
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,840
Guardian Mo.

146
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,160
Don't worry.

147
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
[Jiang Ruo Li's childhood sweetheart, crazy loyal dogs.]

148
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,840
This time, it's over.

149
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,960
Guardian Mo, wait.

150
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,440
Hurry up.

151
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,840
Get up.

152
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,440
She...

153
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,680
Li.

154
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,400
Where did you come from?

155
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,159
You want to die?

156
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,159
Stop!

157
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,480
Stop! Stop! Stop!

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,080
Mo Huaiyou, calm down.

159
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,960
Listen to me.

160
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,560
Alright.

161
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Calm down.

162
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,280
Impulsion is a devil.

163
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
Let's make peace.

164
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,320
Peace comes first.

165
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,720
Who is this, Chief?

166
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,680
When did you get here?

167
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,120
Something is wrong with her today.

168
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,440
My dear daughter.

169
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,400
What's wrong with you today?

170
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,600
The lady is holding a whip.

171
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
It's not the hand of Yin.

172
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
And his temperament has changed drastically.

173
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,000
Those who practice the Ice Heart Chant

174
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,400
be careful of being as cold as ice.

175
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,679
Those guards are disturbing you.

176
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,559
Why did you let them go?

177
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,280
Because...

178
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,880
Because I was possessed.

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Are you alright, Li?

180
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm fine.

181
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,040
But it's not right.

182
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,160
You weren't like this last time.

183
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,560
You threatened her.

184
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,560
You behaved strangely just now.

185
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,000
to lure them here.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,400
Young man.

187
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,120
Don't be impulsive.

188
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,400
Let her go!

189
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,680
Don't hurt me!

190
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Let her go!

191
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,760
It's a misunderstanding.

192
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,880
It's all a misunderstanding.

193
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,880
This is...

194
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,480
He's my savior.

195
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,520
Saviour?

196
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,400
Yes.

197
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
I was out of my mind.

198
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,680
So?

199
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,800
I thought his power could save me.

200
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,000
So I called him over.

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,560
Huaiyou?

202
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
But why have I never heard you mention him?

203
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,480
Besides,

204
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,800
he wanted to kill you.

205
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
It's fate that we met down the mountain.

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,840
As your savior,

207
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,080
I've never seen much of the world.

208
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,600
So when you get excited, you do this.

209
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,640
Right?

210
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,520
Excuse me.

211
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
It's a misunderstanding.

212
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,440
Li, what happened?

213
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,360
What happened?

214
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,640
Stop asking. We need to send these people away.

215
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,680
Li.

216
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,840
Li!

217
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,560
Get out. She needs me to use my power to heal her.

218
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,920
Do you all want to kill her?

219
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,160
Leave now!

220
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,120
Yes.

221
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,680
Let me heal quickly.

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,240
Okay, let's go.

223
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
Rest. Let's go.

224
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,080
Huaiyou.

225
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,040
What are you doing?

226
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Guardian Mo, have some tea.

227
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,080
It's been four hours.

228
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
Why haven't you recovered yet?

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,240
Peng Jun.

230
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,120
Feng Ang.

231
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,920
Mansion.

232
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,560
Wai Yong Peng.
