1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,320
It's shining

2
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
It's shining

3
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,120
This scene...

4
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,840
The tree of marriage has blossomed.

5
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,800
This tree can still bloom?

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,039
I've never heard of it.

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
Could it be that they...

8
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,520
I heard that the tree of marriage blossomed a few decades ago.

9
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,920
We're so lucky.

10
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,160
to witness the tree of marriage blossom.

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,720
This tree

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,120
hasn't bloomed for decades.

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,759
I've bloomed flowers for you two today.

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,759
It proves that you are destined.

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,440
A love that is firmer than gold.

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,960
I guess this tree has bad eyesight.

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,560
But he helped us.

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
God of Matchmaking, I swear

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
I will never betray you.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,560
We'll be sworn brothers in this life.

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,280
in the next life.

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,160
This oath is too big.

23
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,840
Please bow to each other.

24
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,040
Look at the tree

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,320
this tree

26
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,480
bloomed for us.

27
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Yes.

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,480
I miss you so much.

29
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,600
Let's meet in the next life.

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,160
Why are you tied up?

31
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,520
We'll sleep at the same acupoint in this life.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,400
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

33
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,920
What is this place?

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,440
This place is weird.

35
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,800
Let's be careful.

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,120
Don't worry.

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
It's okay to follow me.

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
Please.

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,960
What's going on?

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,280
Why is it closed?

41
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,280
It's not that detailed in the novel.

42
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,120
There should be time when flowers bloom.

43
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,680
Get some rest.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll keep watch.

45
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,680
Jun Wu Ye, wake up.

46
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
The flowers are about to bloom.

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,440
Let's go. I'll take you to your mother.

48
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,760
Let's go.

49
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,840
I remember in the novel,

50
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,640
in the novel.

51
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,360
But next,

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,760
I don't know which direction it is.

53
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
To save time,

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
let's split up.

55
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,960
It's too dangerous to separate.

56
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,560
Let's move together.

57
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,800
Okay.

58
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
This way.

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,600
Jun Wu Ye, it should be here.

60
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,560
How could you get hurt in such a small case?

61
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,840
Who are you to investigate the case with me?

62
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,720
Mother.

63
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,040
Is it really you?

64
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,480
That's great.

65
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,760
Let's go.

66
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,280
We can't let anyone find us.

67
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,840
Who is making trouble here?

68
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,080
How dare you! Do it!

69
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,280
Jiang Ruoli!

70
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,840
Are you okay?

71
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
I'm the Deputy Commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau.

72
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,240
Who dares to do this?

73
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,200
What's your relationship with the people who exist here?

74
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,560
This is my mother, Luo Qiuhan.

75
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
The Criminal Officer

76
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
was murdered due to investigation.

77
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,840
We are from the Criminal Investigation Bureau

78
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,760
We found this place according to the clues.

79
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,160
How do you explain this?

80
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,040
Someone told me that this is her mother.

81
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,000
She waited for her lover for 20 years.

82
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,200
and died in depression.

83
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,080
I saw that she was deeply in love,

84
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
so I promised her

85
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,160
to place her mother in my Peach Blossom Town.

86
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,560
Do you know who she is?

87
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,800
I don't know.

88
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,560
The emperor has no Ye.

89
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,240
The Emperor has no Ye.

90
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,880
Jiang Ruoli!

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,080
No!

92
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,040
What?

93
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,560
The one who wanted me to keep the body.

94
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,560
Lord Wuye.

95
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,480
How did we escape?

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,600
They dare not stop me when I mention the bureau

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,160
Did you bring your mother out?

98
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,560
Have you found the body-hiding man?

99
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,240
No.

100
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,360
We can find clues from her body.

101
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
We'll find the real culprit.

102
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Thank me.

104
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,679
Just don't try to kill me.

105
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,159
Why would I kill you?

106
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,120
Your life

107
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,799
to save your life.

108
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,799
Take the medicine.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,080
Where are you going?

110
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,080
If you go to the street,

111
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,200
can you bring me a cake?

112
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,480
What's that?

113
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,600
It's a cake.

114
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,760
Or bring some

115
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,640
other delicious food here.

116
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,480
I'm hungry.

117
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
I need to prepare a carriage. I don't have time.

118
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,960
You just said thank you.

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Get in the car.

120
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,960
You don't buy it for me?

121
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,760
I'll buy it myself.

122
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,760
I'm in a hurry. Get in.

123
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,880
Sir,

124
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,880
Anyone who lives here

125
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,360
a free piece of cloud cakes.

126
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,840
You can use it on the way.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
Thank you.

128
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,840
If you don't buy it for me,

129
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,080
Someone gave it to me.

130
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,800
He bought it himself.

131
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
but he told us to say it's from the store.

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,160
This man is crazy.

133
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,480
Miss, you're back.

134
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,760
Where have you been?

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,640
Hand Mo didn't find you just now.

136
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,080
She was angry when she came back.

137
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
Now that you're back,

138
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
I'll inform him that you're safe.

139
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,520
Wait.

140
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,360
Hongye, tell them

141
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,040
No one is allowed to enter my room today.

142
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Miss, what are you doing?

143
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Practice.

144
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,360
Yes.

145
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's begin.

146
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,880
The skull is fine.

147
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
His neck is fine.

148
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,600
There are shallow injuries on his arm to nails.

149
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,600
but it's not fatal.

150
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,360
The calves are not injured.

151
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,200
I fought with someone before I died.

152
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,120
But few external injuries are not serious.

153
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,200
nor poisoned.

154
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,200
How did my mother die?

155
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,960
Only by dissection

156
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,640
can we find out the cause of your mother's death.

157
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,760
What did you say?

158
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,920
Hengming Peng.

159
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:37,640
Feng Ang.

160
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,280
Zhang Changhao Lei.

161
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,320
Wei Yong Peng.
