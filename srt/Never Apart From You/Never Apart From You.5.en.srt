1
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,200
Moon Palace?

2
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,840
I chased this bug to Wangyue Palace.

3
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,360
Where is Wangyue Palace?

4
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,840
It's okay. If you don't want to say it, don't say it.

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,280
If you want someone

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,520
to drink and chat with you,

7
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,040
I can.

8
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,200
Okay.

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,640
I won't bother you then.

10
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,440
What kind of person

11
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,080
in your eyes?

12
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,000
She must be nice to you.

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
She once said

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,680
I don't deserve this badge.

15
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,560
She's a liar.

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,880
Master left it to me.

17
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,160
Tell me.

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,200
if she can't come back,

19
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
I will

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,080
to you.

21
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Actually,

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,880
she has never underestimated you.

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
It's just that

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,079
she knows

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,240
that this trip

26
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,160
will be a narrow escape.

27
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,520
So I must protect you no matter what.

28
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,480
If I can be reborn,

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,640
before she investigates the case,

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,280
I won't believe her words.

31
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,440
Sometimes I think

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,160
God gave me a chance to be reborn.

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,160
But it made me live

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,680
when I lose the most important person.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,840
when you lose the most important person?

36
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,079
Have you ever thought

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,320
maybe not God?

38
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,840
Your mother is blessing you to be reborn.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
The emperor has no Ye.

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,560
Do you still want to kill me?

41
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,280
Do you trust me now?

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,080
What do you mean?

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,880
My place was shattered in the previous life.

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,880
But when I met you,

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,160
it can't help drawing again.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
But strangely,

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,079
it thinks you are a sincere and kind person.

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,880
Although it has seen your lies,

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,360
it still can't stop it and wants to believe you.

50
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,160
But I'm afraid I'll trust you wrongly.

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
I'm afraid I'll wrong you.

52
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,680
I don't know what it's thinking.

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Let's drink together.

54
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,800
Like a pig.

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,080
What's the next story in the novel?

56
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,159
He found his mother,

57
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,600
but he didn’t find out the cause of death.

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,560
So I plan to sneak in and investigate again.

59
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,760
But after settling down my mother,

60
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,120
she was suddenly attacked by Snow Phantom.

61
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,960
Miss.

62
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,640
Chief ordered you and Guardian Mo to go to the mourning hall of Second Elder.

63
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
The mourning hall?

64
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,040
Okay.

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
What about him?

66
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,280
Then no one will come in.

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,040
Miss.

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,360
What are you...

69
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,880
Curiosity kills the cat.

70
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Go home.

71
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,159
Yes.

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,280
Li, why are you here?

73
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,760
The Second Elder died suddenly.

74
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,240
It’s just the right time for you to come back.

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,200
Isn't that what father wants?

76
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
To make him happy,

77
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,600
to make him happy.

78
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,560
Tell them you did it.

79
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,680
But don't worry.

80
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,760
I have arrested

81
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,240
in private.

82
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
No way.

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,720
You don't have to do this for me. You're too polite.

84
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,040
You're the one who should be polite.

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,920
Li,

86
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
We've never broken up.

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,240
By the way,

88
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
have you heard of a sect

89
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,200
called Wangyue Palace?

90
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,960
Moon Palace?

91
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,520
What's wrong?

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,200
Did they bully you?

93
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,240
No, no.

94
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,720
Just asking.

95
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,040
This sect is quite evil.

96
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,560
They use Gu insects

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,840
and turn the dead

98
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,760
a silver-haired monster that can be manipulated.

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,240
He used Gu insects to turn people into silver-haired monsters.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
Jun Wuye just settled down his mother.

101
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
he was attacked by Snow Phantom.

102
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,960
Is the Snow Phantom who killed him

103
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,440
is Luo Qiuhan who mutated?

104
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,280
This is bad.

105
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,960
The emperor has no Ye, the emperor has no Ye.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,880
The emperor has no Ye.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh no, the Gu insect is out.

108
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,000
The emperor has no Ye. The emperor has no Ye.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
Are you okay?

110
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,760
It's just a minor injury.

111
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,600
I'm fine.

112
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,480
Mother, I'm Ye'er.

113
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't you remember who I am?

114
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
I'm Ye'er.

115
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,480
Li.

116
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,680
Mother.

117
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
She's too strong.

118
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,440
Do something!

119
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,720
Otherwise, both of us will die.

120
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,160
It must be the poisonous worm in her heart.

121
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,760
Li.

122
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,080
Mother! Mother!

123
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,760
Mother.

124
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,680
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,000
It's not your fault.

127
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
Aunt Luo is a heroine.

128
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,680
She shouldn't be insulted like this after she died.

129
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Don't worry.

130
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,920
I will help you find out the truth.

131
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,280
Get up and look at me, Mother.

132
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,280
Mother.

133
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,880
Lord Hengming Peng.

134
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,000
Feng Ang.

135
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,880
Zhang Changhao Lei.

136
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:29,840
Wai Yong Peng.

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,640
Wai Yong Peng.
