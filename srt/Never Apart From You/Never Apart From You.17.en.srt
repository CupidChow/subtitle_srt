1
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,800
These are all the records

2
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,400
in the past two years.

3
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,640
The goods are shipped by Yuwaist slave.

4
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,760
He must know a lot.

5
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,720
Next,

6
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,240
is to find the jade waist slave.

7
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,520
Looks like

8
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,760
we need to find out the truth of Wu Ye's mother's death.

9
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,600
the jade waist slave is the key.

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,440
But how can we find him?

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,800
Chief vomited a lot of blood today.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,400
Come to think of it,

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
Chief has been vomiting blood two years ago.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400
He’s getting worse recently.

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,920
It’s not peaceful these two years.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
The death of Second Elder

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,840
died a strange death.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,960
Just like the Fourth Elder who died last year,

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,560
died a strange death.

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,160
Is the death of Second Elder

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,720
related to Gu insects?

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,080
The jade waist slave has no fixed place.

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,720
I can't find him in Wangyue Palace.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,280
How can I contact him?

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,160
If you need him,

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,160
the Chief will release a poisonous worm.

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,840
When the jade waist slave sees the Snow Phantom,

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,960
he will come.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,160
We'll know after the autopsy.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,440
The second day of June.

31
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,520
At midnight,

32
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,240
Yunlu Security Agency escorted goods at night.

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
The masked man retrieves the goods at night.

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,440
The goods are small.

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,440
I couldn't find out what it was.

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,320
I only found that there was water soaked in the goods box.

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,440
It was soaked out.

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,200
Why would there be water in the delivery box?

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
It's soaked slowly from the bottom.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,680
It's ice.

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,040
What?

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,520
What ice?

43
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
Escort with ice.

44
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Although the goods are small,

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,960
If it's food,

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,840
it's not worth it.

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,040
Snow Phantom makes Gu.

48
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,600
The plant is cold.

49
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,040
Maybe

50
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,880
This Gu is born from worm pupa.

51
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,560
since the wormworm pupa.

52
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,760
You want to investigate?

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,600
Yunlu Security Agency

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,920
No way.

55
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,040
When you recover,

56
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,720
I'll investigate with you

57
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,280
I'll investigate with you.

58
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,200
Senior.

59
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,600
Just this once.

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,360
I will be careful.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,760
Because

62
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't want any regrets.

63
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,640
I was right.

64
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,240
There is really a Gu insect in Master Rong’s body.

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,320
Li.

66
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,640
Where have you been?

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
I was hungry.

68
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,800
I went to the kitchen to get some food.

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,880
You finally remember to eat.

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,320
But

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
I don't really like

72
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,120
in the kitchen.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
What do you want to eat?

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
I'll get it for you.

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,120
I want to eat

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,800
from Zhang Ji.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,440
Okay.

78
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,520
I'll buy it for you now.

79
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,240
What's wrong?

80
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,200
Li,

81
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,040
You will wait for me.

82
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,560
right?

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,520
I knew you'd wait for me.

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,520
Just like when I was young,

85
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
I won't be alone.

86
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,960
What do you want?

87
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,600
This is from Yunlu Security Agency.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Where is the jade waist slave?

89
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,000
Li.

90
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,440
Li.

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm sorry, Mo Huaiyou.

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,080
When I leave this world,

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,040
Jiang Ruoli won't lie to you anymore.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,920
Where is the jade waist slave?

95
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,200
Mr. Yu, you didn’t show up until late at night.

96
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,159
Lord Wu Ye.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,840
How is your wound?

98
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,520
I'm fine.

99
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,040
That's good.

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,880
Have you been well?

101
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,000
I understand

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,720
what I said before.

103
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,600
After all, you've been living there.

104
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
It's only natural that you want to go back.

105
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
I was too selfish before.

106
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,040
I don't know

107
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,159
I don't know much.

108
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,520
Later,

109
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
be careful later.

110
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,960
It can be a memory.

111
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,160
But I was confused then.

112
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,520
Mr. Yu. Mr. Yu.

113
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,200
Shut up!

114
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,640
It's a girl.

115
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,360
Escort Qian.

116
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,440
Who are they?

117
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,360
They are from our agency.

118
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
Really?

119
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,320
Yes.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,880
There's no way to cross the road.

121
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,760
Step.

122
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,360
Step on the cloud as the bridge.

123
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
Mr. Yu.

124
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,560
Don’t worry.

125
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,560
These are my new disciples.

126
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
They are a loving couple.

127
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,960
No problem.

128
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,000
Mandarin ducks.

129
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,280
You two

130
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,440
love each other.

131
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,840
Then you two kiss.

132
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,040
If you don't,

133
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,360
I'm coming.

134
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,600
Interesting.

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,880
You can get lost.

136
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,679
Yes.

137
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,520
Yes.

138
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,400
She already knew.

139
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,480
We were tricked.

140
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,720
The Criminal Investigation Bureau

141
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,880
Please cooperate.

142
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,320
Otherwise,

143
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,520
Wangyue Palace has been destroyed.

144
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
You know the consequences.

145
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
Excuse me

146
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,160
It's the bureau

147
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
He's dead

148
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,760
No.

149
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,960
This is just her clone.

150
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
The clone of Gu insects

151
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,920
can be exactly like the real one.

152
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,360
Oh no!

153
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,920
This is not going to be easy.

154
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,520
Please spare my life.

155
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,920
Mr. Yu.

156
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,920
Bring the people of the Criminal Investigation Bureau here.

157
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,360
Do you think he should be killed?

158
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,080
Lord Hengming Peng.

159
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,440
Feng Ang.

160
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:01,840
Feng Ang is stable.

161
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,120
Changhao Lei.

162
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
Wai Yong Peng.
