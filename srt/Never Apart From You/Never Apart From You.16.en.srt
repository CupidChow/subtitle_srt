1
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
You're awake.

2
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,320
Li.

3
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,680
Are you okay?

4
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,760
I'm fine.

5
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,280
How do you feel

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,400
How do you feel?

7
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:16,880
I'm fine.

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,480
Where did you get these pills?

9
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,400
You went to buy medicine?

10
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,720
You're seriously injured.

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,280
You’re infected with Gu poison.

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,640
without medicine.

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,440
But we're wanted.

14
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,440
It's too dangerous for you to show up in public.

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,080
But your life is the most important.

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,640
But I can't drag you down.

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,400
I'd rather die

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,240
than let you

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,880
any more danger.

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,400
This is a very serious infection.

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,759
You'll die if you go on like this.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
I'll take you to the hospital.

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,280
No.

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,200
His wound needs to be treated quickly.

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,360
We can't delay any longer.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,680
The emperor has no Ye.

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,080
But you're dragging me down.

28
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,680
Do you think I'm worried about you?

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,199
Don't flatter yourself.

30
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,039
You have no idea.

31
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,840
If you die,

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
I can never go back

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,040
my original world.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,560
Your world?

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,040
What do you mean?

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,440
I saved you.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I helped you investigate the case and bought you medicine.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
All I did

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,360
to go back early

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,680
and return to my world.

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,280
Now,

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,680
the clues of the case are gone.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,880
What's more annoying is

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,400
you became a fugitive

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,040
you became a fugitive.

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,520
He's injured. He can't even move. He's injured.

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,160
No.

48
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,160
There must be another way.

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,360
So I beg you.

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,680
Don't drag me down.

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay?

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm sorry, Jun Wu Ye.

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,360
I have no choice.

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,400
Who are you?

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,680
Turn yourself in.

56
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,040
You alone?

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,240
Where is the Emperor Wuye?

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,960
Back in the prison,

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,600
I kidnapped him and escaped.

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,560
He was wronged.

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,040
There's no escape.

62
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
Where is Jun Wuye?

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
The shabby temple in Qili Hill in the east of the city.

64
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,120
I kidnapped him and wanted to escape.

65
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,480
But he poisoned me and forced me to turn myself in

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,760
Tell me, come to the Criminal Investigation Bureau

67
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,240
to find Commandant Song.

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,560
Li.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,240
Li.

70
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,880
I advise you not to move.

71
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
If I wanted to kill you,

72
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,440
you would have died.

73
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,040
My lord.

74
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
It's the Nine Poison Pill.

75
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,159
That witch is telling the truth.

76
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,840
It seems that His Majesty Wu Ye must be severely injured.

77
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,040
I'll set off now

78
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,680
to arrest him.

79
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,560
Okay.

80
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,400
Song Qinghe.

81
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,960
Bring some men there.

82
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,640
Bring Jun Wu Ye here.

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,880
Everyone, follow me.

84
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,320
Witch!

85
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,360
Punish her now!

86
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,200
Wait.

87
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,000
Li.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Are you okay?

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,000
How dare you!

90
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,560
Who do you think you are?

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Someone!

92
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,680
Someone!

93
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
This is

94
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,120
must be hand Mo.

95
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,680
I've heard a lot about you.

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,400
The Criminal Investigation Bureau

97
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,760
I have no grudge recently.

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,640
I have always admired

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
your Chief Saintess.

100
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,200
I, Zhao Shanhe,

101
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,240
in the Criminal Investigation Bureau

102
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,280
has never been wrongly accused.

103
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,480
Wu Ye.

104
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,000
Wu Ye.

105
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,680
Wu Ye.

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,000
Wu Ye.

107
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,960
is still alive.

108
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,840
Wu Ye! Wu Ye!

109
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,400
Senior.

110
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,760
You scared me.

111
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,160
Here.

112
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,080
Senior.

113
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,600
How is Li?

114
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,720
She's already gone home.

115
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
What's wrong, Junior?

116
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,480
So what he said is true.

117
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,920
Stop struggling.

118
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,320
I already know

119
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,400
you are Wu Ye, the Criminal Officer.

120
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,240
If I really want to kill you,

121
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,200
you won't wake up.

122
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
What do you want?

123
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
This is the antidote for Gu poison.

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,240
Since you saved Li,

125
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll save your life this time.

126
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,360
I've never liked you.

127
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,040
Get away from me.

128
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,080
Brother Song.

129
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,200
When you see Emperor Wu Ye,

130
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,640
Don't talk about me turning myself in.

131
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,360
Since the first day I came here,

132
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,520
I've been looking forward to going back.

133
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,720
The emperor has no Ye.

134
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Please help me out.

135
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,560
okay?

136
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
I've never liked you.

137
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,520
Get away from me.

138
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,400
Peng, Jun.

139
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,400
Tong Ming.

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,280
Feng Ang.

141
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,080
Mansion.

142
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,720
Wai Yong Peng.
