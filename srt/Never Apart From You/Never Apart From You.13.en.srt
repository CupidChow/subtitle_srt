1
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,280
If Chief really colludes with Miao Heng,

2
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,160
it will be a big problem.

3
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,520
Yes.

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,880
After all, he is your father.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,960
If even the Chief is problematic,

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,360
the whole night will be implicated.

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,640
The point is

8
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,959
is so powerful at night.

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
and ruthless.

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,760
Do you think there is a way

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,760
to investigate the case

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,000
and guarantee our safety.

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,760
Think carefully.

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
If this is done,

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,400
you will be expelled from the martial arts world in no night.

16
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
Your Saintess can't do it either.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,000
Isn't that a good thing?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,280
Think about it. If it's not late,

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,760
I'll make a great contribution.

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,840
I've checked the law

21
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,360
You can recommend me to the Criminal Investigation Bureau.

22
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,120
Then I'll have a producer

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
It's ashore.

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,479
She doesn't seem to have any feelings for the night.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,720
Li,

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,320
Are you really not the original Saintess?

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,520
You finally came to see me.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,160
I knew you wouldn't forget me.

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,800
I've completed all the tasks you gave me.

30
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,079
I'm willing to go through fire and water for you.

31
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,000
for you.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
You won't forget me.

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,440
right?

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,400
I have one last secret.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,680
It's about Emperor Wu Ye.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,000
Look.

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,760
I'm still useful to you, right?

38
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,040
What else do you need me to do?

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll do anything.

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,040
You want me to die?

41
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,400
What do you say?

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,800
What did the bureau say?

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,600
Hongye had a strange disease.

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
and was bedridden.

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,520
Only you can cure him.

46
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,040
He also said there's something very important

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
I can only tell you when I see you.

48
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,280
Meet me?

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,880
Something is wrong.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
There must be a trick.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
What she's hiding

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,160
must be an important clue.

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,760
No matter what trap there is,

54
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,079
we must go.

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,200
But...

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,440
So...

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,160
protect me.

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,800
Okay.

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,320
Lord Jun is so close to this witch.

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
Are you bewitched?

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
What if this continues?

62
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,680
My lord

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Governor Zhao

65
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,000
Go ahead.

66
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,040
I'm here, Hongye.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,040
I can only cure any disease.

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,840
My illness is in private.

69
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,560
Get all these men out.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,600
You're the only one left to treat me.

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,480
Don't play tricks.

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
Unless you don't want to know the truth.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:15,960
I guess

74
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,720
she wants to negotiate with me in private.

75
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,600
You go out first.

76
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,600
I'll talk to her.

77
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,800
Be careful.

78
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,000
Call me if you need anything.

79
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,080
I'll wait outside.

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,120
Okay. Don't worry.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,840
Come with me.

82
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,360
Now everyone has left.

83
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,600
Tell me.

84
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,720
Miss.

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,960
Although Hongye

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,560
is just a little maid by your side,

87
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,760
But I love you so much.

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,960
I don't want you to be in danger.

89
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
What danger?

90
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,240
I don't know how the white ink dye used.

91
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,520
All of us

92
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,800
on all of us.

93
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,920
I took the risk to summon you here

94
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,280
to tell you

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,760
to get rid of this mark as soon as possible.

96
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,440
What mark?

97
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,760
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't worry.

99
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,960
I can do nothing.

100
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,960
It's just that you have this mark.

101
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,640
They will find you sooner or later.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,120
You must make another plan.

103
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Also,

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,480
Did you kill

105
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,680
who knew about it?

106
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,360
You want to frame me?

107
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,240
The emperor has no Ye.

108
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,560
The emperor has no Ye.

109
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,560
Miss, what are you doing?

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't kill me, My Lady.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,760
Hongye.

112
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,159
Hongye, stop acting.

113
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,920
Wake up, Hongye.

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,960
My lord.

115
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,000
He...

116
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,440
is dead.

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,800
How dare you!

118
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,800
How dare you kill in front of everyone?

119
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,680
Magistrate Zhao

120
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,240
This is obviously a frame-up

121
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,280
It really wasn't me.

122
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,160
She just told me

123
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,440
a bunch of nonsense.

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,680
Then he died.

125
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
How dare you deny it?

126
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,480
Your Excellency,

127
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,280
we searched Hongye in advance.

128
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,800
There's no drug possession.

129
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,680
You killed the witness in public.

130
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
Arrest this witch

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,760
Magistrate Zhao

132
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,320
I swear with my head

133
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,000
Jiang Ruoli

134
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,640
Jiang Ruoli must be innocent.

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,360
She knew something was wrong with Hongye,

136
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,960
she still volunteered to investigate the case.

137
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,840
My lord.

138
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,160
This case is full of doubts.

139
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:25,800
I believe

140
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,480
even if she really wanted to kill Hongye,

141
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,800
she can't be

142
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,760
in the Criminal Investigation Bureau's prison.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,480
Isn't this

144
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,040
to kill himself.

145
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,159
Yes

146
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,960
Magistrate Zhao

147
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,760
My mother taught me

148
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
as a criminal,

149
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,880
you must not let a bad person go.

150
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,680
or frame any good person.

151
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,320
If we settle the case here,

152
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,560
it'll be too hasty.

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,280
How about

154
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,880
to examine the coroner?

155
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,760
there might be a different result.

156
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,200
It's not too late to make a decision then.

157
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,960
Not bad, Your Majesty.

158
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,760
You're using the previous Criminal Officer to pressure me.

159
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,200
I dare not.

160
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,040
Fine.

161
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's summon the coroner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau for an autopsy.

162
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,200
If the result is as I said,

163
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,400
I'll see how you can deny it.

164
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
Lock this witch up first.

165
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,040
Yes.

166
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,040
Li,

167
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,400
Eat something.

168
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,760
I have no appetite

169
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,760
The coroner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,080
He's very capable.

171
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,400
He will find out the cause of her death.

172
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
Hongye died of poisoning.

173
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,760
I don't doubt that.

174
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,159
But even so,

175
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,720
I can't prove my innocence.

176
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,640
You mean

177
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
she didn't eat anything

178
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,880
she didn't eat anything.

179
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,120
If it can prove

180
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
she took the poison before she met me,

181
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,560
before she saw me.

182
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,120
It can prove my innocence.

183
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,040
So, I must...

184
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,160
You want to dissect the body, right?

185
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
Unfortunately,

186
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,640
If I were to dissect it,

187
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,880
they won't believe me

188
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,080
they won’t believe me.

189
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,640
They will also suspect that I did something.

190
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
Is the world

191
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,160
can be dissected?

192
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,039
Do you believe that I'm not from this world?

193
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,679
Li,

194
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,520
Since I trust you,

195
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,040
I chose to believe everything about you.

196
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,400
I believe that what happened before

197
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,480
what happened before.

198
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Teach me how to dissect.

199
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,280
But this thing

200
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,920
learn this so easily.

201
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,960
I've been working in the bureau for years

202
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,080
I have some experience in the morgue.

203
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,960
Do you think you can

204
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,800
Trust me.

205
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,320
I'll teach you.

206
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,280
My lord.

207
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
The coroner has found out

208
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,800
Hongye

209
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,320
died of arsenic.

210
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,720
Arsenic poison.

211
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,920
It takes effect immediately after taking it.

212
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,000
It seems

213
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,840
the murderer must be that witch.

214
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,320
Magistrate Zhao

215
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,840
We can’t convict him with this alone

216
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,840
The truth is right in front of us.

217
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,040
What else do you want to say?

218
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,800
If the red leaves

219
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,200
It's right outside the arsenic

220
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,120
outside the arsenic.

221
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,080
that can delay the effect,

222
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
Then she can take the medicine in advance

223
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,280
and delay the time of the medicine.

224
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,960
to frame Jiang Ruoli.

225
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,440
I think you're trying to defend that witch.

226
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,560
to defend that witch.

227
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,880
I'm not talking nonsense.

228
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,840
I can verify it.

229
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,680
What is it?

230
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,680
I'll do it myself.

231
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,680
Are you crazy?

232
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Corpse is a serious crime.

233
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,280
My lord.

234
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,640
Wu Ye is young and ignorant.

235
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,480
Look.

236
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,080
The emperor has no Ye.

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,880
Have you thought about the consequences?

238
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,960
You have to know

239
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,560
no matter what the result is,

240
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,960
you can't avoid the crime of dismemberment.

241
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,080
And as a criminal,

242
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,440
you broke the law.

243
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,880
you'll be punished.

244
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,320
As long as we can find out the truth,

245
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm willing to take the blame.

246
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,200
Lord Hengming Peng.

247
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,520
Feng Ang.

248
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:20,760
Feng. Ang.

249
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,400
Changhao Lei.

250
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Wai Yong Peng.
