1
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,360
Don't touch me!

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,080
Li.

3
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,840
Why are you so afraid of me?

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Trust me.

5
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
I never wanted to hurt you.

6
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,920
It's just the two of us now.

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,840
Are you still acting with me?

8
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,520
Li.

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,320
Mo Huaiyou.

10
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,480
How long are you going to act with me?

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,240
You don't have to trust me.

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
doubt me, doubt me,

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,760
except you.

14
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,720
All I did

15
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,960
to make you the Chief.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,160
You promised me

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,600
when you become the Chief,

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,200
we will get married.

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,160
Have you forgotten?

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,000
Li.

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,160
Li!

22
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,560
Why?

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,520
I've worked hard for so long.

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,480
Why does he think

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,600
a woman can't take the throne?

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,840
Chief must be senile.

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
That’s why those elders who are not as good as you

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,400
who are not as good as you.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,800
Don't worry, Li.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,160
I’m here.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,200
you will be the next Chief.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,880
Really?

33
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
When did I lie to you?

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,120
and promised you

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,280
that I couldn’t fulfill?

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,440
If you can help me become the Chief,

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,200
I promise

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,280
to marry you.

39
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,880
Really?

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,240
That's impossible.

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,920
You wanted to kill me.

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,040
Hongye...

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,800
Li,

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,480
I never wanted to hurt you.

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,600
Why would I kill you?

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,040
I want to kill you and replace you.

47
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,240
I didn't know about this.

48
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,880
It was my mistake.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,360
But I conspired with Miao Heng to buy arms.

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,079
and made Snow Phantom with Wangyue Palace.

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,079
All I did

52
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,800
is to make you the heir.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,880
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,080
I have to apologize to you.

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,920
Li,

56
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
You don't have to apologize to me.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,800
I won't blame you no matter what you do.

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,440
Actually...

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,440
I'm not the Li you love.

60
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,600
What did you say?

61
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,360
I actually came from

62
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,680
from another world.

63
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,400
I came here for no reason

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,560
to this body.

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,280
But...

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
But I'm not her.

67
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,720
Li,

68
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,760
Are you kidding me?

69
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Don't lie to me.

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
You always lie to me.

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
Mo Huaiyou.

72
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,079
You grew up together.

73
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,040
Can't you see

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm totally different from her?

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,720
Li, stop joking.

76
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,440
OK?

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,040
Let's wait here for a few days.

78
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,560
and wait for someone to save us.

79
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,480
Okay, Mo Huaiyou?

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,240
You know her so well.

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,600
Can't you tell?

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,920
Stop talking.

83
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,240
I'm sorry, Li.

84
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,720
I'm sorry, Li.

86
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,399
Don't touch me.

87
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,680
Wu Ye.

88
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,360
Li.

89
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,120
Mo Huaiyou.

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Open the lock.

91
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
This lock is made of darksteel.

92
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,159
No matter how you cut it,

93
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,280
you can't cut it open.

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,840
The emperor has no Ye.

95
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,400
You can't take her away.

96
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,320
Where is the key?

97
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,320
Here.

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,560
Just like this,

99
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,600
die here together.

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,080
Li.

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,280
The Emperor has no Ye.

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,360
Wake up.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,080
Li.

104
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,600
I'm dying.

105
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,000
Leave me alone.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
Don't hurt her.

107
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,240
Emperor Wu Ye.

108
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,080
Li, let's go.

109
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,000
This bamboo is nice.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,640
In a few days,

111
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll give you a bamboo-made one.

112
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,000
Li,

113
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,320
I think

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,840
this piece of wood is good.

115
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,320
Huaiyou.

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,720
Why are you so slow?

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,360
I, Jiang Ruoli,

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,520
will soon

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,320
to conquer the world and unify the world.

120
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,520
Okay.

121
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,720
Huaiyou.

122
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,920
From now on,

123
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,080
the world will be ours.

124
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,120
Are you alright, Li?

125
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,200
I'm fine.

126
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,120
I didn't expect them to be so skilled.

127
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,880
Yeah.

128
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,320
We almost died here.

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,440
Why are you laughing?

130
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,120
Is it funny to see me in a mess?

131
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,880
I'm not happy

132
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm not happy at all.

133
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,720
But when I think of being hunted down with you,

134
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm happy

135
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,720
I'm quite happy.

136
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,360
Are you stupid?

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,800
No.

138
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,600
I'm happy because I'm embarrassed.

139
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
What else can it be?

140
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,040
Worried.

141
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,600
If I were killed just now,

142
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,039
will you stay

143
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,000
or run away?

144
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
You know.

145
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,799
That's why I said you're stupid.

146
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,080
What if it was me?

147
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,240
If it were you,

148
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,680
I would have run away

149
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,600
when you were killed.

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Just as I want.

151
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,800
I’m going back to the night.

152
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
and bring all the people of the sect

153
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,880
to kill his family and avenge you.

154
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,360
Look.

155
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,120
I knew it.

156
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
you're smarter than me.

157
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,880
That's good.

158
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Hengming Peng.

159
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,400
Steady.

160
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
Wai Yong Peng.

161
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,000
The roots.
