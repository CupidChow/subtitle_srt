1
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,519
Wu Ye.

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,519
Wu Ye.

3
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,760
Senior.

4
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,680
How's the investigation?

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,240
The jade waist slave said

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,800
Snow Phantom is from the Western Region.

7
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,120
The Western Region?

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,039
Mo Huaiyou is also a scumbag from the Western Region.

9
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,240
But will it really be him?

10
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,840
He never hurt me.

11
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,800
How could he

12
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,720
the one who manipulated all this?

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,680
Maybe

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,440
not him.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,360
Li, don't think too much.

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,039
Wu Ye.

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,520
You don't have to comfort me.

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,920
There's no one else

19
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,120
can control everything.

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,640
No matter what,

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,759
I have to go back to ask him.

22
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,160
Greetings, Saintess.

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,400
What's wrong?

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,840
Saintess, you are finally back.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,120
The Chief is missing.

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,520
Missing?

27
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,560
Guardian Mo.

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Jun Wu Ye is here.

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
Let's go.

30
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,480
He's mine.

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,640
Who dares to touch him?

32
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,720
I...

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,800
Mo Huaiyou.

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,200
After Chief went missing,

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
he issued a decree at night.

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
This

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,840
was done by Emperor Wu Ye.

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,400
He changed his name

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,600
to join my

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,160
The purpose

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,080
is to destroy me.

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,040
He must have gone missing.

43
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,200
Nonsense!

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,800
Mo Huaiyou, what are you doing?

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm showing you who he really is.

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,160
Li,

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
Stop being stubborn.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,040
Come back.

49
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,760
Okay.

50
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:23,720
You said

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,280
that he was the one behind Chief’s disappearance?

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,480
I’d like to see

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,320
what it is.

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
That's it?

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,640
Saintess, no!

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,880
Let's see who dares to act rashly.

57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
The reaction of acid pointer.

58
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,920
Do you think I didn't learn chemistry?

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,079
Li.

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,720
Apply some pebbles on purple clothes

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,720
and set up traps.

63
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,560
and let the vinegar fall from a high place.

64
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,640
After combining the two,

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,159
it will react to red.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
If you don't believe me,

67
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,560
you can go upstairs and smell it.

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,520
This is obviously a frame-up.

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,880
Why?

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,840
Li,

71
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,280
We used to have a tacit understanding.

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,360
But why did everything change when he came?

73
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,440
Kill Jun Wuye.

74
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,440
Kill the Emperor Wu Ye!

75
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
Kill the Emperor Wu Ye!

76
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,320
Here is the divine decree.

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,240
Stop quibbling.

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,640
Kill Jun Wu Ye!

79
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,720
Kill him!

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,840
Let's see who dares to do it.

81
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
That’s right.

82
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,480
It was me who caught him. It was me who caught him. It was me. It was me. It was me. It was me. It was me. It was me. It's me.

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,480
A few days ago,

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,560
I found that he colluded with Miao Heng.

85
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,400
So I secretly took him to the Criminal Investigation Bureau for trial.

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,440
As for

87
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,520
who disguised as him

88
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
I don't know.

89
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,480
Since I approached you,

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,200
I've been using you as my shield.

91
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,680
It's fine.

92
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,280
I treated you so well.

93
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,600
How dare you lie to me?

94
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Where is my father?

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,640
I advise you to cherish your life.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,600
Otherwise,

97
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,920
don't blame me for not considering our past relationship.

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,520
The emperor has no Ye.

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,520
Back off!

100
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,400
Back off!

101
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,960
Back off! Back off!

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,200
The emperor has no Ye.

103
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,200
I'll give you whatever you want.

104
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,480
Don't hurt her.

105
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Give me a fast horse.

106
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,040
Get the horse ready.

107
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,680
Hurry!

108
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,080
Li.

109
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't be afraid.

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,600
Go!

111
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
Are you really going back alone?

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,280
The disappearance of Chief must be related to Mo Huaiyou.

113
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,760
I want to find out.

114
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,720
Wait for my news.

115
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,000
It's too dangerous

116
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,880
When the bureau arrived,

117
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,680
he would have destroyed the evidence.

118
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,880
Don't worry.

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,080
He won't do anything to me.

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,520
But...

121
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,800
I have no choice.

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,560
If I can't find any evidence,

123
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,720
the Criminal Investigation Bureau will still arrest me

124
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
they will still arrest me.

125
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,760
So,

126
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,720
I could only pretend to be Jiang Ruoli

127
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,920
to fool Mo Huaiyou.

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,360
Take care.

129
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,159
Take care.

130
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,400
Li.

131
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,799
That bastard is so despicable.

132
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,600
How dare he use me!

133
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,880
I treated him so well, but he lied to me.

134
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,080
It's okay.

135
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,520
I'll kill him for you.

136
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,480
No.

137
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,600
I've solved it.

138
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,720
Leave me alone.

139
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,000
Unfortunately,

140
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,280
I didn't have time to ask

141
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,600
about my father.

142
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,560
Don’t worry.

143
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,080
The Chief is blessed.

144
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,640
I will pray for him.

145
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,640
What is he doing?

146
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,640
Hengming Peng.

147
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,600
Feng Ang.

148
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:06,760
Feng Ang is stable.

149
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,080
Changhao Lei.

150
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
Wai Yong Peng.
