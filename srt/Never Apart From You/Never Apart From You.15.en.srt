1
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,080
I'll eat first.

2
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Good night.

3
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,360
Good night.

4
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,560
What does "good night" mean?

5
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
Good night means

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,280
Good night.

7
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,479
Is this the language of your world?

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,039
Isn't that...

9
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,200
in the daytime,

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,080
you have to say Bai'an.

11
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,640
I guess I was wrong.

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,760
What about our blessings?

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,520
Good morning, good night, good afternoon.

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,320
If you want to be alone,

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,760
to be alone all day,

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
It's a good day.

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
In that case,

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,560
then...

19
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,880
I’m here. Don’t be afraid.

20
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,680
The Leader of Wangyue Palace is dead.

21
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,200
The most important clue is to find out

22
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,320
the most important clue is at Wangyue Palace.

23
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,920
Even without the Leader,

24
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
there must be clues.

25
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,600
We came here

26
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,760
to investigate

27
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,240
the conspiracy

28
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
with Miao Heng.

29
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,079
Tell me everything you know.

30
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,760
If you hide anything,

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,440
I’ll punish you severely.

32
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
You’ve followed Master Bai for years.

33
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,520
You must know a lot.

34
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,680
Tell me.

35
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,720
Leader always keeps his word.

36
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,480
I only know that someone

37
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,480
who provided us with the poison of Snow Phantom.

38
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,680
to have this cooperation.

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,360
In that case,

40
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,680
there must be accounts.

41
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Take him away.

42
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,080
There are so many ledgers in the accounting room.

43
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,680
I can't find any useful information.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,920
So annoying.

45
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,360
The real ledger must be in Bai Mo Ran's room.

46
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,560
No hurry.

47
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,240
Take your time.

48
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,600
Hurry. Hide.

49
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,320
Wait.

50
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,280
What are you doing?

51
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,240
My lord.

52
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,360
There's noise upstairs.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
No one is upstairs.

54
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
I've checked.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,200
What's going on?

56
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,159
But...

57
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,240
I saw someone come in.

58
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
You mean I'm blind

59
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,000
I can't see people?

60
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,360
My lord.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,640
That's not what I meant.

62
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,480
Alright.

63
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,440
Hurry up.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,920
Let's go somewhere else.

65
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,680
Go.

66
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,320
Let's go.

67
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,880
You two,

68
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,440
be careful?

69
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,320
Don't cause me any more trouble.

70
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,120
Show yourself everywhere.

71
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,600
Find the clues as soon as possible

72
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,320
Or I can’t stop you

73
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,880
I can’t stop him

74
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,440
Help! Help!

75
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,880
My lord.

76
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,600
Bring the maid on his right.

77
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,320
to me.

78
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,120
I want to interrogate her alone.

79
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,640
She's gone.

80
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,159
Where did you hide the ledger?

81
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,280
This is it.

82
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,960
What a cunning old fox.

83
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,360
These are all the records

84
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,880
in the past two years.

85
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,080
The Gu is transported by the jade waist slave.

86
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,200
He must know a lot.

87
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,400
Next,

88
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,760
is to find the jade waist slave.

89
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,920
The jade waist slave doesn't have a fixed place.

90
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,520
I can't find him in Wangyue Palace.

91
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,240
How can I contact him?

92
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,240
If you need him,

93
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,960
the Chief will release a poisonous worm.

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,840
When the jade waist slave sees the Gu insect,

95
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,040
he will come.

96
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,400
Do we still have

97
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,760
Snow Phantom?

98
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,840
The poisonous insects in Wangyue Palace are all with Snow Phantom.

99
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,720
The Snow Phantoms outside

100
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,520
have been killed by you.

101
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,000
Take them away.

102
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,080
Let's go.

103
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,919
Split the body.

104
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,039
I can plead for him.

105
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,000
After all, it's to solve the case.

106
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,120
But breaking into the prison

107
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,799
will be a big problem

108
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,360
Besides, Governor Zhao

109
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,280
is trying his best to arrest him.

110
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,520
You can't keep hiding.

111
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,440
Thank you, Senior.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,200
You've done enough.

113
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,680
Next,

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
to us.

115
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,960
Thank you.

116
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,520
After half an hour,

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,480
after half an hour.

118
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,880
The west side of Wangyue Palace.

119
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,640
No one is here.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,040
The Emperor has no Ye.

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,960
You don't look well.

122
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,640
No.

123
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,520
I've been traveling for two days.

124
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,040
these days.

125
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,080
Okay.

126
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
Rest early today.

127
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,440
We'll discuss other things later.

128
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
Lord Wu Ye, are you alright?

129
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,920
The Emperor has no Ye.

130
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,880
The emperor has no Ye.

131
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,960
Lord Hengming Peng.

132
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,880
Feng Ang.

133
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:56,960
Ang. Steady.

134
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Changhao Lei.

135
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:07,920
Wai Yong Peng.

136
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,720
Wai Yong Peng.
