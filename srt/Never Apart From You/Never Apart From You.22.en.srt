1
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,920
Ah Li.

2
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,720
Fortunately, this place is not far from the secret room.

3
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,720
I found the antidote.

4
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
I already took one.

5
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,200
Li,

6
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,240
It's all over.

7
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,759
right?

8
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,200
Yes.

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,840
It's all over.

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
I promised you

11
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,360
After you find my mother,

12
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,040
I'll send you back

13
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,079
to your world.

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
What is your world like?

15
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,200
In my world,

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,040
you are a character

17
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
in our novel.

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,920
Novel?

19
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,800
[The person in the novel]

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,880
I guess it's already the end.

21
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,880
I guess

22
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,560
you should have killed

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,640
you want to kill.

24
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,800
But

25
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,160
you've really changed.

26
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,760
So...

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,200
I don't know

28
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,120
what will happen next.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,920
Li,

30
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
are you willing to be with me

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
under the peach blossom tree?

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
Wu Ye.

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,200
Let's get married.

34
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,120
Now.

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,079
Right now.

36
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,240
But I didn't prepare anything.

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,280
No need to prepare.

38
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
The peach blossoms on the tree of marriage

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,040
as your betrothal gift.

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,360
My dowry?

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,360
All the flowers and plants under the tree

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,840
are our guests.

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,840
Like this.

44
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,720
At least before the end comes,

45
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,160
before the end.

46
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,320
The emperor has no Ye.

47
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,600
The emperor has no Ye.

48
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,040
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
I promised you

50
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,440
I’ll take you home.

51
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,920
Didn't you take the poison pill?

52
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
How could it be?

53
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,960
There is only one antidote.

54
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,159
Why are you doing this?

55
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,280
Don't cry.

56
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm happy

57
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,760
I think that's enough.

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,560
Why are you doing this?

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,560
Why did you lie to me?

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,840
The emperor has no Ye.

61
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
The emperor has no Ye.

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Li,

63
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,320
In that world without me,

64
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,960
Good morning.

65
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,600
Good morning.

66
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
Good night.

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,280
Good night.

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,640
The emperor has no Ye.

69
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,640
The emperor has no Ye.

70
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,640
The emperor has no Ye.

71
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,920
Zhou Li, you're awake.

72
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,720
Are you okay?

73
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,600
What's wrong?

74
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,320
Excuse me.

75
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,720
What happened?

76
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
I'm fine.

77
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,880
You can go back first.

78
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,360
I want to take a rest.

79
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,320
Okay.

80
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,480
We'll leave you alone.

81
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,600
Have a good rest.

82
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,960
Let's go.

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,720
You can be discharged now.

84
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,159
I heard you saved me.

85
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,840
Lord Hengming Peng.

86
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,000
Feng Ang.

87
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:25,840
Wai Yong Peng.

88
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,240
Wai Yong Peng.
