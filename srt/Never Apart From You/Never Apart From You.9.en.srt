1
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,960
The king is not here. The king is not here.

2
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,440
Are you awake?

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,360
How are you? Are you feeling better?

4
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,440
What you said to Bai Mo Ran

5
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,160
what you said to Bai Mo Ran.

6
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,440
Now you're being so affectionate to me.

7
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,039
Don't you feel sick?

8
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,240
Those were done by the original Jiang Ruoli.

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,200
Although I'm her,

10
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,400
but I'm not her.

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,480
I don't know how to

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,520
explain this to you.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,560
I came from another world.

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,680
I'm not from here.

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,440
How could you make up such a ridiculous lie?

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,880
Trust me.

17
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,880
I know.

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,840
This may sound ridiculous,

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,840
but honestly,

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,480
the first day I came here,

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,240
I never thought of hurting you.

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,000
I only believe what I see.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,800
What's going on?

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,520
I feel dizzy.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,479
The miasma here is poisonous.

26
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,800
If we don't get out of this miasma,

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm afraid I'll be trapped here.

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,560
Can you hold on?

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm too poisoned.

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,759
I won't last long.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,920
No, I need to find someone to save you.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,800
You'll die soon.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,960
What should we do?

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,680
I'll pass my internal force to you

35
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,160
to help you regain your strength.

36
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,760
and find a way out.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,040
and ask someone to save me.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,040
Okay.

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,160
This is the only way.

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,120
The emperor has no Ye, the emperor has no Ye.

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
The Emperor has no Ye. Are you okay?

42
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,240
Jiang Ruoli.

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,160
If you lie to me again,

44
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,680
if I have another chance to be reborn,

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,960
I won't let you suffer.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,040
Are you worried that I'll leave by myself?

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,360
Don't worry. I won't survive even if you die.

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
I'll find someone to save you.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,200
Jun Wu Ye, trust me.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
I'll be back before dark.

51
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:56,920
The emperor has no Ye.

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,480
You lost in the end.

53
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
Gosh.

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,840
How foolish.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Mother.

56
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
Ye'er, you've suffered.

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,159
I'll take you to buy candied haws.

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,080
Hey!

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
I want to eat sugar-coated haws.

60
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,159
I want to eat sugar-coated haws.

61
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,960
I'll buy it for you.

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,360
Here.

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,200
Sit here.

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,520
When are you coming back?

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
I'll be back soon.

66
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,440
Wait for me here.

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,120
The emperor has no Ye.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,360
I'm back to save you.

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,200
Come here. Over here.

70
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,640
The emperor has no Ye.

71
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
The emperor has no Ye.

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,280
Don't worry.

73
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,000
I've sent someone to take care of you.

74
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,760
Take good care of yourself

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,360
Take good care of yourself.

76
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,200
There must be a way.

77
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,640
He will believe me.

78
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,840
The words of white ink dye

79
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
may not be true.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,840
I'll investigate it myself.

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Hello?

82
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,880
Anyone?

83
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,200
Madam Mei, are you there?

84
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,600
Taohua Town will open at night.

85
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
Please go back.

86
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,480
Wait, you are...

87
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
Jiang Ruoli, the Saintess of the night.

88
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,760
I just want to ask

89
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,720
who is the person

90
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,640
hiding Luo Qiuhan here?

91
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,960
Isn't that you?

92
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,240
Are you sure?

93
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,680
How could I be wrong?

94
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,800
Let the murderer investigate the truth for him.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,760
and let the rebel fall in love with the protagonist.

96
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,640
I want to live until the end.

97
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,480
Did you give me this chance?

98
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,960
The emperor has no Ye.

99
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,280
What do you mean?

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,360
I'll send you back to the bureau for trial

101
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,520
You still don't trust me.

102
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,159
How can I trust you?

103
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,120
Then why did you run?

104
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,360
I didn't.

105
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,640
Do you trust me, Jiang Ruoli?

106
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,200
Of course I trust you.

107
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,200
I believe

108
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,640
you're an upright Criminal Officer.

109
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,640
Now,

110
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,680
He caught me.

111
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,480
This time,

112
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,280
I can use my blood

113
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,240
to sacrifice your mother's spirit.

114
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,600
The emperor has no Ye.

115
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,760
Untie me! Untie me!

116
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,480
The Emperor has no Ye.

117
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,360
Who is it?

118
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,640
Master Bai.

119
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,039
What’s wrong with you?

120
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,480
What happened?

121
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,280
That despicable man.

122
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,280
I’ve never been so miserable in my life.

123
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,120
Untie me.

124
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
I'll get you out of here.

125
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,600
Let's work together to get rid of this thief.

126
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,240
Forget it.

127
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,160
Forget it.

128
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,560
Just let it go.

129
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,560
That bastard.

130
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,480
He has no conscience.

131
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,280
and inhumane.

132
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,280
and petty.

133
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,480
Despicable and shameless.

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
He's a beast in his clothes.

135
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,560
What did he do to you?

136
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,160
No.

137
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,800
How dare I eat your food?

138
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
After eating it,

139
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
I have to be grateful to you.

140
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,200
I might not be able to pay you back.

141
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,320
Okay.

142
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
Thank you.

143
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,040
Sir,

144
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,800
Here you are.

145
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,160
Sir.

146
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Anyone who moves in here

147
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,720
will be given a free piece of cloud cakes.

148
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,640
Enjoy.

149
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
Anyone who lives here

150
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,000
a free piece of cloud cakes.

151
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,560
Thank you.

152
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,800
Why are you only giving it to her for free?

153
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,440
You can't eat it.

154
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,040
Why should I starve my opponent?

155
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,480
What kind of gentleman are you?

156
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,200
Sir, the steamed pork bun you ordered

157
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,360
is also ready for you.

158
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,680
Where's the callus?

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
Aren't you afraid I'll run away?

160
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
You sleep on the bed tonight.

161
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll sleep on the floor.

162
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't want to owe you anything.

163
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,040
Rest early.

164
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,800
There will be a tough battle tomorrow.

165
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,640
What tough battle?

166
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
So mysterious.

167
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:27,840
Xiao Li.

168
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,840
Hengming Peng.

169
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,000
Feng Ang.

170
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,800
Feng Ang is stable.

171
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,400
Changhao Lei.

172
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:49,840
Wai Yong Peng.
