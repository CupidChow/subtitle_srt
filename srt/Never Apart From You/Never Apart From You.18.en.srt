1
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,400
You...

2
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,320
How did you...

3
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,800
The person I love lied to me.

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,280
and turned me into a Gu.

5
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,040
I have no real body.

6
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,000
No.

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,160
Now should I say

8
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,560
In this vast world,

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,320
everyone can become me.

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,480
I love playing games

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,680
with lovebirds.

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,480
You love her.

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,280
She's just my friend.

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,640
Don't do anything stupid.

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,640
I don't think so.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,640
Li.

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,800
Li!

18
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,240
What are you doing?

19
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
Come at me.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,600
I have a medicine.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,200
As long as you take it,

22
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,080
I'll let her go.

23
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,479
No! Don't go!

24
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,440
Li!

25
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,000
No!

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,120
Don't eat it.

27
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,079
Eat it. Let her go.

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,880
Li,

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,440
You did it.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,280
and you still say you don't love her?

31
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,079
What did you feed him?

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,640
The liver and intestines.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,640
This Gu is a female and a male.

34
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,840
Red is male Gu.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,640
Green is female.

36
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,720
They love each other.

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,079
It's hard to part.

38
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,840
Just like you two.

39
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,160
As long as the medicine is melted,

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,120
the male Gu will wake up.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,200
The emperor has no Ye.

42
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,960
The emperor has no Ye.

43
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,840
That's it.

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,680
In order to return to the female Gu,

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,640
it will bite

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,440
his flesh and blood.

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,600
The emperor has no Ye.

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,120
Are you alright?

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,079
Give me the antidote.

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,079
Antidote?

51
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
You're too naive.

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,880
The only way to save him

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,520
to save him.

54
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,240
What do you want?

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,520
What do I want to do?

56
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,880
I just

57
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,200
to see

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,920
lovebirds.

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,000
Is it true or fake?

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
The emperor has no Ye.

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,520
After taking this poison,

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
If you can feel

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
your strong love,

64
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,160
you won't struggle anymore.

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,800
However,

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,240
if one of you

67
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,520
one of you

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,240
will be bitten to death.

69
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,000
He will die faster.

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,360
You dare not eat it.

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Love is nothing.

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
With this poison,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,720
I don't know how many

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,360
the so-called lovers

75
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,760
make them turn against each other

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
and kill each other.

77
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,880
I wonder

78
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,840
what kind of surprise

79
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,800
will you give me?

80
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:03,920
Li.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm fine.

82
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,000
It's okay.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,960
Let's go.

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,560
She doesn't want to die with you.

85
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,600
Shouldn't you

86
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,000
hate her and kill her?

87
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,280
The emperor has no Ye.

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
She doesn't love you at all.

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,080
Let's see how long you can be arrogant.

90
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,520
Li.

91
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,920
Let's go.

92
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,280
She won't eat it.

93
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,920
In this world,

94
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,200
die for love?

95
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
The emperor has no Ye.

96
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,000
If I made a wrong decision,

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,120
don't blame me.

98
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,560
Li.

99
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,200
Li!

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
Li.

101
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,840
How?

102
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
How dare you...

103
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
That's impossible.

104
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,880
Impossible.

105
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
It's impossible.

106
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,760
Impossible.

107
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,200
You overestimated yourself.

108
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,080
This is the first time I've seen it.

109
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,200
But love in this world

110
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920
love is love.

111
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,560
Love is not love.

112
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,120
No matter how you pretend,

113
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,320
you can fool the world,

114
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,440
or my love Gu.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I told you.

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,960
no one will live under my love Gu.

117
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,159
What is love?

118
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,120
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,920
I couldn't do it.

120
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,000
I couldn't take you home.

122
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,760
I always hesitated and worried.

123
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,640
But now I think

124
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,200
my previous thoughts are not worth mentioning.

125
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,600
I just want you to live.

126
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,680
The emperor has no Ye.

127
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,760
I've figured it out.

128
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,520
I really love you.

129
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
I love you too.

130
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,360
Impossible.

131
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,480
No one can break my love Gu.

132
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,679
This must be fake.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
I'll kill you all!

134
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,840
After I kill you,

135
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,880
there will be no true love in the world.

136
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,680
I will kill you.

137
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,240
You're killed by the person you love.

138
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,560
You should take revenge on him.

139
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,200
Why did you

140
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
on others?

141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,880
Can you fool others and yourself?

142
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,640
True love doesn't need to be proved.

143
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,600
Why?

144
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,720
Why?

145
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,360
I love him so much.

146
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,520
For him,

147
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,800
I want to give him

148
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
to him.

149
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,480
Why doesn't he love me?

150
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,400
Why doesn't he love me?

151
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,160
If you want to investigate,

152
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,920
the Snow Phantom Pupa of Wangyue Palace,

153
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,400
It's from the pagoda in the Western Region.

154
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,560
from the Western Region.

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Not Miao Shan.

156
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,560
That's right.

157
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,600
I will never forget

158
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,800
That was 12 years ago today.

159
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm a little kid from the Western Region.

160
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,880
wandering on the streets of Midland.

161
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,440
and was humiliated.

162
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,680
Do you have any other clues

163
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,920
to us?

164
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
or testify for us.

165
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm tired.

166
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
I've seen the true love in this world.

167
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,600
That's enough.

168
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,400
Begonia.

169
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,840
If there is a next life,

170
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,600
I hope you won't let me down again.

171
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,080
There is true love in the world.

172
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,600
There will be no jade waist slave anymore.

173
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:26,760
Heng Ming Peng.

174
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,320
Lord Hengming Peng.

175
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,080
Feng Ang.

176
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,160
Ang. Steady.

177
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,120
Wei Yong Peng.

178
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,400
Yong Peng.

179
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,920
Wai Yong Peng.
