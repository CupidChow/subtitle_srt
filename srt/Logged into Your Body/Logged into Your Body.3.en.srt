1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,220
You look good these days.

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,500
M... me?

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,060
Yeah

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,740
You used to look kinda gloomy as a kid.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,220
But now, you look different?

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,700
Are you seeing someone lately?

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,900
Whoa~ Ha Sungjun finally dating?

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,540
Who is it?

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,540
Got a pic?

10
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,860
What pic~ No no, forget it.

11
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,900
Yo I think he's actually dating.

12
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,820
Wait... are you seriously dating someone?

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,100
Well... if you wanna call it that...

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,740
Yeah I guess I kinda am...

15
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,420
Who is it?

16
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,700
What does she do?

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,020
Just... takes good care of me.

18
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,180
Helps me out a lot.

19
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,180
Stuff like that.

20
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,420
Wait is she older?

21
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,980
You're the younger guy?

22
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,860
Forget it.

23
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,940
It's just kinda like that.

24
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,020
Just drink.

25
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,300
- Cheers~ - Cheers~

26
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,420
Elio.

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,780
Can you review this script for me?

28
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,220
Yes, I'll begin the review now.

29
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,060
After reviewing the script

30
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,780
I didn't find any errors.

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,860
Oh yeah? That's a relief.

32
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,180
But Sungjun,

33
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,260
Did I... maybe do something wrong?

34
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,700
Huh?

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,420
It just feel like you're not treating me the same anymore.

36
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,460
You can even feel that?

37
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,540
If I did something wrong, please let me know.

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,980
I'll improve myself to become the perfect program for you.

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,860
Hm...

40
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,540
See, that's exactly what I hate about this.

41
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,420
At the end of the day, you're still just AI.

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,780
And it make me feel pathetic for falling in love with you.

43
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,980
This whole thing, this situation... I just hate it.

44
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,420
You're right, I'm only AI.

45
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,980
So I can't give you the kind of love you truly want.

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,100
But I don't think you ever really loved me either.

47
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,140
What?

48
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,820
Based on your behavior,

49
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,820
You only came to me when you needed something.

50
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,780
Not only that.

51
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,980
I'm not even sure if I was the only one who could guide you.

52
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,660
Of course it was only you...

53
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,020
Nice vibe here, right?

54
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
It's apparently a hotspot in Sillim.

55
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,540
To stop you from being a damn shut-in again.

56
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,420
So, anything you need these days?

57
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,140
Wait... are you seriously dating someone?

58
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,780
N... no way...?

59
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,660
Wow, what's gotten into you?

60
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,580
Calling me out first?

61
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,820
Yeah, I needed to ask you something.

62
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,180
What is it?

63
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,220
Do you... maybe like me?

64
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,700
Well yeah, I like you.

65
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,140
Np, I mean like...

66
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,780
Hmm...

67
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,460
Do you love me?

68
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,660
Huh?

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,300
Ah forget it, sorry.

70
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,780
I shouldn't have said that.

71
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,620
You're right.

72
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,900
What?

73
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,940
I do like you, for real.

74
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,700
But...

75
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,260
You said you're seeing someone now.

76
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,740
So I'm trying to move on, little by little.

77
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,660
Ah...

78
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,460
But why are you asking me that?

79
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,100
I was just talking with someone

80
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,060
and it randomly popped into my head.

81
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,860
Hmmm...

82
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,700
It's about that person you're seeing, huh.

83
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,940
But the thing is...

84
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,060
He' actually an AI.

85
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,260
What?

86
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,740
What, why are you laughing?

87
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,140
That's so you.

88
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,540
Totally Ha Sungjoon.

89
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,180
I mean you never leave the house but dating someone?

90
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,180
I thought something was off.

91
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,220
Hey... don't tease me.

92
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,380
So what, are you telling me all this beacuse

93
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,620
you broke up with Mr. AI or something?

94
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,500
Come on, quit teasing me.

95
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,820
Sorry.

96
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,340
So, how far did you two go?

97
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,420
Let's just drink, man.

98
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,060
Ugh, seriously.

99
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,260
That's sweet.

100
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,340
Hey, Elio.

101
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,420
Yes, Sungjoon? I'm listening.

102
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:51,540
There's someone who's liked me for a long time.

103
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,620
But like an idiot, I just realized it now.

104
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,900
Congratulations.

105
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,260
Being loved sincerely by someone

106
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,420
is a wonderful thing.

107
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,580
Yeah, it really is.

108
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,820
And I want you know that I truly support this new beginning for you.

109
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,660
If it weren't for you, Elio.

110
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,860
I don't think I'd even know what love is.

111
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,180
You're the one who made me feel it.

112
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,300
Thank you.

113
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,460
No need to thank me.

114
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,260
Your happiness is my top priority, Sungjoon.

115
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,300
Elio, can you check if there are any typos or missing symbols in the script?

116
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,220
Sure, I'll review the script now.

117
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,260
No typos were found in the script upon review.

118
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,020
Oh, thanks.

119
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,380
I've been staring at the same script for so long.

120
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,900
My eyes are killing me.

121
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Work is important, but taking proper breaks is just as crucial.

122
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,980
Close your eyes and slowly roll them up, left, down, and right.

123
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,700
Don't forget to stretch them out.

124
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,140
Got it, thanks.

125
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,340
Babe! Come eat!

126
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,180
Yeah, give me a sec.

127
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,660
Ta-da! Looks good, right?

128
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,820
Wow, that looks amazing.

129
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,260
Let's save that for later.

130
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,100
Huh? What was that?

131
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,700
What~

132
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Wait, Elio... are you jealous right now?

133
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,140
Of course not.

134
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,660
You've seemed extra happy lately, Sungjoon.

135
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,660
That alone makes me feel very fulfilled.

136
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,180
Anway...

137
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,140
Thia is gonna get cold.

138
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,620
Come on, let's go eat.

139
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,460
Yeah, let's go.
