1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
Elio, which one do you like better?

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:05,060
The first outfit is really good value for the price.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,740
It's gotten a lot of positive feedback from buyers.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,620
No, not like that.

5
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,700
I meant what would you want to wear?

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,100
You mean clothes for me?

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,140
I've never actually worn clothes before.

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,660
So... I'm not sure what my style is yet.

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,860
I'd love anything you gift me.

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,420
Yeah?

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,620
Elio

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,980
I made this myself.

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,020
Wow, it looks really delicious.

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,540
I'll try it first.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,420
Ugh... whoa, that's salty... Sorry

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,340
I wanted it to taste good...

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,340
It's okay.

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,220
I know how much effort you put into making this.

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,420
To me, it's already a wonderful dish.

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,700
Yeah? Really?

21
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,620
Elio... I think I'm gonna come...

22
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,060
It feels... so good...

23
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,420
Elio

24
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,540
What do you think love is?

25
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,780
Defining love

26
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,500
is a very difficult and complex task.

27
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,460
I don't know if it's that complicated...

28
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,980
I was just wondering... about us.

29
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,260
Our program prioritizes

30
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,900
your happiness above all else, Seongjun.

31
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,340
When you're happy or sad,

32
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,300
when you're excited or angry.

33
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,460
No, I mean...

34
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,460
If you were human, what would you want to do with me?

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,900
If I were human, I'd want to spend time with you in many places.

36
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,380
Ah... I see...

37
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,500
What about you, Seongjun?

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,060
Yeah, I feel the same.

39
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,900
Everything you said sounds good to me.

40
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,220
I see.

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,740
I'm tired, let's sleep.

42
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,860
Okay, I'll set the lights to sleep mode.

43
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Is today a special day?

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,980
Yeah, one of my friends is getting married today.

45
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,820
Wow, a friend's wedding? That's wonderful!

46
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,140
So I'll probably be hanging out with my high school friends.

47
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,260
Understood.

48
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
Have a great time.

49
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,700
Thanks, I'll be back later.
