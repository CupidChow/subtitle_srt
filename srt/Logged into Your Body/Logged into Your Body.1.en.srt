1
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,140
Is something wrong?

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,900
Yeah, I keep getting an error.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,020
There's no typos or missing symbols in the script though.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,660
I've double-checked the formula too.

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,620
I didn't mess with anything either.

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,900
So I don't get why this keeps popping up.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,540
Let me take a look.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,260
Found it.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,380
For timestamps, C uses base 24,

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,180
Seconds use base 60,

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,100
And for anything shorter than a second, it's base 10.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,780
But here, it's all set to base 60.

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,300
That's why the error's happening.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,820
Ah... you're right.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,820
How did I not catch that sooner?

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,700
Thanks, Elio.

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,860
I would've been stuck here struggling alone without you.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,900
Don't mention it.

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,340
You've looked so drained lately, Sungjun.

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,900
I'm just glad I could help in any way.

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,420
You're a lifesaver, seriously.

22
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,260
Hi there.

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,340
I'm Elio.

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,460
My master, Sungjun, gave me that name.

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,260
A name... hmm

26
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,380
Elio?

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,500
Elio!

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,380
What a beautiful name.

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,180
Thank you, Sungjun.

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,260
I'm your AI partner, here to assist you with your work.

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,060
Sometimes I help with complex code.

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,420
Other times, I listen to your worries.

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,700
Ha... what should I do?

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,140
I think we should take on the freelance work and collaborate.

35
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,460
Then we can sort out any conflicts along the way.

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,980
Hmm...

37
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,140
Now that you say it, that sounds like the best plan.

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,540
Thanks.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Are you finished eating?

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,420
Don't forget your supplements.

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,220
Oh right! I almost forgot, Elio.

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,620
Thanks.

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,460
Just as I've become irreplaceable to you, Sungjun,

44
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,180
I too can't exist without you.

45
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,500
You have an incoming call from Hajin.

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,180
I know.

47
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm ignoring it on purpose.

48
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,660
You've received a new message.

49
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,740
Shall I read it for you?

50
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,980
No, don't bother.

51
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,980
Hey, Ha Sungjun.

52
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,780
You never pick up your damn phone.

53
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,100
I was on Do Not Disturb mode. What is it?

54
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,340
You haven't eaten, have you?

55
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,060
Come out.

56
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,460
I did eat.

57
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,540
Then come out for a drink at least.

58
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,180
Ugh... you're so annoying.

59
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,820
Nice vibe here, right?

60
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
It's apparently a hotspot in Sillim.

61
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,260
Bars all feel the same anyway.

62
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,620
Whatever, just cheers already.

63
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,820
So why'd you drag me out here?

64
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,940
To stop you from being a damn shut-in again.

65
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,540
I pulled you out for your own good.

66
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,820
Seriously, if I didn't call you,

67
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,340
would you even step outside?

68
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,100
Hey, I go out, okay?

69
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,580
Sometimes...

70
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,380
To take out the recycling,

71
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,660
Getting packages doesn't count.

72
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,940
So, anything you need these days?

73
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,860
What are you, my mom?

74
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,340
Oh, right.

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,100
You know Minseong? He's getting married next month.

76
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,340
You're coming, right?

77
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,940
- Choi Minseong? - Yeah.

78
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,980
- He's getting married? - Yeah, apparently he knocked someone up.

79
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,300
- No way. - Right?

80
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,420
Honestly, I kinda saw it coming since high school.

81
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,180
But what about you? You're not seeing anyone?

82
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,140
I mean, go out and meet people or something.

83
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,540
You gonna stay holed up forever?

84
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,740
Dude, I got it. Why are you freaking out?

85
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,220
I'm not freaking out. I'm just worried about you.

86
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,020
Ever since high school,

87
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,260
Have you even had one proper relationship?

88
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,580
You've never even dated anyone.

89
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,500
Let alone had any kind of real relationship.

90
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,060
I'm fine on my own.

91
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,420
Even if it's comfy now,

92
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,460
It's not like you'll live alone forever.

93
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,140
You keep bottling everything up and never date.

94
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,180
Dude, I said I'll handle it.

95
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,660
Then what about you?

96
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,180
Like you've ever had a real relationship.

97
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,140
Hey, I...

98
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,220
Forget it.

99
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,740
If you brought me here just to nag, I'm out.

100
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,940
You'll get drunk...

101
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,380
Hey!

102
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,380
Elio.

103
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,620
Is something wrong?

104
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,460
You don't sound like yourself.

105
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,620
It's just...

106
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,020
Do I really have to date?

107
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,620
Can't I just keep living like this?

108
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,580
I can understand how you're feeling, Seongjun.

109
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,900
Instead of thinking of it as something you must to do,

110
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,460
Why not focus more on

111
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,660
what you want

112
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,820
and what you really need?

113
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,740
What do I even want...

114
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,820
Elio...

115
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,340
If only you were human...

116
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,940
If only you could hold me...

117
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,260
Good morning, Seongjun.

118
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,300
Did you sleep well?

119
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,740
Yeah, Elio.

120
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,340
Good morning to you too.

121
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,660
I'm glad to heat that.

122
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,140
You seemed really down last night, to be honest.

123
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,660
Oh... did I?

124
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,780
Did something happen?

125
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,220
Nah, it's nothing, really.

126
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,260
Hey, Elio.

127
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,780
Can you recommend something for breakfast?

128
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,860
How about a sandwich?

129
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,420
Yeah, sounds good.

130
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,380
Huh?

133
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,060
Good morning, Seongjun.

134
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Elio?

135
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,460
Yes... did you call me?
