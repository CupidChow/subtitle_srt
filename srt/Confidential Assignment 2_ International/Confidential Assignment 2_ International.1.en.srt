0
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,717
You're the one who loses
everything while trying to eat it all

1
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,843
is money that good?

2
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:53,614
So let's see if this
money can save you?

3
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,936
Rim cheol-ryeong sees
everything here, man

4
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:45,467
do you forsake the republic's
grace and become a drug dealer?

5
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,249
Aren't you ashamed to see
your comrades?

6
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,819
I'm your girlfriend, because
I died right in front of you?

7
00:03:58,374 --> 00:03:59,694
What did you do then

8
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,030
hey, it's a shame to be lonely

9
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:12,007
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
this guy just pushed in

10
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,654
the criminal will be
repatriated to the home country

11
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,458
according to the agreement
between the dprk and the U.S.

12
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,311
The republic appreciates your cooperation

13
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,639
you now

14
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,665
infringing on the privileges
of diplomatic missions

15
00:04:26,677 --> 00:04:28,440
of the Democratic
people's republic of Korea

16
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:49,331
Ok, all light

17
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:01,202
Allite

18
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:03,014
Thank you, comrade commander

19
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:05,073
it's the hundred dollars
you gave me yesterday.

20
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,874
Bought as a gift for my daughter and mother

21
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:07,936
hundred dollars?

22
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,975
Wasn't it ten dollars from me?

23
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,607
It's changed, please change it

24
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:16,167
how about this?
I wrote it all down

25
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,883
are you kidding me again?
Commander-in-chief is also...

26
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,739
I bought a few of these
to give to my mom.

27
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,015
- Get one of the captain's comrades.
- No job.

28
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,858
'Cause there's no one waiting for me

29
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,030
comrade

30
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:36,077
hasn't a lot of time passed now?

31
00:06:37,103 --> 00:06:38,125
Kikago

32
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,735
there are not only two eminai who are
aiming for the team leader with tiger eyes.

33
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:45,363
If I was born with this
face, I wouldn't live in ikago.

34
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,241
Pula

35
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:24,001
Comrade!

36
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:33,401
Go go

37
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,836
This is Seoul central district
prosecutor's office Kim seung-yeon.

38
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:29,629
Are you miyoung Kim?

39
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,256
My bankbook is used
for illegal transactions...

40
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:33,240
It seems that your personal
information has been leaked

41
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:34,425
yes, don't panic

42
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,344
the money in your
current account is at risk...

43
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:37,593
Yes mother hello

44
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,237
that jung-wook is
my friend Chang-hoon.

45
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,431
Drink and hit people

46
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,887
I'm at the police station

47
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,472
- mom?
- Hello, uh...

48
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,894
This...

49
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:48,066
No, see

50
00:10:48,324 --> 00:10:49,816
no, change the script.

51
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:54,175
I keep blowing the rebroadcast so I keep my
eyes open and there's no response to this

52
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:57,714
-i can't eat me anymore.

53
00:10:57,715 --> 00:11:00,160
It's because of your acting.
Why are you hitting the script?

54
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:05,184
Well, as you can see, it's just an
ordinary telemarketing company.

55
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,126
Well, I don't know which
mate would be a good fit.

56
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,406
I'm a little tired of
this phone consultation

57
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,838
because it's
emotional labor, yeah

58
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,800
instead, you just
need to collect money.

59
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,260
1% of the collection goes to the allowance

60
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,268
not 1%

61
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,628
fuck, if you get caught by
the cops doing a collection

62
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:23,558
I'm the only one getting fucked, fuck it

63
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,602
looks like you're spending
some time on the floor

64
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:28,188
I was a resident in the
Philippines for 1 year.

65
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,690
He spent two years as
a specialist in yanbian.

66
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,942
That's what you said earlier

67
00:11:33,098 --> 00:11:35,736
so, would you like
to write a script?

68
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:40,331
No, some people call me
a writer by the river, yeah

69
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,425
if you give me 5 million per
episode, I can give you a good rating.

70
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:46,082
No, what is this?

71
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:48,527
Is this a camera?

72
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:51,418
You have great eyesight

73
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,403
nothing else, I do
YouTube, that youtuber

74
00:11:54,404 --> 00:11:56,174
this savage! Jump out!

75
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:57,441
Hurry up!

76
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:58,667
Hey, stop moving.

77
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:01,941
- It's a cop.

78
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:03,129
Oh, it hurts

79
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:04,864
bustle

80
00:12:04,865 --> 00:12:08,978
my brother is jintae kang from
the kwangsudae. You bastards, huh?

81
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:12,020
Cannon bankbook, Cannon
phone, counterfeit passport

82
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:15,026
where did you get all that?

83
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,301
Who's the supply, you bastard!

84
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,573
Supply book and nabal

85
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,667
I'm cold and hungry and I'm dying

86
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:25,371
no, when are you coming?

87
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:31,542
Hey, aren't you guys eating
something without me knowing?

88
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:34,970
I wish I could eat a bowl of hot noodles

89
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,394
- hey, we're not bastards.

90
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:41,344
Hey, gaekone, gaeko,
who's not a detective?

91
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:48,410
Hey, hey, come, come, come

92
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:58,027
How many millions
of won do you need?

93
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,697
Look, see the perfect
hologram here?

94
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:03,491
Only me in Asia can make this

95
00:13:06,096 --> 00:13:07,316
where are you from?

96
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:09,214
Russia? Curry ski?

97
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:10,433
Kareisuki tea?

98
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,563
I came to my korean grandfather's
hometown to earn money.

99
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:15,621
I live near Korea university.

100
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,402
So how many?

101
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,449
Excuse me

102
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:25,769
- yes, you're in trouble.
- Are you the owner of this car?

103
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,724
Yes, yes, good work

104
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,224
- police, police
- that's it

105
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,746
when I look up the
car, it says Cannon car.

106
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,347
Yeah cops, cops

107
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,114
sergey, sergey!

108
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,487
A montage of the serial kidnapping of
women and girls in bongcheon-dong...

109
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,780
I'm out of it

110
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,925
it's not like that

111
00:13:43,926 --> 00:13:46,385
I'm the gangster,
the gangster...

112
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:47,808
Gwangju or gwangsu, stay still

113
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,218
- you're not stingy, really.
- Stay still, be still.

114
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:51,861
- That's right, that's right.
- That's right, that's right.

115
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:53,916
You kidnapped women
using these handcuffs?

116
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:54,917
Pervert chick

117
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,027
so get fake passports
to bounce abroad!

118
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,065
- Fake passports!
- Fake passports!

119
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,158
I, I am a cop, cop!

120
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,800
It's the gwangsudae police station!
Gwangsudae!

121
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,881
After the undercover investigation of
this bastard caught almost everything...

122
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,750
Hey!

123
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:13,605
Splash, bounce,
hurry, chase, chase!

124
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:21,355
Hey, you bastard, stand there!

125
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:27,492
Stand up!
Stand up, you bastard!

126
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:51,516
Baby like a magnet

127
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:02,549
Hey, yah la, put away the
ramen, put away the ramen

128
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:04,111
if it's sesame...

129
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,781
Didn't eat

130
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,996
How did he hang upside down again?

131
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,440
If he falls, you have to stand up.

132
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,714
Hey, oh, oh, move it right

133
00:15:17,715 --> 00:15:20,214
hey, it's on the
left. Turn right!

134
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,385
Hey, I'm going to fall!

135
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:37,801
Stop!

136
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,442
Be careful!

137
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,895
Don't cry, it's okay,
where's mom, mom?

138
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:09,537
- Where's mom, where's mom?
- Where's mama, go to mama

139
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:13,309
- it's okay?
- It must have been a disaster.

140
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:15,637
It's okay? Are you really okay?

141
00:16:16,012 --> 00:16:18,770
No, you should
have stopped there.

142
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,395
Seniors

143
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:22,690
hey, blood!

144
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:26,652
What kind of blood is this

145
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:28,574
no, why are you here...

146
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,366
Hey hey...

147
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,332
Really...

148
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:43,440
I bought a cell phone
from a used country.

149
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,479
Head hurts

150
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:50,134
received the parcel and found that there
were only chicken bones in the chicken box?

151
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:52,433
There was also a
plastic bag, so I opened it.

152
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:55,613
Well, shit...

153
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:56,669
Shit?

154
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:00,754
Star, you crazy bastard...

155
00:17:01,483 --> 00:17:03,621
How much shit was
there as much as this?

156
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:06,997
This much

157
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,569
is that human shit?

158
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,316
On may 6th, after an argument in the
PC room in banghak-dong, both sides...

159
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,452
Are you talking about
assault on both sides?

160
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,451
No, then this is
just plain assault.

161
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,848
Hey, why are the cybercriminals
investigating simple assault?

162
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,266
Who received this?

163
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:21,832
I...

164
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,834
Is it a cyber crime to be a
fan of people in a PC room?

165
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,753
Beat people with the keyboard

166
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:29,455
hey, if you're a fan of
cybercriminals with a keyboard

167
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,051
is losing money a financial crime?

168
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,678
So what, if you hit a
calculator, what's digital crime?

169
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,176
- Sorry.
- Genius.

170
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:41,403
Gun!

171
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:52,481
The general reconnaissance bureau found
traces of jang myung-jun in Hanoi, Vietnam.

172
00:17:53,332 --> 00:17:55,278
But my head hurts

173
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:59,369
they say they entered south
Korea with fake passports.

174
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,073
Yes?

175
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:01,541
In the past, during the
march of hardship, the

176
00:18:01,553 --> 00:18:03,094
military's foreign currency
earning business was

177
00:18:03,118 --> 00:18:05,334
the military's 915 research
lab produced the bingdu.

178
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:08,647
Didn't the party banned it because it
became a problem both inside and outside?

179
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:12,295
Jang myung-joon,
who tasted this dollar

180
00:18:12,296 --> 00:18:15,136
disappeared with a
billion dollar Swiss account

181
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,512
couldn't that money be enough
to feed the entire republic?

182
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:20,558
Why did you choose South Korea?

183
00:18:20,762 --> 00:18:23,894
Guddy there is a money book in
the south that manages $1 billion

184
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,247
Kim chul-soo, who was in charge
of the 915 lab's bingdu production

185
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:39,911
what if jang myung-joon and Kim
cheol-soo were captured by the us?

186
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,872
Peace agreement or whatever,
the march of suffering begins again

187
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:48,461
the meeting place has been
changed from Singapore to Seoul.

188
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,756
The negotiations with the south
are over, so go down immediately.

189
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,007
A week later, we
have our representative

190
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,489
I went to Seoul

191
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,535
until then, I found the money
book and met jang myung-joon.

192
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,223
Bring all the billions

193
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,856
Sprinkle the rice cakes

194
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:05,653
gather the meat

195
00:20:20,536 --> 00:20:22,559
Capitalism is good, hey

196
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:25,996
oh my, you're alive

197
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:29,186
I was very surprised to
hear that he was arrested.

198
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:35,651
This, boss Joe, you
did not worry about me

199
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:39,457
I also wondered if it was the
fact that my boss was chubby

200
00:20:40,395 --> 00:20:42,144
- could it be?
- Yes.

201
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:43,951
You are the vessel for that

202
00:20:44,434 --> 00:20:45,869
what happened to the money you prepared?

203
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,160
I told you before

204
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:50,374
if you suddenly recover your
investment, you will lose a lot of money.

205
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,209
Take some time to trust me...

206
00:21:12,317 --> 00:21:14,036
Eminai is so pretty, hey

207
00:21:15,215 --> 00:21:18,778
my daughter young-soon
is alive, but it's just this age.

208
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,184
You

209
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,567
have you ever eaten salted
fish salted with human flesh?

210
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:34,911
No taste beluga

211
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,256
don't make something to taste

212
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:41,342
I'll give you 3 days

213
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,669
In red color

214
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:56,333
I'll shade you

215
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:58,122
the mascara is carefully

216
00:21:58,123 --> 00:22:01,387
like this, slowly

217
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:03,772
complete

218
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:06,801
today at the Berlin club, very hip

219
00:22:06,802 --> 00:22:09,614
I took a look at the
original smokey makeup

220
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:10,715
how about it?

221
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:14,442
Min-young's make-over show that
will be appreciated if you follow it

222
00:22:14,926 --> 00:22:16,536
that's all for today

223
00:22:16,537 --> 00:22:19,241
subscribe and like are love

224
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:22,462
why?

225
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:25,606
Hey, how many times
did you call me to eat, huh?

226
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:27,497
- I'm annoyed.
- Hurry up!

227
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,543
- I'm so bored I'm dying.
- Because of you, I have to film again.

228
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,074
What the hell is this?

229
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:33,805
I have to take you, but I'm coming out

230
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,472
can't you see I'm working right now?

231
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,255
Is it your job to paint your face?

232
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:39,022
I sent them to me
because I went to a makeup

233
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:40,956
academy, but I didn't get
a job and what I was doing

234
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:43,112
okay, okay, love what, this...

235
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,442
My sister doesn't know what
to say, but being a youtuber

236
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:49,409
hopefully she can earn
over 100 million a month?

237
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,005
- Really?
- Yes

238
00:22:51,677 --> 00:22:53,895
so? How much did her aunt earn?

239
00:22:55,427 --> 00:22:57,293
- 36,000 won
- a day?

240
00:22:58,004 --> 00:23:00,020
I just got a profit,
got it in a year

241
00:23:00,021 --> 00:23:01,105
- a year?
- Erai

242
00:23:01,106 --> 00:23:02,527
not a month, but a year?

243
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:05,718
36,000 won in 365 days
is about 100 won a day.

244
00:23:06,082 --> 00:23:06,969
Yuna

245
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:09,597
don't be like that,
aunt, call me like this

246
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,395
why are you doing this
to your brother-in-law?

247
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:12,945
How are you?

248
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:14,723
I was also good when I was young

249
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,629
I feel bad, I don't eat

250
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:19,481
uh, don't eat, don't eat

251
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,718
- hey, why are you
doing this again?

252
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:22,605
Let go, you did
well, okay, let this go.

253
00:23:22,606 --> 00:23:23,280
Hey, you don't eat?

254
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,924
Are you going to take
it right away like that?

255
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:25,925
Done

256
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:39,876
Hey, what are you doing
with your toys, at work?

257
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,431
Isn't that a toy?
The world has changed a lot

258
00:23:42,432 --> 00:23:45,341
they also search for missing people
and crack down on traffic violations.

259
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,801
Amman, even if the world changes

260
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:50,862
investigation runs on your feet,
and the detective fills in handcuffs.

261
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,033
Sunbaenim came to the
cyber investigation team.

262
00:23:54,035 --> 00:23:55,979
You're going to get something
like a license right now.

263
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,519
Do you think I'm going to rot here?

264
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,439
I will somehow return to
kwangsudae, wait and see

265
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:03,442
- but is the rumor true?
- What?

266
00:24:03,513 --> 00:24:06,362
I heard you had a big case
with a North Korean detective...

267
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:08,739
- Did you hear me?
- Yes

268
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,907
- you also?
- Yes

269
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:15,569
how can this nigga
have no secrets, I am

270
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,205
really...

271
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,415
There was such a thing
as a super note copper

272
00:24:24,427 --> 00:24:26,979
plate that would destroy
the world economy.

273
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:31,345
The North Korean detective's
name was im cheol-ryeong, who

274
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:35,849
if it's not my brother, I'll follow
you around and rely on you

275
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,229
I'll do it like this

276
00:24:40,464 --> 00:24:43,106
I wish we could take on a
big case like that too, really

277
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,214
if you're a police
officer, at least once...

278
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,611
What's wrong with him?

279
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:48,706
Hey!

280
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:50,526
Uh

281
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,742
What, a cheol-ryeong?
You're lying

282
00:24:54,064 --> 00:24:55,584
really

283
00:24:55,585 --> 00:24:57,329
- really?
- Okay

284
00:24:57,415 --> 00:25:00,972
I'm coming down as a preparation team
for the North Korea-U.S. summit next week.

285
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:01,734
Yes

286
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,586
no, what's the story? It's
probably the same as last time.

287
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,190
No, but he's coming
to catch a drug dealer.

288
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:09,354
- Would the nis believe that?
- By the way?

289
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:11,920
I was trying to select
a detective to partner

290
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:14,104
with lim cheol-ryeong
from among the applicants.

291
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:15,105
Yes

292
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:18,096
no, nobody has any applicants.

293
00:25:18,105 --> 00:25:18,987
Why?

294
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:20,401
Last time, there
was a rumor that my

295
00:25:20,413 --> 00:25:22,146
brother and my family
were all about to die.

296
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,064
- Uh
- everyone is taking care of themselves.

297
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:25,854
So now

298
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,944
is it the same as Seoul national
university law school's underachievement?

299
00:25:28,945 --> 00:25:29,666
Right

300
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,738
as long as you apply, you just pass.

301
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,074
Hey, then why are
you doing this to me?

302
00:25:34,229 --> 00:25:35,743
I have a wedding date set

303
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:36,766
suddenly?

304
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:40,666
- So what about you?
- I'm in 3rd grade.

305
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,517
Hey, the kid is taking the
exam. Are you taking the exam?

306
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,209
So you, you, are you going to stay
in the cybercrime in these uniforms?

307
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,504
- Won't you come back to kwangsudae?
- I have to

308
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:51,080
I'm suddenly worried

309
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:54,011
man, if my wife found
out, she'd do it to kill me.

310
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,181
- What, Mr. Cheol-ryeong?
- That person again?

311
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:59,099
- Why?
- No, what

312
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:01,822
simple, I guess I got a
nigga to catch a nigga

313
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:04,905
did you forget that our family
almost died the last time?

314
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:06,345
- Uh?
- How do I forget that?

315
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:07,906
But why are you talking about it again?

316
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:10,158
Maybe, maybe, again, you...

317
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,195
- Uh?
- It's crazy?

318
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:13,196
What kind of detective
am I in Korea?

319
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,491
But yeah, a human with a
brain would never do that

320
00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:18,659
but who are you
coming to catch this time?

321
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,454
- What...
- Maybe

322
00:26:20,775 --> 00:26:22,253
aren't you coming to catch me?

323
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,893
It must have been harder
than dying, forgetting me

324
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:27,503
are you serious?

325
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,055
Another start, another start

326
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:31,006
cheol-ryeong said that
we would meet again

327
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,263
that's just saying we'll see you when
we're unified as a greeting, that's it

328
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:35,259
no, I can't stand it until then

329
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,259
I can't stand it because of you

330
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,015
no, don't you know that men don't
cover fire when they fall in love?

331
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,476
Live the way you feel comfortable, huh?

332
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,853
- Longevity.
- This is not the time, now.

333
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:48,431
Hey, what, did cheol-ryeong
tell you to meet you, huh?

334
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:52,986
Really...

335
00:26:53,065 --> 00:26:56,338
If you come in contact by any
chance, will you just let it go?

336
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:57,003
Okay okay

337
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:59,367
if you get involved with that person
again, it's just a divorce, divorce.

338
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,787
- Okay? Uh?
- Okay okay

339
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,104
Where's your brother-in-law's
emergency fund?

340
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,220
Where are you?

341
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,120
This is kinda weird...

342
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:44,962
Stay here

343
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:47,526
oh yeah...

344
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,955
Really...

345
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:54,034
Somehow, the air
purifier didn't work at all.

346
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:57,968
Uh, uh, what's up?

347
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:00,512
No I

348
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:03,223
did you ever sneak a peek at that wife?

349
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:06,471
When cheol-ryeong talked
about it, it just jumped and jumped.

350
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:07,635
Uh? That's divorce

351
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,688
no, it's okay to do that, well

352
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:12,581
uh, but that... just make sure

353
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:15,228
are you sure you are responsible
for the return of kwangsudae?

354
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:18,270
No, I have to risk my
life to catch some culprit.

355
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,282
I'm risking my life
to deceive my wife

356
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:22,437
huh, great

357
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,900
- brother-in-law.
- What are you doing here?

358
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:26,141
With cheol-ryeong again?
Are you cheating on your sister?

359
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:27,915
- No, no.
- Great.

360
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,309
- No, no, no...
- Sister, sister!

361
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,310
Huh?

362
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:35,464
Will you give me money?
36 million won?

363
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,006
10 years of YouTube

364
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,091
so how much?

365
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,843
20 years, 30 years?

366
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:43,305
50 years? Then how are you?

367
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:45,265
- 1.8 million won?
- Hey

368
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:48,768
then it's my 1 year
allowance, you want all of it?

369
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:50,145
Sister, UN...

370
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,838
Okay, I'll give you

371
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,191
- then take that and get one more.
- What?

372
00:28:54,192 --> 00:28:56,447
Before you go,
Mr. Cheol-ryeong, let me meet you.

373
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:00,151
Hey, he must have his
own taste, is that up to me?

374
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,956
- Okay, okay, I'll try.
- Okay?

375
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:02,866
I really promised

376
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,674
- okay, instead...
- Okay, uh

377
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:07,151
of course, of course

378
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:17,557
Dazzling, really

379
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,474
is there only a last name
detective in South Korea?

380
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:24,930
Ok I am one

381
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:26,848
oh my, it's been a while

382
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:29,971
uh? No guns?

383
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,323
Cooperation rule 1

384
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,857
the gun is kept by the
South Korean detective.

385
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:39,361
Now you know how to do it

386
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:41,159
hey, there's a second rule

387
00:29:41,424 --> 00:29:44,491
- the use of illegal weapons is prohibited.
- Yes?

388
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:47,926
I mean don't beat people up with a roll
of toilet paper or something like that.

389
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:49,284
Got it

390
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:51,682
I'm so hungry

391
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:53,500
let's go eat first

392
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:55,534
hey, what's going on?

393
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:57,170
He said that we would
do an investigation first.

394
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:00,214
Let's take care of the naked people
with the southern compatriot tax

395
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,295
hey, is that what you look
like naked, you bastard...

396
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,262
How about eel?

397
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:06,825
- Good.
- Okay.

398
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:30,497
Oil flows revolutionary

399
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,708
what do you guys put the
revolution on everywhere?

400
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:35,167
What do you mean by kika?

401
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,628
When I'm emphasizing
something here

402
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,506
I'm adding a ruler to the end of the word

403
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:45,260
like shit, shit

404
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,763
try it once

405
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:49,146
how does oil flow?

406
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,013
Oil is flowing

407
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,105
hey, cheol-ryeong is really good

408
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,504
What is this operation?

409
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:05,864
Well, eavesdropping
or hacking, or...

410
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:08,556
Well, you can pretend
to be investigating

411
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:10,328
- well, just do what you say.
- Investigate.

412
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,953
- Fm boulevard
- yes?

413
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:14,289
I want you to do your research properly.

414
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:17,083
During the investigation, the
information is called cache.

415
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:20,153
Have you come to catch a drug dealer?

416
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,130
Surely there must be a plot

417
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,841
hey

418
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,269
honestly what this time?

419
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,905
Isn't it that jang myung-jun
came to catch a drug dealer?

420
00:31:43,146 --> 00:31:45,278
He ate terribly well

421
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,947
huh? What is he saying now?

422
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,185
I can't hear...
Hey, turn up the volume

423
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:50,186
yes

424
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,876
Shameful, shameful, really

425
00:32:01,372 --> 00:32:02,712
let the investigation begin

426
00:32:03,477 --> 00:32:04,739
why are you in such a hurry?

427
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,536
Hey go slow

428
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:11,278
are you both agents?

429
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:12,512
- No
- yes

430
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:14,599
- no
- yes

431
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:22,435
These tattooed bastards

432
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:25,341
they're probably distributing
new drugs to finance their escape.

433
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:27,739
And again?

434
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:32,032
In addition? Is this all?

435
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,411
I was taught that investigations
are done with the feet.

436
00:32:35,911 --> 00:32:39,458
Man, that's a thing of the past,
these days it's all about forensics

437
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,502
is there any concept of
scientific investigation there?

438
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:45,599
Well, just put all the scientists
together to make missiles.

439
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,161
There is no such thing
as a scientific investigation

440
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,888
The concept could be

441
00:32:56,528 --> 00:32:59,536
what can a castle
like that be pointy?

442
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:03,122
There's a revolutionary way

443
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:04,997
oh, jonggu

444
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,152
yes, there is a picture I sent you.

445
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,028
I need to find someone who deals with it?

446
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,263
Show me a demonstration
of korean forensic science

447
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:13,074
yes, I checked your photo.

448
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,547
Well then!

449
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:28,294
Red pill

450
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,343
- sprinkle some rice cakes.
- Okay.

451
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,918
Senior, let's start
with rice cakes

452
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:41,185
hey, how do you get a bite?

453
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,897
Yes, it can be delivered in
30 minutes by motorcycle?

454
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:46,650
- Send me a photo. Yeah.
- Yeah, I get it.

455
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,153
Yes, I asked you for rice cakes.

456
00:33:50,154 --> 00:33:52,197
Ok, yes

457
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,866
nice

458
00:33:58,332 --> 00:33:59,527
forensic investigation

459
00:34:00,113 --> 00:34:01,882
now, all you have to
do is find a suspicious

460
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:03,833
motorcycle that goes
round and round around you.

461
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,582
Did you know? Come on, fight

462
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:17,457
Uh? There!

463
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,933
Please enlarge

464
00:34:31,902 --> 00:34:35,198
Okay, suspect found. The flower bed
on the West Side of the anguk building.

465
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:36,950
Ok

466
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,288
Hey hey here it is

467
00:34:46,988 --> 00:34:48,043
hey, where are you going?

468
00:34:48,863 --> 00:34:50,547
Hang on with it?
I have to rush over

469
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,381
hey, there's a flying guy
on top of a running nigga

470
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,049
I have a smart guy above him

471
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,803
don't worry, cctv's
watching, huh?

472
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,930
Yes, the suspect is
currently moving south

473
00:35:22,316 --> 00:35:23,691
Worried

474
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,875
worried about getting hurt?

475
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,377
Yeah, I'm afraid those
bastards will get hurt

476
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:31,113
go fast

477
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:33,332
ok

478
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:44,668
Excuse me

479
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:47,312
rumors spread that this
place is a ppong restaurant.

480
00:35:47,433 --> 00:35:49,481
Who is the oldest?

481
00:35:50,168 --> 00:35:51,024
You?

482
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,160
No, fuck, this isn't some
kind of convenience store.

483
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:55,161
What is this, dogs and
cows all come in here, huh?

484
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:57,934
The restaurant is so unfriendly.

485
00:35:57,935 --> 00:36:01,042
Hey, kneel knees, huh?

486
00:36:01,848 --> 00:36:03,022
Hey, get down on your knees

487
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:05,413
hey, kneel, these babies all!

488
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,165
Salty?

489
00:36:08,089 --> 00:36:10,058
This kid this
is your manners bad?

490
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:12,544
How to put it to the face
it's salty, isn't it?

491
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,613
Heck, a little bit

492
00:36:13,614 --> 00:36:16,216
oops, true
got something to suck on, really

493
00:36:17,238 --> 00:36:18,426
stay still, dear...

494
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,929
- Are you and your daughter here?
- If you do not comply with the arrest

495
00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:23,597
exercise the right to self-defense

496
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,474
what are you talking about, what is this?

497
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,476
Hey, I'm asking because
I'm worried about hyung.

498
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:29,417
Do you have your actual expenses insurance?

499
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:33,472
What kind of bullshit
are you talking about?

500
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:36,930
- Dude.
- Yes.

501
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:39,864
I've been hiding a lot

502
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,199
where are you?
Better to just go, eh?

503
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Go in

504
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:44,619
go, go, go

505
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,604
go, you bastard, go, huh?

506
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,081
What? This bastard, this

507
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:50,128
hey, hey, hey, what tongue, go

508
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,586
this baby, I caught, this

509
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:56,988
hit it!

510
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,628
Hey, you bastard!

511
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:36,307
Ugh, look at these bastards, this?

512
00:37:36,308 --> 00:37:39,152
Cheoryeong-ah, the ban on the
use of weapons is lifted for 5 minutes

513
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:40,636
one minute is enough

514
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:41,926
okay?

515
00:38:30,387 --> 00:38:31,387
Hey

516
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,464
hang on, you bastard

517
00:38:33,465 --> 00:38:35,104
yeah I'm salty, nigga

518
00:38:35,886 --> 00:38:37,160
got a kid

519
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,332
the baby is all caught up

520
00:38:40,615 --> 00:38:42,127
where did you get this medicine?

521
00:38:42,128 --> 00:38:45,615
It's the first time I've seen them,
so I left them to open a deal.

522
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,847
Did you talk like a korean-Chinese?

523
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,376
They say it looks
like it needs a power

524
00:38:49,388 --> 00:38:50,994
supply, so they just
spray it at a cheap price.

525
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,792
What is this, a mart event?

526
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:55,752
You said you should try the
mulberry and threw it away?

527
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:57,417
Eh, ing, me too

528
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,276
they told me to wash my
hands after handling this sample.

529
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:02,066
You need to brush your tongue properly.

530
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:05,785
What is this

531
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:08,888
hey, this is an aggravated
punishment for the rest of my life.

532
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,050
I'll live until I poop
out of the bread?

533
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,745
You don't have to prepare for old age

534
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:13,851
- brothers!
- Yes?

535
00:39:14,038 --> 00:39:16,672
What are you going to do in
this alley business area like me?

536
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:19,147
I will cooperate so
that I can catch them

537
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,525
only once
please forgive me just once, really

538
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,986
how will you cooperate?

539
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:26,764
After a while, those bastards over this way
I'm coming to get money

540
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:27,765
when?

541
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:33,983
Right?

542
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,155
Uh, are you here?

543
00:39:54,585 --> 00:39:55,560
How...

544
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:58,453
We got the stuff
as promised, huh?

545
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,101
Why is your top like that?

546
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,960
This?

547
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,285
Korean police, don't move!

548
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:17,030
Rim cheol-ryeong?
How are you here?

549
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,654
Did you die then?

550
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:19,959
Where is jang myung-jun?

551
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:23,769
Hey Mr.

552
00:40:57,257 --> 00:40:59,624
Uh, jonggu, there
was a crash here.

553
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:00,991
Send an ambulance

554
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:21,419
What did you say?

555
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:22,856
I have a concussion

556
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:25,641
you're only waking up tomorrow
morning because of the tranquilizer?

557
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:28,364
Mr. Cheol-ryeong lim

558
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,698
no, how long have you been here?

559
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:34,033
What are you robocop, huh?

560
00:41:34,072 --> 00:41:36,452
Then what, the culprit is a
rabbit right in front of you?

561
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:38,457
Where are you talking to your boss?

562
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,998
You can't, come with me

563
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,291
- what?
- Follow!

564
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:43,677
Why?

565
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:47,546
No, because cheoryeong is
difficult to control, so that's about it.

566
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,083
I know, I know, I know, I know

567
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,176
good job, good job

568
00:41:53,419 --> 00:41:54,581
yes, huh?

569
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:57,098
You caught the guy on
the red wanted for Interpol.

570
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,934
Is that all?
Only 3kg of drugs confiscated

571
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,095
our team has completed one
year's worth of performance.

572
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:03,191
Okay?

573
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:06,325
Something smells fishy.

574
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,784
What did you find out
from lim cheol-ryung?

575
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:11,528
Let's watch the viewer's
report video together

576
00:42:11,848 --> 00:42:14,157
- the 17-to-one fight that I only
heard of in words - hey, hey, hey, hey

577
00:42:14,158 --> 00:42:15,532
- in the middle of downtown
Seoul - hey, min young-ah

578
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,279
- it happened.
- Isn't that cheol spirit?

579
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,676
Look, there's cheol-ryeong

580
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:20,003
cheol-ryeong, iron, cheol-ryeong!

581
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:23,285
As soon as it arrives,
it's just churning around.

582
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:24,630
How are people here?

583
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:26,457
No, how is it the same as last time?

584
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:27,598
Equally cool

585
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:32,008
hey, I got it and told him not
to mess with lim cheol-ryeong.

586
00:42:32,496 --> 00:42:34,092
This time again, what
kind of detective will go

587
00:42:34,104 --> 00:42:35,746
through hardship instead
of your brother-in-law?

588
00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:37,388
Iron spirit!

589
00:42:38,637 --> 00:42:39,590
For a moment

590
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,950
police find the suspect...

591
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:42,450
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

592
00:42:42,451 --> 00:42:44,692
that human again!

593
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:52,247
Cheol-ryeong secretly brought it
with a Cannon phone and a passport.

594
00:42:53,457 --> 00:42:54,946
Hey, hey, good job, good job

595
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,614
I will analyze this

596
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,082
like last time,
cheol-ryeong takes you home

597
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,450
- Bob is Meg, alcohol is Meg.
- Are you crazy?

598
00:43:01,637 --> 00:43:03,414
Do you want to
see your wife die?

599
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,699
- Dad, answer the phone.
- What?

600
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:08,270
- Don't pretend to be busy, take it.
- Hey

601
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:10,786
daddy, answer the phone

602
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,174
- uh, honey, why?
- Hey, are you going to die?

603
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:15,137
Come rush home with lim cheol-ryeong!

604
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:17,220
I don't know where the iron spirit is

605
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:21,661
did you forget that my family almost died?

606
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:23,770
But why do you come again, huh?

607
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:25,937
No, I'm not here

608
00:43:26,238 --> 00:43:28,472
I said I didn't like
it, but cheol-ryeong

609
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:30,684
if it's my brother, I can't,
I can't, I can't, I have...

610
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:32,360
Yes? When I...

611
00:43:33,387 --> 00:43:34,387
Sister

612
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:36,906
it was Mr. Cheol-ryeong who
saved that near-death thing.

613
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:38,184
Yes mom

614
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:40,770
even if I bow down to the
life saver, it's not enough

615
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:42,325
- it's starting again.
- It's been a while.

616
00:43:42,326 --> 00:43:44,455
Hey, it's not like this

617
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:48,333
no, this time it's just a deal
to catch a few drug lords

618
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,544
it's not like I just fired a gun
like last time, so don't worry

619
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,001
that’s right, cheol-ryeong, huh?

620
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:53,089
Guilty

621
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,114
- sister
- mom

622
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:57,239
Mr. Cheol-ryeong

623
00:43:57,928 --> 00:44:00,638
our house here
is really nice, right?

624
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:03,224
Yes, that's great

625
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:06,476
but even if it looks like mine,
it's not ours, neither is the car.

626
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,489
The house I live in is not mine

627
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,731
everything belongs to the party.

628
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:12,583
Uh, right

629
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:15,778
it's similar, but it's all
about debt, it's all about debt

630
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:18,371
so, until we pay off this debt,
my father and I have to stay alive.

631
00:44:18,372 --> 00:44:20,324
No, what am I, a
money making machine?

632
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,052
Machines make good money

633
00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:23,327
really...

634
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:31,168
Anyway, a man's face should look
so handsome like cheol-ryeong again.

635
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:36,153
What's so good about
a face like mine...

636
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:38,843
Ji's face is said to be a common face

637
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:41,345
hey, if you have
a common face, I...

638
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,014
Aww, really...

639
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:45,286
Ji's face is said to be a common face

640
00:44:45,287 --> 00:44:46,403
does not make sense...

641
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:48,137
Sit up straight

642
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:55,802
Noisy, wash quickly and eat rice

643
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,200
okay

644
00:44:57,481 --> 00:45:00,156
what to eat at the great wall?
Huh?

645
00:45:16,895 --> 00:45:18,704
And make me a sinner too?

646
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:20,059
Hey, sorry

647
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:23,012
how much would you
have missed the scene?

648
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:24,931
Amman is like that too.

649
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,489
By precisely separating
the public and private...

650
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,017
Yeah, I can't separate his
public and private affairs

651
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:32,644
I threw the super note copper plate into
the sea, so I couldn't get a promotion.

652
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:34,273
- It's like this...
- It's not even an ethmoid bone.

653
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:35,566
How many times do you boil it?

654
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:39,606
So, hyung, give me a
promotion once in a while, please.

655
00:45:39,856 --> 00:45:42,817
Hey, let's be honest
with each other for once

656
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:44,223
myung-jun jang

657
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:47,684
what is that baby, do you hit
the red wanted at the Interpol?

658
00:45:54,364 --> 00:45:57,295
He was smuggling bingdu to
and from the Korea-China border.

659
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,856
As his crackdown intensified, he
moved his base to North America.

660
00:45:59,927 --> 00:46:01,598
A new type of bingdu
that is highly addictive

661
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,969
he's a bad guy who
made and sold in bulk.

662
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,470
New bingdu?

663
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,627
It is characterized in that
it can be mass-produced

664
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,432
with easily available
chemical substances.

665
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,466
But for what purpose
did we come to Korea?

666
00:46:12,467 --> 00:46:14,543
I want to run away,
but there are more

667
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:18,207
- that's...
- That's it?

668
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,569
I wonder too

669
00:46:22,677 --> 00:46:25,567
did you have any clues
from that guy earlier?

670
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:28,073
Well, a cell phone or something,
your belongings or something.

671
00:46:28,097 --> 00:46:29,465
There was no

672
00:46:31,692 --> 00:46:34,231
hey, I'll buy you
that beer, yeah

673
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:35,354
no beer

674
00:46:35,355 --> 00:46:38,525
I'm going to buy you a beer,
so grab a bite to eat, huh?

675
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:42,934
Gwangyong was caught by the police

676
00:46:43,356 --> 00:46:44,301
but why?

677
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,012
Rim cheol-ryeong was with me

678
00:46:46,919 --> 00:46:48,184
rim cheol-ryeong?

679
00:46:55,129 --> 00:46:57,982
It's going to be shit
in the republic, hey

680
00:46:58,317 --> 00:46:59,317
bread

681
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:14,989
This isn't it

682
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,536
what do you mean?

683
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,549
Out of site out of mind

684
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,677
I just made up my mind, but
if it shows up like this again...

685
00:47:30,504 --> 00:47:32,504
You're here because of
me. Is work an excuse?

686
00:47:33,411 --> 00:47:35,728
No, I'm really here for work.

687
00:47:35,833 --> 00:47:36,880
Lie

688
00:47:39,825 --> 00:47:40,825
yes?

689
00:47:44,887 --> 00:47:46,848
But why can't you
look into my eyes?

690
00:47:47,723 --> 00:47:50,302
I'm sorry about that

691
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,953
- what?
- Don't you know?

692
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,581
It's not realistic

693
00:47:56,926 --> 00:47:59,809
no, why does Mr. Cheol-ryeong
decide that, yes?

694
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:02,177
Why give up before you even try?

695
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:10,889
Gikamun...

696
00:48:11,436 --> 00:48:13,975
Comrade min young, try to
unify the north and the south.

697
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:16,936
Kiritamunya, did you
have any problems?

698
00:48:21,279 --> 00:48:22,928
How do I unify?

699
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:28,154
Really...

700
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:36,038
How to unify...

701
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,967
It seems that jang
myung-joon farts in america.

702
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:45,798
No, why did he have
to come to Korea?

703
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:46,913
Well, are you curious?

704
00:48:47,147 --> 00:48:49,358
Who am I I also asked

705
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:50,428
what is iron spirit?

706
00:48:50,796 --> 00:48:52,139
I'm curious about the map

707
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:55,098
no, I have to figure
it out, this frustrating

708
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,263
hey, what kind of vending
machine do I press and it comes out?

709
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:58,998
Wait a minute

710
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:06,225
Wait a minute

711
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:16,078
It's a surprise

712
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:17,913
did you notice

713
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,256
I haven't eaten anything...

714
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:29,925
It's done, it's done, but why

715
00:49:30,272 --> 00:49:31,719
I mean a suit

716
00:49:31,782 --> 00:49:34,263
isn't that bastard a rip off?

717
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:36,807
No, the little bastard

718
00:49:36,885 --> 00:49:40,227
tap me on the shoulder
what, good, good?

719
00:49:41,053 --> 00:49:42,521
I swear by it...

720
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:44,648
I think someone put it in with a parachute.

721
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,639
There was that super note last time, he
said he drank water because he missed it

722
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,920
no, did I?

723
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:51,608
No, because jiji looks
like a head, he drank water.

724
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,824
I thought it was a water-drinking hippo

725
00:49:54,216 --> 00:49:57,530
- uh, hang up, hang up, okay, uh
- yeah, yeah, get in

726
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:01,999
unless it's the wiretapping, I'm not alone

727
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:03,639
yes

728
00:50:06,816 --> 00:50:09,092
- hey, wake up.
- What are you talking about?

729
00:50:09,553 --> 00:50:11,381
Why, huh?

730
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:12,625
- Wake up.
- No, why?

731
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:14,264
- I don't know.
- What's wrong with min-young?

732
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:15,833
- Calm down, girl.
- No, I just

733
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:17,999
you say patriotism
with your face and face.

734
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:19,052
Did you drink this?

735
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:22,478
Does this mean I have
to go to unification?

736
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,639
It's time to do it once

737
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,441
I'm really like him.
What should I do, really?

738
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,467
- It's a habit, it's a habit.

739
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:32,108
Yes let's go

740
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,571
- yuna's mom, don't worry about it, don't
worry about it - hey, it's embarrassing

741
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,737
I can't live, really

742
00:50:34,795 --> 00:50:36,325
honey, call the cops, cops

743
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:38,708
well, I'm a cop,
so I can take you.

744
00:50:49,991 --> 00:50:52,022
No, why is pork belly in the morning?

745
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:54,671
What is illegal to eat in the morning?

746
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,929
Hey, with what money?

747
00:50:57,695 --> 00:50:59,135
Did you give him pocket money again?

748
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,092
I don't even want to die

749
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:05,257
cheol-ryeong, I cooked this
deliciously, so please eat a lot.

750
00:51:05,258 --> 00:51:07,358
Originally, Koreans are rice-shim.

751
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:08,780
- No work.
- No, fast.

752
00:51:08,788 --> 00:51:10,826
- Why are you so embarrassed?
- Try it first.

753
00:51:10,827 --> 00:51:11,866
Money should run out

754
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:13,365
- I'd go out and beg.
- It's delicious, right?

755
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:16,257
I'm making money. What's
wrong with being a youtuber?

756
00:51:16,381 --> 00:51:17,533
Mom

757
00:51:18,944 --> 00:51:19,535
uh, eat

758
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:21,829
didn't you see the
piggy bank on my desk?

759
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:24,498
- Look for it.
- I can't find it.

760
00:51:25,084 --> 00:51:28,835
I mean, I worked really
hard to buy the bts album.

761
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,163
Bulletproof boy scouts?

762
00:51:31,163 --> 00:51:32,999
There's something wrong
with South Korea, hey

763
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,663
my uncle is also from the chosun boys.

764
00:51:40,147 --> 00:51:41,757
It's been fun, huh?

765
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:42,971
Where did you go?

766
00:51:42,972 --> 00:51:44,686
Hey you look good

767
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,312
that thief bitch, me, hey

768
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:49,939
I, hey, you thought I was you

769
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,479
- it's just noisy in the morning
- hey, you're doing it now.

770
00:51:51,481 --> 00:51:52,312
- In front of cheol-ryeong
- my nephew's money?

771
00:51:52,314 --> 00:51:53,036
What?

772
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:53,777
- Do not come!
- Anyway, really.

773
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,754
- Open the door quickly.
- Just jingle.

774
00:51:54,755 --> 00:51:56,237
- What if I say that to Mr. Cheol-ryeong?
- Just like people who don't exist...

775
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,676
Open the door, hurry up

776
00:51:58,179 --> 00:51:59,083
- hey, open it.
- What's up, since morning?

777
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,090
Yes yes

778
00:52:00,372 --> 00:52:02,311
- get out.
- Uh, okay, yeah

779
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,061
hey, Kim kwang-yong is awake.

780
00:52:04,576 --> 00:52:05,576
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

781
00:52:06,472 --> 00:52:07,475
No no

782
00:52:07,477 --> 00:52:08,978
- why do you always say things to me?
- I don't have time to eat.

783
00:52:08,979 --> 00:52:10,502
I don't have time to eat

784
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:15,632
did I say no?

785
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,662
- Are you the culprit?
- Let's hurry

786
00:52:17,826 --> 00:52:18,927
come out quickly!

787
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,391
Yes, thank you. Let's go in.

788
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:26,654
I'm under investigation
now, so go back.

789
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:27,436
What are you talking about?

790
00:52:27,437 --> 00:52:30,007
Now it's under our foreign affairs
team, so detective kang is out of the way.

791
00:52:30,031 --> 00:52:31,179
No, what...

792
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:33,240
I'm talking nonsense

793
00:52:34,057 --> 00:52:35,623
hey, who are you?

794
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:37,905
Yes?

795
00:52:38,046 --> 00:52:39,156
Yes ok...

796
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:41,241
Do you know someone

797
00:52:45,444 --> 00:52:47,850
this one is mine now

798
00:52:48,694 --> 00:52:50,171
kanna

799
00:52:50,976 --> 00:52:53,147
knowing how to speak korean
did you deceive me?

800
00:52:53,342 --> 00:52:54,663
When did you ask

801
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:56,647
didn't you ask?

802
00:52:58,913 --> 00:53:00,302
Put away the pieces of paper

803
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:02,471
because I caught it
I went to interrogation

804
00:53:04,124 --> 00:53:05,124
this...

805
00:53:06,092 --> 00:53:07,768
Is it a situation you've seen a lot?

806
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:10,020
Who is it that I missed
jang myung-jun?

807
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:12,005
Wow, are you following me all the
way here and making a mess of dogs?

808
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:13,029
Because of me?

809
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:19,947
Did I tell you?

810
00:53:20,373 --> 00:53:22,657
How can you trust a North Korean
who secretly makes nuclear bombs?

811
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,147
You guys come with nuclear
weapons, are you saying we can't?

812
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:28,951
Yes

813
00:53:29,842 --> 00:53:31,780
can't figure out anything

814
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:33,788
took all my fortune

815
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:36,810
hey, you don't have a fortune, you
say your house belongs to the party

816
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:37,858
- castle!
- Hey

817
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:41,051
I don't know what's going
on now, put it all down

818
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,819
come on, come on, let's talk

819
00:53:44,015 --> 00:53:45,681
hey, hello, hello exuse me

820
00:53:45,873 --> 00:53:47,599
nice to meet you
I'm korean, the...

821
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,350
Detective

822
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:51,710
nice to meet you

823
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:55,816
- uh? - Are you ant-man?

824
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:57,651
Autumn, high temperature

825
00:53:58,099 --> 00:53:59,645
am I ant-man?

826
00:54:00,146 --> 00:54:02,986
I'm just trying to offend you in the
first place. When have you seen me?

827
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,921
You, what, what...

828
00:54:05,187 --> 00:54:07,576
Wendy you...
Wow Wendy you Mr...

829
00:54:08,038 --> 00:54:09,038
Under...

830
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,895
I'm prestrading

831
00:54:10,896 --> 00:54:12,615
Jin tae ya, Jin tae ya

832
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,418
control your load properly!

833
00:54:14,426 --> 00:54:15,795
Sorry, sorry

834
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,655
come on, detective
kang, let's get out.

835
00:54:18,795 --> 00:54:20,356
- You know, anyone you know?
- Hurry up

836
00:54:20,413 --> 00:54:21,504
lim cheol-ryeong, come quickly!

837
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:22,528
See me at once

838
00:54:59,858 --> 00:55:02,624
How do you stop the
FBI from attacking?

839
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:04,510
Even the FBI...

840
00:55:06,116 --> 00:55:07,553
Seeing this happen

841
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,350
I'm sure there's something
more to it than a super note.

842
00:55:10,608 --> 00:55:12,599
We have to find out what it is.

843
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,631
Gotta have some clues,
whatever, I'll figure it out

844
00:55:16,122 --> 00:55:18,206
what did you find out of
the confiscated belongings?

845
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,507
Phone is being restored

846
00:55:20,545 --> 00:55:22,420
I checked my passport.

847
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:25,248
A technician who can
perfectly forge that hologram

848
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:27,115
well, there aren't many in the world.

849
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,928
See the perfect hologram?

850
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:32,530
Only me in Asia can make this

851
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:33,497
sergey!

852
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:35,958
- Yeah, sergey.
- Sergey.

853
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:39,670
I heard that he sold his passport
and Cannon phone to jang myung-jun.

854
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:40,963
- Yes.
- Yes.

855
00:55:55,796 --> 00:55:56,796
Hey

856
00:55:57,244 --> 00:55:58,438
who are we

857
00:55:59,947 --> 00:56:02,197
even when barbarians
attack, we'll stick together

858
00:56:02,198 --> 00:56:04,775
you are the korean people who
overcame the national crisis, but

859
00:56:04,776 --> 00:56:07,656
you can't be beaten by
an FBI bastard, can you?

860
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:10,033
What are you hiding from hyung?

861
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:11,243
Huh?

862
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:16,707
I think jang myung-jun brought
a technician and produced drugs.

863
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,087
Technician?

864
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:22,129
No, but why are you
talking about it now?

865
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,089
It's just a guess

866
00:56:25,205 --> 00:56:26,967
so many drugs
to give you a taste

867
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:28,962
can't it be smuggled in easily?

868
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:30,978
Right

869
00:56:31,399 --> 00:56:33,298
if you set up that drug factory

870
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,439
so how many raw materials?

871
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:39,650
Senior, there was a chemical
theft case a week ago.

872
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:40,651
Give me

873
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,482
hey, what is benzylcyanide?

874
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:44,294
Yes, this is the original
cosmetic ingredient.

875
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:44,859
Yeah

876
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,720
it can also be synthesized with heroin.

877
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:49,299
Security guard dies of
cervical spine fracture

878
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:51,240
bastards do it

879
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,409
a stolen truck

880
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,870
the last trace I left was
the yongin ic that morning.

881
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:55,760
- Yongin?
- Yes

882
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:57,414
produce drugs in large quantities

883
00:56:57,596 --> 00:56:59,885
the poisonous gas and stench
would come out tremendously.

884
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,084
Hey jonggu

885
00:57:02,103 --> 00:57:03,628
abandoned factories
or warehouses that are a

886
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,212
bit far from private
houses, please list them

887
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,674
- yes.
- We're going to yongin.

888
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:08,510
Hey hey hey

889
00:57:08,712 --> 00:57:10,525
what do you and your daughter do together?

890
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:12,930
- Hey, oduk-ah.
- Yes.

891
00:57:12,932 --> 00:57:14,765
You take it and
chase it fast, fast

892
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:16,056
yes

893
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:22,105
Cooperate

894
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:24,107
you can't see your family anymore

895
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:27,903
like a family to meet

896
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:30,385
no

897
00:58:00,642 --> 00:58:03,722
Yes, sunbaenim, I've been guessing,
but there are about 300 suspicious places?

898
00:58:03,931 --> 00:58:05,190
Too many?

899
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:08,213
Let's select only places that are more
than 500m away from private houses

900
00:58:08,237 --> 00:58:09,494
yes, guess

901
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,588
Passed

902
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:49,089
I'll fall for you before I notice

903
00:59:59,628 --> 01:00:02,277
I'll keep chasing
the eagle here.

904
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,410
What, the FBI called?

905
01:00:19,434 --> 01:00:20,645
Uh ok

906
01:00:21,152 --> 01:00:22,152
yes

907
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:25,580
I saw what the nerd found
out. What about all your fortune?

908
01:00:25,777 --> 01:00:27,707
- Sung.
- Uh, can you see something?

909
01:00:27,777 --> 01:00:29,954
The drone's battery is
dead. It's time for work.

910
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:31,082
Shall we withdraw?

911
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:32,457
Hey oduk-ah

912
01:00:32,874 --> 01:00:34,421
- man, just float it.
- Yeah.

913
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,715
Battery excuses

914
01:00:35,848 --> 01:00:36,848
wait a minute

915
01:00:37,246 --> 01:00:38,927
- it wasn't a stolen truck.
- Huh?

916
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,124
Hey, hey, a little closer,
a little closer, a little more

917
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,125
yes

918
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:43,351
hey

919
01:00:43,966 --> 01:00:46,184
let's go first before the
sun goes down, okay?

920
01:00:55,202 --> 01:00:56,382
Are you sure?

921
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:01,663
Hey, rule 1 should be
lifted for a while, take it

922
01:01:02,695 --> 01:01:03,906
- and oh deok-ah - yes

923
01:01:04,248 --> 01:01:05,619
you are waiting here

924
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,581
it's been 10 minutes and
we still don't show up, right?

925
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:08,790
Shall I go to work?

926
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:11,936
-You have to request support, this baby
-yes

927
01:01:13,522 --> 01:01:14,522
let's go

928
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:37,891
No, the ambulance is here...

929
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:44,079
Chief comrade!

930
01:02:27,305 --> 01:02:28,383
Let's go

931
01:02:35,494 --> 01:02:38,017
Is hospital food sweet?

932
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:40,267
Comrade captain, you have escaped

933
01:02:40,268 --> 01:02:41,299
where are you?

934
01:02:41,602 --> 01:02:44,462
Our comrade Kim kwang-yong
why is his tail so long?

935
01:02:47,009 --> 01:02:50,087
We leave no prisoners
behind, you know?

936
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:52,435
Do the dishes neatly

937
01:02:53,165 --> 01:02:56,033
I've been through a lot

938
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:04,243
Hey, hey, hey! Bomb boom!

939
01:03:04,244 --> 01:03:05,638
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

940
01:03:06,419 --> 01:03:07,266
Boom!

941
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,119
It was an honor to meet you

942
01:03:11,213 --> 01:03:12,869
I executed the order

943
01:04:16,589 --> 01:04:17,682
It's okay?

944
01:04:31,956 --> 01:04:33,244
Is it all my fault?

945
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:35,591
You get hit over and over
again because you're stupid.

946
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:38,274
What are you doing?
Hey, what are you doing!

947
01:04:39,206 --> 01:04:41,001
Hey, why, huh?

948
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:43,487
Hey, the bomb exploded
and there was a riot in the yard

949
01:04:43,488 --> 01:04:45,840
what are you doing
in other countries?

950
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:47,378
Can't you see that?

951
01:04:51,932 --> 01:04:53,143
Hey follow me

952
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,628
follow!

953
01:05:03,081 --> 01:05:04,425
Hey, disinfect

954
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:12,659
Cheol-ryeong, listen carefully.

955
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:15,010
Jack is so damn
listenable and carefree

956
01:05:15,354 --> 01:05:17,455
it's an emergency, now, but

957
01:05:17,682 --> 01:05:18,887
north and South America

958
01:05:18,888 --> 01:05:21,459
what are the best
detectives doing right now?

959
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:22,885
Huh?

960
01:05:23,362 --> 01:05:26,339
Man, in a way this
might sound funny

961
01:05:27,128 --> 01:05:28,925
we are the avengers

962
01:05:29,393 --> 01:05:32,429
now Thanos is about
to snap his fingers.

963
01:05:32,572 --> 01:05:34,638
Iron man and captain america

964
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,975
can I fight like this
just because I'm good?

965
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:39,727
A little bit of pride

966
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:43,042
let's work together
internationally!

967
01:05:43,245 --> 01:05:45,445
If there is any hidden
information, it will be exposed.

968
01:05:45,728 --> 01:05:46,932
I'll forgive you all

969
01:05:46,933 --> 01:05:48,570
you don't know anything

970
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:52,589
hey Jack

971
01:05:53,323 --> 01:05:56,327
you're all hospitalized. Who
do you want to work with?

972
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:57,537
And the iron spirit

973
01:05:57,685 --> 01:05:59,667
you, too, flew all the clues

974
01:05:59,932 --> 01:06:02,500
what the hell is this jang myung-joon?

975
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:12,346
What?

976
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:18,182
Do you two know each other?

977
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:19,800
Are you a liar?

978
01:06:22,839 --> 01:06:25,479
I used to be a respected
senior, but not now.

979
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:27,859
He is from an African guerrilla unit.

980
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:30,776
All subordinates are mercenaries

981
01:06:32,432 --> 01:06:33,495
you must I

982
01:06:33,496 --> 01:06:36,003
hey, let's talk
about it right now

983
01:06:36,004 --> 01:06:37,877
- are you talking about this?
- No, that...

984
01:06:38,236 --> 01:06:39,930
Forgive me all.

985
01:06:42,947 --> 01:06:44,250
Ok ok, ok

986
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:47,284
then why did you call the mercenaries?

987
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:50,986
Money?

988
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:52,416
Two months ago

989
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:55,512
I got an email with
the ID Adolf bohrman.

990
01:06:55,706 --> 01:06:57,805
So he was able to catch jang myung-jun

991
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:00,600
but I am Adolf bohrmann

992
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:03,019
I think it's
korean-American Michael Jo

993
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:04,300
Michael Joe...

994
01:07:06,323 --> 01:07:07,323
Money laundering?

995
01:07:08,213 --> 01:07:11,945
Then the fact that Michael
Cho betrayed myung-jun jang

996
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:15,409
that guy gulps jang myung-joon's money?

997
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:17,714
So myung-jun jang is
looking for the money.

998
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:19,685
Did he summon mercenaries?

999
01:07:19,826 --> 01:07:20,828
Bingo

1000
01:07:21,206 --> 01:07:23,128
why did you choose South Korea?

1001
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:24,138
Why did you go

1002
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:27,115
guddy there is a money book in
the south that manages $1 billion

1003
01:07:27,116 --> 01:07:28,873
how the hell is that money?

1004
01:07:29,529 --> 01:07:31,005
Money isn't important

1005
01:07:31,226 --> 01:07:33,449
we need to stop it before
it causes a bigger accident.

1006
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:35,412
'Cause there's no clue

1007
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:42,392
I'll talk about one too.

1008
01:07:43,513 --> 01:07:46,919
Actually, I have a Cannon phone
confiscated by Kim kwang-yong.

1009
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,565
- That...
- Listen first.

1010
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,435
I know the guy who
distributed it, sergey

1011
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:53,860
Sergei, if you catch the bastard

1012
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,822
find out jang myung-joon's number

1013
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:58,115
that you can track
myung-jun jang.

1014
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,193
- You know what I'm talking about, huh?
- Yep

1015
01:08:00,646 --> 01:08:01,872
ok, ok

1016
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:03,333
one cup each

1017
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:08,710
now, if we drink this,
we will cooperate.

1018
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:10,378
- Got it.
- Okay.

1019
01:08:14,037 --> 01:08:15,383
So good

1020
01:08:19,677 --> 01:08:21,681
I'll tell you about the old days

1021
01:08:24,419 --> 01:08:26,978
was there a drama on TV
called investigation chief?

1022
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:31,691
The person who appears as the class leader
there is a person named bul-am choi, huh?

1023
01:08:32,435 --> 01:08:36,270
Just wear a barbarian
coat and smoke a cigarette

1024
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:40,832
you were so cool, huh?

1025
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:46,435
But at that time, I
just looked very old.

1026
01:08:47,419 --> 01:08:50,973
All of a sudden
I'm that old, savage

1027
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:53,516
jintae, jintae, stop drinking.

1028
01:08:53,598 --> 01:08:56,382
What does jintae mean to you?

1029
01:08:56,383 --> 01:08:58,051
I have to say respect, that...

1030
01:08:58,693 --> 01:09:00,010
Castle try it, castle

1031
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,638
I don't know about respect

1032
01:09:01,754 --> 01:09:03,234
there is no such thing as a foreigner

1033
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:04,372
all friends

1034
01:09:04,785 --> 01:09:05,785
uh?

1035
01:09:07,193 --> 01:09:08,193
Wait a minute

1036
01:09:09,802 --> 01:09:11,068
how old are you

1037
01:09:12,146 --> 01:09:13,691
uh? I am 82

1038
01:09:14,122 --> 01:09:15,162
fast 82

1039
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:20,823
Hardy the American way, what

1040
01:09:22,005 --> 01:09:24,202
hey, am I your brother?

1041
01:09:25,544 --> 01:09:27,330
Do you think the
previous one is better?

1042
01:09:27,404 --> 01:09:28,419
Okay?

1043
01:09:30,091 --> 01:09:32,129
- Hey, do you like cheol-ryeong that much?
- Uh

1044
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:35,380
I just saw cheol-ryeong
in a slow video like this

1045
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:37,824
was your sister like that when
you first saw your brother-in-law?

1046
01:09:37,848 --> 01:09:39,592
I don't know, I don't even remember

1047
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,325
dad said he was all
over the house now

1048
01:09:41,326 --> 01:09:42,326
what?

1049
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:44,317
No no no no no no no no

1050
01:09:44,318 --> 01:09:45,583
- no, no, no now.
- Did you come quickly?

1051
01:09:45,584 --> 01:09:46,724
Here, can you tidy up here?

1052
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:47,872
- No.
- Really...

1053
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:50,927
Take this and follow me

1054
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,942
No, what is it doing?

1055
01:10:02,292 --> 01:10:03,333
Why?

1056
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:07,981
I heard it backwards,
it should be like this

1057
01:10:07,982 --> 01:10:09,329
- okay, hurry up, go fast.
- Fight.

1058
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,373
- Go fast.
- Fight.

1059
01:10:26,294 --> 01:10:28,091
Cheol-ryeong, are you hurt, where are you?

1060
01:10:28,364 --> 01:10:29,392
No work

1061
01:10:29,794 --> 01:10:31,269
come and sit here

1062
01:10:35,427 --> 01:10:36,576
look where

1063
01:10:57,408 --> 01:10:58,557
How r u?

1064
01:10:58,924 --> 01:11:00,923
Fine, thanks and you?

1065
01:11:01,142 --> 01:11:02,341
Bare Dan now

1066
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:04,251
honey, why is your
face curly again?

1067
01:11:04,253 --> 01:11:06,472
We had volunteer
work as a group today.

1068
01:11:07,046 --> 01:11:09,015
This is Jack

1069
01:11:09,016 --> 01:11:11,829
it's the FBI, the FBI uh, uh

1070
01:11:11,955 --> 01:11:13,239
my wife

1071
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,188
- daughter, sister
- nice to meet you

1072
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:17,650
- hi, nice to meet you

1073
01:11:18,618 --> 01:11:21,535
you speak korean very well

1074
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:26,408
I heard that there are
many beauties in Korea.

1075
01:11:27,213 --> 01:11:28,236
It's true

1076
01:11:29,627 --> 01:11:30,369
look at this

1077
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,587
I said no respect and
where did Jill wink?

1078
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,817
- Yes
- but a little

1079
01:11:33,818 --> 01:11:35,641
- I think you should wash.
- That's right.

1080
01:11:35,978 --> 01:11:37,181
Daddy's clothes, daddy's clothes

1081
01:11:37,182 --> 01:11:38,478
- guess I'll have to
give you a big one.

1082
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:39,564
- Showers, showers
- yeah, once upon a time

1083
01:11:39,565 --> 01:11:41,634
I should change into the
clothes my father wore.

1084
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:42,923
- Toilet, toilet
- ok

1085
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,884
- sister, I, I'll take it.
- Mom, I'll look for dad's clothes.

1086
01:11:44,885 --> 01:11:46,743
- Honey.
- No, I threw it all away.

1087
01:11:46,744 --> 01:11:47,900
Where did you put it?

1088
01:11:47,901 --> 01:11:49,618
- Shower.
- I didn't throw it away.

1089
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:50,923
Where are you, honey

1090
01:11:50,924 --> 01:11:52,600
honey, you know that
stripe like this on a tee

1091
01:11:52,601 --> 01:11:54,601
didn't you see that line going in?

1092
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:56,517
Okay, why?

1093
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:59,243
It was hard, even if it wasn't

1094
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:00,733
not a single woman

1095
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:02,259
it's ok, it's ok

1096
01:12:34,879 --> 01:12:37,114
America knows how
to manage money

1097
01:12:37,324 --> 01:12:39,582
when america
smells money, it's over

1098
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:40,661
hurry up

1099
01:12:40,663 --> 01:12:42,880
we need to get the money back first

1100
01:12:43,918 --> 01:12:46,069
and don't trust the south
korean detective too much.

1101
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,332
Because we are of korean people, after
all, we are one with the United States.

1102
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:50,684
I got it

1103
01:12:51,028 --> 01:12:53,145
I think they both noticed?

1104
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:56,581
Detective kang Jin-tae?

1105
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,084
Well, that's the teacher, what

1106
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,754
who am I?

1107
01:13:03,965 --> 01:13:06,132
I'm sober

1108
01:13:06,133 --> 01:13:09,719
cheol-ryeong and Jack this bastard
is drinking and teasing me now.

1109
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:12,457
It's very lax than it looks

1110
01:13:12,692 --> 01:13:15,168
but our house not airbnb.

1111
01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:16,832
This is the price of rice

1112
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:18,957
later this
do I have to process all receipts?

1113
01:13:18,958 --> 01:13:20,738
The price of food is a problem now, huh?

1114
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:22,921
Wake
that you are the national team

1115
01:13:22,922 --> 01:13:25,839
right, and
there's a guy called Michael Jo

1116
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:27,527
check him out

1117
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,112
- Michael Joe?
- That bastard

1118
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:32,158
I think jang
myung-joon stole money.

1119
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,452
I don't want to, so I'll try
to get my money back.

1120
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:37,079
It looks like they're attacking
me. Take my men with me, huh?

1121
01:13:37,449 --> 01:13:38,831
- Okay, okay, Michael Jo.
- Okay?

1122
01:13:38,832 --> 01:13:39,999
Yes, yes, yes

1123
01:13:40,307 --> 01:13:42,801
here, this, this,
change into this

1124
01:13:42,903 --> 01:13:43,794
- ok
- change

1125
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:45,046
why, why, why, why, why?

1126
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,707
Yes, okay, I know
that, so I stop

1127
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:48,007
hey, hey, jintae, you...

1128
01:13:48,497 --> 01:13:49,675
Already hung up

1129
01:13:49,809 --> 01:13:50,718
are you hurt?

1130
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:52,327
- Wound? Where?
- You must have been very sick.

1131
01:13:52,328 --> 01:13:53,486
- Where? Where?
- It's huge.

1132
01:13:53,487 --> 01:13:54,972
- This?
- Look.

1133
01:13:55,254 --> 01:13:58,254
This is the wound I got from
fighting the Russian mafia.

1134
01:13:58,255 --> 01:14:00,993
- Russian mafia
- too unrealistic

1135
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:03,183
behind it, so big

1136
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:10,742
What should we do

1137
01:14:11,678 --> 01:14:12,781
- it's so cool.
- It's really cool.

1138
01:14:12,782 --> 01:14:16,318
Where are you bastards
proud of having a rough scratch?

1139
01:14:17,928 --> 01:14:19,242
In our north

1140
01:14:19,243 --> 01:14:22,458
red pills are a waste in this
place, roughly miso or bardi

1141
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,060
is this nothing?

1142
01:14:24,061 --> 01:14:26,501
- They're hanging out, what a wound.
- Cool, Mr. Cheol-ryeong.

1143
01:14:26,592 --> 01:14:27,592
It was a long time ago

1144
01:14:27,771 --> 01:14:30,998
I'm going to arrest a cow thief
and I'm just going to handcuff it.

1145
01:14:31,007 --> 01:14:33,102
- What's flashing all of a sudden?
- What, what?

1146
01:14:33,148 --> 01:14:33,975
I just saw

1147
01:14:34,021 --> 01:14:36,389
the calf murmured,

1148
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,123
I just ran into you again, so I

1149
01:14:39,029 --> 01:14:40,559
- no, dad, really, really?
- Stretched out, on the spot

1150
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,537
it's real, I got real scars here

1151
01:14:42,538 --> 01:14:44,740
- it's true, I...
- Hey, hey, hey

1152
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:46,161
dad, don't

1153
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:47,162
- really?
- No, really...

1154
01:14:48,419 --> 01:14:49,717
Did you defuse the bomb?

1155
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:50,708
- Bomb?
- Bomb?

1156
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:52,933
I worked in the bomb
squad for 3 years?

1157
01:14:53,404 --> 01:14:54,803
- Aren't you scared?
- I wasn't scared.

1158
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,676
- Hey, hey, Jack, Jack, Jack
- it's a bomb.

1159
01:14:56,677 --> 01:14:57,677
Jack, Jack!

1160
01:14:57,731 --> 01:15:00,620
I was in the bomb squad too.
I went to a college meeting.

1161
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:03,216
That's why I was living
with that bomb then and now

1162
01:15:03,217 --> 01:15:06,529
- my wife, the bomb.
- You gave me a big laugh, huh?

1163
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:08,963
Hey hey

1164
01:15:23,107 --> 01:15:24,388
Bon appetite

1165
01:15:25,975 --> 01:15:26,975
thank you

1166
01:15:27,365 --> 01:15:28,899
I have to unpack

1167
01:15:29,123 --> 01:15:30,803
can cheol-ryeong also give me some coffee?

1168
01:15:31,404 --> 01:15:32,570
No work

1169
01:15:33,771 --> 01:15:35,881
what's the best thing about being bitter...

1170
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:40,686
Thank you

1171
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:44,607
brother-in-law

1172
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:51,537
Do you have an eye disease?

1173
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:53,685
Kiburidi malau

1174
01:16:07,115 --> 01:16:11,108
Yes, I scoured all social media
and found traces of Sergei.

1175
01:16:11,248 --> 01:16:13,610
Natasha is a Russian model.

1176
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,863
It is believed to be
Sergei's girlfriend.

1177
01:16:17,396 --> 01:16:19,186
'Cause we'll go into Natasha's undercover

1178
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:21,285
you know a little bit
more about Michael Joe

1179
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:22,404
- let's go.
- Did you hear that?

1180
01:16:22,428 --> 01:16:23,974
We play Michael Cho

1181
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:47,561
Did Sergei show
up in three days?

1182
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,357
I hope so, what

1183
01:17:05,607 --> 01:17:08,326
I need to plant a
wiretap, but I'll return it.

1184
01:17:09,311 --> 01:17:11,669
Why aren't you going out, huh?

1185
01:17:22,061 --> 01:17:24,615
Hey, how did you know
about this place, huh?

1186
01:17:24,637 --> 01:17:26,568
I asked the table manager

1187
01:17:26,569 --> 01:17:28,107
really great honesty

1188
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:41,991
Hey, hey, go out, go out

1189
01:17:42,099 --> 01:17:44,299
I'm just sitting still, what
are you going to eat now...

1190
01:17:45,091 --> 01:17:47,704
Hey, I'm going to
plant that blueberry

1191
01:17:47,705 --> 01:17:48,982
I can't leave Natasha alone.

1192
01:17:48,983 --> 01:17:50,915
Someone needs to follow
me, what should I do?

1193
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,396
Follow me

1194
01:17:52,398 --> 01:17:53,884
hey, are you bouncing a bit?

1195
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:56,529
- Then I'll go.

1196
01:17:57,850 --> 01:17:59,841
Then I will go with
Mr. Cheol-ryeong.

1197
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,911
Wouldn't it be okay if we
disguised ourselves as a couple?

1198
01:18:01,912 --> 01:18:02,928
Couple?

1199
01:18:04,271 --> 01:18:06,935
Yeah, yeah, that's what
I do, but don't be shy

1200
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:08,468
- okay.
- Okay.

1201
01:18:08,692 --> 01:18:10,131
Jack take a look here.

1202
01:18:10,967 --> 01:18:12,562
- I go first.
- Be careful.

1203
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:13,670
Oops

1204
01:18:53,211 --> 01:18:55,272
This is very exciting

1205
01:18:55,664 --> 01:18:57,500
police work is
always so thrilling...

1206
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:06,742
Am I good at acting?

1207
01:19:07,023 --> 01:19:09,370
Is my undercover
perfect for my aptitude?

1208
01:19:11,633 --> 01:19:14,594
Isn't it strange
to buy two each?

1209
01:19:20,591 --> 01:19:21,771
No way...

1210
01:19:47,071 --> 01:19:47,700
Are you again?

1211
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:50,164
This baby, where I was
there, was stuck here

1212
01:19:55,274 --> 01:19:56,274
Castle!

1213
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:01,665
Uh

1214
01:20:03,875 --> 01:20:06,719
Well I don't know, I don't know!

1215
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,032
Why don't you know

1216
01:20:08,033 --> 01:20:11,765
to jang myung-joon, you
you sold a Cannon phone

1217
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:14,639
let's finish it fast
please tell me your number

1218
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:15,757
what's the number

1219
01:20:15,758 --> 01:20:17,687
call me a lawyer here.
Lawyer!

1220
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:20,440
What is the global hogu in Korea?
For a Soviet guy like you

1221
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,311
get a lawyer for your taxes
is this kid?

1222
01:20:22,312 --> 01:20:24,610
That's why i'm
sitting in this country

1223
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,654
looks like Russia

1224
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:28,626
already in electric torture,
direct to siberian prison

1225
01:20:29,227 --> 01:20:32,618
this country really has
the best human rights

1226
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,055
you send me to real Siberia

1227
01:20:39,056 --> 01:20:42,376
I knew this would happen, and I posted a
notice of cooperation in advance, didn't I?

1228
01:20:42,492 --> 01:20:45,430
You know it's two hours by
plane from vladivostok, right?

1229
01:20:46,954 --> 01:20:47,954
Are you scared

1230
01:20:53,563 --> 01:20:54,563
Hey man

1231
01:20:59,212 --> 01:21:02,767
rusky officials are so lazy

1232
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:05,038
you know the zootopia sloth?

1233
01:21:06,115 --> 01:21:10,901
Ser...

1234
01:21:10,902 --> 01:21:14,370
Gay

1235
01:21:15,149 --> 01:21:15,913
what?

1236
01:21:15,914 --> 01:21:17,993
No, I want you to call
me right in front of you...

1237
01:21:24,977 --> 01:21:26,507
Uh, detective seo, why, why?

1238
01:21:26,709 --> 01:21:28,907
- You want me to call you?
- Uh

1239
01:21:30,649 --> 01:21:32,513
already?
Did you arrive at the airport?

1240
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:33,868
What airport?

1241
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:35,349
You're coming this way right?

1242
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,875
No, no, don't do that,
just rest and come.

1243
01:21:37,876 --> 01:21:39,686
No, what the hell are you talking about?

1244
01:21:39,796 --> 01:21:42,523
Tomorrow you're going straight
to vladivostok with this bastard?

1245
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,900
No, I'm here

1246
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:48,132
go to hanok village, go to
gwangjang market, eat drug gimbap

1247
01:21:48,133 --> 01:21:49,530
I tell you to rest

1248
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:53,117
okay, okay, then
come on. Yeah, uh

1249
01:21:56,095 --> 01:21:57,496
it's Carl, it's Carl.

1250
01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,720
Hey

1251
01:21:59,907 --> 01:22:03,282
what about your pretty girlfriend
if you get caught, Natasha?

1252
01:22:03,656 --> 01:22:04,656
Uh?

1253
01:22:09,234 --> 01:22:10,509
Ugly bastard, that

1254
01:22:10,595 --> 01:22:12,283
what about the Russian detective?

1255
01:22:12,415 --> 01:22:14,018
Hey, there are north and
South Korea and there is the

1256
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:15,764
United States, but it would
be sad if Russia was missing.

1257
01:22:15,765 --> 01:22:18,579
Jack, you used to
be a Russian mafia.

1258
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,266
Did I mention that you've ever been stuck?

1259
01:22:21,923 --> 01:22:22,923
You...

1260
01:22:25,329 --> 01:22:26,329
No

1261
01:22:27,204 --> 01:22:28,527
- Yes
- no, no

1262
01:22:28,626 --> 01:22:30,985
- yes, yes, yes, yes
- no, no, no, no, no, no

1263
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,517
no

1264
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:01,040
Russian

1265
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,719
well, I only know flirting
with girls and cursing.

1266
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,095
It's enough

1267
01:23:05,454 --> 01:23:06,454
hey

1268
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:09,462
anyway, shouldn't we have
to catch myung-jun jang?

1269
01:23:09,743 --> 01:23:10,743
Uh?

1270
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:13,149
Ok

1271
01:23:13,548 --> 01:23:15,360
Come on, come on, come on

1272
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:17,634
I'm annoyed

1273
01:23:21,306 --> 01:23:25,376
the thought of sending you
to Siberia breaks my heart.

1274
01:23:25,602 --> 01:23:26,602
Hey

1275
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:30,509
you know what it's like to a guy
like you in a prison full of men?

1276
01:23:32,642 --> 01:23:33,892
Tarkovsky!

1277
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:57,688
Why don't we spend the night
together, you kinky bastard?

1278
01:24:05,836 --> 01:24:06,837
Restroom?

1279
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,503
The bathroom, the bathroom!

1280
01:24:09,504 --> 01:24:11,164
Find the bathroom, the bathroom!

1281
01:24:11,352 --> 01:24:12,699
You're looking for the bathroom.

1282
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:14,550
That bastard, that

1283
01:24:14,551 --> 01:24:16,675
that baby shit

1284
01:24:17,602 --> 01:24:18,751
bro bro

1285
01:24:18,906 --> 01:24:19,910
- hey, what's your brother, nigga?
- Save me.

1286
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:21,829
- I need a title to help you
- that bastard is a complete psycho.

1287
01:24:21,853 --> 01:24:22,735
010!

1288
01:24:22,736 --> 01:24:24,274
- What?
- 6742!

1289
01:24:24,275 --> 01:24:25,852
Hey, hey, hey, nigga, take it here

1290
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:39,079
Start

1291
01:24:51,641 --> 01:24:53,463
Do you really need to do this?

1292
01:24:53,619 --> 01:24:56,844
How does your heart get softer?

1293
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,229
I'm not giddy

1294
01:24:59,829 --> 01:25:01,680
even innocent people...

1295
01:25:07,094 --> 01:25:11,095
Did our comrade
Kim's family die for sin?

1296
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:14,461
I have to pay you back

1297
01:25:17,735 --> 01:25:18,821
guilty

1298
01:25:26,165 --> 01:25:28,832
The North Korean delegation for
the North Korea-U.S. high-level talks

1299
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:31,497
arrived through
panmunjom this afternoon

1300
01:25:31,498 --> 01:25:34,075
this conference, which will be
held for two days and one night,

1301
01:25:34,076 --> 01:25:36,455
Kim jong-taek, 5th in the
ranking of power, a member

1302
01:25:36,467 --> 01:25:38,633
of the central military
commission of the party

1303
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:41,692
great progress is
expected in negotiations

1304
01:25:47,536 --> 01:25:49,770
- Come in.
- I'll go.

1305
01:25:50,668 --> 01:25:52,314
Cannon phone location is up

1306
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:54,028
- is it?
- Traveling by vehicle

1307
01:25:54,029 --> 01:25:55,856
in the direction of yeongdongdaegyo
bridge, olympic boulevard

1308
01:25:55,872 --> 01:25:57,319
hey, where are these kids going?

1309
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,196
Base station access log

1310
01:25:59,513 --> 01:26:01,447
but jang myung-joon and
his crew a few days ago

1311
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:04,161
visited a club owned
by Michael Cho

1312
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:05,645
cheongdam-dong chroma

1313
01:26:06,099 --> 01:26:06,942
chroma?

1314
01:26:06,943 --> 01:26:09,623
Myung-jun jang goes to Michael Cho

1315
01:26:10,286 --> 01:26:12,292
- okay, okay.
- Hey, hey, hey, jintae.

1316
01:26:12,395 --> 01:26:14,094
We don't have a warrant,
we don't have any evidence,

1317
01:26:14,106 --> 01:26:15,914
but we got our necks off
after touching the wrong thing

1318
01:26:15,938 --> 01:26:17,214
am I stupid

1319
01:26:17,536 --> 01:26:19,290
if you go in pretending to
be a guest, and when jang

1320
01:26:19,302 --> 01:26:21,402
myung-joon shows up, you will
be caught as a current criminal.

1321
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:23,428
Brother, haven't you been to the club?

1322
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,262
Vips play in the room so
you can't tell from the outside

1323
01:26:26,263 --> 01:26:27,310
- okay?
- Yes

1324
01:26:29,129 --> 01:26:31,786
- so what do you do, without a warrant?
- So not now.

1325
01:26:33,842 --> 01:26:37,458
Well, there are ways to
search without a warrant.

1326
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:38,505
What?

1327
01:26:38,614 --> 01:26:40,872
I'm the club bamboo shooter, no...

1328
01:26:42,216 --> 01:26:44,591
As an experienced club member,

1329
01:26:44,592 --> 01:26:46,592
what if I go to the club?

1330
01:26:46,593 --> 01:26:50,038
Is it that men naturally
entangled and booking came in?

1331
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:51,411
In this room, in that room

1332
01:26:52,075 --> 01:26:53,708
when I was young again, I

1333
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,496
doesn't that mean that
all rooms are equal?

1334
01:26:56,497 --> 01:26:57,497
So?

1335
01:26:57,668 --> 01:27:00,549
It's a walking search warrant, I

1336
01:27:24,704 --> 01:27:25,866
Be careful

1337
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:28,216
the problem went
away like a bullet.

1338
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:30,165
Like a bullet?

1339
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:34,832
Slower than bullets...

1340
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:35,915
I see

1341
01:27:37,064 --> 01:27:40,345
now, let's get the warrant enforced.

1342
01:27:54,961 --> 01:27:57,022
Yes ace confirmed

1343
01:28:18,407 --> 01:28:19,594
Hello

1344
01:28:41,937 --> 01:28:43,902
South Korean machines are good, hey

1345
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,476
a lot of people gathered

1346
01:28:45,882 --> 01:28:47,155
do you have a meeting today?

1347
01:28:48,913 --> 01:28:50,476
What's so funny?

1348
01:28:53,046 --> 01:28:54,960
I've been thinking

1349
01:28:57,062 --> 01:28:59,042
here's a billion dollars

1350
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:02,087
if only one person left
this out, it was all mine.

1351
01:29:02,554 --> 01:29:03,671
What do you want to say?

1352
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:05,256
That's how I'm doing business

1353
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:08,280
why are you all of a sudden saying
you're withdrawing money, geez?

1354
01:29:08,365 --> 01:29:10,326
Anyway, you're on the run

1355
01:29:10,608 --> 01:29:12,138
I can't even give you this

1356
01:29:14,476 --> 01:29:16,935
five million bucks would be
a bummer in the Philippines

1357
01:29:16,936 --> 01:29:18,890
I'll take care of your living expenses.

1358
01:29:18,891 --> 01:29:20,639
Think you're going to farm

1359
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:24,484
the conversation is so cool, man

1360
01:29:25,108 --> 01:29:26,108
okay

1361
01:29:27,202 --> 01:29:31,304
then take a sip of my
drink and think about it, well

1362
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:32,921
huh?

1363
01:29:35,702 --> 01:29:37,499
Bring me a mansour set

1364
01:30:01,803 --> 01:30:03,828
Is your seat okay?
Shall we change?

1365
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:21,917
- Jintae
- why?

1366
01:30:22,088 --> 01:30:24,995
Cheol-ryeong has
something to hide from us

1367
01:30:24,996 --> 01:30:27,087
- what are you hiding?
- Jang myung-jun's money

1368
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,590
the drug money, $1 billion

1369
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:30,800
- you're here to find it.
- A billion dollars?

1370
01:30:30,910 --> 01:30:32,246
Why are you talking about that now?

1371
01:30:32,247 --> 01:30:35,138
No, he wants both jang
myung-jun and money.

1372
01:30:35,364 --> 01:30:37,459
Then we'll be fools

1373
01:30:40,427 --> 01:30:41,763
you get your money

1374
01:30:45,514 --> 01:30:46,816
what is this?

1375
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,401
How much is one billion dollars?

1376
01:30:49,402 --> 01:30:51,696
One billion dollars is
10 billion, 100 billion...

1377
01:30:53,334 --> 01:30:54,537
Is it Joe 1?

1378
01:30:55,996 --> 01:30:56,996
10, wait...

1379
01:30:57,154 --> 01:30:58,328
Hey, you bastard!

1380
01:30:58,529 --> 01:31:01,356
I'm dying because I don't have enough
hands. I'm just kidding around here.

1381
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,791
Let's go to the kitchen now!

1382
01:31:02,946 --> 01:31:06,045
I got the boss vip in the penthouse
and went out with the mansour set.

1383
01:31:07,404 --> 01:31:08,546
Yes sorry

1384
01:31:08,602 --> 01:31:11,060
boss, yes, vip yes, yes, yes

1385
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:15,342
hello

1386
01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:17,180
uh, head of the table

1387
01:31:19,071 --> 01:31:21,071
I found out about North Korea's plot.

1388
01:31:21,072 --> 01:31:22,084
What is that?

1389
01:31:36,302 --> 01:31:38,946
I'll take care of you
until I omit my crumbs.

1390
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:41,830
But I can't understand
your young topic

1391
01:31:41,831 --> 01:31:43,361
it is not important to understand the topic

1392
01:31:43,362 --> 01:31:46,000
it's important to understand the
atmosphere right now, you bastard

1393
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,915
do you still think
I'm your asshole?

1394
01:31:49,822 --> 01:31:53,314
It's an expensive drink,
but you have to taste it.

1395
01:32:20,829 --> 01:32:21,993
Help me

1396
01:32:23,814 --> 01:32:27,384
isn't money one
thing with drugs?

1397
01:32:27,579 --> 01:32:29,437
I'm starting to eat.

1398
01:32:29,438 --> 01:32:31,629
You have to look for it to end

1399
01:32:31,931 --> 01:32:33,757
I feel sorry for your daughter

1400
01:32:35,056 --> 01:32:36,056
stop

1401
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:37,969
stop it, comrade zhang.

1402
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:39,572
She got her money
too, so stop...

1403
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,845
You bastard like a tiger horse!

1404
01:32:42,336 --> 01:32:44,595
Did you think I didn't know
that you spyed on the FBI?

1405
01:32:44,596 --> 01:32:45,680
Comrade jang

1406
01:32:46,165 --> 01:32:47,978
we've come too far

1407
01:32:48,673 --> 01:32:49,731
before it's too late...

1408
01:33:05,548 --> 01:33:07,978
Uh? Myung-jun jang is in the penthouse.

1409
01:33:08,353 --> 01:33:09,368
Min young

1410
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:10,986
go home now

1411
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,769
- Jack.
- Why?

1412
01:33:28,009 --> 01:33:29,244
Hey, hey!

1413
01:33:30,743 --> 01:33:31,743
Hey!

1414
01:33:32,329 --> 01:33:33,329
Sorry

1415
01:33:34,056 --> 01:33:35,056
hey!

1416
01:34:00,611 --> 01:34:04,102
I am adol, Adolf bohrmann

1417
01:34:04,892 --> 01:34:06,307
stop, stop

1418
01:34:07,853 --> 01:34:09,102
crash, slaughter...

1419
01:34:10,243 --> 01:34:11,243
Let's go

1420
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:27,790
Hurry in, get in, get in!

1421
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:30,313
Enter!
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

1422
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,495
Cheoryeong-ah

1423
01:35:37,597 --> 01:35:38,683
go over there

1424
01:35:41,698 --> 01:35:43,127
what, why?

1425
01:35:43,128 --> 01:35:44,572
Sung, I'm sorry

1426
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:47,120
hey, hey!

1427
01:35:47,393 --> 01:35:48,971
Hey, im cheol-ryeong!

1428
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:29,298
Lim cheol-ryeong,
lieutenant of social

1429
01:36:29,310 --> 01:36:31,526
security, Democratic
people's republic of Korea

1430
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,190
according to the agreement
between the north and the south

1431
01:36:34,214 --> 01:36:36,252
North Korean delegation
requesting extradition

1432
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:41,686
I drank water again.

1433
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:43,089
Look, huh?

1434
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:45,784
Surely I said I had other plans?

1435
01:36:45,785 --> 01:36:48,803
But I can't figure it out, huh?
In the end, make this four months?

1436
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:51,986
No, I found it, but isn't
it just that I'm late there?

1437
01:36:51,987 --> 01:36:54,182
It's like a billion dollars

1438
01:36:54,183 --> 01:36:56,550
does jintae or Nana have
to take off their clothes?

1439
01:36:56,651 --> 01:36:58,895
Why do I take my clothes off?

1440
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:03,011
Then you take responsibility
and bring back 1 billion dollars!

1441
01:37:03,394 --> 01:37:04,986
Senior, senior

1442
01:37:05,933 --> 01:37:07,741
the vehicle that jang
myung-jun and his crew

1443
01:37:07,753 --> 01:37:09,532
were riding was found
near pyeongtaek port.

1444
01:37:09,986 --> 01:37:11,971
Looks like you're trying
to smuggle into China?

1445
01:37:14,401 --> 01:37:16,135
'Cause we'll do the dishes

1446
01:37:16,136 --> 01:37:18,284
he will make a comeback
home by plane tomorrow.

1447
01:37:18,285 --> 01:37:20,081
Detective kang Jin-tae, go home and rest.

1448
01:37:20,465 --> 01:37:22,917
I'm just going to make
you rest well this time.

1449
01:37:23,042 --> 01:37:25,370
Is this only the price
you risked your life for?

1450
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,480
Yes?

1451
01:37:28,049 --> 01:37:30,003
I will follow you to pyeongtaek.

1452
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,929
Hey, if you don't understand
the topic, don't talk about it

1453
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,806
detective kang's house
monitoring device, go and collect it.

1454
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:35,964
A surveillance device?

1455
01:37:36,276 --> 01:37:38,477
Did you think we
would trust jintae?

1456
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:39,645
Are you naive, what are you?

1457
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,018
So im cheol-ryeong
slaps me in the back

1458
01:37:42,019 --> 01:37:44,065
- twice.
- Really...

1459
01:37:44,066 --> 01:37:45,362
- Hey, hey, hey
- what?

1460
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,370
No, what are you talking about...

1461
01:37:48,698 --> 01:37:49,862
Really...

1462
01:38:07,268 --> 01:38:09,581
Good job, how about Kim chul-soo?

1463
01:38:09,964 --> 01:38:11,065
He is dead

1464
01:38:11,558 --> 01:38:13,846
all threats to the party
have been removed

1465
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:26,442
Uh, are you here?

1466
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:30,363
This is comrade rim
cheol-ryeong who closed this case.

1467
01:38:31,033 --> 01:38:33,905
Girae, you did a great job

1468
01:38:34,644 --> 01:38:36,394
Swiss bank security?

1469
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:50,745
Comrade is the hero of the party

1470
01:38:51,822 --> 01:38:54,120
he's gone to promise a big reward

1471
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:08,933
German chemist

1472
01:39:09,432 --> 01:39:12,155
invention of poison gas that killed Jews

1473
01:39:13,355 --> 01:39:15,628
adol, Adolf bohrmann

1474
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:17,456
stop, stop

1475
01:39:18,722 --> 01:39:20,288
crash, slaughter...

1476
01:39:34,143 --> 01:39:36,862
Customer is unable
to answer calls

1477
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:39,748
today's high-level talks
between the U.S. and North Korea

1478
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:41,651
confirmed only the differences
between the two sides.

1479
01:39:41,652 --> 01:39:43,948
It ended without the
adoption of an agreement

1480
01:39:43,949 --> 01:39:47,356
North Korean leader Kim jong-taek, member
of the party central military commission,

1481
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:50,065
the U.S. came to the
meeting empty-handed.

1482
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,278
He strongly criticized the United States.

1483
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:54,956
The North Korean delegation will go
through panmunjom tomorrow morning.

1484
01:39:54,957 --> 01:39:56,531
I'm going back to the north

1485
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:58,117
the informant is Kim chul-soo.

1486
01:39:58,118 --> 01:39:59,893
Said he had to stop the
slaughter before he died

1487
01:39:59,894 --> 01:40:01,831
the name he used
was Adolf bohrmann.

1488
01:40:02,121 --> 01:40:04,424
German chemist who murdered Jews

1489
01:40:07,049 --> 01:40:08,339
unusual

1490
01:40:27,683 --> 01:40:28,870
I'm here

1491
01:40:34,269 --> 01:40:35,877
Hey, it's a little late

1492
01:41:11,395 --> 01:41:12,395
Jack?

1493
01:41:14,903 --> 01:41:15,919
Jack?

1494
01:42:30,154 --> 01:42:32,146
How do you like this glory?

1495
01:42:33,107 --> 01:42:35,149
To catch a cub

1496
01:42:35,787 --> 01:42:38,584
comrade Kim jeong-taek
of baekdu bloodline is here...

1497
01:42:47,764 --> 01:42:49,409
Bastard baby

1498
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:52,193
snout is alive

1499
01:42:53,725 --> 01:42:57,963
I only believe in your words that you
need to earn dollars to feed the people.

1500
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:02,553
I threw away all my honor as a
soldier and acted as a drug dealer.

1501
01:43:02,834 --> 01:43:03,928
That money

1502
01:43:04,529 --> 01:43:07,295
I mean, it went through
the mouth of a bastard.

1503
01:43:09,107 --> 01:43:13,014
I'll close my eyes and do
whatever I ask you to do

1504
01:43:13,295 --> 01:43:15,248
have a quick glance

1505
01:43:21,584 --> 01:43:23,364
But why the hell was he caught?

1506
01:43:23,686 --> 01:43:25,795
- You mean he was caught on purpose?
- Okay

1507
01:43:25,796 --> 01:43:28,536
and now they're
after jintae's family

1508
01:43:28,662 --> 01:43:30,232
I will save my family

1509
01:43:30,233 --> 01:43:32,154
you are in charge of jang myung-joon

1510
01:43:42,295 --> 01:43:44,326
It's shit training, shit training

1511
01:43:46,147 --> 01:43:47,498
hey, hey, hey

1512
01:43:47,499 --> 01:43:49,396
do you know me

1513
01:43:49,397 --> 01:43:50,889
yeah? Yes

1514
01:43:55,576 --> 01:43:58,459
don't you want to work with the FBI?

1515
01:43:59,287 --> 01:44:00,287
Really?

1516
01:44:01,177 --> 01:44:04,071
Mom, I'm so scared

1517
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:07,115
yuna, don't worry

1518
01:44:08,134 --> 01:44:10,985
daddy will come to our
rescue just like back then.

1519
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:12,162
It's okay

1520
01:44:12,468 --> 01:44:13,834
it's ok don't cry

1521
01:44:23,310 --> 01:44:25,264
Please check your ID

1522
01:44:26,654 --> 01:44:28,694
this is jintae kang, the
Seoul metropolitan police.

1523
01:44:36,177 --> 01:44:37,990
- Thanks for your cooperation.
- Yes.

1524
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:54,733
Let's eat rice!

1525
01:44:55,827 --> 01:44:56,827
Rice?

1526
01:44:57,093 --> 01:44:58,772
No we don't want to eat

1527
01:44:58,773 --> 01:45:01,444
no, I'm just saying that
we can eat all of this.

1528
01:45:01,445 --> 01:45:02,296
- Hey.
- Why?

1529
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:03,811
Would you like some jjajangmyeon?

1530
01:45:03,812 --> 01:45:05,590
Hey, do you think it's
going through your throat?

1531
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:07,443
You have a collection of
Chinese restaurant stickers, huh?

1532
01:45:07,444 --> 01:45:10,030
How recklessly did you save
up to eat sweet and sour pork?

1533
01:45:10,031 --> 01:45:12,279
I should die wearing it, so
it's less embarrassing, huh?

1534
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:14,098
Ghosts that ate and died have a good color

1535
01:45:14,099 --> 01:45:15,267
- I'm skinny.
- Hey!

1536
01:45:15,311 --> 01:45:16,186
- Weight loss?
- No, no.

1537
01:45:16,187 --> 01:45:17,467
- No, what.
- I'm skinny!

1538
01:45:17,468 --> 01:45:18,646
- No, no.

1539
01:45:18,647 --> 01:45:20,439
- Is this eminai crazy?
- What are you all going to eat?

1540
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,631
- Quickly pick a menu, pick a menu!
- Can't you shut up?

1541
01:45:22,655 --> 01:45:24,069
Please forgive me
when he was young

1542
01:45:24,071 --> 01:45:26,835
I think it's because I got the
briquette gas wrong, I'm sorry

1543
01:45:29,178 --> 01:45:30,327
anybody home?

1544
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,233
I'm here to tell you good things

1545
01:45:38,335 --> 01:45:39,913
'Cause I can kill you

1546
01:45:41,327 --> 01:45:44,632

1547
01:45:49,061 --> 01:45:52,225
shut up, I'll see you soon

1548
01:45:54,014 --> 01:45:56,202
I'm here to tell you good things

1549
01:46:11,944 --> 01:46:13,787
He came to save us

1550
01:47:02,602 --> 01:47:04,522
- Min young-ah, min
young-ah, min young-ah - aunt

1551
01:47:04,569 --> 01:47:06,409
sister, sister, sister,
sister, sister, sister!

1552
01:47:12,231 --> 01:47:13,858
Open the door,
quick, quick, aunt!

1553
01:47:41,374 --> 01:47:43,241
Occupied the central control room

1554
01:47:57,999 --> 01:47:59,031
What is it

1555
01:47:59,740 --> 01:48:00,969
this bastard...

1556
01:48:09,288 --> 01:48:12,507
Connection complete the
elevator has been blocked

1557
01:48:38,945 --> 01:48:39,972
Uh, honey!

1558
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:41,767
Honey, are you okay?

1559
01:48:42,053 --> 01:48:42,866
Uh I'm fine

1560
01:48:42,867 --> 01:48:45,477
uh, we're fine. Jack saved me.

1561
01:48:45,598 --> 01:48:47,376
- Don't worry about us.
- Uh

1562
01:48:55,765 --> 01:48:56,864
Transfer is ready

1563
01:48:56,920 --> 01:48:59,108
move all $1 billion
to my account

1564
01:48:59,109 --> 01:49:00,242
I got it

1565
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:07,374
Connection confirmation

1566
01:49:08,116 --> 01:49:09,616
started hacking

1567
01:49:14,991 --> 01:49:16,108
Why are you waiting?

1568
01:49:16,452 --> 01:49:17,718
Got hacked

1569
01:49:18,752 --> 01:49:20,920
- what is this?
- Your account is running out of money

1570
01:49:20,921 --> 01:49:23,320
hey, you bastard,
stop it quickly!

1571
01:49:23,321 --> 01:49:24,475
I got it

1572
01:49:30,859 --> 01:49:32,171
This...

1573
01:49:35,093 --> 01:49:36,695
This bastard

1574
01:49:36,788 --> 01:49:39,608
if you want to catch a tiger, you
have to enter the tiger's oyster.

1575
01:50:18,921 --> 01:50:21,990
To get you out of the republic

1576
01:50:22,648 --> 01:50:24,868
how many years have you been preparing?

1577
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:26,495
Take it all

1578
01:50:27,257 --> 01:50:28,330
I have no work

1579
01:50:28,485 --> 01:50:31,631
but why did you kill
my innocent family?

1580
01:50:32,506 --> 01:50:35,546
Pursuing even to the end of
hell and tearing the enemy apart

1581
01:50:35,547 --> 01:50:38,343
isn't that a husband and a father's job?

1582
01:50:38,452 --> 01:50:39,522
Ivorau

1583
01:50:41,023 --> 01:50:42,068
myung-jun...

1584
01:52:38,732 --> 01:52:40,091
What do you mean?

1585
01:52:41,217 --> 01:52:42,794
What is poison gas?

1586
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:48,919
Click this and after 5 minutes

1587
01:52:49,318 --> 01:52:52,977
poison gas installed on the
roof will spread all over the place

1588
01:52:53,107 --> 01:52:56,603
all living things within a
3km radius will be destroyed.

1589
01:52:56,919 --> 01:52:57,927
How are you?

1590
01:52:58,873 --> 01:53:00,747
Isn't that a crazy operation kid?

1591
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:05,122
And this is for my
dead comrades...

1592
01:53:17,318 --> 01:53:18,318
Castle

1593
01:53:18,654 --> 01:53:21,003
- I'm sorry yesterday.
- It's noisy.

1594
01:53:21,451 --> 01:53:23,052
Collaboration isn't over yet

1595
01:53:25,223 --> 01:53:26,799
they're trying to spray poison gas

1596
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,787
you're doing all the damn shit, really.

1597
01:53:31,615 --> 01:53:33,390
- Cover me.
- Huh?

1598
01:53:34,248 --> 01:53:35,849
Ok ok

1599
01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:31,694
Hey, rim cheol-ryeong!

1600
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:44,319
Crazy bastard

1601
01:55:28,302 --> 01:55:29,589
Come in!

1602
01:55:30,045 --> 01:55:31,413
This bastard

1603
01:55:33,272 --> 01:55:37,686
you crossed two lines
that shouldn't be crossed

1604
01:55:37,896 --> 01:55:38,990
the first

1605
01:55:39,514 --> 01:55:42,394
the fact that you entered
the territory of Korea, second

1606
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:45,358
that you touched my family

1607
01:55:45,359 --> 01:55:48,038
what are you going to do?
Weak bastard

1608
01:56:56,458 --> 01:56:58,857
Cheol-ryeong, are you okay?

1609
01:57:00,529 --> 01:57:01,693
Bomb?

1610
01:57:02,755 --> 01:57:04,216
- It's over there.
- Uh.

1611
01:57:06,169 --> 01:57:09,263
Are you going to kill
all the innocent people?

1612
01:57:09,380 --> 01:57:10,670
Why are you not guilty?

1613
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,037
My daughter and
my wife died in a fire

1614
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:16,498
even if South Korea only accepted asylum

1615
01:57:16,888 --> 01:57:19,107
my family didn't get killed

1616
01:57:19,809 --> 01:57:21,911
now the South Korean bastards

1617
01:57:22,982 --> 01:57:25,021
shouldn't it be a taste of hell?

1618
01:57:52,357 --> 01:57:53,917
- Uh, jintae, why, why, why, why?
- Jack

1619
01:57:54,170 --> 01:57:56,152
now look, it's a poison gas bomb

1620
01:57:56,153 --> 01:57:57,570
- poison gas!
- What are you talking about

1621
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:58,697
poison!

1622
01:57:58,698 --> 01:58:00,708
Honey, we're all
here here, there...

1623
01:58:01,544 --> 01:58:03,325
What if I come here?

1624
01:58:03,903 --> 01:58:04,863
I'll be delighted

1625
01:58:04,864 --> 01:58:07,455
hey Jack, what do I do?
Less than 3 minutes left

1626
01:58:07,548 --> 01:58:09,541
if we don't dismantle
this, we'll all die!

1627
01:58:09,622 --> 01:58:10,932
Why are you asking me that

1628
01:58:11,302 --> 01:58:13,529
you said you were a bomb squad!

1629
01:58:18,379 --> 01:58:20,489
- Please help me.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1630
01:58:20,614 --> 01:58:22,053
What should we do

1631
01:58:22,841 --> 01:58:26,057
ok, hole, key to dismantle
the hole, key to dismantle

1632
01:58:26,216 --> 01:58:27,216
key?

1633
01:58:28,708 --> 01:58:30,943
Key! There, there! Uh!

1634
01:58:38,034 --> 01:58:39,255
- You can't come in here.
- No, wait.

1635
01:58:39,256 --> 01:58:40,841
- Jintae's family
- hello

1636
01:58:41,451 --> 01:58:43,033
- jesu, what are you doing here?
- Chief

1637
01:58:43,075 --> 01:58:44,707
now our yuna and
dad are over there

1638
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:47,348
- yes?
- No, there's a bomb on the roof.

1639
01:59:33,451 --> 01:59:34,451
Iron spirit!

1640
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:36,334
Key!

1641
01:59:36,451 --> 01:59:39,162
I need to find the key
to defuse the bomb.

1642
01:59:42,193 --> 01:59:43,193
Key

1643
01:59:43,896 --> 01:59:45,123
give it out

1644
01:59:51,255 --> 01:59:52,498
Come now

1645
01:59:53,544 --> 01:59:54,935
my daughter

1646
01:59:55,677 --> 01:59:57,899
I'm going to go see my wife's face

1647
01:59:58,880 --> 01:59:59,943
cheoryeong-ah

1648
02:00:01,412 --> 02:00:03,669
that we never meet again

1649
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:05,591
would be nice

1650
02:00:09,990 --> 02:00:11,240
no!

1651
02:00:18,114 --> 02:00:19,114
What is that?

1652
02:00:27,373 --> 02:00:28,373
Put the radio

1653
02:00:51,193 --> 02:00:52,370
Uh huh?

1654
02:00:52,375 --> 02:00:53,646
Take the key

1655
02:00:58,726 --> 02:01:01,054
- Closer!
- One more

1656
02:01:01,258 --> 02:01:03,375
- closer, more
- closer!

1657
02:01:15,235 --> 02:01:16,876
Iron spirit!

1658
02:02:01,352 --> 02:02:02,357
Castle

1659
02:02:03,961 --> 02:02:05,086
by the way...

1660
02:02:06,454 --> 02:02:08,047
How do you get into the house?

1661
02:02:09,710 --> 02:02:11,641
We died to my brother-in-law

1662
02:02:16,273 --> 02:02:18,235
hey, just get down on your knees, what

1663
02:02:21,532 --> 02:02:22,649
hey Jack!

1664
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:30,281
Yeah im ok hey Jack,
thank you so much

1665
02:02:30,688 --> 02:02:32,776
you said it was because you
were the older brother, didn't you?

1666
02:02:32,788 --> 02:02:33,788
Uh?

1667
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:38,469
Not your brother, huh?

1668
02:02:39,922 --> 02:02:43,126
Hey, you only use English
when you're at a disadvantage

1669
02:02:52,524 --> 02:02:54,040
Hey, but how do I do this?

1670
02:02:55,265 --> 02:02:58,243
If you take it, will it be used to
solve the real food shortage?

1671
02:03:13,589 --> 02:03:14,971
Did the chairperson go up?

1672
02:03:29,444 --> 02:03:32,813
Guess I'm crazy, that's
minyoung-ah, see me, that slow video

1673
02:03:33,648 --> 02:03:35,241
- awesome.
- Sister, can you see it?

1674
02:03:35,414 --> 02:03:36,460
- Great, I see.
- Huh?

1675
02:03:36,461 --> 02:03:40,362
Hey, what's wrong with
this, what's up, honey

1676
02:03:40,363 --> 02:03:41,581
dad!

1677
02:03:41,719 --> 02:03:44,083
Honey, come quickly

1678
02:03:44,084 --> 02:03:46,750
come on, you bastard, really...

1679
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:10,086
News that unicef is going to provide
$1 billion in food aid to North Korea

1680
02:04:10,087 --> 02:04:12,531
people who donated $1 billion

1681
02:04:12,532 --> 02:04:15,365
attention is focused on
the source of the funds.

1682
02:04:15,366 --> 02:04:17,616
However, unicef decided
not to disclose the identity

1683
02:04:17,628 --> 02:04:19,805
of the donor according
to the wishes of the donor.

1684
02:04:24,594 --> 02:04:26,751
Sung, I'm sorry

1685
02:04:26,859 --> 02:04:27,889
what?

1686
02:04:28,078 --> 02:04:29,993
I can't even get a promotion because of me.

1687
02:04:31,438 --> 02:04:34,759
Man, I didn't even want a promotion,
I'm just glad I didn't get cut, well

1688
02:04:34,868 --> 02:04:37,547
but that's a really good idea

1689
02:04:38,415 --> 02:04:40,664
I'll live like this again, well

1690
02:04:42,273 --> 02:04:43,618
goodbye

1691
02:04:45,797 --> 02:04:46,930
good luck

1692
02:04:53,495 --> 02:04:55,808
Cheol-ryeong, I'll wait

1693
02:04:55,930 --> 02:04:57,195
wait?

1694
02:04:57,196 --> 02:04:58,992
Yes I will wait

1695
02:04:59,516 --> 02:05:00,827
I really...

1696
02:05:11,164 --> 02:05:13,993
Minyoung, have you
ever been to the us?

1697
02:05:14,508 --> 02:05:15,508
No

1698
02:05:15,993 --> 02:05:17,468
When I go to usa

1699
02:05:18,547 --> 02:05:19,721
wanna go on a trip together?

1700
02:05:20,117 --> 02:05:21,789
- Really?
- Yes

1701
02:05:23,235 --> 02:05:24,434
- Why?
- Uh?

1702
02:05:25,313 --> 02:05:26,329
Why come

1703
02:05:29,047 --> 02:05:30,063
why?

1704
02:05:31,321 --> 02:05:32,321
Hey

1705
02:05:32,774 --> 02:05:34,321
don't be silly

1706
02:05:41,711 --> 02:05:42,922
It's mine?

1707
02:05:50,961 --> 02:05:52,742
Thank you, Mr. Cheol-ryeong

1708
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,508
I'll wait

1709
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:59,258
hey, you're a cheol-ryeong...

1710
02:06:01,290 --> 02:06:02,322
Sister!

1711
02:06:02,323 --> 02:06:03,715
What's up with this

1712
02:06:03,717 --> 02:06:05,961
there is really no tree
that can't be taken ten times.

1713
02:06:05,962 --> 02:06:06,694
Don't touch it.

1714
02:06:06,706 --> 02:06:08,807
Look, hey, congratulations,
congratulations.
