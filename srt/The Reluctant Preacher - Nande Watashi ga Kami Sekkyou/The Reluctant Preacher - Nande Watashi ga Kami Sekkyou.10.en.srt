1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:09,275
We will expel the 75 students listed here.

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,311
What Moriguchi-sensei is trying to do

3
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,446
is the most foolish thing
an educator can do.

4
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,081
-What is this?
-Huh?

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,050
They want to interview us about this.

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:17,951
THE SCHOOL IS AT RISK OF CLOSING.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,352
-Hey look!
-Isn't this crazy?

8
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,587
-Isn't this crazy?
-What?

9
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:23,023
TONIGHT IS THE FINAL EPISODE

10
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,457
Shut up, brat!

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,995
Make sure you post this next part
with zero edits.

12
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,804
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

13
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,714
I'm telling you,

14
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,617
I don't know anything about such a list.

15
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,753
Maybe someone is playing a prank?

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,022
What was that about?

17
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,359
It's the Chairman's order.

18
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,028
MEISHIN EXPELLING 75 INNOCENT STUDENTS

19
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,664
They want to interview us about this.

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,767
Wouldn't it be best if we just pretended
we didn't know anything?

21
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,869
He said, "If we don't acknowledge it,

22
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,873
it will eventually fade,
and be forgotten…"

23
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,609
Regardless of the media,

24
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,244
what about the students?

25
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,648
We can't tell them the truth.

26
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,918
If they find out the school planned this,

27
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,353
they'll never trust adults again.

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,755
I feel the same.

29
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,124
This is really…

30
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,727
Principal, what do you think?

31
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,798
Are you okay? You don't look well.

32
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,201
Oh…

33
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,635
I guess I'm just a bit tired…

34
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:43,937
-Yes?
-Yes.

35
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,609
I don't think we should
always tell the truth…

36
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,713
But then, what should I say?

37
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,718
Is this really true?

38
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,819
MEISHIN TRYING TO EXPEL
75 INNOCENT STUDENTS

39
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,056
It says
they're trying to expel innocent students…

40
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,558
What about Kaito or Iroha?

41
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,961
Was Miyazawa expelled because of this?

42
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,196
Did you go along with it?

43
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,464
That's impossible!

44
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,167
You know that she protected me and Iroha

45
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,237
when we almost got expelled, right?

46
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,005
But still…

47
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,307
It must be a prank by someone.

48
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,609
Is that true?

49
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,316
Well…

50
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,219
maybe so…

51
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,057
A lie can smooth things over.

52
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,994
But when that lie is exposed,

53
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,263
it will cause massive chaos.

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,831
Did you do it?

55
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,732
Yes.

56
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,168
Shizuka Urumi.

57
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,204
Because she ignored me…

58
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,774
My only playmate was Shizuka Urumi,

59
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:58,378
But now the whole Meishin Academy
is involved in this.

60
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,782
Something like this…

61
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,519
If we lie and say
the school doesn't know about this,

62
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,555
it won't become such a big deal.

63
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,159
The only one
who'd suffer any consequences…

64
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:15,862
would be me.

65
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,767
I'm the one who came up with this plan.

66
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,369
I wanted to revive this school,

67
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:27,373
turn it into a prestigious,
high-profit brand.

68
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,647
I wanted to achieve that
before I became the chairman.

69
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,782
I see…

70
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,586
So…

71
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:44,691
what do you think would happen
if I uploaded this online?

72
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:53,333
I… recorded what you just said earlier.

73
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,103
I'm the one who came up with this plan.

74
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,706
This video went viral.

75
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,441
turn it into a prestigious,
high-profit brand…

76
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,408
CONTROVERSY-EXPULSION LIST
OF 75 STUDENTS LEAKED?

77
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,743
-We apologize.
-I'm terribly sorry.

78
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,247
I'm not aware of such a list.

79
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,349
Maybe someone is playing a prank?

80
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,283
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY ACCUSED
OF A "SCHOOL LIE"

81
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,751
Once it was revealed to be a lie,

82
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,720
the media exploded.

83
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,687
Yes.

84
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,155
Expelling 75 students.

85
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,190
What? Expelled…

86
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,658
The school's lie.

87
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,027
Headlines like these
were flooding the streets.

88
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,528
Not that! Look at Meishin!

89
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,130
-Let's go…
-Any comment?

90
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,832
-What happened?
-Make some space…

91
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,133
-Why-
-Out of the way!

92
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,335
The Chairman's been hospitalized?

93
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,106
It seems his heavy workload

94
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,675
took a toll on his health.

95
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,843
I see.

96
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,812
-So he faked illness.
-Yes.

97
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,784
He's decided to entrust
everything about this incident to you.

98
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,790
That old bastard…

99
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,560
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

100
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,533
Principal.

101
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:07,073
How should we explain
this to the students?

102
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,909
What should we really say?

103
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,083
As the principal,
I will take responsibility.

104
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,552
Tomorrow,

105
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,821
I'll hold a school-wide assembly.

106
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,389
There,

107
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,692
I'll explain everything

108
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,794
to all the students, in person

109
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,629
and apologize.

110
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,466
Ms. Kyoko will explain everything…

111
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,670
but…

112
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,139
is that really okay?

113
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,611
I feel like Watanuki might ask,
"Why did you lie?" and interrogate me.

114
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,194
Good morning.

115
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,465
Or rather…

116
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,103
what is this weird tension?

117
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:13,973
WEEKLY TRUTH

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,110
Seems like the school's in big trouble.

119
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,780
It's shocking…

120
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,784
To think Meishin's such a terrible school.

121
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,521
I came because you ignored me.

122
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,623
Could it be…

123
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,294
you were the one who spread
that video online?

124
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,796
Yes. I did it.

125
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:38,931
Why did you do that?

126
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,768
I wanted to expose
the corruption of the school.

127
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,569
I only did the right thing, didn't I?

128
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,071
Sorry, but…

129
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,774
it looks like you just did it for fun.

130
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,475
That's harsh…

131
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,943
Harsh?

132
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,181
You weren't even bullied,
but you lied and said you were…

133
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,850
That was just for laughs, right?

134
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,485
I was bullied.

135
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,422
I said so myself. And you doubt me?

136
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,991
You're the worst teacher.

137
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,093
What's with you?

138
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,563
-What?
-You're full of crap!

139
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,969
No one in our old class, 1-5,
saw you being bullied.

140
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:20,807
Huh?

141
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,109
This class

142
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:28,481
turned a blind eye even when Naito
was bullied by Watanuki, right?

143
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,451
And you trust people like that?

144
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:34,253
I bullied Iroha? Who said that?

145
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,022
I heard it from Naito.

146
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,092
You're saying that behind my back?

147
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,727
-That's…
-You said it.

148
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,062
Unbelievable!

149
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,465
-Sorry.
-Wow!

150
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,466
You apologized?

151
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,367
What's this?

152
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,204
You said you might get along,
but do you still have a hierarchy?

153
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,139
-Enough already!
-Oh!

154
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,208
Are you going to get violent again?
Like in middle school?

155
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,277
-Huh?
-I heard that from Naito, too.

156
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:00,146
You told him about Kaito too?

157
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,581
-No, that's not true…
-What isn't?!

158
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,015
Stop it!

159
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,551
Why are you believing him
instead of Naito?

160
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,657
It's not like she was badmouthing you.

161
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,061
Naito was close
with Wakisaka-kun in middle school.

162
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,831
She just happened to meet him,
and told him what happened in this class.

163
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,233
She didn't mean any harm.

164
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,573
I don't want you telling me
whether to believe someone or not.

165
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:36,382
All the teachers at this school…
are liars, right?

166
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,653
You tried to expel 75 students,

167
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,656
but you all coordinated your stories
and said, "We don't know," right?

168
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,593
-That's…
-A school full of lying teachers…

169
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,830
Isn't it awful?

170
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,301
Hey! What's going on?

171
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,503
Wakisaka, why are you--

172
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,139
I'll be back again.

173
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,546
Sensei,

174
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,881
why did you lie to us?

175
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,750
Please explain!

176
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,451
There…

177
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,054
There will be an explanation

178
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,723
from the principal at tomorrow's assembly.

179
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,827
I was pathetic.

180
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,232
I couldn't convey anything
in my own words,

181
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,200
so I left everything to Ms. Kyoko.

182
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,303
I was pathetic…

183
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:32,905
Do you think it'll be okay?

184
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:33,906
It'll be fine.

185
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,175
How can you be so sure?

186
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,744
There's no way things can get worse.

187
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,479
So it can only get better, right?

188
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,682
That's a pretty weak reason.

189
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,517
It's okay!

190
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,920
CLASS 2-3

191
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,637
WHY WAS THE LIST LEAKED? WHY EXPEL THEM?

192
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,472
BETRAYING THE STUDENTS WHO TRUSTED YOU…

193
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,289
Will things be okay?

194
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,926
Does it look like I'm okay?

195
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,061
Not you.

196
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,999
Kyoko said she would come over…

197
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,575
If this is rock bottom,
it can only get better.

198
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,610
That's what I hoped…

199
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:45,511
INCOMING CALL
SHIZUKA URUMI

200
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,946
…but the worst…

201
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,648
was yet to come…

202
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,354
I'm in front of the school…

203
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,757
where 75 students were about to
be expelled…

204
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,092
May I have your attention?

205
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,898
Last night,
the Principal collapsed from overworking.

206
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,467
So…

207
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,103
the schoolwide assembly we planned

208
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,706
will be held after he returns.

209
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,510
And in the meantime…

210
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,880
we're temporarily closing the school.

211
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,584
How do we explain this to the students?

212
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,986
We've been heavily attacked

213
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,522
by the media these days.

214
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:33,959
Once a school is marked to be "attacked,"
they show no mercy.

215
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,995
And look what information

216
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,298
they got a hold of this time!

217
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,232
NOT A TEACHER, BUT A MURDERER

218
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,135
This is about Urumi-sensei
and Suzuki-sensei.

219
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,105
It's probably him again…

220
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,908
The media is flooding us with questions
about this,

221
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,212
and… we're getting
threatening calls and emails.

222
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,583
We will monitor things for a while.

223
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,620
Once we see the situation is safe,
the school will reopen.

224
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:05,458
This decision was made
after discussions with the chairman.

225
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,199
Are you okay
after what happened with Aika?

226
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,835
Did the reporters outside
ask you anything?

227
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,838
Not really…

228
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,742
I thought the media
might ask me questions.

229
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:29,048
I was so worried about being questioned
that I overdid it with the disguise.

230
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,984
It is embarrassing, so I'll stay quiet…

231
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:35,921
Where is Aika?

232
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,725
I don't know how the media found out,
but looks like she got a call.

233
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,596
She ignored it
since it was an unknown number,

234
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,500
but she told me not to worry about her,
and focus on the students.

235
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,571
She's worrying more about the students
than herself.

236
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,140
That sounds like Aika-sensei.

237
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,410
I'm embarrassed
for only thinking about myself…

238
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,946
Are the students really okay?

239
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,148
But…

240
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,584
without the principal,
how are we supposed to explain anything?

241
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:09,188
Where is Moriguchi now? What is he doing?

242
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,491
-You're quitting?
-Yes.

243
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,593
You were supposed to take my place

244
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,162
as the next chairman, weren't you?

245
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,064
After all this,

246
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:20,900
I don't want that anymore.

247
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,102
Well…

248
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,504
I don't care about Meishin anymore.
So it's fine.

249
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,073
See you.

250
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,276
Take care!

251
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,848
Hey!

252
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,817
What's that?

253
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:41,353
Maybe the media is targeting me…

254
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,890
By the way, Mom, what's in this package?

255
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,626
Ah, this?

256
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,897
You're really going to quit like this?

257
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,235
Are you going to run away
from what you did

258
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,138
without taking any responsibility?

259
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,674
Yes.

260
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:06,078
So I'm leaving the mess at Meishin
in your hands now.

261
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,049
Lifelong vice principal.

262
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,854
Don't get cocky.

263
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:21,427
You have no right to talk to me that way,
you greenhorn brat!

264
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,163
Stop it, vice principal.

265
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,431
BE QUIET IN THE REST AREA

266
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:26,599
Principal.

267
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,935
Are you feeling better?

268
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:37,676
I collapsed
and was taken to this hospital.

269
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,112
Take care.

270
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,448
Moriguchi-sensei.

271
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,485
Let's apologize to the students.

272
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,221
Why should I do that?

273
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,028
Because you did something wrong,
you should apologize.

274
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,196
That's obvious.

275
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,165
And of course, you won't be alone.
I'll be with-

276
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,901
I didn't do anything wrong!

277
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,237
In the kind of school I envisioned,

278
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,173
those 75 expulsions were necessary!

279
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,444
We don't need students
from dysfunctional families!

280
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,480
That's just prejudice!

281
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,283
You're projecting the bullying

282
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,052
you suffered as a student…

283
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:23,989
Bullying?

284
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,526
So you were digging around

285
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,762
behind my back, weren't you?

286
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,000
That's right.

287
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,469
I was bullied.

288
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,839
I was smart
and came from a wealthy family.

289
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,610
So those underprivileged idiots
targeted me.

290
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,515
But those 75 students you chose…

291
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,084
They're not the ones who bullied you.

292
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,689
Kids from troubled homes are all the same.

293
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,524
This isn't prejudice.

294
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,760
It's data based on experience.

295
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,163
You're dealing with people here!

296
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,931
No matter what you say, I won't change!

297
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,036
I'll find success

298
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,539
somewhere else.

299
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,909
Moriguchi-sensei.

300
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:20,946
You don't trust anyone

301
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,616
but yourself.

302
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,951
And people like that

303
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,420
won't be trusted by anyone either.

304
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,492
An untrustworthy person
will never succeed.

305
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,695
No matter where you go,

306
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,165
you'll make the same mistakes.

307
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,279
I made your favorite food.

308
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,381
Can you eat it?

309
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,281
Mom…

310
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,251
this really isn't the time…

311
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:00,719
What?

312
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,588
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

313
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,060
THE PLAN TO EXPEL 75 STUDENTS!
DARK SIDE OF A PRESTIGIOUS HIGH SCHOOL.

314
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,728
-The backlash against Meishin
-Yes…

315
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,697
-just kept growing day by day…
-We apologize.

316
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,333
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

317
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,236
They're just writing
whatever gets clicks, huh.

318
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:22,674
Is Meishin going to get shut down?

319
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,876
Don't say that!

320
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,779
Guess I better start looking
for a new job…

321
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,347
Even if we try to transfer,

322
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,750
just being known as "former Meishin staff"
might get us turned away…

323
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,786
Unless we can restore
this school's reputation

324
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,522
And how exactly
are we supposed to do that?

325
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,824
Meishin isn't a bad school.

326
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,925
And the teachers here

327
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,227
at least from my point of view,
are genuinely great.

328
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,730
So we just need to
get others to understand that.

329
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,998
How do we do that?

330
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,833
I don't have a plan yet.

331
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,403
He's all fired up
but has absolutely no plan.

332
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,971
That's almost impressive.

333
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:54,807
-It's all empty.
-What?

334
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,608
Nothing inside. Zilch.

335
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,043
Vice Principal.

336
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,315
How long do you plan
to leave things like this?

337
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,818
I didn't plan this.

338
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,453
It's not my call to make.

339
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,622
You're pathetic!

340
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,393
So you want me to march outside

341
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,696
and tell the reporters
that Meishin isn't a bad school?

342
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,332
No matter what we say,

343
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,303
they'll twist it
and drag us through the mud again!

344
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,806
Forget about the media and the public!

345
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,442
What about our students
reading these articles?

346
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,543
Think about them!

347
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,723
Is this how celebrities feel

348
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,192
when they're being chased by reporters?

349
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,930
Actually, this disguise
just makes me stand out more.

350
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:56,869
Sensei!

351
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,473
What are you doing here?

352
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,144
Miyazawa!

353
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:06,879
It's been a while.

354
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,954
This is awkward…

355
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,091
I wonder if he still resents me…

356
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,326
Thank you for everything back then.

357
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,765
I've always wanted to thank you properly.

358
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,702
When I was expelled,
you really stood up for me.

359
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:33,872
Right now,

360
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,808
I'm working part-time
and studying to get into college.

361
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,045
I see.

362
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,381
That's great.

363
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,889
I saw everything about Meishin online,
and it's been on my mind.

364
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,293
The 75 expulsions…

365
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,198
I was one of them, right?

366
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,504
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,008
Please don't apologize.
I was the one who did something wrong.

368
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,978
I'm not trying to blame anyone.

369
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,117
Is everyone in Class 2-10 doing okay?

370
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,088
I'm not sure.

371
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,026
The school's closed right now,
so I haven't seen them.

372
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,562
I see.

373
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,799
After everything that happened,

374
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,034
if we still don't explain anything,

375
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,304
no one will ever trust this school again.

376
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,743
What are you going to do?

377
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,050
Honestly…

378
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,286
I don't even know what I should do.

379
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,923
I may not have all the answers,

380
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,461
but what you said saved me back then.

381
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,934
I think everyone…

382
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,603
still wants to hear from you.

383
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,280
So what exactly do you want?

384
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,519
I'm resigning from the school.

385
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,889
I no longer need to play your little game.

386
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,492
That's what I came to say.

387
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,394
Oh really?

388
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,231
You and I are alike.
We're both intelligent.

389
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,501
And because of that,
we tend to look down on others.

390
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,505
There are a lot of idiots in the world,
so it can't be helped.

391
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:47,839
But…

392
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,809
you and I…

393
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,245
we both grew too twisted.

394
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,382
Back in your first year,

395
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,118
as your homeroom teacher,
I met your parents once.

396
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:01,953
Your parents…

397
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,324
are neglectful and toxic.

398
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,192
Yes, I know.

399
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,394
They don't care about me at all.

400
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,765
Your desperate need for attention…

401
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,600
comes from them, doesn't it?

402
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,371
Back in middle school,
you were the center of attention

403
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,839
and that fulfilled you.

404
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,075
But in high school,

405
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,711
you realized you were smarter than most.

406
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,612
You began to look down on people.

407
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,482
Eventually,

408
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,019
you started manipulating others
and messing with them.

409
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,888
Just to feed that need for validation.

410
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,491
You became a messed-up person.

411
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,031
You and I…

412
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,900
we're both messed up.

413
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,571
So what?

414
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,842
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

415
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,415
Good morning, Shizuka-sensei.

416
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,450
Good morning.

417
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,286
A school without students
is really quiet, isn't it?

418
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,255
Sensei.

419
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,290
You scared me!

420
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,992
What are you doing here?

421
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,068
Why are you all here?

422
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,169
We came because

423
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,806
we have something we want to tell you.

424
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,444
At first,

425
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,679
I didn't like you at all.

426
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:39,217
When you called me out for bullying Iroha…

427
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,953
I kind of knew I was in the wrong…

428
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,955
But I didn't want to admit it.

429
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,161
When you said "Shut up, brat,"
I was seriously pissed.

430
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,731
But after that,

431
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:57,936
you kept sharing what you really believed.

432
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:03,508
Even if I didn't always agree,
I could tell you were sincere.

433
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,646
So I reflected on…

434
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,349
how I treated Iroha…

435
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,488
But now… what about you, sensei?

436
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,658
Didn't you once say

437
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,662
"If you can't understand feelings,
don't act like teasing is harmless."

438
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,466
So what about our feelings?
Do you understand them?

439
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,541
"When you fall for someone
who has a partner,

440
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:38,543
what matters is imagination.

441
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:42,314
You made that choice
so be prepared for the consequences."

442
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,650
You said that, sensei.

443
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,086
And I've never forgotten it.

444
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,291
So be ready to face the consequences.

445
00:24:56,127 --> 00:24:57,329
Don't you care…

446
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,700
what happens to us now?

447
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,569
Because I don't think you do.

448
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,841
That day…

449
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,277
I felt like I couldn't trust anyone.

450
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,546
But then you said,
"If you let hatred consume you,

451
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,915
you can't move forward."
That helped me let go.

452
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,352
So if you don't say something now,

453
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,355
I'll stop trusting people again.

454
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,123
Whenever we're struggling,

455
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:29,361
we want to know what you think…

456
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,395
We want to hear it.

457
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,234
The things you say

458
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,070
can be harsh

459
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,673
and they hit hard.

460
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,143
But because you say
things no one else will…

461
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,080
We know we can accept it…

462
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,716
when it's you saying them!

463
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,487
Sensei, remember what you told me?

464
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,957
"You made a mistake in the past.

465
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,494
If you reflect on your mistake
and want to earn trust again,

466
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,728
you need to show sincerity

467
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,666
more than anyone else."

468
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,937
What about you, sensei?

469
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,679
We are waiting for what you have to say.

470
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,374
You're right.

471
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,156
Vice Principal, I have something to say.

472
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,860
Please let us hold the school assembly.

473
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,795
Huh?

474
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,163
As soon as possible.

475
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,165
Tomorrow if possible.

476
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,935
We need to explain
everything to all the students.

477
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,504
What are you talking about?

478
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,905
I told you already.

479
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,408
-We're waiting-
-For how much longer?

480
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,214
You're just stalling
because you don't know what to do, right?

481
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,851
We made a mistake as a school,

482
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,453
And now we're ignoring it, saying nothing.

483
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,391
How would you feel
if the same thing was done to you?

484
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,963
What we tried to do
was no different from a company

485
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,866
laying off staff for business reasons.

486
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,101
You want me to tell the students that?

487
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:51,970
Yes.

488
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,106
Saying that would be
admitting the school was wrong.

489
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,808
That's why we should say it.

490
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,179
Education isn't about
sugarcoating everything.

491
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,416
If we did something wrong,
we need to apologize.

492
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:09,320
We need to explain how we plan
to do better going forward!

493
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:10,922
If you still care

494
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:14,225
about the students
as a teacher of Meishin…

495
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,367
I agree.

496
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,170
Me too!

497
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,939
But still…

498
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,247
Vice Principal…

499
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,485
Let's… hold the assembly tomorrow.

500
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,057
But…

501
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,662
what do we even say
in a situation like this?

502
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,300
Don't overthink it.

503
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,736
Just do

504
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,604
what you can.

505
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,774
That's all that matters.

506
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,256
Understood.

507
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,472
It's going to work out. I'm sure of it.

508
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,445
And what exactly makes you so sure?

509
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:48,987
I just choose to believe
what I want to believe.

510
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,194
-Okay, back up!
-I want to ask…

511
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,695
-An interview…
-Any comments about

512
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,397
-last night's news?
-Back up!

513
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,009
Good morning, everyone.

514
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,746
Today,
there is something I'd like to talk about.

515
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,516
It is about

516
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,085
the 75 expulsions.

517
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,288
It's…

518
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,224
all true.

519
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,964
But… this decision wasn't made

520
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,235
by the teachers as a whole…

521
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:43,107
If you watch this video that
was spread online,

522
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,275
it'll explain everything.

523
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,345
Moriguchi-sensei,
homeroom teacher for Class 2-5

524
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,849
and a candidate for the next chairman,

525
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,918
was the one who created this plan.

526
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,654
But the one…

527
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,359
who tried to carry it out was me.

528
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,429
Vice-Principal…

529
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,931
So yes…

530
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,933
the people ultimately responsible

531
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,971
were Moriguchi-sensei and myself.

532
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,575
I am…

533
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:19,944
truly sorry.

534
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,487
Wait a second!

535
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,923
May I ask a question?

536
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,525
What is it?

537
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,830
Are you saying
no other teachers share the blame?

538
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,267
If the rest of the staff
knew about the plan

539
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:45,303
and didn't stop it,
doesn't that make them just as guilty?

540
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,606
The other teachers

541
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:52,644
couldn't go against
those in charge of school management.

542
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,179
They had no choice but to stay quiet.

543
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,948
Huh? What?

544
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,317
So you're saying

545
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,353
they chose to protect themselves
rather than the students?

546
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,590
You call yourselves teachers?

547
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,163
Don't you have an answer?

548
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,801
Hey!

549
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,872
What is it?

550
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,841
Can you hear me?

551
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,344
Hey!

552
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,880
Shut up, brat!

553
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,943
What are you doing?

554
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,845
I didn't know what would happen today,

555
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,348
so I tried to imagine every possibility…

556
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,494
SCRIPT

557
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,535
Do you really enjoy tearing people down?

558
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,805
-What?
-You think teachers are your classmates?

559
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,175
You're enjoying ruining this school, huh?

560
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,610
Enjoying it?

561
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,178
What?

562
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,546
What are you talking about?

563
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:38,983
What?
The school's the one at fault, right?

564
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,621
I'm just delivering justice
to this school.

565
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,025
The word "justice" is meant for people
who want to make the world better.

566
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:51,662
Not for idiots who tear others down
just to watch it burn.

567
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,800
You enjoy ruining this school.

568
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:00,972
So what's so funny?

569
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,609
Even if I was,

570
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:10,114
if it makes the school better,
then what's the problem?

571
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,449
So you're admitting it?

572
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,317
So what if I admit it?

573
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,753
That video you're recording…

574
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,190
You're going to post it online, right?

575
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,263
Then make sure you post this next part
with zero edits.

576
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,207
Everything the Vice Principal said…

577
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:37,875
is true.

578
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,844
But that doesn't mean

579
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,881
Moriguchi-sensei and the Vice Principal
are the only ones responsible.

580
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,751
We teachers could've leaked this plan,

581
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,753
shut it down, and put an end to it.

582
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,422
But we didn't.

583
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,527
Leaking that list doesn't prove anything.

584
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,897
If they say, "I didn't know,"
that's the end of it.

585
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,666
On the contrary,

586
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,136
it would stir up confusion
and anxiety among students.

587
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,207
That's why we resisted this plan

588
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,809
without making it public.

589
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,746
We did everything we could
so no student would be expelled.

590
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,850
We tried to render this list meaningless!

591
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,252
Do you have any proof
you actually did all that?

592
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,655
-Anyone can say it after the fact.
-You're right.

593
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:28,059
Whether or not we really did those things…

594
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,895
There's no proof.

595
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:35,933
All we can do now is ask you to trust us!

596
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,569
Seriously?

597
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,774
This world is overflowing
with information.

598
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,613
From now on, you'll constantly have to
sift through it all

599
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:51,048
to find the truth.

600
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,418
Finding the truth.

601
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:58,322
In other words, deciding what to believe.

602
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,926
You'll be choosing what to believe

603
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,895
without always having proof or facts.

604
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,198
It isn't easy.

605
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,835
Psychologically speaking,

606
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,405
negative information
is especially powerful.

607
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,175
Like someone you love cheating on you,

608
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,912
or that a kind person
has done something awful,

609
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,381
or that your friend
is talking behind your back.

610
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:28,286
Even if there's no real evidence,
rumors like that…

611
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,855
make you suspicious and afraid.

612
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,992
Con artists mix a little truth
into a big pot of lies,

613
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,130
and use it to manipulate people.

614
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,335
There's so much malicious information

615
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,104
designed to deceive people.

616
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,840
That's why choosing what to believe
isn't easy.

617
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,010
So what should we rely on?

618
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,716
Trust.

619
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,487
To me, trust

620
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:09,060
is the feeling of wanting to believe
in someone else.

621
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,030
Not built by information,
but human connection.

622
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,800
Who said this? Where did it come from?

623
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,203
If you have trust,
then even when you're unsure,

624
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,005
you can believe it.

625
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,740
And having someone

626
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,443
you can trust in the first place…

627
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,545
That's the strongest of all.

628
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,420
I don't trust you.

629
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,655
I'm sure you don't.

630
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,458
I don't trust you either.

631
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,263
Didn't I just say?

632
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,366
Trust is something you build together.

633
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,603
You really think

634
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,039
those kids in Class 2-10 trust you?

635
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,076
I think they do.

636
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,215
Because I've lectured you all

637
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,984
again and again and again…

638
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,622
The most important part of a lecture is…

639
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,659
having a trusting relationship.

640
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:21,098
I trusted in the words
I shared with everyone.

641
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,535
I trusted that…

642
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,706
they would take them to heart and reflect.

643
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,277
Trust isn't something
one person creates alone.

644
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,780
It's built together.

645
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,717
When I first arrived here,

646
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,621
no one trusted me.

647
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,258
And I didn't care if they did.

648
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:50,261
But now…

649
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,798
it's different.

650
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,769
I believe we have a trusting relationship.

651
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,306
I don't have any reason or proof, but…

652
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,941
I…

653
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,411
want you to believe in us, your teachers.

654
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,789
I believe in you.

655
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,491
Seriously?

656
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:23,994
She's a liar!

657
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,797
I want to believe in her.

658
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,933
At least more than you.

659
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,937
I believe in you too.

660
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,172
I do too!

661
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,576
Geez… you're all such idiots.

662
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,177
Same here!

663
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,113
I do too.

664
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,181
Me too!

665
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,616
-Me too.
-I do too!

666
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:46,717
-Same here.
-Yes.

667
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,052
-Me too.
-I believe you.

668
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,154
-Same here.
-Me too!

669
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:58,262
Thank you.

670
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,940
Go to tomorrow's school assembly.

671
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,575
Why should I?

672
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,378
To hear what Urumi-sensei has to say.

673
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,982
You'll realize what it is you're missing.

674
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:22,980
Wakisaka!

675
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,420
Find someone…

676
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,756
you can trust.

677
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,692
Trust?

678
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,896
I'm not interested.

679
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,403
If you keep going like this…

680
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,573
you'll end up just like me.

681
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:05,389
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

682
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,526
Oh, right! Aika's thinking about
returning to teaching.

683
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,662
-What?
-She's job hunting right now.

684
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,064
What kind of teacher do you want to be?

685
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,434
I want to be a teacher
who is trusted by the students.

686
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,273
Thanks for everything.

687
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,075
No problem.

688
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,012
So what do you say?
Wanna go out for drinks tonight?

689
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,481
You're just going to get a cola, right?

690
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,582
Of course!

691
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,652
How about you Seira-sensei?

692
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,224
Seira-sensei…

693
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,561
has a mixer tonight with me!

694
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,729
So, yes…

695
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,867
Time to rebuild, huh?

696
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,535
Right?

697
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:52,803
Right?

698
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,405
Don't jump in.

699
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:57,441
Right?

700
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,344
-Of course, right?
-Right?

701
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,179
Oh no!

702
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,982
-We're late!
-Hey, no running!

703
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,016
Yes!

704
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:12,189
Conveying your thoughts
without being misunderstood is difficult.

705
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,159
Even if you believe you're right,

706
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,630
that doesn't mean
the other person will agree.

707
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:22,833
And more than anything…

708
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,569
forcing your beliefs on someone

709
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,306
might hurt them,

710
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,510
or even backfire on you.

711
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,682
I ran away from that mess…

712
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,285
But…

713
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,556
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

714
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,826
There are times…

715
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:52,696
when you just have to speak your mind.

716
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:57,067
SCRIPT

717
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:02,139
Today,
there's something I want to tell you!

718
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,977
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
