00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,871
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,942
Time and freedom also greatly impact
an individual's happiness.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:09,843
With limited time…

4
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,611
It’s been a few days since…

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,480
Because of something Shizuka Urumi said…

6
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:14,981
My sister died!

7
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:15,882
I’ll never forgive you!

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,451
Aika Sensei's painful past…

9
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,719
Why are you a teacher?

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:23,757
How it pushed her
into a fragile mental state…

11
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:24,824
I can’t forgive that!

12
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,393
Never!

13
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,230
And my feelings…

14
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:32,766
It’s to help students who are struggling,
like that girl.

15
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,534
Please…

16
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,736
let me remain your teacher.

17
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:42,208
These kids accepted everything.

18
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,210
…becomes harder to feel that way.

19
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,414
Next, Watanuki.

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,984
On the other hand, using your time
according to your own will…

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,986
Nanami and Watanuki?

22
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,755
Yes. I told everyone in class.

23
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,725
That this time,
we shouldn’t tell our parents,

24
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:02,529
or spread it around, or post about it
on social media for fun.

25
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:06,599
If that drove you or Aika-sensei
into a corner, I’d hate that.

26
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,568
Thank you.

27
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,937
Everyone likes you, sensei.

28
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,573
I see…

29
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,010
Sensei?

30
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,280
It’s been forever
since someone said they liked me.

31
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,715
And now I’m grinning harder
than I expected.

32
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,652
Can’t let her see me like this…
Get it together!

33
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,524
What’s wrong?

34
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,094
What do you mean?

35
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,796
You were covering your face…

36
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,166
It's nothing.

37
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,635
Let’s go.

38
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,508
What were we talking about again?

39
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,944
About how everyone likes you, sensei.

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,315
Naito.

41
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,617
Oh! Wakisaka-kun!

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,522
Nice to meet you, Shizuka Urumi-sensei.

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,457
Who?

44
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,360
I’m Haruki Wakisaka.

45
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,828
HARUKI WAKISAKA

46
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,530
Haruki Wakisaka.

47
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,133
Currently undergoing treatment
due to poor health.

48
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,271
Haruki Wakisaka?

49
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,073
Yes.

50
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,843
Rright! You’re Wakisaka from my class!

51
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,445
You didn’t realize, did you?

52
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,548
Not really…

53
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,451
Are you okay being out like this?

54
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,052
You are still recovering, right?

55
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,054
I’ve been feeling a bit better lately.

56
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,589
So I’ve been going out once in a while.

57
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,993
-Then, will you be back at school soon?
-Maybe.

58
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,095
Are you two close?

59
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,564
We went to the same junior high, right?

60
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,600
Wait. Wait, the way you answer it,

61
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,770
it's like we're just normal classmates,
and not close at all.

62
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,205
That’s not what I meant…

63
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,241
Then you should’ve said
"we’re close" first…

64
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,677
Otherwise, it sounds like you’re denying--

65
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,745
You’re so annoying!

66
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,813
Sorry. I guess we’re not that close.

67
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,885
So that’s the kind of person you are.
Didn’t expect that.

68
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,823
Since I haven’t been at school,
you thought I was gloomy?

69
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,825
No… It’s just…

70
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,062
Your hair color is pretty unique,
so you weren’t quite

71
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:17,931
what I imagined…

72
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,968
Naito said you’re different
from other teachers,

73
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,505
but maybe you’re just old-fashioned
and full of prejudice.

74
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,910
I’m kidding.

75
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,079
Knock it off.

76
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:39,552
But I heard from Naito
that you’re a really good teacher.

77
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,823
We bumped into each other the other day
and ended up talking a lot.

78
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,525
I see.

79
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,127
She told me…

80
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:50,496
About you and Aika-sensei…

81
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,432
Hey! I told you not to bring that up!

82
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,767
Please don't think I'm a loudmouth.

83
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,036
-Wakisaka-kun is in Class 2-10 so--
-Sensei.

84
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,373
Will you…

85
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,309
help me?

86
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,512
Naito told me.

87
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,451
If someone asks for help,
you’ll save them, right?

88
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,858
I can’t help everyone,
but if someone like me

89
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,996
is someone they can turn to,

90
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,099
then I want to share my thoughts…

91
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,535
to help them.

92
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,674
I…

93
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,247
was bullied in my first year.

94
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,953
I’ve never heard about you

95
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,122
being bullied before…

96
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,891
Wasn't it the same for you?

97
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,295
-What?
-No one noticed,

98
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,964
but Urumi-sensei saved you, didn’t she?

99
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,472
I’m still suffering.

100
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,644
Who did what to you?

101
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,248
Who did what to me?

102
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,719
Like with Naito,
I want you to figure it out.

103
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,124
And then,
please make the people who bullied me

104
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,260
apologize to me.

105
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:32,699
If you can’t do that…

106
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,706
then I’ll get my revenge on them.

107
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:42,675
Revenge?

108
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,179
What are you planning to do?

109
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,917
They need to suffer more than I have.

110
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,094
Please.

111
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,566
What? Seriously?

112
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,406
-Good morning.
-Hey.

113
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,874
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

114
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,075
Shizuka-sensei!

115
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,314
What’s wrong? You look like a zombie!

116
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,982
Come on, don't be so gloomy.

117
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,052
He bounces back fast…

118
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,720
-Aika! Stop it!
-You have no right

119
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,021
-to be a teacher!
-After that…

120
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,022
Please stop, Aika!

121
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,524
how is he so happy?

122
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,227
Want some chocolate?
A sugar boost will cheer you up.

123
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,397
He really just lives without thinking…

124
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,067
Urami-sensei was actually really sad.

125
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,903
But when he saw you

126
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,906
talk honestly in front of the students,

127
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,141
he said it made him think.

128
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,144
I figured me getting depressed
wouldn’t help anyone.

129
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,980
So if anything happens, just say the word.

130
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,649
I’ll help you however I can.

131
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,521
Sorry for thinking
you never think about anything…

132
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:07,059
Shizuka-sensei has been through
so much already.

133
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:11,130
If something happens again,
it'd be like a sick joke.

134
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,335
What?

135
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,304
Did something happen again?

136
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:19,772
HARUKI WAKISAKA

137
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,041
He stopped coming to school
around February

138
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,811
of the first year due to poor health.

139
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,147
His parents just told us
he’d come back when he felt better.

140
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,417
He had enough attendance,

141
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,786
his grades were excellent,
so we let him advance.

142
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,821
REPORT CARD
GRADES-EXCELLENT

143
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,224
But even after the new school year,
they said he wasn’t getting better.

144
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,728
We’ve just been waiting…
That’s the situation.

145
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,532
Do we know who bullied him?

146
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,203
No idea…

147
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:54,140
Honestly, I barely remember him at all.

148
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,143
Same here. I wasn’t his homeroom teacher,

149
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,044
so I don’t remember much…

150
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,613
Who was his first-year teacher?

151
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,215
Moriguchi-sensei.

152
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,783
Moriguchi-sensei?

153
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,719
Now that you mention it,

154
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,921
Moriguchi-sensei made such a fuss,

155
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,823
but since then, he hasn’t been at school.

156
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,792
What happened to him?

157
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,697
If you want to talk about problems,
what about the things you’ve done?

158
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,603
Like the issue
of the expulsion list being leaked…

159
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,005
Is that a threat?

160
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,213
That list was a decision made
by the board of directors.

161
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,583
If that gets out…

162
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,288
it could mean the end
for Meishin Private Academy.

163
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,156
That's right.

164
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,360
So I told the Chairman.

165
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,662
"Are you okay with that happening?"

166
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,264
Then he said…

167
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,033
That was something he did on his own.

168
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,370
It has nothing to do with the board.

169
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,272
That's what he said.

170
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,544
Knowing him,

171
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,047
he might just blame it all on you.

172
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,353
I know you've been working
behind the scenes…

173
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,690
trying to manipulate that old man!

174
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,761
You can try to blame it on me…

175
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,964
But I won’t go down quietly.

176
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,100
MEISHIN ACADEMY

177
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,969
I never intended to blame you!

178
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:33,806
I…

179
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,442
want to help you.

180
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,818
If Moriguchi-sensei isn’t coming,
then what do we do?

181
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,658
Maybe we should just wait
and see how things go for now?

182
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,728
I disagree.

183
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:00,299
Wakisaka went all the way
to see Shizuka-sensei.

184
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,302
That means Wakisaka
is reaching out to you for help.

185
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,005
A teacher doesn’t ignore
a student’s cry for help.

186
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,873
-That is a real teacher.
-Hold on a second.

187
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,179
Why are you just casually
part of this meeting?

188
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,180
Yeah…

189
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,849
Weren’t you on Moriguchi’s side?

190
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,387
Well, a lot happened
and I did lean that way for a bit…

191
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,123
In my heart,
I was always with the principal.

192
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,661
Now that Moriguchi’s side is gone,

193
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,764
both my body and heart
belong to the principal's side.

194
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,399
I'm back!

195
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,003
Are Moriguchi and his lackeys
really gone, though?

196
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,407
I don't know,
but they caused a lot of trouble.

197
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,975
They should be punished for it.

198
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,644
Both Moriguchi-sensei
and the vice-principal.

199
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,878
The vice-principal…

200
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,314
He's…

201
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,150
He’s not a bad person, deep down.

202
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,121
So, what did you want to talk about?

203
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,856
Please…

204
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:02,094
stop following Moriguchi-sensei’s orders.

205
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,599
This has nothing to do with you.

206
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,334
You’re right.

207
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,570
We are strangers now.

208
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,608
But I can’t stand to see you
keep heading down

209
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:20,579
the wrong path as an educator.

210
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,114
Wrong path?

211
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,818
-You think I-
-It is wrong!

212
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,986
Look at this!

213
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,489
Trying to expel these kids.

214
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,626
-This can't be the right thing to do!
-Stop it!

215
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,395
How could this ever be the right thing
to do as a teacher?

216
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,536
This list…

217
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:46,305
doesn’t mean anything anymore.

218
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,979
I heard the Chairman was against it too.

219
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,184
If that’s true,

220
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,853
this is nothing more…

221
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,923
than a piece of paper.

222
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,330
Thanks for being concerned…

223
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:13,299
about me.

224
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,006
So…

225
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,909
let’s not go too hard
on the vice-principal.

226
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:24,910
Excuse me.

227
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,481
Right now,
the vice-principal isn’t the issue.

228
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,850
Let’s focus on Wakisaka.

229
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,652
Of course.

230
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,022
First,
we need to find out more about Wakisaka.

231
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,158
But how?

232
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,763
Why not ask Moriguchi-sensei?

233
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,269
EXPULSION LIST

234
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,973
LEADERSHIP, EDUCATION…

235
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,431
SANSADA DINING

236
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,635
Did we really have to meet
somewhere like this?

237
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,438
It would be risky to invite you
into my apartment.

238
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,108
What do you mean, "risky"?

239
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,813
Not that you’d do anything to me…

240
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,948
but if I did something to you…

241
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,716
I mean, hypothetically…

242
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,787
It’s just risk management.

243
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,691
If you said I did something to you,

244
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,494
it’d be hard for me to disprove it.

245
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,399
Better to meet in a public space.

246
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:55,467
I see.

247
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,468
Besides,

248
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,171
I was hungry.

249
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,739
Thank you for waiting.

250
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,074
Enjoy your meal.

251
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,647
Why are you not coming to school?

252
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,551
-That’s none of your business.
-It isn't.

253
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:18,490
You’ve been absent for a few days,
so I’m just making conversation.

254
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,528
I don’t need small talk.
Just say what you came to say.

255
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,333
It’s about Haruki Wakisaka.

256
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,673
He was a student in your first-year class.

257
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,145
What kind of student was he?

258
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,617
How am I supposed to answer that?

259
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,121
Was Wakisaka bullied?

260
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,662
Why are you asking me?

261
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:02,868
Yesterday, he came to me and said,

262
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,339
"Make the people
who bullied me apologize."

263
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,615
Tell me about Wakisaka-kun.

264
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,685
Please.

265
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,625
I…

266
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,028
don’t like you.

267
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,833
Why should I help someone I don’t like?

268
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,336
Thank you for waiting.

269
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,039
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

270
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,081
Moriguchi-sensei!

271
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,458
He said,
"I won’t help someone I don't like"?

272
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,762
-Yes…
-Seriously? What is he, a kid?

273
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,401
-What?
-Doesn’t that mean he likes you?

274
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,603
What?

275
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,008
When guys act mean to the girl they like…
It’s that kind of thing, right?

276
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,578
He’s not in elementary school.

277
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,049
-Still…
-He kind of seems like the childish type.

278
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:27,252
Totally. He doesn’t seem like he has
any relationship experience at all.

279
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,354
Right?

280
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,823
-He clearly doesn’t understand women.
-Yeah…

281
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,391
-Oguchi-sensei!
-What?

282
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,728
Oh… Moriguchi-sensei!

283
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,765
It’s been so long!
We were so worried about you!

284
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,708
Feeling better?

285
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,685
Then let’s get back to work,
Moriguchi-sensei.

286
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,862
I'm glad to see you back.

287
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:13,332
To be honest,

288
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,202
I thought
you might never return to the school.

289
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,806
I’m…

290
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,809
going to be this
school’s future administrator.

291
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,145
This is just a minor setback.

292
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,789
I look forward to working with you again.

293
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,129
I’m sorry…

294
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:46,331
but I can no longer

295
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,168
cooperate with you.

296
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:59,311
Please make the people who bullied me
apologize to me.

297
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,780
If you can’t do that…

298
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,348
then…

299
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,951
I’ll get my revenge on them.

300
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,227
Hey.

301
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,864
Are you and Wakisaka close?

302
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,769
Not really…
We just went to the same junior high.

303
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,439
The other day,
you guys were with Shizuka-sensei…

304
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,145
I saw it.

305
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,818
Isn’t he supposed to be out sick?

306
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,423
He said he’s been feeling a bit better,

307
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,391
so he’s been going out.

308
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,997
So, what were you talking about?

309
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,035
Something sensitive?

310
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,174
What are you two whispering about?

311
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,248
Hey. Anyone know anything about
Haruki Wakisaka from his first year?

312
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,383
What kind of info about Wakisaka?

313
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,220
Apparently, Wakisaka said
he was bullied in his first year.

314
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,322
I want to figure out who did it.

315
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,858
Were you in the same class?

316
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,666
Back in first year,
I was in 1-5 with Wakisaka.

317
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,304
He was always alone.
Most of the class hardly talked to him.

318
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:38,143
As far as I know, no one bullied him.

319
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,112
I see.

320
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,185
You asked everyone about Wakisaka, for me?

321
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,520
I thought asking the whole class
would be quicker.

322
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,523
I didn’t want to make a big deal of it,

323
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,525
but thank you.

324
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,661
You're welcome!

325
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,298
We didn’t really find anything useful.

326
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,699
What?

327
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,801
No one remembers talking to Wakisaka.

328
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,538
Everyone from 1-5
didn't have much of an impression of him.

329
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,973
In the end,

330
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,010
all we learned
was that no one knows anything about him.

331
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,813
Well, yeah. That’s true…

332
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,849
Sensei.

333
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,285
What is it?

334
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,120
That's not true.

335
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,690
What?

336
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,392
That’s not the Wakisaka
I knew in junior high.

337
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,196
He wasn’t the quiet type.

338
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,632
He wasn't like that.

339
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,102
He was bright,

340
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,137
always cracking jokes,

341
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,439
and really smart.

342
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,375
Everyone looked up to him.

343
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:47,746
When he talked with you,
that was the impression he gave off…

344
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,151
It’s not that weird for someone
to change between

345
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,419
junior high and high school.

346
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,824
Are we sure he was actually bullied?

347
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:14,606
Sensei.

348
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,652
Any progress?

349
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,488
Progress?

350
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,924
Did you find out who bullied me?

351
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,462
I did some digging,

352
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:42,100
but no one said anything
about you being bullied.

353
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,470
I see…

354
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,507
The students from 1-5

355
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,510
said you seemed standoffish,

356
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,212
but didn’t mention bullying.

357
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:58,717
He's crying?

358
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,321
Sensei…

359
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,325
Why do you think bullying never stops?

360
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,428
Because--

361
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:12,164
Bullies don’t realize their mistakes.

362
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,203
They don’t realize they’ve hurt someone.

363
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,005
That’s why bullying never ends.

364
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:24,476
That’s why the people who bully

365
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:28,146
need to acknowledge their actions
and make amends.

366
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,383
That’s what education is, isn’t it?

367
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,924
Naito told me
what you’ve done since coming to Meishin.

368
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,595
I believed you’d find the ones who hurt me

369
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,331
and make them face what they did.

370
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,401
That's what I believed.

371
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,538
But I’m disappointed…

372
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,742
You’ve failed as an educator.

373
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,780
So, like I said,

374
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,015
then I have no choice
but to get revenge on them.

375
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,452
What are you planning to do?

376
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,720
I just want the people

377
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,691
who bullied me
to recognize their wrongdoing.

378
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:14,659
And I want the so-called educators

379
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,396
who failed to uncover the truth
to feel regret and shame.

380
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,235
What you're saying is too extreme…

381
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,103
I believe that to truly change society,

382
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,939
bold and extreme views
are sometimes necessary.

383
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,277
Sensei…

384
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,614
Please take this seriously.

385
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:39,151
Take it seriously?

386
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,154
I’ll wait until tomorrow.

387
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,224
Tomorrow, at this time.

388
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,594
Until 8:00 p.m.

389
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:55,834
Bring the people who bullied me
and make them apologize.

390
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,103
Otherwise,

391
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,807
I’ll take revenge, with my own hands.

392
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,990
URUMI

393
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,127
Why are you here?

394
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,262
Why am I here?

395
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,999
Come on, not the first time I barged
into your house.

396
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,001
It isn't you I'm surprised about.

397
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,237
It's him…

398
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,674
Wow, I'm so happy you can eat this much!

399
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,642
This is incredible!

400
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:40,645
Your cooking is amazing, Ms. Urumi.

401
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,447
-Oh stop it, I'm so happy!
-Yeah!

402
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,049
Why are you here too?

403
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,585
Well, I didn’t properly thank you…

404
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,386
I can’t understand a word!

405
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:51,456
Urami-sensei, are you and Shizuka
in a relationship?

406
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,124
-No!
-No, we aren't!

407
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,194
He already has a girlfriend.

408
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,665
Really? Then you are seeing Shizuka,
even though you have a girlfriend?

409
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,833
-No, not like that!
-No!

410
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,635
What is going on here?

411
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,937
We’re just colleagues.

412
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,105
He’s my senpai at work.

413
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:12,577
Oh, I see…
Well, since he came over, I figured…

414
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:17,082
Yeah, I guess anyone would think that.

415
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,185
So, what are you doing here?

416
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,220
Urami-sensei said

417
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,657
he wanted to properly thank you
for what happened with Aika.

418
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,296
That was absolutely delicious,

419
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,299
Shizuka-sensei…

420
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,334
Thank you very much.

421
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,104
It’s nothing.

422
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,840
Thank you for confronting Aika,
and not running away.

423
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,378
But that doesn’t mean she forgave me.

424
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:50,348
I think she already has.

425
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,420
And, forgive… I don’t think
you were in the wrong to begin with.

426
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,758
It just feels like
a weight has been lifted.

427
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,861
She’s starting to go back
to the way she used to be.

428
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,600
Thank you so much.

429
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,972
Hey…

430
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:15,907
you seem gloomy…

431
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:22,347
In this situation,
you'd normally smile or shed tears…

432
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,219
I'm extremely happy, though.

433
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:30,555
It's…

434
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,924
about Wakisaka.

435
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,527
It’s not exactly a happy situation…

436
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,262
Did something happen?

437
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,138
Eight p.m. tomorrow night?

438
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:53,411
I really don’t know what to do…

439
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,055
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

440
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,290
-Good morning.
-Hey.

441
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,224
Good morning.

442
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,161
-Good morning.
-Morning.

443
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,564
Good morning.

444
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,636
Please wait, Moriguchi-sensei!

445
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,971
Moriguchi-sensei!

446
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,207
What is it?

447
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:27,178
Back in 1-5, who was bullying Wakisaka?

448
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,749
Please, just tell me anything.

449
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,350
Even the smallest hunch. Anything you saw!

450
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:35,420
Tell me what you saw in Class 1-5.

451
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,557
I…

452
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,726
don’t like you.

453
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:46,131
So I have no interest in helping you.

454
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,632
I already told you that.

455
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,202
See you.

456
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,573
Enough already!

457
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:02,180
Whether you like me or not doesn’t matter!

458
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,716
If you’re a teacher,

459
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,786
you should be putting the students
before your petty feelings!

460
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,223
Enough already!

461
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,228
Whether you like me or not doesn’t matter!

462
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,097
If you’re a teacher,

463
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,233
you should be putting the students
before your petty feelings!

464
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,937
You let your emotions get in the way.
That’s just pathetic!

465
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,239
Fine!

466
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,008
Students are watching, so calm down.

467
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,242
That doesn’t matter.

468
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,378
I’m not leaving
until you tell me what you know!

469
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,880
-Wait! Just wait a second!
-Are you going to tell me?

470
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,584
What is that?

471
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,319
Up.

472
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,454
MEISHIN

473
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,788
About your question,

474
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:49,127
I never actually saw
Wakisaka getting bullied.

475
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:56,835
Why not just have
the former students in Class 5 apologize?

476
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:04,576
But maybe it wasn’t even someone
from Class 5.

477
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,011
Then…

478
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,282
why not make the whole school apologize?

479
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,384
That’s not realistic.

480
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,686
I don't know!

481
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,287
What do you mean "I don't know?"

482
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,723
You were his homeroom teacher!

483
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:24,295
But Wakisaka asked you, Shizuka…

484
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,700
Urumi-sensei, right?

485
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:35,340
MEISHIN

486
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,250
HARUKI WAKISAKA

487
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,484
THANK YOU. I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

488
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,254
HOW IS SHIZUKA URUMI DOING?

489
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,601
SHE’S BACKED INTO A CORNER.

490
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,537
THERE’S NOTHING MORE SHE CAN DO.

491
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,948
Shizuka-sensei.

492
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,818
Can we talk?

493
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,921
SCIENCE PREP ROOM

494
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,525
Come in.

495
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,167
Aika-sensei…

496
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,304
It’s been a while.

497
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,874
"A while"?

498
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:47,278
It hasn’t even been that long
since your big speech.

499
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,950
You’re right.

500
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,752
Um… I mean…

501
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,356
You had no problem going on and on
in front of all those students.

502
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,093
I’m sorry.

503
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,930
I don’t think I ever properly apologized…

504
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:08,566
It’s fine.

505
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,770
It’s not your fault that Karen died.

506
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,774
I just took out…

507
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,311
all my helpless anger on you.

508
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,382
There is no way Karen would hate you.

509
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,152
I couldn't understand something so simple.

510
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,358
I’m truly sorry.

511
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,627
No, please…

512
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,530
When I heard what you said the other day,
something changed in me.

513
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,501
Thank you…

514
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,703
Though it feels…

515
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,438
strange to say that.

516
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,913
That’s great.

517
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:57,148
I had hoped you two could make peace.

518
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,118
Now, how about a BBQ sometime?

519
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,519
Right?

520
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:04,856
That might be a little much for now…

521
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,730
Did you come all this way
just to say that?

522
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,699
That's one reason.

523
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,567
The real reason is…

524
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,503
What is it?

525
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,706
It's about Haruki Wakisaka.

526
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,757
JUNE 13TH, FRIDAY
19:58

527
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,669
FRIDAY, JUNE 13
19:59

528
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,010
What? You didn’t go?

529
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,611
Nope.

530
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,082
Why not?

531
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,189
You said you had something
you wanted to tell me about Wakisaka?

532
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,724
Yeah.

533
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,095
Wakisaka told me the same thing.

534
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,933
It was near the end of his first year.

535
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,003
Sensei.

536
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:03,608
There’s something
I want to talk to you about.

537
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,309
About what?

538
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,815
It’s about bullying.

539
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,486
You’re being bullied?

540
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,357
-Yes.
-By someone in 1-5? Who is it?

541
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,326
I can’t say.
If I do, they’ll know I ratted them out…

542
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,861
I won’t tell anyone!

543
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,730
Sensei, find out who it is!

544
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,202
I’ll never forgive the ones
who bullied me.

545
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,204
That’s why…

546
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,940
make them apologize!

547
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,277
If you can’t do that…

548
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:45,249
I’ll take revenge with my own hands.

549
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,718
I knew I had to do something…

550
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:54,092
I did everything I could to find out
who was bullying him.

551
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:55,860
But…

552
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,762
But?

553
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,834
I couldn’t find a single shred of evidence
that he was being bullied.

554
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,038
And around that point…

555
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,606
I won't forgive you!

556
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,475
Because of you!

557
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,312
I caused trouble and ended up resigning.

558
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,249
I was overwhelmed,

559
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,052
and I stopped thinking about Wakisaka-kun.

560
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,822
But then…

561
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,758
he showed up again.

562
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:30,995
I’ve left Meishin.

563
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,432
There’s nothing I can do for you anymore.

564
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,839
I thought someone who lost their sister
to bullying would help me…

565
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,375
My sister?

566
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,545
-How do you know?
-It’s not that hard to find out.

567
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:48,913
Just a little research.

568
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,157
This is disappointing.

569
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:00,958
Disappointing?

570
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,794
If you’re gone,

571
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,598
there’s no one left for me
to mess with, right?

572
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:14,872
Mess with?

573
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,075
The whole thing was a lie.
He wasn't bullied.

574
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,078
He had no intention of getting revenge.

575
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,781
He was just messing with me…

576
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,086
But why would he do that?

577
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:31,822
I don’t know.

578
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,928
What the heck?

579
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,463
That’s what happened…

580
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,206
She didn’t show up,
even though it was past eight.

581
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,411
I was looking forward
to seeing her squirm.

582
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:57,048
I guess she figured out I was lying, huh?

583
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,684
Hey!

584
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,430
So boring.

585
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,067
Got any better ideas for toying with her?

586
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,706
That’s enough already.

587
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:25,409
Why are you backing off?

588
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,046
You hate Shizuka Urumi too, don’t you?

589
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,585
You promised to help me.

590
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,154
"Help"?

591
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,224
You’re blackmailing me.

592
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,464
You mean this?

593
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,899
EXPULSION LIST

594
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,669
Wrong path? You think I-

595
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,237
It is wrong!

596
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:54,772
Look at this!

597
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,776
Trying to expel these kids.

598
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:01,145
-This can't be the right thing to do!
-Stop it!

599
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,315
How could this be the right thing
to do, as a teacher?

600
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,284
This list…

601
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,854
doesn’t mean anything anymore.

602
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,524
This is nothing more
than a piece of paper.

603
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,804
CLASS 2-10

604
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,341
If you don’t want this getting out,

605
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:36,113
you’d better keep cooperating with me.

606
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,188
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

607
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,089
Good morning.

608
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,037
Why didn’t you come yesterday?

609
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,741
Because I knew you wouldn’t do anything.

610
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,578
It was all a lie, wasn’t it?

611
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,217
I don’t know why you’re playing games
with teachers,

612
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,620
but your lies are disgusting.

613
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,892
Let’s end this little game, okay?

614
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:26,464
If the other person refuses to play,

615
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,399
the game’s over.

616
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,569
See you.

617
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,916
She’s more fun to mess with
than I thought.

618
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,956
Moriguchi-sensei.

619
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,197
I just thought of something really fun…

620
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,340
Yeah!

621
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,042
What the heck?

622
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,750
MEISHIN

623
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,020
Alright then, please get started
on the worksheet problems.

624
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,962
A few days passed

625
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,799
and Wakisaka didn’t do anything.

626
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,203
What is he thinking now?

627
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,776
He didn’t show up today, either?

628
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,450
Moriguchi-sensei hasn’t shown up
since that day…

629
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,687
To be honest… right now…

630
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,657
it's so nice!

631
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,596
It’s peaceful, isn't it?

632
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:08,098
It really is.

633
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,635
Peace and quiet is the best.

634
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,838
Sure is.

635
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,940
But still…

636
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,742
Doesn't this peace make you nervous?

637
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,744
Yes. It does.

638
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,715
Since I came here, every day
has brought new trouble.

639
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,117
So when things suddenly go quiet,
it makes me feel…

640
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,186
scared.

641
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,858
That’s such a waste of mental energy.
You really don’t need to think like that.

642
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,961
When you act this relaxed and carefree…

643
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,396
that’s what makes it feel like
something bad is coming.

644
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:42,166
-Right?
-What?

645
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,803
Alright! Let’s all have a BBQ soon!
What do you think?

646
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,338
Again?

647
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,906
What? You're…

648
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,075
Hey, have you seen this?

649
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,312
What is this?

650
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,681
Looks like it’s already spreading online…

651
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,283
What?

652
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,789
Hello, this is Meishin Private Academy.

653
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:10,060
Is it true
you're planning to expel 75 students?

654
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,730
Um… may I ask who’s calling?

655
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:19,870
This is it.

MEISHIN TRYING TO EXPEL

659
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,346
A reporter from Weekly Truth called.

660
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:32,016
They want to interview us about this.

661
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,319
So? What did you say?

662
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:39,557
Such requests need to go through
proper channels…

663
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,025
What?

664
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:42,726
That's irresponsible.

665
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:48,766
Oguchi-sensei followed proper procedure
for this kind of situation.

666
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,936
So what’s the plan?

667
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,672
There’s going to be more media attention.

668
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:59,209
Just… deny everything.

669
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,913
So we lie?

670
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,415
Lie?

671
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:05,883
This expulsion list…

672
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,686
was approved by the board, right?

673
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,623
No. That was something
Kai and Vice-Principal Shinjo’s

674
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,125
Reform Committee did on their own.

675
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,027
The board had nothing to do with it.

676
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,264
So…

677
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,399
you’ll blame it on us?

00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,282
-Hey look!
-Isn't this crazy?

681
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,750
-Crazy, huh?
-What?

682
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,151
-Huh?
-Oh my god.

683
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,953
-Isn't this…
-Oh no…

684
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,258
Check this out!

685
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,994
Let’s have our next barbecue here!

686
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,928
What do you think?

687
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,130
-I’ll pass.
-Why?

688
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:58,369
This was the beginning of the
biggest scandal Meishin had ever seen.

689
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,749
Spread what I'm about to say
without cutting anything!

690
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,818
You all coordinated your stories
and pretended not to know, right?

691
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:16,520
Sensei, did you go along with it as well?

692
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,355
I want you to believe in us teachers!
