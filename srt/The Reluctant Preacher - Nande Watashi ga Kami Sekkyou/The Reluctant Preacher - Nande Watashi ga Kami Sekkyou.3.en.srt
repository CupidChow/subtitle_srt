1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,073
From today, I will be the Chairman of…

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,975
the School Reform Committee.

3
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,645
We will expel these 75 students

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,548
by the end…

5
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,386
of this school year.

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,821
-Expel?
-Expel students?

7
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:25,058
<i>What is Moriguchi-sensei talking about?</i>

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,461
<i>It's just so sudden, I can't keep up.</i>

9
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,931
There’s a lot I want to ask,

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:34,534
but why is Moriguchi-sensei
the head of the reform committee?

11
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,637
He was appointed by the chairman.

12
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,005
The chairman?

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,442
I never talked about it
since it's a hassle,

14
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,344
but I’m his nephew.

15
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,815
Starting next year,
I’ll be this school’s chairman.

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,483
-What?
-Chairman?

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,318
He has no children, so he asked me.

18
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,121
But jumping from teaching
to managing a school…

19
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:59,092
Until two years ago,
I was a management consultant.

20
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,928
I’m more of a management professional.

21
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,331
I only became a teacher

22
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:07,033
to study this school’s condition.

23
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,669
Because of

24
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,138
your misguided reforms,

25
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,507
Meishin is now facing a management crisis.

26
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,244
I’m going to fix it
before becoming chairman.

27
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,946
With all due respect,

28
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,650
revising the discipline rules,
and expanding each grade to 10 classes

29
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,619
boosted enrollment dramatically.

30
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,488
-That’s right.
-That’s right.

31
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,992
But Meishin, once prestigious,
lowered its standards.

32
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,461
Of course enrollment went up.

33
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,564
But the student quality declined.

34
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,769
Now we have complaints from neighbors
about poor student behavior.

35
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,274
To maintain stable admissions,…

36
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,309
IDENTIFY THE TARGET

37
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,079
…we need to identify our target,
which is the parents,

38
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,448
and understand their needs.

39
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,217
UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS

40
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,086
Based on my research,

41
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,256
what’s most needed at Meishin is…

42
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,024
BRAND POWER AS A PREP SCHOOL

43
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,161
…branding as a prep school.

44
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,930
But then we’ll lose enrollment again.

45
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,665
If numbers drop, we raise tuition.

46
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:17,670
Quality, not quantity, is what matters.

47
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,339
What’s important is…

48
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,876
the quality of the students’ families!

49
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,845
Families of high quality

50
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,415
will pay top dollar
for a reputable school!

51
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:34,187
Those are the only ones we need to target.

52
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,656
So we should ignore families
that can’t afford that?

53
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,993
It’s about clearly identifying targets
and understanding their needs.

54
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,632
Within one year
before I become the chairman,

55
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,435
I'll rebuild Meishin's brand
beyond what it used to be.

56
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,870
To do that,

57
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,408
I want students who may damage the brand

58
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,444
to leave the school.

59
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,484
Expelling students?

60
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,621
You've got to be kidding.
I'm not listening to a guy like that.

61
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,722
-Another round!
-Yes.

62
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,192
Maybe you’ve had enough?

63
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,593
It's fine.

64
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,596
That much cola can't be good for you.

65
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,665
I can't drink alcohol.

66
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,334
You still act like you're drunk.
How do you do that?

67
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:26,306
Even sober people deserve to vent
when they’re having a bad day.

68
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,974
Yes…

69
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:32,378
More importantly, Shizuka-sensei,

70
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,148
do you plan to help that guy?

71
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,753
<i>I don’t care what happens</i>

72
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,522
<i>to the school or the students.</i>

73
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,290
<i>This is the list of</i>

74
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,093
75 students I judged unsuitable,

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,295
based on their academic records
and other factors,

76
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,765
for the Meishin Academy I'm aiming for.

77
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,634
That’s so many…

78
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,437
Some of them have good grades
and behavior.

79
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,905
Their families are the problem.

80
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,708
Students from troubled homes

81
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,243
are also targets for expulsion.

82
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,679
Troublemakers often come

83
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,214
from troubled homes.

84
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,650
Even if they’re fine now,

85
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,919
something might happen later.

86
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,088
That’s pure prejudice!

87
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,259
Of course,

88
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,662
we can’t forcibly expel
students who haven’t caused any trouble.

89
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,865
So all teachers must

90
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,837
monitor these 75 students
and report even the slightest issue.

91
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,806
You want us to find
a reason to expel them?

92
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,908
If the parents found out--

93
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,644
Then just don’t tell them!

94
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:39,946
Well…

95
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,283
If this boosts Meishin’s brand,

96
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,785
many parents will probably
understand and agree.

97
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,288
Right, Vice-Principal?

98
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,029
Really, don’t take it so seriously.

99
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,965
Aside from this task I gave you,

100
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,900
you can just do your jobs as usual.

101
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,336
Don’t get angry.

102
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,570
Don’t praise students.

103
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,839
Don’t counsel them.

104
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,577
Some teachers

105
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:15,848
make a fuss by meddling in student issues.

106
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,185
<i>What? Am I being targeted?</i>

107
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,091
For each student you manage to find fault
and report to me,

108
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,528
I promise to raise your yearly salary
by 10 percent!

109
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,265
-10 percent?
-10 percent?

110
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,168
<i>That guy…</i>

111
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,570
-<i>just irritates me.</i>
-Here you go.

112
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,473
KEITA MIYAZAWA

113
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,476
<i>Keita-kun, can't you stay?</i>

114
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,178
I’ve got class early tomorrow.

115
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,214
College life isn’t easy, huh?

116
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,684
Yes…

117
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,154
Then…

118
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,724
One last drink before we go?

119
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,394
I told you already. I don’t like alcohol.

120
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,298
It's a joke.

121
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,369
Here’s your payment for today.

122
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,875
And this too.

123
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,080
I thought it would suit you.

124
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,052
I can’t accept the way he’s doing this.

125
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,921
Let’s fight this together,
on the principal’s side.

126
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,924
What exactly are you planning to do?

127
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,793
Well, I don’t have a concrete plan.

128
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:38,097
You want me to fight without a plan?

129
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,469
<i>I’m not even really</i>
<i>on the principal’s side.</i>

130
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,076
Why are you here every night?

131
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,044
Not every night. Just three nights a week.

132
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,679
-Right?
-It's five.

133
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,114
See? Not every night.

134
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,449
It’s basically every night.

135
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,685
Well, Kanako’s cooking is just too good.

136
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,187
-Seconds, please.
-Okay.

137
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,655
-Hold on a second.
-Okay.

138
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,627
Did you know about
the committee meeting today?

139
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,295
Yes, I did.

140
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,097
And you didn’t object?

141
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,867
They're going to expel so many students.

142
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,905
Moriguchi-sensei's decision

143
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,640
is the board’s decision.

144
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,341
And that can’t be overturned.

145
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,843
The board?

146
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,779
Among the five board members, except me,

147
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,650
<i>all the others are connected</i>
<i>or related to the chairman.</i>

148
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:34,086
Normally, expelling a student
is the principal’s call.

149
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:38,124
But if I tried to stop it,

150
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,295
the board would fire me.

151
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:44,363
There’s nothing I can do…

152
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,566
Thank you.

153
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:51,304
Sure, the increased enrollment
caused troubles for our school.

154
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,207
Still, forcing students out…

155
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,042
that’s just not right.

156
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,010
So let's fight together, Shi-chan.

157
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,979
This again?

158
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,814
-Huh?
-No…

159
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,685
What do you mean by "fight"?

160
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,187
Moriguchi-sensei is looking

161
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:12,291
for problems, to use as excuses
to expel students.

162
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,495
So before those problems
get reported to him,

163
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,798
you must resolve them all. Right?

164
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,967
Yes!

00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,886
That watch looks good on you.

182
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:14,954
Oh…

183
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,158
<i>Keita Miyazawa.</i>

184
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,663
Ten students from your class?

185
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,633
If you report them all,
your pay is doubled!

186
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,168
I’ve only got three in mine.

187
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:30,870
I'm jealous…

188
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,039
You're jealous?

189
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,842
You're thinking,
"She's actually going to do it."

190
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,178
You are going to report them?

191
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,716
Well, the decision’s been made.
And there’s a bonus for us, too.

192
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,821
The other teachers also
seem to be on board, for now.

193
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,759
CLASS 2-1 - YUUKI TAGAWA,
YOICHI NISHIMURA, YUME FUJII

194
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,698
I don't feel right, doing this.

195
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,334
How about you, Vice-Principal?

196
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,704
I’m just an employee.

197
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,107
I follow orders from the one who hired me.

198
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,113
Don’t make that face.

199
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:17,249
A smile suits you best.

200
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,319
I’m not in the mood to smile.

201
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:26,225
How about dinner tonight?

202
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,996
I found a great <i>motsuyaki</i> place.

203
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,133
You smiled.

204
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,137
That's not fair.

205
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,607
You know I can't resist <i>motsuyaki</i>.

206
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,276
No, no. We can't do this at school.

207
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,281
Look straight ahead while you walk.

208
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,583
I thought I was.

209
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,185
You're right.
I’m the one who wasn’t looking ahead.

210
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,025
Thank you very much.

211
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,634
What time do you want to eat <i>motsuyaki</i>?

212
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,270
7:30 p.m.

213
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,940
This test won’t affect your grade,
so don’t worry about it.

214
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,444
That means everyone did poorly, huh?

215
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,781
Wait, Keita scored 98?

216
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,318
How did I lose to Keita
when he didn’t even attend?

217
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,055
Ask my parents.

218
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,725
There are those who excel without trying,

219
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,527
and those who try but still struggle.

220
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,495
Oh, come on!

221
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,934
Shut up.

222
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,536
You should study more!

223
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,072
Keita Miyazawa?

224
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,441
You were his teacher in year one, right?

225
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,508
Yes, that’s right.

226
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:54,113
Keita is polite and diligent.

227
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,015
So I was wondering…

228
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,919
Why is someone like him on that list?

229
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,190
I hate to say it,

230
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:09,061
but Keita comes from a single-parent home.
His mother doesn’t earn much.

231
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,663
They're financially struggling.

232
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,400
Moriguchi wants to cut out students

233
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,103
from impoverished families.

234
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,739
Sensei…

235
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,143
What are you doing?

236
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,082
What happened, Naito?

237
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,053
Miyazawa-kun was wearing
an expensive watch,

238
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,254
so I looked it up.

239
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,856
WATCH PRICE 310,000 YEN

240
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,190
310,000 yen?

241
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:42,762
It’s not that I suspect him
was doing anything bad.

242
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,831
He’s a good kid.

243
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,100
That’s why I was concerned.

244
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,337
I thought you might be able to help.

245
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:56,075
<i>Please stop dragging me into trouble.</i>

246
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,644
If there’s anything I can do, I’ll do it.

247
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,048
<i>You should worry about yourself first.</i>

248
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,852
Are you troubled by something?

249
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,722
You are looking really stern.

250
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,724
Is it about the students?

251
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,627
You can talk to me about it.

252
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,061
Let’s solve it together.

253
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,533
You just want info so
you can report my students.

254
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,705
Your face says it all.

255
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,107
Urumi-sensei.

256
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,714
You look really shaken up.
Is something wrong?

257
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,052
I’m okay. Not shaken at all.

258
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,955
Don’t you have something to report to me?

259
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,157
Huh?

260
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,593
Keita Miyazawa.

261
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,062
<i>There it is! His name.</i>

262
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,832
Did anything unusual happen to him today?

263
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,703
<i>I can only think of one thing.</i>
<i>What do I do?</i>

264
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,605
<i>I’ll play dumb for now.</i>

265
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,007
Something unusual?

266
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,210
No, he seemed the same as always.

267
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,247
I see. Understood.

268
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,249
<i>Yes, I tricked him!</i>

269
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,650
Well, I’ll be going now.

270
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,019
The watch.

271
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,156
<i>He knew!</i>

272
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,259
The watch?

273
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,128
The watch he’s wearing.

274
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,297
It supposedly costs ¥310,000.

275
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,968
A high schooler…

276
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,338
from a struggling household

277
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,408
wearing that kind of watch?
Isn’t that strange?

278
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,879
I believe I told you to report
things like that.

279
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:42,715
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,149
Why didn’t you?

281
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,420
So you can’t even do such a simple task?

282
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,223
You’re useless.

283
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,894
<i>Enough with the nagging.</i>

284
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,662
<i>I'm getting seriously irritated.</i>

285
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,130
Are you even listening?

286
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,170
Keep being this useless
and you’ll go back to being unemployed.

287
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:10,709
You're wondering why I know that,

288
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,912
aren’t you?

289
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,647
<i>I am.</i>

290
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,349
The basics of management
start with data collection.

291
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,151
I like investigating things.

292
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:23,322
Are the people around me useful or not?

293
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,492
Are they friends or foes?

294
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,398
If something happens again,
be sure to report it.

295
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,574
<i>Why am I being a stalker now?</i>

296
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,742
<i>But, if something happens</i>

297
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:48,113
<i>to Miyazawa, and Moriguchi-sensei</i>
<i>finds out, he’ll be expelled.</i>

298
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,516
<i>And I hate that kind of stuff.</i>

299
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,187
<i>Oh no!</i>

300
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,493
<i>Honestly, tailing someone</i>
<i>is super nerve-wracking.</i>

301
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,428
Sensei?

302
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,766
You always appear out of nowhere.

303
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,735
I just happened to spot you.

304
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,870
What are you doing?

305
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,977
You really do care about your students.

306
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,945
Normally, teachers don’t stalk students.

307
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,682
Why are you tailing him too?

308
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,953
Because I’m worried about Miyazawa-kun.
And I said I’d do anything.

309
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,990
<i>He’s wearing a watch that costs ¥310,000…</i>

310
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,126
<i>and changing into adult clothes</i>
<i>after school.</i>

311
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,996
<i>Something is definitely going on.</i>

312
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:13,866
<i>Miyazawa-kun,</i>

313
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,769
<i>what are you doing?</i>

BOOK STORE

315
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,073
EXAM REFERENCE BOOK

316
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,542
<i>Browsing a reference book.</i>

317
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:27,913
Wow. He's so focused.

318
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:29,915
Yes.

319
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,353
Miyazawa-kun always gets good grades,

320
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,189
so I thought he was just naturally smart.

321
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,525
But he’s been working hard.

322
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,071
He moved!

323
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,046
Sensei!

BOOKSTORE

325
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,623
We lost sight of him.

326
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,694
-Yes.
-Do you think he noticed us?

327
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,366
Keita-kun! Sorry, were you waiting?

328
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,068
I just got here too.

329
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:23,969
Wearing the watch?

330
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,737
Yes.

331
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,074
Great! Let’s go to our usual place.

332
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,344
Feels like it’s been a while.

333
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,913
Are you hungry?

334
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,448
Want to eat something?

335
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,951
I'm good. I have food at home.

336
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,219
Okay.

337
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,054
-I'm hungry.
-Oh!

338
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:43,856
What will you drink?

339
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,191
Maybe red or white wine…

340
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,726
-I can't decide.
-Miyazawa-kun.

341
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,596
Why are you here?

342
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,431
Who is she?

343
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,633
I'm Miyazawa-kun's classmate.

344
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,268
Classmate?

345
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:02,007
Why are you bringing a 16-year-old
to a place like this…

346
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,710
What?

347
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,411
You're a minor?

348
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,046
You told me you were 21.

349
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,615
This is messed up!

350
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,650
Don’t be so loud.

351
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,221
This is fraud.

352
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,123
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,026
"Sorry" won’t cut it.

354
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,896
Give back the watch too.

355
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,471
I’ll never forgive you.

356
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,146
Why would you do something like this?

357
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,916
To survive.

358
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,854
We’re poor.

359
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,723
But…

360
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,193
You always have food at home.

361
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,163
You can go to cram school,
and buy all the textbooks you want.

362
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,499
You wouldn't know.

363
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:04,970
It's just me and my mom.

364
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,640
She works so hard,

365
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,143
but we can barely survive.

366
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,812
If I don’t do things like this…

367
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,648
Our school allows part-time work--

368
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,618
I want to study
and get into a good university.

369
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,654
This is the only way
I can escape this life!

370
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,558
But,

371
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,495
if I get a part-time job,

372
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,998
there’s no time to study.

373
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,468
And even if I work,

374
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,606
a high school student
barely earns anything.

375
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,508
If you're born poor in Japan,
there's no way out.

376
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,845
Why did you interfere?

377
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,750
If they find out about this,

378
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,453
I would be expelled, right?

379
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,260
Sensei, is there no other way?

380
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,303
I saw nothing.

381
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,642
So…

382
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,611
I won’t report this to the school.

383
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,054
SEE

384
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,994
ONE COMMENT

385
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,097
GOOD LUCK TO ME TOMORROW
MARCH 5, 2023 18:43 ONE COMMENT

386
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,999
YOU DID SOMETHING UNNECESSARY

387
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,835
IT'S YOUR FAULT!

388
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,737
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!
IT'S YOUR FAULT

389
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,274
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT

390
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,610
YOUR FAULT

391
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,891
KEITA MIYAZAWA

392
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:06,892
Has…

393
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,461
anything unusual happened?

394
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,365
Not really.
Everything’s the same as usual.

395
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,167
I see.

396
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,337
FIRST CLASS - SELF-STUDY

397
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,672
Sensei.

398
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:22,674
Yes?

399
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,610
Actually, Ai has been really stressed
about her future lately.

400
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:32,084
I get why your parents are worried…

401
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,188
but if you really want
to be a voice actor…

402
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:38,256
you need to express that clearly.

403
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,192
If they oppose it,

404
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,227
please help me convince them.

405
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,329
Okay…

406
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,098
Thank you.

407
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,566
That’s great news, Ai.

408
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,968
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

409
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,572
Sensei.

410
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,942
Do you have time to talk?

411
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,747
<i>What’s going on? I’m scared.</i>

412
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:05,450
<i>Suddenly my students are opening up to me.</i>

413
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:09,354
<i>Why? It’s honestly terrifying…</i>

414
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,623
Sensei, what are you doing?

415
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,397
One by one,
they keep coming to me for advice.

416
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,466
I seriously don’t get it.

417
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,703
Oh, I see.

418
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,006
Do you know the reason?

419
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,074
It’s Miyazawa-kun.

420
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,009
Miyazawa?

421
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,411
She cares so much…

422
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,946
<i>He’s been saying there’s no one</i>

423
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,549
<i>who cares about students more than you.</i>

424
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,853
I don’t know
what teachers used to be like,

425
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:46,391
but we feel like adults now
are either overly friendly,

426
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,461
or trying to keep their distance from us.

427
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,964
But truth is, lots of us

428
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,033
want to talk to adults and teachers.

429
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,737
<i>I really didn't want to get involved</i>

430
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:00,172
<i>with my students, but…</i>

431
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,377
-Yes, Meishin.
-Hello,

432
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,680
I believe a student named
Keita Miyazawa goes to your school.

433
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,116
May I know who’s calling?

434
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,422
What did you want to discuss?

435
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,792
Miyazawa, I’ll be direct.

436
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,862
Have you been involved
in a compensated dating?

437
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,532
Answer me.

438
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,303
Did Urumi-sensei…

439
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:34,739
say something?

440
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,611
Urumi-sensei…

441
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,748
-There's trouble.
-What’s going on?

442
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,184
Miyazawa.

443
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,992
I heard the school received a call
about something involving him.

444
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:55,627
Yes.

445
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,064
A woman claimed to have been

446
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,867
his "sugar mommy." Is that correct?

447
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,134
Yes.

448
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,570
What exactly…

449
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,639
-is this about…
-Please take a look at this.

450
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,877
This photo was sent
by the woman in question.

451
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,579
Her face is obscured,

452
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,147
but that boy is Miyazawa.

453
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,416
Isn't that correct?

454
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,922
This woman says
she was deceived by Miyazawa.

455
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:28,093
She agreed to a compensated dating
because he said he was 21.

456
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,330
She "can't believe he was a high-schooler"
and said she’ll sue him for fraud.

457
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,367
But, there is a possibility she is lying…

458
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,869
He himself admitted it!

459
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,974
So…

460
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,310
We’re currently discussing

461
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:50,882
asking Miyazawa to voluntarily quit.

462
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,851
Voluntarily quit the school?

463
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,087
Such a serious matter,
and you discuss it in private?

464
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,024
Principal! Don’t make me say this again.

465
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:02,394
My judgment is the board’s judgment.

466
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,029
You understand that, yes?

467
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,365
And Urumi-sensei…

468
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:13,338
You witnessed this incident,
but didn't report it, right?

469
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,976
You noticed a change in your student,
yet said nothing.

470
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,146
You saw the scene firsthand
and stayed silent.

471
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,782
A liar like you

472
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,251
is not qualified to be a homeroom teacher.

473
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,367
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

474
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,503
TOTAL INTEGRITY

475
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,273
Sorry Keita.

476
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,008
It’s all my fault.

477
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:51,910
I'm sorry.

478
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,881
Please!

479
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,451
It’s all my fault.

480
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,520
I couldn’t make enough money.

481
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:06,057
Keita isn’t a bad person!

482
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,064
Please!

483
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,768
He just wants to go to university. So…

484
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,403
It’s okay, Mom!

485
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,339
You don’t need to feel embarrassed.

486
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,607
Keita…

487
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,277
‪I…‬

488
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,883
I’ll drop out.

489
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,418
Miyazawa…

490
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:36,888
Keita…

491
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,424
You wanted to go to university, right?

492
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,593
Yes.

493
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,462
I did…

494
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:46,297
but now…

495
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,901
I don’t care anymore.

496
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,539
If I have to bow down before them,

497
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,409
then it isn't worth it.

498
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,115
You violated a clear rule by not reporting

499
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,617
your student’s behavior.

500
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:11,056
Normally,
there would be a penalty for that.

501
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,391
But…

502
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,561
thanks to you,

503
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,730
we successfully got our first expulsion.

504
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,199
That was quicker than I expected.

505
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,938
So I’ll let this incident slide.

506
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,408
Keep up the good work.

507
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,953
We can't just give up.

508
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,790
It’d be better if I weren’t around.

509
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,931
Whenever I get involved with someone,
it always ends badly.

510
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,201
It’s always like this.

511
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,674
Maybe I’m just bad luck.

512
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,012
You're still hung up
over what happened two years ago?

513
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,052
Someone like me being a teacher…

514
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,823
I’ll only bring misfortune to my students.

515
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,462
That’s why I shouldn’t get
involved with anyone.

516
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,201
If that’s how you define yourself,

517
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,571
that’s all you’ll ever be.

518
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,043
If you stop trying
because you think you’re causing harm,

519
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,980
then yes, things'll be like that.

520
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:43,815
But if you keep going

521
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,918
until you bring someone happiness,

522
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,219
then the result will change.

523
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,824
I know you hate losing, Shi-chan.

524
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,393
If they don’t give up…

525
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,063
people can become who they want to be.

526
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,821
You need something?

527
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,758
Are you seriously planning
to sue Miyazawa for fraud?

528
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,360
Of course.

529
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,097
He tricked me, an adult.
I’ll never forgive him.

530
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,033
I see…

531
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,003
But that won’t hold up in court.

532
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,974
MINOR, COMPENSATED DATING

533
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,943
MINOR, COMPENSATED DATING, CRIME

534
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,377
UNDERAGE COMPENSATED DATING, A CRIME?

535
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,414
Even if he lied about not being a minor,

536
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:52,483
that alone doesn’t make it a fraud.

537
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,753
In fact, you should worry about
being arrested yourself.

538
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,523
Why would I get arrested? I paid him!

539
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,192
Under Penal Code Article 224,

540
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,229
Anyone who lures or abducts a minor

541
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,966
faces 3 months to 7 years in prison.

542
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,069
Abduction? What do you mean?

543
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:15,039
Taking Miyazawa out of his daily life
and putting him under your control.

544
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,342
That’s abduction.

545
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,177
WHY IS COMPENSATED DATING A CRIME?

546
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,446
Depending on how it’s interpreted,

547
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,414
what you did qualifies.

548
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,482
LURING A MINOR WITH MONEY

549
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,218
But I never forced him to go anywhere.

550
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,854
Even if he agreed to it,

551
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,256
it can be considered abduction.

552
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,829
Children sometimes make poor judgments
and act carelessly.

553
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,466
Some adults deceive such children,

554
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,867
leaving deep scars

555
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:45,670
on their future lives.
There are people like that.

556
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,340
Laws exist to prevent
such things from happening.

557
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,478
So I’ll be arrested?

558
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:54,579
Of course.

559
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,284
Only if Miyazawa or his guardian sues you.

560
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,119
That’s insane.

561
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,656
Do you know how much I paid that boy?

562
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,129
UNIVERSITY EXAM PREP BOOK

563
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,417
Can you reconsider your withdrawing?

564
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,420
There’s nothing to reconsider.

565
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,889
Even if I don’t withdraw,
I’ll be expelled anyway, right?

566
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,424
Why?

567
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,160
I did a compensated dating.

568
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:45,029
Rie-san said she’d sue me, didn't she?

569
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:48,800
So…

570
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:53,204
it just has to look like
you didn’t do it, right?

571
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,340
What are you saying?

572
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,676
Rie-san won't sue you for fraud.

573
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,847
She also testified
you didn't do a compensated dating.

574
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,483
This is the written statement.

575
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:08,753
With no reason left,

576
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,989
they can’t expel you, right?

577
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,492
How did you? What about the money?

578
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,928
The money I got from Rie-san?

579
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,397
Don’t worry about that.

580
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,599
What? You're paying me back?

581
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,634
You keep being annoying about it.

582
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:25,703
Someone has to step up.

583
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,138
Annoying?

584
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,041
I was the one deceived,
and now I'm told I was grooming him!

585
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:32,410
Fine, fine. How much do you want?

586
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,746
50,000 yen? 100,000 yen?

587
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,214
But if I pay…

588
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,783
you’ll pretend this never happened, right?

589
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,619
50,000 yen? I gave him 500,000 yen.

590
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,089
No way.

591
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:48,059
Did you really pay her?

592
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,462
Well… I kind of did, in the moment.

593
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,064
Why did you go that far?

594
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,234
I guess I hate losing.

595
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:01,506
I couldn’t pay it all at once,
so I asked to pay in installments.

596
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,013
Let’s go back to school.

597
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:12,250
Give me a break!

598
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,786
Please…

599
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:17,188
don’t pity me.

600
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,657
Pity just makes me feel miserable.

601
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,994
Even with a home like this,

602
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,964
I don’t want to lose to anyone.

603
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:29,766
I studied hard and found ways

604
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,735
to earn money on my own.

605
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,811
Even if I quit school,
I’ll manage somehow.

606
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,880
Maybe if I become a YouTuber,

607
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,083
I'll be rich.

608
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:49,520
I understand how you feel.

609
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,491
But can I ask you one thing?

610
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:59,263
Please come to school tomorrow.

611
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,532
But I already withdrew.

612
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,135
The paperwork isn’t final yet.

613
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,671
Your withdrawal hasn’t been accepted.

614
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,149
THIS IS THE WRITTEN STATEMENT

615
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,222
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

616
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,892
A public service corporation…

617
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,563
Thank you… for coming.

618
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,478
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

619
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,679
Come in.

620
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,616
Thank you.

621
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,323
Principal, what is this about?

622
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:04,328
Urumi-sensei
wanted to speak with all of you.

623
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,964
So we arranged this meeting.

624
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,266
A discussion…

625
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,935
So, what is this about?

626
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:11,969
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

627
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,838
It’s about Miyazawa's withdrawal.

628
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,007
Could you reconsider it?

629
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,210
-Sensei!
-He lied about his age and did

630
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,312
compensated dating. That’s on him.

631
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,353
This is a written statement.

632
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,324
The woman won’t sue, and admits
he wasn’t doing compensated dating.

633
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,026
She testified to it.

634
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,996
TOTAL INTEGRITY

635
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,335
I see.

636
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,706
Then there’s no reason
to expel Miyazawa anymore.

637
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,844
I see.

638
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,014
But can I ask…

639
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,484
what about the photo of them together?

640
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,621
That is…

641
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,424
Could you arrange
for me to meet this woman?

642
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,292
What do you plan to do?

643
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,295
I just want to hear her side of the story.

644
00:37:12,263 --> 00:37:15,766
If there was no compensated dating,

645
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:18,936
Why did she say she’d sue?

646
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,104
If you think of it,

647
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,874
It just makes it look like
there was some truth to it,

648
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:28,079
but I think you talked to her
and convinced her to settle.

649
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,218
This is a school.

650
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,487
We are to educate and raise students.

651
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,890
The truth matters more

652
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,727
than what’s written on a sheet of paper.

653
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,566
What good is saving a child with a lie?

654
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,502
So…

655
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,338
can you let me speak to that woman?

656
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,109
-But…
-I already told you that’s enough!

657
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,078
-Miyazawa…
-I'm sorry.

658
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,848
I’m dropping out.

659
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,218
-Wait!
-Don’t make me say it again. I don’t care.

660
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,420
It’s my life.

661
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,890
I won’t burden anyone.

662
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:14,759
I’m quitting school.

663
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,902
Are you just trying to sound cool?

664
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:32,443
You won't stay, and you think you'll look
good when you leave?

665
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,915
Then, you're just a self-indulgent fool.

666
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,451
Don't say it like that.

667
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,288
I said I’m fine with it.

668
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,391
Is quitting such a bad thing?

669
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,961
I want to quit, but instead
I should just endure all of this?

670
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,263
Isn’t that outdated?

671
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,701
Well, it’s true.
These days, quitting right away

672
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,303
isn’t seen as negative anymore.

673
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,674
People no longer feel
they must stay in toxic environments.

674
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,576
But on the flip side…

675
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,481
This idea that it’s fine to quit anytime
has also become more common.

676
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,721
Some do well after quitting. Others don’t.

677
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,990
Why the difference?

678
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,226
Do you know why?

679
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,798
It’s whether you have something
you want to do or not.

680
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,204
If you have a goal worth quitting for,
I won’t stop you.

681
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,374
But you said you don’t care anymore.

682
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,076
Quitting because you "don't care."

683
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,446
You’re just acting on impulse
and not thinking ahead.

684
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:47,218
That’s the same as a child
throwing a tantrum.

685
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,622
Wherever someone like that goes,

686
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,892
they’ll quit again when things get tough.

687
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,262
Because there’s nothing
they really want to do.

688
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,366
And if they keep quitting…

689
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:07,204
They’ll eventually end up doing nothing,
just staying at home.

690
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,708
Then they’ll start blaming themselves.

691
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,246
They’ll think the world is judging them.

692
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,381
They won't have a moment of peace.

693
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,885
Even normal things become overwhelming.

694
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,289
That mental fatigue turns into negativity,

695
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,626
which creates a vicious cycle
that keeps them from moving forward.

696
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,198
I’ve experienced that myself.

697
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,741
Do you have something
you really want to do?

698
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:45,910
I…

699
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,979
You said you love studying
and want to go to university, right?

700
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,716
Then staying in high school
is the right choice.

701
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,486
If you stay here, you can chase your goal.

702
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,123
So don’t say "I quit" so easily!

703
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:11,836
I… really…

704
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:16,040
Please!

705
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,275
Let Miyazawa

706
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,711
stay in school!

707
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:23,981
I…

708
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:25,749
don’t want to quit.

709
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,152
I don’t want to leave school!

710
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,860
He loves school more than anyone.
He loves studying

711
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:37,328
and he’s a good kid.

712
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,764
Are you going to take away his future?

713
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,602
Moriguchi-sensei

714
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,005
said schools are like companies. However…

715
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,842
Private high schools
are public-interest corporations.

716
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,712
Public-interest corps exist
to benefit society.

717
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,014
Stop thinking about school’s profits…

718
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,749
Enough is enough!

719
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:04,221
I don’t have time to listen
to your lectures.

720
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,156
No matter what’s said,

721
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,626
Miyazawa is expelled.

722
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:19,203
Quitting high school
won’t change his future that much.

723
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,073
If he wants to study,
he can do it at home.

724
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,110
He can take
university entrance exams, too.

725
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:30,481
Even if he’s poor, there are ways
to get into university.

726
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:38,589
What happens to you from here
is up to you. However,

727
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,258
when someone does wrong,
they must be punished.

728
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,728
It’s our job as teachers
to teach them that.

729
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:49,433
Otherwise, children won’t grow up.

730
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,172
Isn't that right, Vice-Principal?

731
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:01,512
You’re absolutely right.

732
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,681
Principal…

733
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:05,616
do you agree?

734
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:27,838
Today…

735
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,443
I must inform you all about something.

736
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,281
Keita Miyazawa…

737
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,086
will be leaving school.

738
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:47,458
What? He's quitting?

739
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,526
Why?

740
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:50,961
Why so suddenly?

741
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,898
What’s going on, Keita?

742
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:00,304
Well… a lot happened.

743
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,209
I'm quitting school.

744
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,678
Why? What’s the reason?

745
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,247
‪So…‬

746
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,549
a lot of stuff happened.

747
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,585
Sensei, what's going on?

748
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,758
Sensei…

749
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,067
I’m sorry…

750
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,038
I’m sorry…

751
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:44,915
I’m sorry…

752
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,219
I’m sorry…

753
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,358
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

754
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,365
MURDERER

755
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,733
MURDERER

756
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,034
SHIZUKA URUMI IS A MURDERER

757
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:07,104
SHIZUKA URUMI IS A MURDERER
