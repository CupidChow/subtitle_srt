1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,439
Shizuka Urumi is a murderer.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,909
That wasn't just your fault.

3
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:11,077
What SEE said…

4
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,178
I THINK IT'S OKAY TO RUN AWAY…

5
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,847
triggered Karen’s death.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,483
THANK YOU… GOODBYE.

7
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:17,851
I can…

8
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:22,088
never forget the grief and hatred
I felt after losing her!

9
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,792
SIX MONTHS AGO

10
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,032
That's really good.
I think I can do this too.

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:32,966
Hey!

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,801
-You mean like this?
-Watch out!

13
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,803
-Not good!
-Wait. You've got to move…

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,805
-No, just sit down.
-Ouch.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,508
This is so boring. Why are you acting shy?

16
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,509
Sorry.

17
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,511
You need to hype it up, Iroha. Try again.

18
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,478
Okay.

19
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:48,882
Nice!

20
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,984
It's better than before!

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,019
Maybe mine was…

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,656
Are you forcing yourself?
Being with Watanuki and the others.

23
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:58,992
Yes…

24
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:05,565
Once those dynamics are formed,
it’s hard to break them on your own.

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,334
Keeping everything bottled up

26
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,137
and talking to someone
invisible on the Net won’t help.

27
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:17,277
An adult needs to step in
and stop it, no matter what.

28
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,681
Before it becomes irreversible,

29
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:24,484
ask a nearby adult for help.

30
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,053
Yes.

31
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,902
When I see her teaching
like nothing ever happened,

32
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,438
it makes me uneasy.

33
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,539
She’s fine.

34
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,541
She’s gotten better in the past two years.

35
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,176
I see.

36
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,646
If anything happens to her,
report it to me immediately.

37
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,415
Yes.

38
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:57,951
Sensei.

39
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,789
I want to discuss something with you.

40
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,491
Discuss?

41
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,829
It's about bullying.

42
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,033
INVESTIGATION REPORT

43
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:18,938
SUSPECT

44
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,879
What are you looking at?

45
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,415
What is this?

46
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,352
The ones who bullied Karen.

47
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,555
I must make them carry the guilt

48
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,824
of killing her

49
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,494
for the rest of their lives…

50
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:59,412
I'm hungry.

51
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,980
-What do you want to eat?
-Why?

52
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,283
-What?
-Why do you look so happy?

53
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,119
How can you be happy after killing Karen?
I won't forgive you!

54
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,954
Because of you, Karen…

55
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,622
It's your fault!

56
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,357
It's all your fault!

57
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:24,037
I'm grateful you kept that incident quiet

58
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:25,805
so Aika could return to teaching.

59
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,008
But…

60
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,078
did you even consider how Aika would feel?

61
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,415
Why did you make
Shizuka-sensei a teacher at Meishin?

62
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,784
I’ll…

63
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,787
never forgive Shizuka Urumi.

64
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,524
Urami-sensei,

65
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,227
what will you do about Aika?

66
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,329
-Huh?
-Answer me.

67
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,669
I love Aika.

68
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,072
I’ll do anything to save her!

69
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,710
What?

70
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,078
Did you just smirk?

71
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,413
Sorry.

72
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,950
You said it so boldly, "I love her."

73
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,654
It's so straightforward.
I just thought that was kind of amazing.

74
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,090
That is absolutely the wrong reaction.

75
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,225
We don’t know who might be around here.

76
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,261
I’m being serious here!

77
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,133
You say you’ll do anything to save her,

78
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,269
but you’ve done nothing.

79
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,139
Like putting up those flyers at school…

80
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,408
Aika's getting closer to Urumi-sensei.

81
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,943
Will you just stand by, do nothing?

82
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,912
Right now, she’s emotionally unstable,

83
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,482
so I'm keeping watch on her,
from a distance!

84
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,683
It was you who brought

85
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,686
Shizuka-sensei to Meishin and
that’s why Aika ended up like this!

86
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,988
What exactly did Urumi-sensei do wrong?

87
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,331
I want…

88
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,167
to save everyone.

89
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,005
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

90
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,142
But still…

91
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,176
Sensei.

92
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,647
I’m going to try to forget
about baseball and move on.

93
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,352
I see.

94
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,787
Thanks.

95
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,791
-What?
-What?

96
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,329
What’s wrong?

97
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,164
What?

98
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,566
You seem really sad.

99
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,704
Is it hard to say?

100
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,708
She’s not losing weight.

101
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,543
What?

102
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,746
Koi’s stressed because
she’s not slimming down at all.

103
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,083
That's great, isn't it?

104
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,651
Sensei, you’ve changed, haven’t you?

105
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,119
What?

106
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,921
You spoke to a student on your own.

107
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,426
Before, it felt like you found dealing
with students annoying.

108
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:01,327
I could be wrong.

109
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,131
They were the ones who asked me for help…

110
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,767
Do you know Aika-sensei?

111
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,335
Aika-sensei?

112
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,172
She was supposed to be
our homeroom teacher.

113
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,508
Oh… Urami-sensei's…

114
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:16,409
What?

115
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,978
I guess no one knows they're dating.

116
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,646
Oh, it's nothing.

117
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,816
Aika-sensei was super popular.

118
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,987
She noticed when students were struggling,
and reached out to talk with them.

119
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,822
I see…

120
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,591
I feel like you're a bit like her.

121
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,895
I don’t really know her,
but she doesn’t seem unpleasant.

122
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,936
Wakisaka-kun also opened up
to Aika-sensei.

123
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:44,971
Wakisaka?

124
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,639
He’s in our class.

125
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,875
Oh…

126
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,879
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

127
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,392
HARUKI WAKISAKA

128
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,394
Haruki Wakisaka.

129
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,465
Currently undergoing treatment
due to poor health.

130
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,701
We will begin the morning homeroom.

131
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,305
He hasn’t come to school
since the start of sophomore year, right?

132
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,407
Is something going on with him?

133
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,043
I was just wondering
what kind of student he is.

134
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,948
Honestly, I don’t remember him that well.

135
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,052
Oh, right! I never properly thanked you.

136
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,555
-What?
-Thanks to you,

137
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,324
I managed to truly hate my ex, Dai.

138
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,026
-Dai?
-My ex-boyfriend.

139
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,060
I see.

140
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,530
It feels amazing
to be totally over your ex.

141
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,499
Glad to hear that.

142
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,734
Peace at last!

143
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,371
Moriguchi-sensei
hasn't made any moves lately, either.

144
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,742
So you’re saying I can’t become chairman?

145
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,244
No, I didn’t say that.

146
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,612
This is ridiculous.

147
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,517
Didn’t you say I’d take over
Meishin’s management next year?

148
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,620
I never said you wouldn’t become chairman.

149
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,690
It's just that, after what happened…

150
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:11,991
Kobayakawa,

151
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,761
as PTA President, what do you think?

152
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:19,265
If this continues,
everyone will end up expelled.

153
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,969
Since then, it seems
the principal has been in contact.

154
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,040
Maybe it’s still too soon
for you to be chairman.

155
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,276
Even the PTA is expressing concern.

156
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,445
That is what they're saying…

157
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:39,585
That family’s got ties
to the Agency for Cultural Affairs, too.

158
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:44,357
Without President Kobayakawa’s backing,
I can’t push for you to be chairman.

159
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,996
So lay low for now.

160
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,500
And let’s put this on hold, too.

161
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,337
Even the president
is starting to pull back on this.

162
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,811
You want to take down the principal?

163
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:06,846
Yes.

164
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,583
Do you have anything
that could be used against her?

165
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,485
No, not really.

166
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,921
If the principal goes down,
President Kobayakawa,

167
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,757
who was swayed by that woman
might reconsider.

168
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,861
You seem pretty irritated.

169
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,097
I want to run this school!

170
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,702
I want to become chairman
and quit teaching as soon as possible!

171
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,870
I’m sick of dealing

172
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,339
with stupid students
and even dumber parents!

173
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,108
Also…

174
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,112
being manipulated by that woman
pisses me off even more!

175
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,752
What?

176
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,325
If you’ve got a problem, just say it.

177
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,830
Have you lost interest…

178
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,232
in becoming…

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,668
principal of Meishin?

180
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,142
Of course I’ve got a problem! You punk!

181
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:13,245
What do you think?

182
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,483
-Why should I care?
-So cold!

183
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,786
You dumped me like that,

184
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,556
and now you want me
to listen to your whining?

185
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,093
You’re just an annoying boss to me now.

186
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,328
A… Annoying…

187
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:34,166
An annoying boss’s whining
is the worst sound on Earth.

188
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,267
I’m leaving.

189
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,941
I’m embarrassed
I used to think someone like you was cool.

190
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,745
But honestly,

191
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,881
I think you were a lot more admirable

192
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,684
before you met Moriguchi-sensei.

193
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,020
Though I could be wrong.

194
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,197
-Thank you very much.
-Okay. Do your best!

195
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,165
Let's go.

196
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,103
Aika.

197
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:15,841
Oh, sorry!

198
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,944
Okay.

199
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,453
Are you sure you don't want to eat?

200
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,754
Yes. I'm okay.

201
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,123
-Oh, let's eat over there.
-Yes.

202
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,392
I chose this one!

203
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,860
-Great!
-Shibuya.

204
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,563
I want to talk to you.

205
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,065
About what?

206
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,533
About your diet.

207
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,335
If you over-restrict
calories, carbs, and fat

208
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,172
because you’re not losing weight,

209
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,808
you could enter a "starvation mode"
from nutrient deficiency…

210
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,309
Sensei, hold on.

211
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,877
What’s going on?

212
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:52,978
What?

213
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,581
I learned about dieting.
You want to lose weight, right?

214
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:57,083
Well…

215
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,617
Yes. So apparently,

216
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,520
when your body enters that state…

217
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,725
Bottom line,
if you really want to be beautiful,

218
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,160
you shouldn’t try to lose weight
too drastically.

219
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,996
Thank you.

220
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,833
I only looked this up during my break,
so it’s not much.

221
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,835
It’s more than enough.

222
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,138
You're a wonderful teacher.

223
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
What brings you to school?

224
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,783
Why is she ignoring me?

225
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,053
Are you here to see Urami-sensei?

226
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:36,822
Guess not.

227
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,992
Coming to his workplace to see him?

228
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,293
That’s kind of intense.

229
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,729
Why is she not reacting?

230
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,132
Is she a crazy person?

231
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,168
Are you always like that, Urumi-sensei?

232
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,136
What?

233
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,606
You really seem
to care about your students.

234
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,409
Well, uh…

235
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,213
Aren’t you scared
to express your own beliefs?

236
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,888
I actually have a favor to ask of you.

237
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,463
So early! Aren't you still on lunch break?

238
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,532
Sorry, it's just…

239
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,435
Aika-sensei!

240
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,905
It’s been a while.

241
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,507
-Why are you here?
-Are you feeling better now?

242
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,508
Yes.

243
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,609
So actually…

244
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,113
Aika-sensei has something
she wants to tell you all.

245
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,347
Can you spare some time?

246
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,682
What?

247
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,984
Sorry. It won’t take long.

248
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,687
I’ll finish before the next class starts.

249
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,557
Everyone, please sit down.

250
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,194
What’s wrong, Urami-sensei?

251
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,397
You look super gloomy.

252
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,206
Originally,
I was supposed to be the homeroom teacher

253
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,474
for Class 2-10.

254
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,710
But I left the school suddenly.

255
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,445
I’m sorry.

256
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,683
Today…

257
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,918
I came to talk about Urumi-sensei.

258
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,691
Shizuka Urumi…

259
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,795
is a murderer.

260
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,334
Shizuka Urumi…

261
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,204
is a murderer.

262
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,578
What are you saying?

263
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,882
Even now, you still don’t get it?

264
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,750
SEE.

265
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,361
Two years ago…

266
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,731
because of something Shizuka Urumi said…

267
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,400
a high school girl took her own life.

268
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,169
Her name was…

269
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:06,305
Karen Suzuki.

270
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,942
She was my little sister!

271
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,379
SUZUKI FAMILY FUNERAL

272
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,589
Because of Shizuka Urumi, my sister died!

273
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,792
Shizuka Urumi is a murderer!

274
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,361
I won’t forgive you!

275
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,329
Aika! Stop it!

276
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,830
You have no right to be a teacher!

277
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:34,867
-Stop, Aika!
-You killed my sister!

278
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,702
I’ll never forgive you!

279
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,137
-Aika!
-Why?

280
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,705
-Hey!
-Stop it!

281
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,141
-Aika!
-Why?

282
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,776
Why are you a teacher?

283
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,177
-Hey!
-Stop it!

284
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,112
-I’ll never forgive you!
-Stop…

285
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,015
-Is this true?
-Yes.

286
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,654
Looks like we’ve finally got a weapon
to bring the principal down.

287
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:04,663
TOTAL INTEGRITY

288
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,265
How is Class 2-10?

289
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,504
The students were visibly shaken.

290
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,809
Is it true Shizuka-sensei…
killed Aika-sensei's sister?

291
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,677
No way she’d do something like that,
right?

292
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,546
Then why did Aika-sensei say that?

293
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,616
Right now, Suzuki-sensei

294
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,920
is explaining everything to Urumi-sensei.

295
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,257
Later, she’ll speak to you herself.

296
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,894
I’m not sure if they believed me or not…

297
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,032
Hayashi-sensei is teaching them now.

298
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:41,667
I see.

299
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,236
Aika-sensei,

300
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,372
Why did you do this?

301
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,010
Isn’t it obvious?

302
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,979
Because I couldn’t forgive her.

303
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,515
You couldn’t forgive her?

304
00:16:56,582 --> 00:17:00,352
Do you really believe
Urumi-sensei killed your sister?

305
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,156
You don't, right?

306
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,027
Your sister didn’t want to burden you…

307
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,096
She was struggling with bullying
and couldn’t talk to anyone.

308
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:14,600
Urumi-sensei only wanted to help Karen…

309
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,302
When she said, "it’s okay to run away"

310
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,139
She meant Karen could leave the school.
She didn't have to bear it.

311
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,575
She was telling her to seek help,
from you.

312
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,711
This was the message from Urumi-sensei.

313
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,146
TOTAL INTEGRITY

314
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,148
You should’ve realized that!

315
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,084
"Should’ve realized"?

316
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,553
What are you saying?

317
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,723
I've given it enough thought.

318
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,125
Principal,

319
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,929
I’ve probably
thought about it more than you!

320
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,100
Why did this happen?

321
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,003
What could’ve stopped it?

322
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,406
Of course,

323
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,745
I know you didn’t mean to kill Karen…

324
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:02,214
I read…

325
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,051
all the conversations

326
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,287
between you, SEE, and Karen.

327
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,193
Did you read all the posts written by SEE?

328
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,297
I understand now that you’re someone

329
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,166
who’s honest with her feelings
and genuinely listens

330
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,768
to those who reach out to you!

331
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,573
But that doesn’t matter!

332
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,444
The fact remains that
what you said triggered Karen’s death!

333
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,550
The person I loved most…

334
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,891
was indirectly killed by
what someone else said.

335
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,063
Even if there was no malice,

336
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,667
even if you were trying to help,

337
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,339
how can I possibly accept that?

338
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,509
How can I forgive that person?

339
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,148
Urumi-sensei struggled a lot too!

340
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,484
And then…

341
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:23,195
She became afraid
to share her feelings with anyone.

342
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,700
As she should be.

343
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,537
She must carry that guilt
for the rest of her life!

344
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,273
But instead,

345
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,246
after just two years,
you’ve already forgotten Karen’s death!

346
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,086
I haven’t forgotten.

347
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,728
There’s no way I could!

348
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,098
Then why are you still teaching?

349
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,403
Your writing…

350
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,705
really was beautiful…

351
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,741
But at the same time,

352
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,680
didn't you get a bit arrogant
over the power of what you say?

353
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,983
Arrogant?

354
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,387
Sharing your feelings and thoughts…

355
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,489
can be a way…

356
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,526
to dominate others

357
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,127
and obtain pleasure.

358
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,464
As a teacher,

359
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,634
I understand how easy it is
to get caught up in that feeling.

360
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,303
But that’s exactly why…

361
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:44,276
speaking to others
comes with responsibility!

362
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:50,015
Did you take responsibility
for what you said?

363
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,286
You didn’t.
That’s why you became a teacher, right?

364
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,223
That’s what I can’t forgive!

365
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,693
If you’d just stayed home,

366
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,630
never speaking to anyone again,

367
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,498
I would’ve been able to forgive you.

368
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,133
No…

369
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,603
Not forgiving…

370
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,608
Maybe I would’ve stopped
thinking about you.

371
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,677
But instead, you…

372
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,846
became a teacher!

373
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,218
And now you're standing there,
preaching to students I care about!

374
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,955
I can’t forgive that!

375
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:31,290
Never!

376
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,401
If I quit teaching…

377
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,372
would you forgive me?

378
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,011
Please tell me.

379
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,250
What can I do for you to forgive me?

380
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,822
Karen died because of me. I know that!

381
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,557
It’s not your fault!

382
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,059
It's my fault!

383
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,795
But…

384
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,334
I don’t know what to do!

385
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,805
How do I atone for this?

386
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,946
What should I do?

387
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,317
Please!

388
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,654
What should I do?

389
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:39,458
Shi-chan!

390
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,027
Get a hold of yourself!

391
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:42,928
Shi-chan!

392
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,132
Aika-sensei.

393
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,035
I’m the one who made her a teacher.

394
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,673
If you can’t forgive her for that,

395
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,509
take it out on me.

396
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,751
Quite the commotion…

397
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,453
isn’t it?

398
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,892
It’s been a while, Suzuki-sensei.

399
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:16,928
But…

400
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,964
Still, I have to say I’m surprised.

401
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,966
So you two

402
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,301
share this kind of history.

403
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:28,573
I understand your pain and frustration.
But this is a school.

404
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,142
First…

405
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,811
we need to address the responsibility

406
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,181
Urumi-sensei and the principal hold
for this situation.

407
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,020
This is…

408
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,456
a serious issue, isn’t it?

409
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,125
If I recall,

410
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,061
you were quite fond of Urumi-sensei.

411
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,698
Like a daughter.

412
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,037
To help her reintegrate
after shutting herself in at home,

413
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,072
you made her a teacher at Meishin,
even though

414
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,375
you knew the grudge
between her and Suzuki-sensei!

415
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,545
You used the school

416
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,413
and its students

417
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,416
-for your own purposes!
-That's not true.

418
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,586
I believed
she had what it takes to be a teacher.

419
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,955
That’s why I brought her to Meishin.

420
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,023
What?

421
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,759
You thought she was suited
to be a teacher?

422
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,395
Even after all the trouble she’s caused?

423
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,396
Trouble?

424
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,965
I believe Meishin has been improving
because of her.

425
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,068
Improving?

426
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,304
And what’s that supposed to mean?

427
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,673
In the first place,

428
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,543
what even makes a "good school"?

429
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,813
"What makes a good school?"

430
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:46,084
That’s a great theme
for educators to discuss.

431
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,018
But…

432
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,588
let’s save that for later.

433
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,791
All you care about is running this school.

434
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,759
Becoming chairman.

435
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,063
And you’re just picking fights
to get rid of me, right?

436
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,432
You’re cozying up
to President Kobayakawa, aren’t you?

437
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,605
Okay, let’s stop here for today.

438
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,974
Get home safe.

439
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,943
-Um… Sensei.
-Yes?

440
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,517
We…

441
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:20,619
Well…

442
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,355
I don't care whatever you think.

443
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,992
I’m taking this incident seriously.

444
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,664
Vice principal!

445
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,935
If you side with Moriguchi-sensei,

446
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,004
I’ll expose everything!

447
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,839
-What is this, all of a sudden?
-Then…

448
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,474
You won't get to be the principal.

449
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,376
-In fact, you'll be fired!
-Stop!

450
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,178
-What’s she talking about?
-It’s nothing.

451
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,880
What do you mean "nothing?"

452
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,048
Then I’ll just say it.

453
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,449
You won’t get away with this!

454
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,953
Calm down, both of you!

455
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,623
I don’t know what you’re fighting about,
but can you please save it for later?

456
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:00,825
Okay?

457
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,329
-You too.
-What?

458
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,264
We don’t have time to deal with you now.

459
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,834
-Excuse me!
-What happened?

460
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,303
The students in Class 2-10

461
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,105
haven’t gone home,
even though class is over.

462
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,549
Tell them to go home.
Right now, Urumi-sensei

463
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,718
and the principal’s disciplinary review
come first!

464
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,320
Most likely,

465
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,789
both of them will be leaving this school.

466
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:35,327
We can’t allow such people
to stand before students.

467
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:37,796
I told you, we don’t have time
to deal with you right now.

468
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,499
Urumi-sensei, go to Class 2-10.

469
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,302
No! This is an order!

470
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,437
Shut up, you brat!

471
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:50,508
I’m the principal of Meishin!
Why should I take orders from you?

472
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,344
I've been holding back.

473
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,779
But I'll let you know,
these fists aren't for show.

474
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,082
If anything happens, I’ll leave the school

475
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,618
before you even tell me to.

476
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,290
Urumi-sensei,

477
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:07,058
please go.

478
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:08,960
But…

479
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,402
Don’t look down!

480
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,607
Are you going to stay silent
and tell the students nothing?

481
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,644
You are a teacher, aren’t you?

482
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,792
Aika! Let's stop this.

483
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,963
I don’t recognize her as a teacher.

484
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,100
It’s up to the students.

485
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,237
They’ve heard what you had to say.

486
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,673
Now it’s Shizuka-sensei's turn to speak.

487
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,076
After that, the students will decide.

488
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,332
How do you plan…

489
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,601
to handle this situation?

490
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,217
Sensei.

491
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,787
Was what Aika-sensei said true?

492
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:48,927
Maybe…

493
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,063
maybe it is.

494
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,701
Is it really true?

495
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,505
Did you kill…

496
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,174
Aika-sensei’s sister?

497
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:12,817
I’m sorry.

498
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,759
Right now, I honestly…

499
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,697
don’t know what I should say…

500
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,334
to you all.

501
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,141
Please give me one day.

502
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,746
Anything I say here will just be
an excuse. I don't want that.

503
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,619
I’m asking you!

504
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,854
Wakisaka-kun!

505
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:42,373
Here you go!

506
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,109
What’s with all this food?

507
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:49,380
Kyoko said you were feeling down,
so I made a lot to cheer you up.

508
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:50,682
Eat up.

509
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,184
I'm not hungry.

510
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,254
You won’t feel better if you don’t eat.

511
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,291
Why are you even here?

512
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,794
This is totally normal, isn’t it?

513
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,665
But after everything that happened today,
wouldn’t most people--

514
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,134
This is so delicious!

515
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:16,140
Why did you make me a teacher?

516
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,078
If you’d stayed jobless and stuck at home,
Kanako would’ve worried herself sick.

517
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:24,949
Besides, you said it yourself,
that you’re meant to be a teacher.

518
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,584
I'm not meant to be--

519
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,319
You want to express your thoughts,

520
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,655
share your ideas with others.

521
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,924
You want to help those who want it.

522
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,359
That’s who you really are, right?

523
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,996
That’s not what I mean.

524
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,902
Why did I have to be the one
to replace Aika?

525
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,571
-I don’t get it.
-Really?

526
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,007
Karen died because of me!

527
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:53,077
Karen didn’t die because of you.

528
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,747
You tried to help her. Isn’t that right?

529
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,483
That’s just what you say

530
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:04,389
-because you’re on my--
-Don’t flatter yourself.

531
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:05,690
I’m on…

532
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,227
no one’s side.

533
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,230
This is delicious.

534
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:16,868
Tomorrow…

535
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,472
I don’t know what I’m supposed to say

536
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:24,142
in front of the students.

537
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,011
If…

538
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,147
one of your students

539
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,083
were going through the same thing,

540
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,252
would you call them a murderer?

541
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,662
I THINK IT'S OKAY TO RUN AWAY.
YOU SHOULD LIVE YOUR LIFE HOW YOU WANT

542
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,348
MEISHIN

543
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,458
What kind of excuse are you going to make
to the students?

544
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,561
No matter what you say,
I won’t forgive you.

545
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:17,462
Stop it.

546
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:18,963
Quit teaching.

547
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,096
CLASS 2-10

548
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:02,240
SCRIPT

549
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,581
I'm sorry about yesterday.

550
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,686
I stayed up all night thinking

551
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,756
about how to express myself clearly.

552
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,795
Do I have bags under my eyes?

553
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,070
When I…

554
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:35,606
was a kid,

555
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,411
I was strong-willed, hated losing,
and had a desperate need for approval.

556
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,683
I was the typical annoying brat.

557
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,954
Not that it's related,

558
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,957
but in college,

559
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,426
I started blogging under the name "SEE,"

560
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:59,130
writing about things that happened
or that crossed my mind.

561
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:03,167
It’s embarrassing to say,

562
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:08,039
but I had a decent number of readers.

563
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,844
Seeing comments from people
who resonated with or praised my writing

564
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:17,148
made me start believing that

565
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:22,820
everything I thought was right.

566
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,357
Yesterday,

567
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,461
I reread my old posts.

568
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,365
I was so cocky, full of myself.

569
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,170
I was ashamed just reading them.

570
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,511
Then one day,

571
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,748
I got a message
from a high school student.

572
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,319
She was being bullied at school

573
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,822
and reached out to me for help.

574
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,126
After exchanging messages several times,

575
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,697
I realized the bullying
was worse than I imagined.

576
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,867
So I told her…

577
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,805
"If it’s too painful,
it’s okay to run away."

578
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,875
"It’s your life."

579
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,745
"You should live your life
the way you want."

580
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,113
I sent her that message.

581
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,550
And then…

582
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,986
that student…

583
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,490
took her own life.

584
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,761
When I said "it was okay to run away,"

585
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,530
of course I meant

586
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:44,402
she could run from her environment,
and from toxic relationships,

587
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,805
not from life itself.

588
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,177
Well, yes. Of course.

589
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,213
I thought…

590
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,883
she would understand it that way.

591
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,287
But…

592
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:08,593
what's obvious to you
might not be obvious to others.

593
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:13,864
What’s considered normal changes
with your situation or mental state.

594
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:19,136
That student was probably struggling
with suicidal intent.

595
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:24,008
So "it's okay to run away"
was the wrong thing to say at that time.

596
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,077
I may have

597
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,280
influenced her to make that choice.

598
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,818
I got arrogant,
thinking I was always right.

599
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:41,125
I was shallow, narrow-minded,
and thoughtless.

600
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,165
Just like Aika-sensei said…

601
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,504
I'm a murderer.

602
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,441
I don't think that's true.

603
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,745
What's not true?

604
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,315
Calling yourself a murderer…

605
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,751
That’s just wrong.

606
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,021
I think so too.

607
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,455
What?

608
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,593
Yesterday, the principal asked me this.

609
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,728
"If your student made the same mistake,

610
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:22,767
would you blame them and
call them a murderer?"

611
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,171
I would never do that and
wouldn't think that way.

612
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,008
If someone thinks like that,
I’d be so pissed at them.

613
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,115
So now, I’m going to give a sermon

614
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:44,055
to myself, for blaming myself.

615
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,765
You think you’re not worthy
of expressing your opinions,

616
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,667
so you avoid people.

617
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,604
You think that's atonement?

618
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,574
That’s just self-satisfaction!

619
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,654
My true atonement isn’t to stay silent.

620
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,458
It’s to help students who are struggling,
like that girl.

621
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,026
Of course,

622
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,495
I can’t help everyone,

623
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,665
but if someone like me

624
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,235
is someone they can turn to,

625
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,605
then I want to share my thoughts…

626
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,075
to save them!

627
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,415
Since meeting you all,

628
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,052
and becoming a teacher,

629
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,391
I’ve come to feel that way.

630
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,363
Words are terrifying.

631
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,534
What you believe to be right
can hurt others,

632
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:08,038
or push them to the edge,
depending on the situation.

633
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:13,277
That’s why when you speak,
make sure it’s conveyed correctly.

634
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,381
Think about the other person

635
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,384
before you speak.

636
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,489
To make sure it never happens again…

637
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,592
That’s what…

638
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,597
it means to take responsibility.

639
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:43,140
Even after saying all this,

640
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,380
I’m not sure if I’ve conveyed

641
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,349
my feelings properly.

642
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,594
Please…

643
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,166
let me remain your teacher.

644
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,375
This is too much, all at once.

645
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,010
We don’t know what to say.

646
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,982
I still want to talk with you!

647
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,857
So I want you to stay our teacher.

648
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,794
I wouldn't want you to quit, either.

649
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,095
That was…

650
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,966
a long story, right?

651
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,101
-Yes, a little.
-A little.

652
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,669
-Yes, a little.
-A little.

653
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,304
She improved my vocabulary!

654
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,606
But you were in remedial…

655
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,008
-Yes.
-Don't talk about remedial class!

656
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,845
Don't mention it!

657
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,248
-My head hurts!
-Your head hurts, huh?

658
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,062
Aika-sensei!

659
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,036
Hey.

660
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,541
I, uh…

661
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,013
I know I went on and on
in front of the students.

662
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:32,283
Just say what you want to say.

663
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,252
Hey…

664
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,990
About Karen…

665
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,929
I’m really sorry.

666
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,299
Still…

667
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,337
I want to keep teaching…

668
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,641
for Karen’s sake, too.

669
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,582
-Aika!
-Can I…

670
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,354
continue being a teacher?

671
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,161
The ones who’ll decide that
are the students.

672
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,343
Vice principal.

673
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:33,377
A moment, please.

674
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,882
What did you want to talk about?

675
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,685
What do you mean?

676
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,356
It’s about you and Urumi-sensei.

677
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,759
We can’t just let this slide

678
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,528
after everything that’s happened.

679
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:55,299
But Aika-sensei, Urumi-sensei,
and the students have accepted it.

680
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:57,101
So what’s the issue?

681
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:59,670
That’s not all. I've looked into it.

682
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:02,906
The reason Suzuki-sensei quit this school…

683
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,842
wasn’t health-related.

684
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,410
I won't forgive you for being happy!

685
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,278
Because of you!

686
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,781
She committed assault, didn’t she?

687
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,116
You’re exaggerating.

688
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,218
It’s not like she hit anyone.

689
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,753
She wasn’t arrested either.

690
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,590
She was emotionally unstable.

691
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,291
That surely counts as health issue.

692
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:22,426
Even so,

693
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:26,030
-you never reported--
-I told the Chairman.

694
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,366
Maybe he didn’t tell you.

695
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,137
Jeez…

696
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:34,905
That damn old man…

697
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,974
If you want to talk about problems,

698
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:41,545
what about the things you’ve done?

699
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,247
EXPULSION LIST

700
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:48,352
Like the issue of the
expulsion list being leaked…

701
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,391
MEISHIN

702
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,268
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

703
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,970
THIS DRAMA IS FICTION
