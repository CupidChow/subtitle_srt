1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:08,908
That looks cute!

2
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,643
Whoa, she's uploading it!

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,412
That's a jackpot!

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,214
It's the biggest highlight!

5
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:16,916
Thank you for waiting.

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,052
Here’s your seasonal Alien Parfait.

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,920
-Who ordered this?
-Me.

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,989
Eating due to stress?

9
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,424
No way you have stress, Ayaka.

10
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,459
What is stress?

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,794
It's really good!

12
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:28,695
Is that good?

13
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,998
Stop it!

14
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:34,567
<i>So noisy…</i>

15
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,138
<i>First time I dine out in a while</i>
<i>and I get a bunch of noisy brats.</i>

16
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,672
<i>Just my luck…</i>

17
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,007
Whoa, it’s already online.

18
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,043
-It's Iroha-chan!
-Right?

19
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,513
-Don't upload it!
<i>-I wish some adult would say something.</i>

20
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,681
<i>But I’m the only adult here.</i>

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,319
<i>Am I really the one</i>
<i>who has to tell them off? Me?</i>

22
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,822
<i>Wait! Am I even an adult?</i>

23
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,092
WHAT IS AN ADULT?

24
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,660
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE AN ADULT?

25
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:04,063
<i>Independent both mentally and financially.</i>

26
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,065
AN ADULT IS…
A NEET…

27
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>I’m a neet, though.</i>

28
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,571
<i>It’s best if the staff handles it.</i>

29
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,541
<i>He's totally zoned out…</i>

30
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,142
-Go get some cola.
-Me too.

31
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,310
-Okay.
-Thank you.

32
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,411
-Two colas and iced tea, okay?
-Look.

33
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,046
What? Marshmallow?

34
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,181
-This…
-Not a marshmallow.

35
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,549
-It's Toko, right?
-It's not marshmallow?

36
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,384
I'm going home now.

37
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,253
-It's too early!
-I'm got bored!

38
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,956
Can we take a picture
and upload it on Instagram?

39
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,426
<i>They’re seriously so loud.</i>

40
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,162
-See you.
-See you.

41
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,897
-See you.
-Bye.

42
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,739
Hey, what are you doing? You're so clumsy.

43
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:47,640
Are you okay?

44
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,842
-Refill it again.
-Okay.

45
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,211
<i>You say sorry before you say OK!</i>

46
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,512
<i>Why is that your priority?</i>

47
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,514
<i>You got my clothes dirty.</i>

48
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,183
<i>If I don’t say something now,</i>

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,552
<i>they won't become responsible adults.</i>

50
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,667
DINER

51
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,668
<i>Still…</i>

52
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,838
<i>However, they turn out…</i>

53
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:19,973
<i>It’s none of my business.</i>

54
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,074
HAMBURGER

55
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,842
<i>Besides,</i>

56
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,678
<i>it's not like I am a model adult either.</i>

57
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,585
URUMI

58
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,427
Welcome back.

59
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,430
Getting out once in a while
clears your head, right?

60
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,400
Do I look refreshed?

61
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,002
You look dead.

62
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,672
You sure you can start work tomorrow?

63
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,074
<i>Tomorrow’s…</i>

64
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,277
<i>my first day back at work in two years.</i>

65
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,344
<i>Honestly…</i>

66
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,980
I feel gloomy.

67
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,956
<i>The real world</i>
<i>demands communication skills.</i>

68
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,424
<i>But…</i>

69
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,627
<i>I hate expressing my thoughts to others.</i>

70
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,229
You can sit there.

71
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,098
Please, go ahead.

72
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,671
<i>I don’t think I can explain myself well</i>

73
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,706
<i>without being misunderstood.</i>

74
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:31,744
<i>Even if I believe I’m right</i>
<i>that doesn’t mean they’ll see it that way.</i>

75
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,180
-Hey. Listen.
<i>-Besides…</i>

76
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,648
This is a priority seat.

77
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,717
Please give her your seat.

78
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,953
-It’s fine.
-No, it’s not.

79
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,123
Priority seats are meant for the elderly
and pregnant women.

80
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,659
Don't you have manners?

81
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,762
Actually, I'm pregnant.

82
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,199
<i>By forcing an opinion…</i>

83
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,436
<i>you might hurt someone,</i>

84
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,571
<i>or back yourself into a corner.</i>

85
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,540
If that's so…

86
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>I’d rather avoid the hassle entirely.</i>

87
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,744
-I'm sorry.
-<i>But…</i>

88
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,414
<i>A 28-year-old neet,</i>

89
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,516
<i>who is back at her parent's house</i>

90
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,185
<i>is forced to rejoin society</i>

91
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,320
<i>by her concerned mother</i>

92
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,989
<i>and her assertive friend.</i>

93
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:28,935
<i>Still…</i>

94
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,205
<i>starting out as a high school teacher</i>
<i>is way too much.</i>

95
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,841
I’m Shizuka Urumi.

96
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,276
Nice to meet you.

97
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,245
Urumi-sensei,

98
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,648
I can’t really hear you.

99
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,616
Oh.

100
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,389
I’m sure I’ll cause all kinds of trouble,

101
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,025
but I’ll do my best to become…

102
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,226
a teacher students love.

103
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,495
A teacher loved by their students.

104
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,765
That’s a truly wonderful goal.

105
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,669
So tell me.

106
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,171
What kind of teacher
do you think is loved…

107
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:07,707
by their students?

108
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,611
I believe it’s a teacher…

109
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,447
who stands by their convictions.

110
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,549
As times change,

111
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,452
more teachers
hesitate to speak up to students.

112
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,120
But,

113
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,423
if you have conviction,

114
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,391
there’s no need to be afraid.

115
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,861
Good luck, Shi-chan.

116
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,998
Let’s do our best today.

117
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,834
-Sure.
-Let's.

118
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,846
Good morning. What’s with that face?

119
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,349
I teach class 11-9. We met
during training.

120
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,718
I'm Urami. Forgot already?

121
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,586
This is a priority seat.

122
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,855
Priority seats are for elderly
and pregnant women.

123
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,058
I remember you well.

124
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,927
Let’s work well together, Shizuka-sensei.

125
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,095
Shizuka?

126
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:05,531
Don't call her by her first name
right away.

127
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,066
That’s too hasty.

128
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:10,336
My name’s Urami, and she is Urumi.

129
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,673
It’s confusing,
so this way it’s clearer, right?

130
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,777
-Yes.
-Then I’ll call you Shizuka-sensei too.

131
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,879
And feel free to call me Seira.

132
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,647
Yes…

133
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,083
Ah, Urumi-sensei!

134
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,819
-Looking forward to working with you.
-Same here.

135
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,489
If there’s anything you’re unsure about,
just ask me.

136
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,091
It could be about
good places to eat around here

137
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,560
or love problems.

138
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,696
Don’t hold back.

139
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,664
It's my job, as head teacher of your year.

140
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,234
Oh, right.

141
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,936
Earlier, the principal was talking

142
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,606
about teachers
with strong convictions or something.

143
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,541
You can forget that.

144
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,644
Keep a healthy distance from students.

145
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,247
Don’t scold, praise, or give advice.

146
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,617
That’s the basic policy
of the School Reform Committee.

147
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,185
Sound good? See you.

148
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,924
What’s the School Reform Committee?

149
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,226
A committee to flatter the students.

150
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,095
"Flatter" might sound harsh.

151
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,631
But it’s not wrong, is it,
Moriguchi-sensei?

152
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,433
PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS
WITH UNFULFILLED ENROLLMENT QUOTAS

153
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,536
If you want to call it flattery, sure.

154
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,739
Over 70% of private schools now fall short
of enrollment targets.

155
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,975
Everyone’s struggling.

156
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,811
So yes, it’s necessary.

157
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,413
Our school used to be
a prestigious prep school

158
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,715
with strict guidance policies.

159
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,951
But that kind of approach
doesn’t work anymore.

160
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,753
Applications plummeted,

161
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,254
and we met management difficulties.

162
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,858
To fix that, the School Reform Committee

163
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,626
was created around Vice-Principal Shinjo.

164
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,628
Schools are like service providers

165
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:46,532
that give students what they want
and avoid trouble.

166
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,868
Don’t scold them, don’t praise them,
don’t give advice.

167
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,471
-That’s the stance…
-You're too verbose!

168
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,972
No girl likes a man who talks too much.

169
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,940
It's too long.

170
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,210
<i>So these are the people</i>
<i>I’ll be working with starting today.</i>

171
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,278
<i>Ugh, what a pain.</i>

172
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:03,816
As fellow supporters of the Principal,
let's do our best, Shizuha-sensei.

173
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,119
-The Principal?
-Wait, Shizuka-sensei.

174
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,555
you were introduced
by the principal, right?

175
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,592
The principal and the reform committee…

176
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,094
The principal and vice-principal…

177
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,030
they don't get along so be careful.

178
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,266
Well then, see you.

179
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,834
Sensei.

180

The first greeting shows
what you want to say to the students.

181
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,906
Do your best! See you.

00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,544
<i>Something I want to tell the students?</i>

183
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,780
<i>I don’t really have anything like that.</i>

184
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,325
<i>So for now,</i>

185
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,995
<i>I’ll start with something neutral.</i>

186
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,366
I’m taking over from Suzuki-sensei,
your previous teacher.

187
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,335
Starting today,
I’ll be in charge of class 11-10.

188
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,004
My name is Shizuka Urumi.

189
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,972
Pleased to meet you.

190
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,010
<i>No reaction.</i>

191
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,747
<i>Well, in terms of being neutral,</i>
<i>that was a decent opening.</i>

192
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,615
I’ll be teaching logic and rhetoric.

193
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,553
I don’t really have any hobbies
or talents worth bragging about.

194
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,988
I’m not a particularly exciting person,

195
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,824
but I hope this year we spend together

196
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,327
turns out to be something special.

Weren’t you at that diner yesterday,
sensei?

229
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,420
-Diner?
-What did she eat?

230
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,356
-Is she a commoner?
-You know her?

231
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,824
There must be students…

232
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,961
Look at this.

If uniforms are cuter,
more students would enroll, right?

235
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,601
I want to present this

-What do you think?
-I don't think so.

237
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,975
Some people might like it, sure.

238
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,711
Most students will complain.

239
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,846
Don’t young people
like this kind of thing?

240
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:23,015
You’re underestimating
young people’s taste.

241
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,818
It’s over the top,
cringe, and basically 2.5D.

242
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,887
Parents definitely
wouldn’t stay quiet about it.

00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,589
Shizuka-sensei, here.

244
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,394
You look completely dead inside.

245
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,200
I think the students
totally lost respect for you.

246
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,369
Was it because my pun didn’t work?

247
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,838
No, that’s not the issue.

248
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,339
It’s how you acted at the diner.

00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:53,345
<i>Your clothes got dirty and you went out</i>
<i>without saying anything, didn’t you?</i>

250
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,782
Kids that age pick up
on that kind of thing.

251
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,186
They’re like,
"She won’t say anything no matter what."

252
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,487
"We can walk all over her."

253
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,523
Once students start walking over you,
it’s rough.

254
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,726
What happens then?

255
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,494
<i>For starters,</i>

256
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,564
<i>more kids will misbehave in class.</i>

257
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,866
Do you know, Watanuki?

258
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,035
<i>They stop listening to the teacher.</i>

259
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,471
Class was so boring,

260
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,106
I was just playing on my phone.

261
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,807
<i>They start talking back.</i>

262
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,843
<i>And once that happens…</i>

263
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,612
You’ve got to yell at them!

264
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,648
What’s so bad about being walked over?

265
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,584
Getting angry is too much work.

266
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,485
Right?

267
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,554
<i>It's true, I don't like getting angry.</i>

268
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,425
And if you overwork yourself,
and end up sick like Aika-sensei,

269
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,595
we’d have to find yet
another replacement teacher.

270
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,900
Hey, Iroha!

00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:48,868

Sorry, I’ve got cram school today.

274
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,441
-Oh, come on.
-But…

275
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,077
Why? We're inviting you.

276
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,278
That's right.

277
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,413
Your grades are worse than mine.

278
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,015
You're stupid.

279
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,050
There's no point
studying at the cram school.

280
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,819
-Right?
-Just for today is okay, right?

281
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,955
Let's go, it’s not fun without you.

282
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,190
Right?

283
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,093
-Okay.
-Alright, it’s settled.

284
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,294
Yes!

00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,395

286
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,964
Want to come with us

287
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,834
-I want to.
-You do?

288
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,536
Sure. Kaito, let's go.

289
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,205
-No, I’m good.
-What?

290
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,473
Oh no! Another time!

291
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,542
-What?
-He's not going?

292
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,543
Kaito?

293
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,045
Hey…

294
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,382
What is it?

295
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,853
It’s nothing.

296
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,022

00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:45,724

So enthusiastic.

304
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,782
You're reading through
all the student files so carefully.

305
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,350
That’s great and all,

306
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,353
but keep a good distance
from the students.

307
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,156
Just don’t stir up

308
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,757
any unnecessary trouble.

309
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,330

a little too intense.

00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,032
Right, Urumi-sensei?

311
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,335
Actually, I’m not really…

312
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,975
Keep an eye on her at all times.

313
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,309
Yes.

314
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,647
Hey, earlier, what did you say to her?

315
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,483
Nothing.

316
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,851
Whoa…

317
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,320
Are you two fighting?

318
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,555
Mind your own business.

319
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,695

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,414

00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,652

Hey, sensei, dance with us!

327
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,625
To celebrate you as our homeroom teacher.
Let's film and upload it.

328
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,295
I’m not good with that kind of thing.

329
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,497
Come on, just dance with us!

330
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,167
<i>This awkward mood is exhausting.</i>

Let's dance, sensei!

335
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,648
-Come on!
-Dance!

336
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,017

00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,258
<i>They’re definitely walking all over me…</i>

340
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,026
You can dance. It's easy.

341
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,829
<i>I don't care anymore…</i>

342
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:05,297
It's boring.

343
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,599
You're always looking down.

344
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,605
What a lame person.

345
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,608
Shut it, brat.

346
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,380
You’re so annoying.

347
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,116
What’s so fun about bullying someone?

348
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,091
<i>Oh no! I said it…</i>

349
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,429
What’s her deal?

350
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,931
We were just messing with her.

351
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,172
I’m sorry.
I’m really bad with this kind of thing.

352
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,275
Anyway,

353
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,977
please get home safely, everyone.

354
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,645

Shi-chan! Over here.

359
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,904
Yes.

360
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,106
SCIENCE PREP ROOM

361
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,044
This is the science prep room.

362
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,479
It’s not used anymore,
so no one comes here.

363
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,349
Sometimes I come here to relax.

364
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,885
-Sit down, Shi.
-Okay.

365
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,754
So, what happened?

366
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,157
You told a student

367
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,459
"shut it, brat"? That’s hilarious!

368
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,095
-Why are you laughing?
-No.

369
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,197
I thought it was so you.

370
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,832
You get fired up easily.

371
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,767
You’re really competitive.

372
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,402
That was the old me.

373
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,938
But personality
doesn’t change that easily, does it?

374
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,741
I really don’t think

375
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,645
I’m cut out for teaching.

376
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,881
Is that how an adult should act?

377
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,784
You took the job.
You can’t quit after one day.

378
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,921
The school has to process paperwork
and find a replacement.

379
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,490
We need you here for at least a month.

380
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:14,093
How about Kanako?

381
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,428
Will you go back to being a neet,
and worry your mom again?

382
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,797
-Originally…
-I got it!

383
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,699
The rice cracker…

384
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,102
<i>Due to her persistence,</i>

385
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,371
<i>I ended up having to be a teacher.</i>

386
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,708
It’s still just the first day.

387
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,743
Just keep going.

388
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,382
Goodbye.

389
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,750
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

390
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,989
<i>I promised myself I wouldn’t meddle</i>
<i>in other people’s business anymore.</i>

391
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,760
<i>I just want to go home, eat dinner,</i>

392
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,562
<i>and take a relaxing bath.</i>

393
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,164
Heading home now?

394
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,300
<i>Iroha Naito?</i>

395
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,503
Why are you here?

396
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,438
My house is this way.

397
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,206
SHINMEIGAOKA STATION

398
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,574
I see.

399
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,587
<i>After being a neet for so long,</i>

400
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,789
<i>I’ve totally forgotten</i>
<i>how to make small talk</i>

401
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,791
<i>to fill the silence.</i>

402
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,230
Do you always go home this late?

403
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,069
I waited, hoping I’d run into you.

404
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,638
I was waiting.

405
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,606
<i>Waiting?</i>

406
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,210
Do I look like someone

407
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,947
who’s being bullied
by Hina and her friends?

408
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,183
<i>What are you asking me?</i>

409
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,019
It hurts.

410
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,488
It hurts?

411
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,256
I…

412
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,959
really wanted to be friends
with Hina-chan.

413
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,962
So at first,
I tried to laugh off the teasing.

414
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,531
But it’s gotten harder to take.

415
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,567
But…

416
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,936
I don’t have the courage
to tell her to stop.

417
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,907
<i>Wow… she’s coming to me for help?</i>

418
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,342
Oh.

419
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,514
What do you want me to do?

420
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,586
I don’t know.

421
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,120
But…

422
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,789
ｗhen I saw you say

423
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,257
"Shut it, brat"

424
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,558
to Hina-chan today,

425
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,528
it made me feel a tiny bit better.

426
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,965
So, I thought if it’s you…

427
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,602
<i>If it’s me, what?</i>

428
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,372
<i>Wait, wait, wait!</i>

429
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,008
<i>What are you about to say? What is it?</i>

430
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,343
<i>This is scary!</i>

431
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:46,678
Sensei…

432
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,048
please help me.

433
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,789
<i>Don’t say that to me.</i>

434
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,993
Here you go!

435
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,997
How was it? Going back into society.

436
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,398
Was it fun?

437
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,801
Does it look like that?

438
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,637
Your face looks dead.

439
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,676
If it’s too hard, you can quit.

440
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,411
If I say that,

441
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,613
Kyoko will tell me I spoil you too much.

442
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,315
She’ll get mad at me.

443
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,219
Just hang in there a bit longer.

444
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,456
But don’t push yourself too hard, okay?

445
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,327
I won’t.

446
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,131
If I could push myself,
I wouldn’t have been a neet for two years.

447
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,768
Two years, huh?

448

MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

454
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,369
Morning.

455
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,139
Good morning, Shizuka-sensei!

456
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,075
Good morning.

457
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,076
Whoa.

458
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,778
What’s with your face?

459
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,881
Is it really that bad?

460
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,683
You look like a zombie.

461
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,953
So I have gone beyond looking dead.

462
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,455

464
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,728
Please…

465
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,897
don’t tell anyone.

466
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,134
Can I have a moment?

467
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,135
Yes.

468
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,806
There are rumors in Class 11-10
that Hina Watanuki and her friends

469
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,441
are bullying Iroha Naito.

470
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,609
You're saying it?

471
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,144
Of course. That’s a serious issue.

472
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,947
Don't tell Urami-sensei things.

473
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,416
Where did that information come from?

474
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,585
Apparently, Urumi-sensei

475
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,054
heard it directly from Iroha Naito.

476
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,856
Urumi-sensei, is that true?

477
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,327
-Oguchi-sensei.
-Yes.

478
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,497
As the head, what’s your take on this?

479
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,165
-Yes.
-Well…

480
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,501
We’re asking Urumi-sensei.

481
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,203
Urumi-sensei has only been here one day.

482
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,874
Oguchi-sensei has been
watching them since last year.

483
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,943
Wouldn’t she understand
their relationship better?

484
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,846
I think Watanuki and Naito

485
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,482
are very close friends.

486
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,385
Naito’s more of the teasing type.

487
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,286
Teasing type?

488
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:44,489
I think it’s more teasing than bullying.

489
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,793
But Urumi-sensei said
Naito asked her for help.

490
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,828
Maybe she was joking?

491
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:52,731
Naito’s the playful type.

492
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,067
Bullying is an extremely sensitive issue.

493
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,837
If there is even a suspicion,

494
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,006
we will form an investigation committee

495
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,341
and confirm the facts
before taking action.

496
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,577
Everyone, please do not act

497
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,580
based on personal judgment.

498
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:10,348
Thank you.

499
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,852
Did it go?

500
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,689
Oh, no! Now I’m feeling nervous.

501
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,723
Why?

502
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,492
-I'm nervous.
-Why?

503
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,261
-Let's do it!
-She's coming!

504
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,203
Okay, let’s begin homeroom.

505
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,304
Umm…

506
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:34,506
Sensei.

507
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,242
Yes?

508
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:47,552
Could you…

509
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,590
apologize to Hina?

510
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,625
What are you saying?

511
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:54,893
She said…

512
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,062
being told this

513
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,798
really hurt her.

514
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,969
<i>Shut up, brat!</i>

515
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,404
If you won’t apologize,

516
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,007
I’ll upload this video online.

517
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,746
<i>I see.</i>

518
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,715
<i>Someone told you to say this.</i>

519
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,920
<i>We’re told not to act on our own judgment…</i>

520
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>But still…</i>

521
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,394
Naito…

522
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,299
Let’s stop this already.

523
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,668
What?

524
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,276
Watanuki,

525
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,178
you made her say that, right?

526
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,815
I didn’t say anything.

527
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,652
Iroha’s just doing it
because she cares about me.

528
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,520
There’s no way that’s true.

529
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,324
No matter how you look at it,
you’re the one behind this.

530
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,694
Then show me proof that I made her say it.

531
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,231
<i>I have a short fuse.</i>

532
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,400
Shut it, brat.

533
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,139
You said it again!

534
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,442
You don’t feel bad at all, do you?

535
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,647
Then I guess it’s okay
if I post that video.

536
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:27,786
If I do, you’ll be fired.

537
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,154
So what if I get fired?

538
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,556
If I get fired, that just means

539
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,959
I don’t have to
hold anything back anymore.

540
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,463
And I’ll expose everything you did
to Iroha Naito.

541
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,665
Every last bit of it.

542
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,337
<i>I don’t give up easily.</i>

543
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,906
How not to…

544
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,142
lose…

545
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,344
HOW TO NOT LOSE IN AN ARGUMENT

546
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,680
Bullying? Still talking about it?

547
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:59,517
I told you. It’s just teasing.
Iroha said so herself!

548
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,720
That’s because you made her say it.

549
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,090
She’s scared of you.
That’s why she said it.

550
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,024
GET UNDER THEIR SKIN

551
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,426
Even an idiot could see that.

552
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,528
Scared?

553
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,330
I seriously don’t get it.

554
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:16,134
If you don’t get it
then maybe you really are an idiot.

555
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,770
USE DIFFICULT WORDS
TO CONTROL THE CONVERSATION

556
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,505
You should educate yourself.

557
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:24,442
When people perceive themselves
as superior,

558
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,147
they often act violently toward those
they consider inferior.

559
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,950
That’s bullying.

560
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,587
It’s not bullying. It’s just teasing.

561
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,555
You only know one phrase.

562
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:42,394
I didn’t find a single thing funny
about your teasing.

563
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,130
That makes it bullying.

564
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,965
Everyone was laughing.

565
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,601
Everyone in the class was laughing.

566
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,502
EXPLAIN THE ARGUMENT

567
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:52,671
INVOLVE EVERYONE

568
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,973
Were they really?

569
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,347
If they were…

570
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,618
Then you’re all guilty too.

571
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,023
What’s all the commotion?

572
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,895
You said that?

573
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,232
What are you doing?

574
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,569
<i>What am I doing?</i>

575
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:28,673
<i>I got all worked up</i>
<i>over someone not even worth talking to.</i>

576
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,175
I'm sorry.

577
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,144
You were told…

578
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,548
not to make assumptions about bullying
without confirming the facts!

579
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,317
Why did you unilaterally decide

580
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,486
it was bullying?

581
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,023
<i>Should I just tell him…</i>

582
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,891
<i>I want to quit teaching?</i>

583
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,661
Answer me!

584
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,434
-I…
-Wait, vice-principal.

585
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,236
While Urumi-sensei's behavior

586
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,639
may have been inappropriate for a teacher,

587
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,443
I also think the students
were teasing her too much.

588
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,679
But even if that’s true,

589
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,281
it’s not okay for a teacher
to lose their temper.

590
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,083
-I don't--
-Why not?

591
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,451
What do you mean by "why not"?

592
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,222
Adults today…

593
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,558
are way too afraid to scold kids.

594
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,827
I believe that…

595
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,197
if a child shows blatant disrespect,

596
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,100
an adult should be allowed
to scold them firmly.

597
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,269
That’s an abuse of power.

598
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,472
True, it’s a fine line.

599
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,775
If you care for them,

600
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:41,513
choose your words carefully,
words they can accept,

601
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,047
you’ll get through to them.

602
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,116
What matters is

603
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,186
the teacher’s resolve.

604
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,156
Urumi-sensei…

605
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:55,426
your lecture to Watanuki earlier…

606
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,595
was disgraceful.

607
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,300
Scolding and yelling are not the same.

608
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,538
Scolding means
you care about the other person.

609
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:11,009
Yelling means
you only care about yourself.

610
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,678
That speech you gave.

611
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:17,015
You only said it
so you wouldn’t lose the argument.

612
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,485
You were thinking only of yourself.

613
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,887
Winning an argument…

614
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,590
accomplishes nothing.

615
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,926
<i>You're absolutely right.</i>

616
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,662
Then, Principal…

617
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,097
Are you saying
you’ll forgive Urumi-sensei?

618
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:37,335
If the parents find out about this,
it could become a huge scandal.

619
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,073
If something happens,

620
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,008
we’ll deal with it then.

621
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,546
<i>If something happens?</i>

622
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,648
<i>What else could possibly happen?</i>

623
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,351
First,

624
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:55,620
as written in the notes,

625
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,722
let’s label A³ as capital A,

626
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,491
and B³ as capital B to simplify.

627
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:02,727
I HEARD SHE'S BEEN
BULLYING SOMEONE AT SCHOOL

628
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,097
If we substitute, the equation becomes A²

629
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,800
minus B².

630
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,839
<i>Ugh, I don’t want to go back to class.</i>

631
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,415
Hey, Iroha.

632
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,285
Do you think I’m bullying you?

633
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,090
-Well…
-Why don’t you say you’re not bullied?

634
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,562
Why are you acting like a victim?

635
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,297
It's not like that--

636
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,367
You said you wanted to join our group,

637
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:43,735
so we let you in.

638
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,103
Seriously, what’s your deal?

639
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,541
Don’t talk to us ever again.

640
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,186
Mai, Riko.

641
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,824
Post that video of her online.

642
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,928
<i>Spread it everywhere.</i>

643
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,397
<i>We’ll make sure she gets fired.</i>

644
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,770
Guys,

645
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,773
I’m uploading that teacher’s video online.

646
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,208
Share it with everyone.

647
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,880
Shut up.

648
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,551
Why the hell should we listen to you?

649
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,154
There’s nothing funny…

650
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,757
about what you’re doing.

651
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,405
Sensei.

652
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,674
I’m going to die.

653
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:00,378
What you said really hurt me.

654
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,879
I’m going to die.

655
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,583
-What are you saying?
-You’re not going to die.

656
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,219
She’s trying to get attention.

657
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,790
Hina!

658
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:17,895
<i>Die?</i>

659
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,033
Continue studying!

660
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:25,937
What happened?

661
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,672
Watanuki said she’d kill herself.

662
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,108
Kill herself? Where’d she go?

663
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,877
I don’t know.
I panicked and lost sight of her.

664
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,346
-Let’s check the rooftop.
-Yes.

665
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,890
-Hina.
-What?

666
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,226
It’s just…

667
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,396
This is all your fault.

668
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:56,334
-I’m sorry.
-Sorry doesn’t cut it.

669
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,902
What will you do?

670
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,009
Stop acting like the victim.

671
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,880
-Watanuki!
-Thanks to you guys,

672
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:13,618
everyone looks at me like a bully now!

673
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,322
Yesterday, they were all laughing
while I teased Iroha.

674
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:20,858
But now,
everyone’s suddenly flipped on me.

675
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,293
It’s seriously pissing me off.

676
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,330
I can’t stay in that class anymore.

677
00:34:27,764 --> 00:34:29,467
Take responsibility!

678
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,202
Responsibility?

679
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:33,103
Apologize to me in front of everyone!

680
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,039
Say it was all your fault

681
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,708
and that I never bullied anyone!

682
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,677
If you don’t, I’ll die!

683
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,380
Understood.

684
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:45,315
-Let’s make a deal.
-Vice-Principal.

685
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,386
Urumi-sensei.

686
00:34:49,286 --> 00:34:50,755
You understand, right?

687
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,458
You understand, right?

688
00:34:59,097 --> 00:34:59,997
Yes.

689
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:03,034
In return,

690
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,570
if Urumi-sensei apologizes,

691
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,940
please put an end to this incident.

692
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,953
Kyoko-san.

693
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,455
Call me…

694
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,691
"Principal" at school.

695
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,061
I…

696
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,598
don’t want to apologize to Watanuki.

697
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,334
There’s no way
I’m bowing to a brat like her!

698
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,768
Then,

699
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,938
scold her properly.

700
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,175
Explain what was wrong and what was right.

701
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,277
You just have to make sure
she understands.

702
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,178
I don't want to.

703
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:50,948
Why do I have to lecture her?

704
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,383
What do I gain from it?

705
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:57,221
If she doesn’t understand,
it ends up being my fault anyway!

706
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,423
I don’t even care about that girl!

707
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,459
Besides,

708
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,929
I don’t have the kind of noble words

709
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,298
to lecture someone like that.

710
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,836
And yet…

711
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,338
That’s what a teacher is.

712
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,844
Then I’m not cut out for this. I quit!

713
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:25,183
Causing trouble and quitting
without any explanation?

714
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,585
I hate people like that!

715
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,022
-Hate…
-The things you said

716
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:35,927
triggered all of this.
Watanuki, Naito and Class 11-10.

717
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,462
And now you’re walking away?

718
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,897
And you call yourself a teacher?

719
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,099
I never wanted to be a teacher anyway!

720
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,302
I don't care!

721
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,703
In society, when you mess up,

722
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,506
you take responsibility for it!

723
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,142
You’re an adult.
Don’t expect others to clean up your mess!

724
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:08,960
SCIENCE PREP ROOM

725
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:11,796
MEISHIN

726
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,358
Sensei.

727
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,961
Why are you staying quiet?

728
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,500
Can’t you clear up this misunderstanding?

729
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,171
Just apologize already.

730
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:57,541
So annoying.

731
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,451
What are you doing?

732
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,156
I couldn’t bear listening
to your nonsense,

733
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,891
so I scrolled on my phone.

734
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:16,661
-What?
-What is she saying?

735
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,129
What are you talking about?

736
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,766
Forget that. Just apologize already.

737
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,004
No way.

738
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,575
You were the one bullying Naito.

739
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,711
I wasn’t bullying Iroha.

740
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,980
You misunderstood everything.

741
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,249
Are you going to say it was teasing,
not bullying?

742
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,586
Then tell me. What’s the difference?

743
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:45,022
Answer me.

744
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,927
Can I be frank?

745
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,333
Bullying and teasing are the same.

746
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,168
No difference.

747
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,238
The only difference
is whether the person on the receiving end

748
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,807
accepts it or not.

749
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,611
Did Naito actually enjoy
what you did to her?

750
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,846
She laughed.

751
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,951
It looked to me like
she was forcing herself.

752
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,358
It's complicated with you guys though.

753
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,428
It's true she did used to enjoy

754
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,664
being teased by you.

755
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:28,599
But now,

756
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:33,003
she doesn’t want that anymore.

757
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,308
What’s your problem?

758
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:42,079
You're the one
who wanted to join our group.

759
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:46,250
You’re getting full of yourself.

760
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,718
Getting full of yourself.

761
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,821
Just the fact you’d say that

762
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,957
proves you never treated her as an equal.

763
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:55,726
Don't you get it?

764
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,796
Naito wanted to be your friend.

765
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,498
She wanted to be your equal!

766
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:04,502
She was hurting the whole time
but let you tease her anyway.

767
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,772
But you never changed.

768
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,174
Not once did you treat her as an equal.

769
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,010
Of course, she ended up hating it.

770
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:16,914
You’re the one who’s full of yourself!

771
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,916
If she didn’t like it,
why didn’t she say so?

772
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:19,917
Right.

773
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,190
Maybe if she had, things could’ve changed.

774
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:28,726
But she couldn’t.

775
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,228
Why not?

776
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,933
Because it would ruin the vibe.

777
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,372
It's scary.

778
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,575
The vibe created
by someone with influence.

779
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,944
They have the power to control.

780
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:52,616
Break that vibe
and people say you ruined the mood.

781
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:56,053
Naito was overwhelmed.

782
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,456
If she said no, you’d hate her.

783
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,257
She’d lose her place in class.

784
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,725
As a result,

785
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:05,830
all she could do
was try to keep you happy.

786
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,367
What vibe? I really don't get it.

787
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,969
You know, right?

788
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,974
Yesterday, what you did to Naito
was accepted as teasing.

789
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,543
But just one day later,

790
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,279
it’s shifted into being perceived
as bullying.

791
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,650
And then you went
and made a complete fool of yourself.

792
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,225
But it’s not just you who looked pathetic.

793
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,329
You all laughed along yesterday

794
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:41,031
and then suddenly turned on her today.

795
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,302
Vibes can shift quickly,

796
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,672
turning anyone into a target.

797
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:53,511
As long as groups exist, so will bullying.

798
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,813
That will never change!

799
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,982
So what do we do?

800
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,685
People like me,
who don’t belong to any group…

801
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:06,190
have no choice but to speak out
and shatter the vibe.

802
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,663
Let me say this…

803
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:18,135
as someone
who lives a bit longer than you.

804
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,742
Don’t throw around
the word "teasing" so lightly.

805
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:31,282
Plenty of adults still act like this
without ever realizing what they’re doing.

806
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,285
But people like that eventually lose…

807
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,722
something important.

808
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,204
That was a brilliant speech.
Truly brilliant.

809
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,539
Well…

810
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,409
It sounded a bit extreme to me.

811
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,644
-I did feel your love for the students.
-No.

812
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,880
I don't have love for the students.

813
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,649
I was just pissed off.

814
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:10,321
I just really wanted them to feel
genuinely ashamed of themselves.

815
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,826
SPEECH SCRIPT

816
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,829
What's this script?

817
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,232
<i>I worked hard on it</i>
<i>before going to the classroom.</i>

818
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,133
IF THEY ACCEPT IT OR NOT?

819
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,839
<i>It’s true that Naito used to</i>

820
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,542
enjoy being teased by them.

821
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,112
You must be godlike to remember
such a long script.

822
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,449
I read this while giving the speech.

823
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:49,760
Sensei.

824
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,197
Yes?

825
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,099
Thank you very much.

826
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:05,042
From this, can we become real friends?

827
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,714
Not like this, I don’t think.

828
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,687
Real friends are people
you can speak to as equals.

829
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,092
If you keep tiptoeing around them,

830
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,795
I don't think that’s possible.

831
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:28,966
And maybe that’s okay.

832
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:31,802
Aren’t friendships…

833
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,772
supposed to happen naturally?

834
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:46,450
Goodbye.

835
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,921
Sensei, are you SEE?

836
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,965
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION

837
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,300
‪Let’s keep our relationship‬

838
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,601
‪-strictly professional.‬
‪-Hey.‬

839
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:06,970
<i>&lrm;Don't come this way!</i>
