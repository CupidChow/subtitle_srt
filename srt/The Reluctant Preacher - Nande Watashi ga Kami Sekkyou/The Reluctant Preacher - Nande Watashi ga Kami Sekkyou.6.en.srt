1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:08,641
This appears to be a photo of them
smoking inside a karaoke box.

2
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,111
They all admitted to smoking.

3
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:16,249
The six on the expulsion list
showed no remorse.

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:20,320
The five not listed did show remorse.

5
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,091
This way, only the students on the list
will be expelled.

6
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,093
I want you to expose Moriguchi's plot

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,029
to the PTA board tomorrow.

8
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,899
Anyway, I have no motivation for this job!

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,434
Just once!

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,603
Try confronting it, with all your heart.

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,140
To rebuild the school's reputation,

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,842
they want to expel students
from "problematic" families.

13
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,012
We already know.

14
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,782
All on the PTA board

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,851
support the school's plan.

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,720
Why?

17
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,191
I'm glad we have your approval,
President Kobayakawa.

18
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,393
As long as you have
the president's cooperation,

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,295
I can…

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,299
confidently hand over…

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,902
the chairmanship.

22
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,439
When I was a student here,

23
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:17,310
Meishin was a school everyone admired.

24
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:21,414
I will restore the prestige
of Meishin's elite brand.

25
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,050
Therefore…

26
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:27,654
I ask for your continued support,
President Kobayakawa.

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,628
Wow…

28
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,599
For someone as unmotivated as you,
Hayashi-sensei, you did your best…

29
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,701
Was it Urumi-sensei's influence?

30
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,905
Why don't you take a break?

31
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,942
We'll handle the rest from here.

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,049
Now…

33
00:01:56,116 --> 00:02:01,154
regarding the future of the 11 students
suspected of smoking,

34
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,224
-Shinjo will explain.
-Yes.

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,393
You guys are so loud!

36
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,663
Huh? What…

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,532
Sorry! Sorry…

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,468
Don't get so worked up.

39
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,604
We might get expelled…

40
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,472
That's because you lied about not smoking.

41
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,080
Still, getting expelled
for smoking just once is harsh.

42
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,216
Mai's mom is talking to the school today.

43
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,088
-Yes.
-Let's trust Mai's mom, right?

44
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,596
Urumi-sensei.

45
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,532
The vice principal is back…

46
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:51,471
So you've already won over the PTA board?

47
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,672
Won over?

48
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,208
Please call it prior consultation.

49
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,645
Securing consensus
before a major decision.

50
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,514
That's essential in business.

51
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,119
There are some
who keep interfering with my plans…

52
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,688
This is risk management.

53
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,325
Can you stop using complicated loanwords?

54
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,359
I can't follow it!

55
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,295
They're not that difficult.

56
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,096
-They are!
-No, they're not.

57
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,865
-Principal…
-But people

58
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,434
who flaunt
their Katakana English like that

59
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,469
are usually the ones
who lack self-confidence

60
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:27,040
and want to look more important
than they are.

61
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,275
She has got a point.

62
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,710
TOTAL INTEGRITY

63
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,379
-Never heard that before.
-Right?

64
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,615
I just made it up.

65
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,318
From experience,

66
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,653
I've met a lot of people like that.

67
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,025
And you didn't do all this
because of "risk management", did you?

68
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,562
You just wanted to shut Urumi-sensei
and the rest of us down, right?

69
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,968
I think so too.

70
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,803
This whole plan…

71
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,106
Moriguchi-sensei deliberately leaked it
to Ms. Kyoko.

72
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,377
So we'd take action to stop it.

73
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,013
Then he could crush us

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,982
and cause maximum damage.

75
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,353
It was retaliation
for me foiling his plans.

76
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,923
What a jerk.

77
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,025
So annoying.

78
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,331
Does it matter what I think of you?

79
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,836
All I know is,

80
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,172
I don't lose to fools who act

81
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,174
without a plan.

82
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,946
Right, Vice Principal?

83
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,253
Out of the 11 photographed students,
six will be expelled.

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,390
The remaining five will stay.
The board has already decided.

85
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,760
The PTA board gave their approval too.

86
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,462
This can't be overturned.

87
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,936
So in the end,

88
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:08,241
nothing I did meant anything?

89
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,843
That's not true…

90
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,212
Though in this situation,
I can't say that.

91
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,547
That's not true!

92
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,748
Oh, he said it.

93
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,851
How can you say that
when things turned out like this?

94
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,123
He isn't logical at all.

95
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,260
How does she even date this guy?

96
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,963
But I guess it doesn't matter right now…

97
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,033
Whether or not it meant anything

98
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,269
depends on what you do from here.

99
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,811
Their expulsion hasn't been finalized yet.

100
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,145
-But…
-No buts.

101
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,148
"The biggest difference
between success and failure

102
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:52,885
is whether you give up."
Steve Jobs said so.

103
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,854
Shuzo Matsuoka said,

104
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,489
"Don't give up on not giving up."

105
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,792
Coach Anzai said,
"If you give up, the game is over."

106
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,195
All profound words,
said by profound people!

107
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,765
Who's Coach Anzai?

108
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,601
-From Slam Dunk-
-You can give up if you want.

109
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,537
But you've already been marked
as being on the principal's side.

110
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,139
If we do anything,

111
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,642
they'll assume you're involved,
even if you didn't do anything.

112
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,612
-You might as well help us.
-I got it!

113
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,147
I got it already.

114
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,184
I don't want to let it end like this.

115
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,920
I'm not giving up either, Principal!

116
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,858
It'd be frustrating
to walk away like this.

117
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:35,228
I don't lose to fools who act

118
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,330
without a plan.

119
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,166
Who are you calling a fool? That jerk…

120
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,969
So, what exactly should we do?

121
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,071
That's the problem…

122
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,141
If we act carelessly,

123
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,043
Moriguchi-sensei will strike again.

124
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,081
I'm already working on something,
so wait a little longer.

125
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,956
What?

126
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,793
-It's okay.
-Yes.

127
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,594
Here.

128
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,198
TOTAL INTEGRITY

129
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,468
We understand you were forced

130
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,771
to smoke by Matsumoto and Iwai.

131
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:22,675
But why did you lie and say
you didn't smoke?

132
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,111
Why?

133
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,651
You panicked and lied, didn't you?

134
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,221
It happens when you're young.

135
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,392
We've heard you are a very
honest and serious student.

136
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,296
She really is a good girl.

137
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,165
Do you truly understand

138
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,334
the gravity of what you did?

139
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,470
Mai?

140
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,741
Yes.

141
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,944
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,747
Do you truly understand
the gravity of what you did?

143
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,217
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,119
Do you truly understand
the gravity of what you did?

145
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,055
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,159
Three days of house suspension?
Not normal suspension?

147
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,228
I'm not really sure,
but I think it's different.

148
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,531
Suspension goes on your school record.

149
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,566
House suspension doesn't.

150
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,668
It's just considered an absence,

151
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,504
so it won't affect
university applications.

152
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,539
-So it's lighter than suspension?
-Yes.

153
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,141
Wow, you're really knowledgeable.

154
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,143
I got a house suspension

155
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,779
in junior high.

156
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,782
Still, I'm glad
it wasn't as bad as I thought.

157
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,485
-Right?
-I'm glad.

158
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,754
Voluntary withdrawal?

159
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,823
Yes.

160
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,592
Smoking alone is already a problem.

161
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,428
But Iroha also lied.

162
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,565
Lying…

163
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,667
just to save yourself

164
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,536
is a selfish mindset.

165
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,305
We can't expect

166
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,408
someone like that to repent and improve.

167
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,076
-How about…
-Sounds good!

168
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,645
-Well then…
-What should we do?

169
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,814
It's gotta be karaoke. We'll go there,

170
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,483
-get those large French fries…
-Yes!

171
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,092
Sensei…

172
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,898
Hina-chan and the others
only got a house suspension…

173
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,237
but I'm being told to quit the school.

174
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,511
Why did it end up like this?

175
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,252
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,556
Even if I apologize,
it won't make her feel better.

177
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,026
I don't think it's your fault.

178
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,265
First Miyazawa-kun, then Kaito-kun…

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,070
It just feels like something's
not right at this school.

180
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,506
If anything…

181
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:12,311
you seem like the only one
trying to protect us.

182
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,716
She really sees what's going on…

183
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,224
But still,

184
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,728
I don't want to be expelled.

185
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,633
I don't know what to do.

186
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,738
What did your parents say?

187
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,542
Don't embarrass me.

188
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:47,046
You were the one who smoked.
You brought this on yourself.

189
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,148
You're in your second year of high school.

190
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,084
You're not a child anymore.
Take responsibility.

191
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,456
They don't care about me.

192
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,459
Emotionally negligent parents…

193
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,861
NEGLIGENT PARENTS

194
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,362
WHAT ARE NEGLIGENT PARENTS?

195
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,263
CHARACTERISTICS OF NEGLIGENT PARENTS?

196
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,164
SHOW NO INTEREST IN THEIR UPBRINGING
FAILING TO GIVE LOVE

197
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,799
They provide basic needs,

198
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,036
but show no interest
in the child's upbringing

199
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,872
and fail to give the affection
their child deserves.

200
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:18,344
I don't want to quit school.

201
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,548
You're the only one I can rely on.

202
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,685
Please help me.

203
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,297
Sensei…

204
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:45,438
Please don't tell Hina-chan and the others
about my expulsion.

205
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,573
Why not?

206
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,676
Everyone's happy
they only got a house suspension.

207
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,946
If they find out I'm being expelled,

208
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,781
they'll feel bad.

209
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,318
Effects of emotionally negligent parents.

210
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:04,323
Fear of rejection
leads to excessive people-pleasing.

211
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,859
Okay.

212
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,061
I won't tell anyone.

213
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,467
Sensei.

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,836
Is it true Iroha is being expelled?

215
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,238
It got out immediately.

216
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,006
Why is she the only one getting expelled

217
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,842
when we only got a house suspension?

218
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,877
Even if you ask me…

219
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,047
I mean…

220
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,482
I don't really know…

221
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,283
How can you not know?

222
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,520
I don't really understand…

223
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,056
-Just answer me clearly!
-Stop it.

224
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:40,359
Yelling at her won't help!

225
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,695
-Are you on her side?
-It's not like

226
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,232
she wants Iroha expelled.

227
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,200
You saw how she was with me and Miyazawa.

228
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,672
Isn't this all your fault?

229
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,607
What?

230
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,476
Didn't you get Mai's mom to help you

231
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,845
and throw Iroha under the bus?

232
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,715
-Hey.
-What are you talking about?

233
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,583
You guys were bullying Iroha!

234
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,187
Then you got lectured by the teacher

235
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,523
and had to stop.
That pissed you off, right?

236
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,926
So you tried to get her
kicked out of school.

237
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,395
Like you should talk.
You stole my boyfriend.

238
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,798
Still going on about that? Gross.

239
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,134
-What?
-That's enough!

240
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,406
Hina-chan wouldn't do anything like that.

241
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,611
Then why are you only getting expelled?

242
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,852
What should I have done?

243
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,489
You told me not to act carelessly,

244
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,591
but if we don't do something fast,

245
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,761
Naito will be expelled.

246
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,065
The classroom atmosphere
is already terrible.

247
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,835
I honestly can't take it anymore.

248
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,239
How long are we supposed to wait?

249
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,209
At this rate,

250
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,679
we'll face more expulsion incidents.

251
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,682
And we won't be able to stop them all.

252
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,950
That's why we need

253
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,085
a fundamental solution.

254
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,753
What?

255
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,593
Moriguchi-sensei's plan

256
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,329
to expel 75 students.

257
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,397
I want to stop it.

258
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,267
He says

259
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,803
it's for reviving Meishin

260
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,007
and ensuring business stability.

261
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,410
But I think there's more to it.

262
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,747
Something darker…Something twisted.

263
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,316
If we can figure out the reason,

264
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,220
maybe we can convince him
to abandon the plan.

265
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,125
That's what I'm trying to uncover.

266
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,264
There's a new gym by the station.

267
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,299
Apparently,

268
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,002
you ride a bike to the music in the dark.

269
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,139
My waistline's been bothering me lately.

270
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,709
I was thinking of going there,
but what do you think?

271
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,245
Mom, can we talk about that later?

272
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,249
Sorry.

273
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,488
Right now, Meishin is practically
Moriguchi-sensei's one-man operation.

274
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,722
We have to stop him.

275
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,257
I know.

276
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,726
But if we take our time,

277
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,930
Naito and the others will end up expelled.

278
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,500
Right.

279
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,535
Why don't you come with me?

280
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,204
It might help you relieve some stress.

281
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,173
Mom, we haven't finished talking…

282
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,107
Oh…

283
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,143
sorry.

284
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,045
I'm really sorry.

285
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,479
Maybe you should go.

286
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,814
Yes.

287
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,490
KOBAYAKAWA

288
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,127
What's wrong? It's late.

289
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,366
Hina-chan, it's been a while.

290
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,068
Excuse me!

291
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,272
I came to ask you a favor!

292
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,740
A favor? From me?

293
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,510
Could you please ask the school
to cancel Iroha's expulsion?

294
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,346
Please!

295
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,151
Mom… I agree with her.

296
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,190
All right.

297
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,225
It's okay.

298
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,130
You want Naito's expulsion
to be cancelled?

299
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,000
My daughter asked me to.

300
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,001
Are you going to say no?

301
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,805
If we overturn a decision,
it'll undermine our authority--

302
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:51,143
I've done… a lot for Meishin.

303
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,245
You'll do it, right?

304
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,855
Can you… let me handle things for now?

305
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,626
Starting today,

306
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,429
five second-year students
will serve a house suspension.

307
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,265
The six students
recommended for withdrawal

308
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,503
will remain on home standby
until the expulsions are finalized.

309
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,104
We'll contact their guardians

310
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:23,242
and check on the students' well-being.

311
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,479
Please do not interfere
and focus on your normal duties.

312
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,428
INTERCOM - END

313
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,566
It seems Watanuki
asked Kobayakawa's mother

314
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,036
to request that your expulsion
be cancelled.

315
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,572
Hina-chan did it?

316
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,341
What a beautiful friendship.

317
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,516
Your parents have left the matter
entirely up to you.

318
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:07,986
However…

319
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,191
the school cannot overturn its decision.

320
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,727
Don't get the wrong idea.

321
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:20,599
Under normal circumstances,
all 11 students could've been expelled.

322
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:25,304
But the school
doesn't want to abandon its students.

323
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,974
We made a special exception
to help those who show remorse

324
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,678
and want to make amends.

325
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,884
We were very careful
in choosing who to expel.

326
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,820
We looked at more than just this incident.

327
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:47,025
We looked at your usual behavior,
grades, and family situation.

328
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,995
If you're not satisfied,

329
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,566
we'll just have to expel all 11 of you.

330
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,574
So…

331
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,043
will you accept the expulsion?

332
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:11,817
Yes.

333
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,619
I see.

334
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,725
One more thing,

335
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,495
Watanuki and the others
are thoughtful friends.

336
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,998
But they'll only worry about you more.

337
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,535
So if you really care about them,

338
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:33,906
please stop contacting them.

339
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,083
Life forms that exist on Earth

340
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:49,121
have various types and forms
and natural variations

341
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,189
in the ecosystem…

342
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,257
I don't want to quit school.

343
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,026
Please help me.

344
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,830
I'm already working on something,
so wait a little longer.

345
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,638
During your house suspension,
she can't go out or use her phone.

346
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,940
Has she been doing so?

347
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,977
It's fine.

348
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,346
I've been managing her phone.

349
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,548
I see.

350
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,319
What happened to Iroha's expulsion?

351
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,089
Unfortunately…

352
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,792
She wishes to withdraw.

353
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,728
Iroha? Why?

354
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,598
Apparently, she didn't like school.

355
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,733
-She didn't like it?
-Yes.

356
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,102
She was fed up with the people around her.

357
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,140
Surely, you have some idea?

358
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,446
There were incidents
with Iroha, weren't there?

359
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:57,422
Moriguchi-sensei isn't at school today.
What do you think he's doing?

360
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:01,293
It feels shady…
Bet he's up to something again.

361
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,028
Huh? Look over there.

362
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,305
Oguchi-sensei.

363
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,311
Moriguchi-sensei wasn't in today.
Do you know what's going on?

364
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,114
What exactly are Moriguchi-sensei
and the vice principal planning?

365
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,651
I honestly don't know.

366
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,055
I'm no longer involved with them.

367
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,891
If you don't like it, that's fine.

368
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,559
If you hate it that much,

369
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,828
then just leave me alone.

370
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,031
I think…

371
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,301
I was abandoned.

372
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,007
Why did this happen?

373
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,317
Sorry to call you out so suddenly,
Chairman.

374
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,520
You're here to talk

375
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,322
about Kai, right?

376
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,726
The plan to expel 75 students.

377
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,829
Are you really okay with that?

378
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,334
Did something happen to him

379
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,270
during his student years?

380
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,441
What exactly do you know?

381
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,342
Nothing concrete.

382
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:29,748
As an educator and as a person,

383
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,317
he seems messed up.

384
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,318
So…

385
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,355
I wondered
if something happened in his past.

386
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,330
What about the request
to cancel Naito's expulsion?

387
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,798
Was that resolved?

388
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,971
It's fine. Nothing has changed.

389
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:57,876
Naito and the other five
will still be expelled.

390
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,178
I'm surprised there wasn't any pushback.

391
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,317
The world is full of unfairness,

392
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,521
but how many people actually
stand up to it?

393
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,858
Yes…

394
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,026
Especially in Japan,

395
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,696
people rarely act on their own.

396
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,199
They won't stand up

397
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:25,203
unless they form a group
and share their thoughts with others.

398
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,840
There are many like that.

399
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,345
If you want to

400
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,614
control people unfairly,

401
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,450
just isolate them.

402
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,493
There were incidents
with Iroha, weren't there?

403
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,096
Hina-chan wouldn't do that.

404
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,643
-Should I warm it up?
-No, it's okay.

405
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,647
Aren't these flowers beautiful?

406
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,982
Dad likes these flowers.

407
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,222
HANDKERCHIEF

00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,836
HINA - I WANT TO TALK

409
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,948
I WILL QUIT SCHOOL.
PLEASE DON'T CONTACT ME.

410
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:52,190
The students have been on edge,

411
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,559
and Ms. Kyoko hasn't contacted me either.

412
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,428
I'm just so drained.

413
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,529
Thank you very much.

414
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,997
I need to let off some steam.

415
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,433
Free trial lesson now.
Thank you very much!

416
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,069
Free trial lesson now.
Thank you very much!

417
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,439
Yes! Move your body!

418
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,775
Touch the handles! Let's go!

419
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,518
Touch the handles!

420
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,219
Move your body!

421
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,255
You can do it!

422
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,591
Push up!

423
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,529
Push up!

424
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,865
Nice riding!

425
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,303
Did you get a good workout?

426
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,307
That actually helped me forget
about things for a bit…

427
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,244
Yes!

428
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,189
Why are you here?

429
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,691
Why not?

430
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,027
I was thirsty too.

431
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,995
And we're coworkers, after all.

432
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,131
What's wrong with a drink together?

433
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,167
Are you seriously calling us "coworkers"?

434
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,237
I just wanted

435
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:16,041
a chance to talk with you properly.

436
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:18,343
You've got to be kidding me.

437
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,713
Wanting a chat with me, in this situation?

438
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,948
What is his deal?

439
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:27,652
He's smiling! Gross…

440
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,088
You're 28, right?

441
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,691
Still going to coffee shops
alone after work.

442
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,727
Maybe it's time you got a boyfriend?

443
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,697
Wow, such insensitive teasing…

444
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,166
There are still guys like him, huh?

445
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,902
Also, how does he even know I'm single?

446
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:47,005
I looked into you a little.

447
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,276
I like investigating people.

448
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,310
Creepy.

449
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,780
Did you just think, "That's creepy"?

450
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,519
You're the one
who keeps interfering with my plans.

451
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,788
You're my enemy.

452
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,857
And it's only natural

453
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,659
to research your enemies.

454
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,033
"Shizuka Urumi is a murderer."

455
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,335
That flyer's still on my mind.

456
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,236
SHIZUKA URUMI IS A MURDERER.

457
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,077
You were a NEET for two years.

458
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,381
Is that related somehow?

459
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,054
Before you start worrying
about your students, maybe…

460
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,592
you should worry about yourself.

461
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,369
SEE?

462
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,305
Yes, SEE. Shizuka's "Shi," spelled S-E-E.

463
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,708
So you write and post stuff?

464
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,209
That's impressive, Shi-chan.

465
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,778
It's nothing.

466
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,680
I just write about my feelings,
day to day.

467
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,114
She even got so into it,

468
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,651
she made some SEE official stickers.

469
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,120
Well, recently I've been getting

470
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,122
more fans and messages from readers.

473
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,433
I want to discuss something with SEE.

474
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,570
Is something wrong?

475
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,307
Please help me.

476
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,445
I'm being bullied by my classmates.

477
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,948
I'M BEING BULLIED BY MY CLASSMATES.

478
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,685
TALK TO YOUR FAMILY.

479
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,720
You are being bullied?

480
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:44,089
You should talk to your family.

481
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,631
I can't.

482
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:57,268
The only family I have is an older sister
who's much older than me.

483
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,673
My sister is happy with her work.

484
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,375
I don't want to bother her.

485
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,945
I see.

486
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,081
But I don't think you should try
to deal with everything on your own.

487
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:16,154
I'm sick of everything.

488
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,191
But I know I shouldn't run away, right?

489
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:25,330
That's not true.

490
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,366
If it's too painful,
it's okay to run away.

491
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,902
It's your life.

492
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:33,104
You should live your life
the way you want.

493
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,440
IT'S OKAY TO RUN AWAY.
LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANT.

494
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:50,822
Thank you.

495
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,391
It's okay to run away.

496
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,494
You have saved me.

497
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,529
THANK YOU…GOODBYE.

498
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,730

SUZUKI FAMILY FUNERAL

504
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,152
Did something happen?

505
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,605
Watanuki?

506
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,775
Aren't you still on a house suspension?

507
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,143
Why are you here?

508
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,183
You once said

509
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,053
I was bullying Iroha, right?

510
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:33,725
But I actually thought of her as a friend.

511
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,230
It was true I was just teasing her

512
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,003
and then things escalated.

513
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,873
I realize what I did.

514
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,647
Especially after your lecture.

515
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,752
Since then, things have been strange
between Iroha and I.

516
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:02,887
But…

517
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,958
we were about to be friends again.

518
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:08,359
I was…

519
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,296
so happy.

520
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,699
But Iroha…

521
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,201
She was fed up with the people around her.

522
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,038
Surely,

523
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,607
you have some idea?

524
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,544
So she still hates me.

525
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,251
I'm sorry.

526
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,820
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

527
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,526
It's okay.

528
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,964
I want to… properly apologize.

529
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:50,435
But Iroha rejected me.
I don't know what to do.

530
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,074
Sensei…

531
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,876
Please help me.

532
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,587
Urumi-sensei isn't here.

533
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,857
Did anyone hear from her?

534
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,226
No. She didn't contact at all.

535
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,894
What is she doing?

536
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,397
A teacher, absent without notice?

537
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,980
Tell me.

538
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,549
What did Moriguchi-sensei say?

539
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:42,820
Urumi-sensei is making
the principal teach her class.

540
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,288
Where is she? What's she doing?

541
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,256
I don't know.

542
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,760
But knowing her, she's
probably doing something for her students.

00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:58,703
-Hello?
-Ms. Kyoko.

545
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,639
I'm sorry for skipping school
without permission.

546
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:03,875
What are you up to?

547
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,445
I'll explain later.

548
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,316
But right now,
there's something I need you to do.

549
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:14,619
Got it.

550
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,261
Who were you on the phone with, Principal?

551
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,565
Do I need to tell you?

552
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,933
Was it Urumi-sensei?

553
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:35,072
Whatever she's planning, tell her this.

554
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,810
Don't do anything reckless.

555
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,154
Oh, right.

556
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,590
She asked me something.

557
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,593
She actually had a message for you.

558
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,631
"I'm not going to let things go your way,
dumbass."

559
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,734
That's her message.

560
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,542
What are you doing?

561
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,514
Right now, I'm fired up.

562
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,950
Honestly, I want to protect these girls,
but…

563
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:22,587
I'm also mad at that guy.
That emotion's even stronger.

564
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,290
Maybe that makes me
a failure as a teacher.

565
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,191
It doesn't matter!

566
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,428
I'm going to shut him down!

567
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:35,032
KOBAYAKAWA

568
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:41,772
Sorry, Ms. Kobayakawa.

569
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,008
We dropped by unannounced.

570
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:46,110
Why are you here?

571
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,779
We need to see your mom.

572
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,983
And ask her to request the school
to cancel Iroha's expulsion!

573
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,655
You should go home for today.

574
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,824
-Why?
-Mai?

575
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,995
Oh… do we have guests?

576
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,098
And you are?

577
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,467
I'm Shizuka Urumi, Mai's homeroom teacher.

578
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,536
Her teacher?

579
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,438
I knew you'd show up.

580
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,350
"I'm not going to let things go your way."

581
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,520
You sent that childish message.

582
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,792
You didn't think I'd be here, did you?

583
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,397
I figured you'd show up.

584
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:43,301
You, with your clingy personality,

585
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,337
are the type who always interferes.

586
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:49,073
So I sent that message on purpose.

587
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,343
Still acting tough, huh?

588
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,145
I'm not acting.

589
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,215
Even if I convinced Mai's mom,

590
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,284
you'd just scheme behind the scenes again.

591
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,155
That's why I decided
to take one you two altogether.

592
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:08,826
SCRIPT

593
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,196
Moriguchi-sensei,

594
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,865
in this incident,

595
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,736
students who committed the same offense
were treated differently.

596
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,872
Some were expelled, others suspended.

597
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,941
Can you give a clear explanation?

598
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:29,313
.It was based on
whether they showed remorse,

599
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:33,150
as well as an overall assessment
of their daily conduct.

600
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,952
And what's your standard

601
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,588
for judging whether someone's remorseful?

602
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,825
And what exactly do you mean
by "daily conduct"?

603
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,960
I don't find your explanation
convincing at all.

604
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,962
Also you…

605
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,032
You panicked and lied, didn't you?

606
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,969
It happens when you're young.

607
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,971
Lying…

608
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,408
just to save yourself
is a selfish mindset.

609
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,179
We can't expect
someone like that to repent and improve.

610
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,316
You change your definition of "a lie"
for each student.

611
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,686
How you respond differs
based on who the student is.

612
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:12,623
That's the worst thing a teacher can do.

613
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,427
Ms. Kobayakawa,

614
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,431
as PTA President, what do you think?

615
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,201
Or did you already know,

616
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:27,038
but decided it didn't matter
as long as your daughter was safe?

617
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:29,707
You didn't come to that conclusion,
did you?

618
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,942
Mom… Is that true?

619
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,445
Of course not!

620
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,382
That's a relief.

621
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,987
As the PTA President,

622
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,690
there's no way someone like you
would play favorites, right?

623
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,263
Now then,

624
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,801
why would Moriguchi-sensei
do such a thing?

625
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,939
That doesn't matter right now.

626
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,043
What's important today

627
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,112
is getting the school to cancel

628
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,581
its recommendation for Naito

629
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,820
and the other five students to quit.

630
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,590
Let me be blunt.

631
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,294
If this goes to court,
the school will almost certainly lose.

632
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:29,367
They all did the same thing,
yet the punishments vary.

633
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,668
Any judge would rule that

634
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:35,673
the recommendation for them to quit
lacks legitimacy and is illegal.

635
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,844
You never should've
recommended expulsion in the first--

636
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,791
Sorry to say,

637
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,427
but the school's decision
won't be overturned.

638
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,831
If you want to file a lawsuit, go ahead.

639
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,467
But where will you get the money
to hire a lawyer?

640
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,903
Do you know how long a lawsuit takes?

641
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,608
It's expensive and a hassle.

642
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,310
It would be better to

643
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,313
just transfer their kid to a new school.

644
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,983
There are many parents like that.

645
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,619
Right…

646
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,888
Naito?

647
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,693
I see.

648
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,732
If Naito won't act herself,

649
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,635
then there's nothing we can do.

650
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,875
Then why don't you quit along with Naito?

651
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,011
What are you saying?

652
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,681
Your friend's getting expelled.
But you aren't. Does that make it okay?

653
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,050
Are you really fine with that?

654
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,522
You broke the rules by smoking.

655
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,425
You must reflect on that, of course.

656
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:06,163
But can you really say you've made amends
if you abandon your friend?

657
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:10,234
Even if guilt fades with time,

658
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,737
the fact you betrayed someone
will stay with you forever.

659
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,407
It will come back to you.

660
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,876
-So--
-Enough already!

661
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,178
-How long are you going to--
-I'll…

662
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,581
I'll quit, too!

663
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,553
It's not right
that only Iroha gets expelled

664
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,223
while the rest of us are spared.

665
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:39,063
If Iroha and Hina are leaving,
then so am I.

666
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,531
Mai, what are you saying?

667
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:42,533
I would never allow that!

668
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,504
You… only cared about me!

669
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,372
Do you want me to be such a coward?

670
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,608
No…

671
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,645
Ms. Kobayakawa,

672
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,117
If this continues,
everyone will end up expelled.

673
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,794
Moriguchi-sensei,

674
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:15,966
I think

675
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:20,004
expelling six students
over this is a bit too much.

676
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,840
Please, could you give everyone

677
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,943
the same disciplinary suspension instead?

678
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:34,084
As PTA President, I'm asking you a favor.

679
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,253
You understand, don't you?

680
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:49,366
Dammit!

681
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:53,103
Dammit!

682
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,074
Thanks.

683
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,913
When you said
you'd quit with me, honestly,

684
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,014
I was really happy.

685
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,749
I wanted to say,

686
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,085
"Of course I would," but…

687
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,387
the truth is, Shizuka-sensei told me
to do it.

688
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:12,256
What?

689
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:18,495
When I ask "Why don't you
quit with Naito," go along with it.

690
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,533
I just passed that message

691
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,134
along to Mai.

692
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,906
But I'm really glad we did it.

693
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:32,710
I'm glad.

694
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,917
Okay, let's head back.

695
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:42,753
Sensei.

696
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:44,855
Thank you.

697
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:46,657
Thank you.

698
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,560
No need to thank me.

699
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,528
Just carry out your suspension properly.

700
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:58,769
Are you crying?

701
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,739
-You're crying!
-I'm not!

702
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:04,675
SHIZUKA URUMI IS A MURDERER.

703
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,812
The one who posted this

704
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,116
was Aika-sensei, right?

705
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:17,755
Yes.

706
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:21,659
She doesn't remember.

707
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,728
Even after meeting me.

708
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,349
You murdered my little sister.

709
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,855
Can you all knock it off already?

710
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,323
A HOSTAGE SITUATION
AT A SCHOOL ON SUNDAY?

711
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,525
Coward!
