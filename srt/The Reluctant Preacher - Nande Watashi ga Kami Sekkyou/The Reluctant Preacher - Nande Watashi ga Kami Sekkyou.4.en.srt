1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,707
We will expel these 75 students

2
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,876
by the end of this school year.

3
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,045
If you stay here, you can chase your goal.

4
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,848
So don't easily say you'll quit!

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,349
Please!

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:18,985
Let Miyazawa stay in school!

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,286
Enough is enough!

8
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,521
No matter what's said,

9
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,391
Miyazawa is expelled.

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,095
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

11
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,133
<i>I act all high and mighty, preaching…</i>

12
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,367
I'm going to quit school.

13
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,805
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,441
<i>Yet I cry when things go wrong.</i>

15
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,176
<i>What a lame adult I am.</i>

16
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,110
Hey!

17
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,447
-Come on!
<i>-I know how the students will see me.</i>

18
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,549
Oh, no! She's here!

19
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,151
-She came!
-Oh, no!

20
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,585
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

21
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:55,455
-You guys go!
<i>-Still, isn't that a bit much?</i>

22
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,424
Hey, hey! Shizuka-sensei!

23
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,324
-Morning.
-Come here!

24
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,527
Wait, I haven't changed my shoes yet.

25
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,395
-It's fine. This is serious.
-What?

26
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,364
-Oh, no!
-Let's go!

27
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,766
Run!

28
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,568
Hey, go to class!

29
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,771
-Hey! Move it, quickly!
<i>-Reality…</i>

30
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,174
<i>often surpasses the imagination.</i>

31
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,043
Go back to class! Don't take pictures!

32
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,977
SHIZUKA URUMI A MURDERER

33
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,779
Whoa, what is this?

34
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,651
Step back.

35
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,486
Get to your seats.

36
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,557
Hey, put your phones away.

37
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,194
Why are you silent, Urumi-sensei?

38
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,832
If you know something about this poster,
please explain.

39
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:43,103
The other teachers are confused too.

40
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:45,705
Stop being silent. Say something.

41
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,774
What's the point?

42
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:51,444
No way Shizuka-sensei
would ever kill anyone.

43
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,246
She would never do that.

44
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,715
Even if she did,

45
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,851
it's not like she'd confess.

46
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,354
You think the real culprit
would confess just like that?

47
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,123
There's no point in asking.

48
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,858
Right, Shizuka-sensei?

49
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,259
You're not helping her.

50
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,395
That poster was just some prank

51
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,466
to harass her.

52
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,569
We should focus on finding out who did it.

53
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,571
We're investigating it now.

54
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,275
But the culprit

55
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,979
<i>avoided the cameras,</i>

56
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,848
<i>they pasted the posters in</i>
<i>the camera blind spots.</i>

57
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,617
<i>There's no footage of them at all.</i>

58
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:32,318
That means…

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,455
It might've been someone among us

60
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,324
who knew the camera layout.

61
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,127
Could it be?

62
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,598
You're saying the culprit
is among us teachers?

63
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,133
I said maybe.

64
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,503
We'll find out later.

65
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,672
What we should be focusing on now

66
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,475
is how to handle the parents.

67
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,711
If this blows up and causes panic…

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,848
Urumi-sensei,

69
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:06,352
I expect you to handle this appropriately.

70
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,092
<i>How do I do this "appropriately"?</i>

71
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,428
<i>All this happening at once, and today,</i>

72
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,332
<i>Ms. Kyoko is away on a business trip.</i>

73
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,434
<i>What should I do?</i>

74
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,304
This "murderer" thing is crazy.

75
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,173
She always acts so haughty, too.

76
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,209
It's just a prank, obviously.

77
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,712
-By who?
-I don't know.

78
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,715
-But she isn't like that…
-What do you know?

79
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,426
<i>They want to ask if that poster's true,</i>
<i>but they can't…</i>

80
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,396
<i>I can really feel it…</i>

81
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,699
<i>Of course it's hard to ask.</i>

82
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,234
Sensei, are you a murderer?

83
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,403
<i>Such a direct question.</i>

84
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,672
I mean, everyone's curious, right?

85
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,642
-Actually, me too.
-Me too.

86
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,777
-Right?
<i>-Once the tension breaks,</i>

87
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,580
<i>curiosity takes over.</i>

88
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,017
I'm sorry…

89
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,786
for upsetting everyone.

90
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,057
-I…
-Sensei.

91
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,593
This thing is going viral.
Will you be okay?

92
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,560
SHIZUKA URUMI IS A MURDERER

93
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,065
Tazawa uploaded it online.

94
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,372
-Nanami?
-Delete it.

95
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,708
You uploaded it right?

96
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,177
-Delete it.
-Why are you…

97
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,748
Why are you defending her?
You like her, don't you?

98
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,151
<i>Nanami... likes me?</i>

99
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,719
What are you, a kid?

100
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,288
Pathetic.

101
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,023
<i>Right?</i>

102
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,692
<i>But for a second, I was flustered, too.</i>
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

103
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,460
What do you mean, a kid?

104
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,896
<i>This isn't the time</i>
<i>to be thinking about that.</i>

105
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,399
Why do I have to do what you say?

106
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,933
Shut up and delete it.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,735
You shut up. It's too late now anyway.

108
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,470
-I said delete it!
-What?

109
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:05,705
Quit it!

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,274
Back to your seats.

111
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,950
Urumi-sensei.

112
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,188
A parent from Class 2-10
just contacted us.

113
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,857
They said they want to speak
to you directly.

114
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,195
<i>Oh, no!</i>

115
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,634
Sorry I'm late!

116
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,802
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,403
-Let's go.
-We're going now.

118
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,705
-Let's go.
-Let's go in.

119
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,307
-Leave it to me.
-Geez!

120
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,275
‪I can't get over it.‬

121
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,181
<i>What am I even supposed to say?</i>

122
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,417
<i>I can't lie either.</i>

123
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,518
SHIZUKA URUMI IS A MURDERER

124
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,453
Urumi-sensei.

125
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:54,921
What is it?

126
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,124
What are you going to tell the parents?

127
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,259
Well…

128
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,228
It seems like you don't know what to say.

129
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,630
<i>That's correct.</i>

130
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:09,001
Then just follow my instructions
and say exactly what I tell you to.

131
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,038
Take a video.

132
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,275
We are deeply sorry for this incident.

133
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:22,348
Before explaining anything,
apologize sincerely first.

134
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,017
If you start with an apology,
it'll catch them off guard.

135
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,753
They can't respond with anger.

136
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,820
Right now…

137
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,290
everyone's understandably upset,

138
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,960
and I truly regret causing such concern.

139
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,695
The content of the apology matters.

140
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,163
But,

141
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,099
don't admit the school
is entirely at fault.

142
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,935
Make it clear the school is also a victim,

143
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,706
and show solidarity
by taking sides with the parents.

144
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,975
I'll take whatever criticism comes my way.

145
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,143
But still…

146
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,380
I'm just as outraged that
our students were shaken by this.

147
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,315
No…

148
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,985
I'm more outraged than that.

149
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,988
In fact, expressing more anger
than the parents can be effective.

150
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:03,990
Then…

151
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:05,725
could you

152
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,461
explain why this says,

153
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,497
"Urumi Shizuka-sensei is a murderer"?

154
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,499
Is there any truth to that?

155
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,702
-There is…
-Of course,

156
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,539
No way would we accept the poster as true.

157
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,308
Of course not. It's nonsense.

158
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,243
If the culprit turns out to be a student,

159
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,280
the school will have to suggest
punishing them.

160
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,614
As a school,

161
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:32,718
we will take appropriate action.

162
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,086
Those parents don't want

163
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:37,123
to cause a fuss and get a student
punished. It's just bad taste.

164
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,025
So that might make them

165
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,361
back off a bit.

166
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,966
So for the students' sake,

167
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,502
it's best we don't be too eager
to find the culprit.

168
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,839
I think we should
proceed cautiously for now.

169
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:56,542
How does that sound?

170
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,579
Well…

171
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,816
-Yes, that makes sense.
-Thank you.

172
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,156
It's frustrating.

173
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,891
Huh? What is?

174
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:16,729
When I followed Moriguchi-sensei's advice,
everything went smoothly.

175
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,933
-Isn't that a good thing?
-No, it's not.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,803
We just covered it up
with vague, empty words.

177
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,839
"Proceed with caution"
is the same as doing nothing.

178
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,877
Even if you're right,
no need to get so frustrated.

179
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,914
It just bothers me that
everything went his way.

180
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:40,253
If they say it like…

181
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,687
Come here, hurry!

182
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:46,659
Right…

183
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,694
What's wrong, Mrs. Tazawa?

184
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,132
I just saw my son…

185
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,740
Taichi!

186
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,210
What? What happened?

187
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,611
What are you doing?

188
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,850
Blo-…Blood! You're bleeding!

189
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,520
-What was it?
-Sorry!

190
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,489
It's bad. Kaito…

191
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,266
INCOMING CALL - MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

192
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,902
Yes, this is Nanami.

193
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,573
Tazawa…

194
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,643
Did Nanami really hit you?

195
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,179
What?

196
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,315
Are you saying you don't believe him?

197
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,150
It's not that I don't believe him.

198
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,719
When did I ever hit you?

199
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,187
You did hit me!

200
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,357
-Don't make stuff up!
-Nanami…

201
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,925
Mind what you say, okay?

202
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,433
-Their versions of the story don't match.
-Yes.

203
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,337
-Tazawa "criticized" Nanami's attitude.
-You.

204
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,838
You're looking down on me, right?

205
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,540
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,344
You always look at me
like I'm beneath you!

207
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:13,913
Shut up!

208
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,482
Tazawa says

209
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,218
he was attacked, unprovoked.

210
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,221
-Nanami said…
-Stop lying!

211
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,122
KAITO NANAMI

212
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,992
You always look at me
like I'm beneath you!

213
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,027
Say something!

214
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,962
Hey!

215
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,333
Pathetic.

216
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,837
He says he just left
without doing anything.

217
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,342
This is a problem…

218
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,879
By the way, Urumi-sensei,

219
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,449
Have you contacted Nanami's mother?

220
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,585
Yes.

221
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,686
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,289
Kaito has caused trouble.

223
00:10:57,356 --> 00:11:00,426
We haven't determined
Kaito is at fault yet.

224
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,494
But…

225
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:04,797
I believe

226
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,533
he did resort to violence.

227
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:10,936
Um…

228
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,573
She said she couldn't come today
due to work.

229
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,378
Isn't that a bit irresponsible?
Right, Vice-Principal?

230
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,481
Work…

231
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,854
So, what happened?

232
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,425
The conversation went nowhere,

233
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,160
so we agreed to talk again tomorrow.

234
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,364
Are you okay?

235
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,934
If I look okay to you, you need glasses.

236
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:44,704
First the posters, now this.

237
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,972
Today's just been nonstop problems.

238
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,675
So many problems,
I feel like I'm going to puke.

239
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,244
If you're stressed,
you should go to the ocean.

240
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,313
The ocean?

241
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,250
Looking at the sea helps
you forget bad things, right?

242
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,786
This time of year,
the Kamakura coast is great.

243
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,557
That place helps you forget everything.

244
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,326
Just looking at the ocean
makes it all go away.

245
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,796
I wish I were such a simple creature.

246
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,366
So, Tazawa and Nanami…

247
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,002
who do you believe is telling the truth?

248
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,240
Nanami hit Tazawa.

249
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,842
Isn't that fine?

250
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,778
You can't just decide that so easily.

251
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,714
Nanami had used violence

252
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,282
back in middle school.

253
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,854
Still, you shouldn't…

254
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,690
Japan's recidivism rate

255
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,992
is around 50%.

256
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,994
People who do bad things

257
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,396
end up doing it again.

258
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,104
Also, don't forget.

259
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,707
He's on this list.

260
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,877
He's a student this school
has no need for.

261
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,679
That makes this situation

262
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,482
our chance to expel him.

263
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,952
-Yes.
-However…

264
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,988
But Nanami didn't admit to hitting Tazawa.

265
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,291
Even so,

266
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,927
it's still possible to expel him.

267
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,333
Vice-Principal, are you really fine with
just obeying Moriguchi-sensei?

268
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,906
He's the next board chairman anyway.

269
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,075
Of course we obey him.

270
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,645
You're a cold person.

271
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,215
But when we're alone, you're so sweet.

272
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:40,853
Lately,

273
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,190
we haven't gone for a meal at all.

274
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,193
We…

275
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,196
shouldn't meet too often.

276
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,833
But you still do it anyway.

277
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,706
Bad people just repeat

278
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,210
the same mistakes in the end.

279
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:07,746
You're terrible.

280
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,815
This place,

281
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,618
is in sight of a security camera.

282
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,153
What?

283
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,524
Wow, your shirt is dirty!

284
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,060
NUMBER 8 STAIRS

285
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,028
Did you know?

286
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,332
Kaito beat up
a classmate in middle school.

287
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,535
-Really messed that guy up.
-Really?

288
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,271
-Really?
-Kaito…

289
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,673
-Is that true?
-He was bleeding…

290
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,042
-Isn't that scary?
-Scary.

291
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,711
-His face…
-Poor kid…

292
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,045
Scary stuff, huh.

293
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,488
Let's start today's homeroom session.

294
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,859
-Where's Nanami?
-Looks like he already left.

295
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,761
He went home?

296
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,664
Maybe he felt awkward
after hitting Tazawa?

297
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,334
What are you talking about?
He's the one lying.

298
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,204
But he has a record.

299
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,277
Nanami had a violent incident
in middle school.

300
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:12,845
It seems so.

301
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,483
Do you think Kaito-kun
really hit Tazawa-kun?

302
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:20,953
What do you think?

303
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:25,958
Kaito-kun is quiet and reserved.
You can't tell what he's thinking.

304
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,027
But before…

305
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,297
<i>When Hina-chan tried to spread your video…</i>

306
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,598
That wasn't funny.

307
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,001
I don't know much about his past,

308
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,105
But I don't think Kaito-kun would do
something like that.

309
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,913
-I didn't hit him.
-Don't lie.

310
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,317
Why don't you believe your own son?

311
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,620
You already did it before.

312
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,121
I just can't trust you.

313
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,624
I knew it.

314
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,261
You really are

315
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,496
just like your father.

316
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,668
Do whatever you want.

317
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,738
Just stop making me suffer.

318
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,880
<i>I'm tired…</i>

319
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,486
<i>All right, for now,</i>
<i>let's just not think about anything.</i>

320
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,788
<i>Ms. Kyoko is on a business trip.</i>

321
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:31,991
<i>I'll sleep for now.</i>

322
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,559
URUMI

323
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,862
Why are you here?

324
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,733
I came back.
Because I was worried about you.

325
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,369
You don't seem worried…

326
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,270
Want something to eat?

327
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,474
I'm good. I don't have an appetite anyway.

328
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,677
That prank was terrible, huh.

329
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,479
Posters all over the school…

330
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,883
But the part about me
being a murderer is true.

331
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,359
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL FELL FROM FOOTBRIDGE.
BULLYING TO BLAME?

332
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:10,929
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL FELL FROM FOOTBRIDGE.
BULLYING TO BLAME?

333
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,300
FUNERAL

334
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,611
FUNERAL

335
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,951
That wasn't all your fault.

336
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,421
Not "all," yes…

337
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,793
Maybe someone who knows
about that incident

338
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,395
-put up the posters?
-Shi-chan.

339
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,598
I get why you're panicking,

340
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,901
but don't overthink it now.

341
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,140
Sorry to say this
without considering how you must feel,

342
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,343
but I also heard about Nanami and Tazawa.

343
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,047
Moriguchi-sensei will probably try

344
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,317
to expel Nanami, regardless of the facts.

345
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,320
Like with Miyazawa.

346
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:14,993
If we want to protect the students
from Moriguchi-sensei's tyranny,

347
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,696
we need your help, Shi-chan.

348
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,299
You don't want
to see them in tears, right?

349
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,201
I…

350
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,369
really…

351
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,509
That's all I want to say.

352
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,378
I must get back to my business trip.

353
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,849
You came all the way here
just to say that?

354
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,753
Wait, you're leaving already?
I brought more food.

355
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,722
I'll eat it.

356
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,125
-I brought beer too.
-I'll have some.

357
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,759
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

358
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,838
Damn it…

359
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,354
Good morning.

360
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,688
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,562
-What's wrong, Nanami?
-Got a minute?

362
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,168
-What?
-Sensei…

363
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,838
could you come with me for a bit?

364
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,808
-What? We both have classes.
-There's somewhere I want to go.

365
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,810
No, no.

366
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,812
-You can't.
-I was the one

367
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,549
who put up the posters.

368
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,218
If you want to know why,

369
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,787
come with me.

370
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,203
Hey, is Kaito absent today?

371
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,170
Seems like it.

372
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,073
Maybe he really did hit Tazawa.

373
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:13,912
Everyone, take a seat.

374
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,949
Why are you here today?

375
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,418
Shizuka-sensei took the day off.

376
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,487
She's feeling under the weather.
I'll be doing homeroom in her place.

377
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,357
Do you know why Kaito's absent?

378
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,659
I haven't been informed.

379
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,971
They say looking at the sea
helps you forget bad things.

380
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,607
<i>Are you one of those people?</i>

381
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,507
But…

382
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,178
no matter how long I stare at it,
I can't forget a thing.

383
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:49,915
That's good.

384
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:51,550
What?

385
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:57,322
It means you aren't so simple that you
forget bad stuff just by looking at sea.

386
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,259
Was that a compliment?

387
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:02,894
I'm not sure.

388
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,130
Anyway, your promise.

389
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,336
The posters. Why did you do that?

390
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,318
Nanami is even dumber than I thought.

391
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,455
He skips school without clearing his name.

392
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,423
Honestly,

393
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,626
it makes it easier to expel him.

394
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,897
To be honest,
I think Tazawa is the one lying.

395
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:40,866
What do you mean?

396
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,502
Earlier, in homeroom, he was restless.

397
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,872
<i>Bouncing his leg, touching his face.</i>

398
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:52,044
They are classic signs of a guilty person.

399
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,880
I thought you were just
a dumb, hot-blooded teacher,

400
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,815
but you observe your students closely.

401
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,650
Even if I'm dumb,

402
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,686
I'm doing more for the students than you.

403
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,555
So…

404
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,359
ｗhy would Tazawa lie?

405
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,331
I don't know.

406
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,433
I see.

407
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,405
Then you can't protect Nanami.

408
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,276
Do you really want to see him
expelled that badly?

409
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,979
Yes.

410
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,615
His violent past in middle school,

411
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,417
coming from a poor family,

412
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,754
For Meishin's future, students like him…

413
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,490
are a burden!

414
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:43,362
Getting angry and violent already?

415
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,398
At this rate,
you'll be fired before he is.

416
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,401
You really are stupid.

417
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:52,971
Now,

418
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,507
lower your fist, please.

419
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,947
Lower your fist.

420
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,685
-You really gonna hit me?
-Even if I do, I'll just say I didn't.

421
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,554
-That's not good.
-It doesn't matter.

422
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,289
Violence solves nothing.

423
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,492
Stop it!

424
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,496
There are cameras. You can't hide it.

425
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,835
‪NUMBER 8 STAIRS‬

426
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,270
Answer me.

427
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:28,974
It was a lie.

428
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:30,776
Lie?

429
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,778
I didn't do any of that.

430
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,681
I lied just to get you to come here.

431
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,950
What?

432
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,789
When I was little,

433
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,826
I saw a TV show where a student
and a teacher

434
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,594
went on a date at the beach.

435
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,765
That's why I wanted to come here with you.

436
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,834
<i>I remember something.</i>

437
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,438
<i>A forbidden romance</i>
<i>between teacher and student…</i>

438
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,875
<i>Does that mean Nanami likes me?</i>

439
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,244
<i>Is that why he lied?</i>

440
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,684
There's something I want you to hear.

441
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,153
<i>What?</i>

442
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,456
<i>What? What is this?</i>

443
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,060
<i>Why does it feel like</i>
<i>you're about to confess?</i>

444
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:24,663
Sensei.

445
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,869
How do you get people to believe you?

446
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:33,805
<i>What are you saying?</i>

447
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,441
I didn't hit Tazawa.

448
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,578
But…

449
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:43,248
no one will believe me.

450
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,017
Why do you think that?

451
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,656
In 2nd year of middle school,

452
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,059
I hit a classmate.

453
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,464
I got mad over something dumb and hit him.

454
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,336
He fell down from the punch,

455
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,139
and ended up seriously hurt.

456
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,480
Apparently, the other students
found out about it.

457
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,554
No one trusts someone
who has made a mistake before.

458
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,423
-That's not true.
-It is.

459
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,059
Even my mom didn't believe me!

460
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,264
I think…

461
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,600
he did resort to violence.

462
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,044
What happened with you and your mother?

463
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,415
I hit a classmate

464
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,651
<i>-in middle school.</i>
-Hey.

465
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,885
Why did you do that?

466
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,454
-Kaito?
-I just lost my temper.

467
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,089
Are you

468
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:00,025
that kind of person?

469
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,761
-Answer me!
<i>-My mother pleading to me…</i>

470
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,362
-<i>I…</i>
-You wouldn't do…

471
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,630
Shut up already!

472
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,168
‪Sorry.‬

473
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:11,937
You're…

474
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,372
just like him.

475
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:16,541
Just like that man.

476
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,047
My dad was abusive for such a long time.

477
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,383
<i>They finally got divorced</i>

478
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,352
<i>when I started middle school.</i>

479
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,222
But I am his son.

480
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,926
What if I turn into someone like him?

481
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,431
I'm scared of it.

482
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,267
It made me angry.

483
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,610
But you already know this, don't you?

484
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,947
Sensei, you are SEE, right?

485
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,584
Are you?

486
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,791
I told you before…

487
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,862
I don't know what you mean.

488
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:13,598
Then,

489
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:17,736
what about that sticker on your phone?

490
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,405
That is SEE's sticker.

491
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,607
SEE
I WRITE ABOUT THINGS THAT INTEREST ME.

492
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,580
Back then,

493
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,983

494
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,985

519
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:49,394
That message…

520
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,831
really saved me.

521
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:56,668
But…

522
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,504
SEE vanished from the internet…

523
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:02,207
I never got to say thank you.

524
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,044
So,

525
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,547
<i>when you showed up as my teacher,</i>

526
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,417
I was shocked.

527
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,554
Yes.

528
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,656
We will be waiting.

529
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:20,391
Goodbye.

530
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,064
Looks like it will go well.

531
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,235
I'll see you later.

532
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:31,703
Yes.

533
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,010
Are you sure it's okay like this?

534
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:48,419
Urami-sensei.

535
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,854
What happened?

536
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:51,923
Moriguchi-sensei

537
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,426
will have a meeting with Nanami's mother
today at four p.m.

538
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:00,498
Nanami's mother doesn't
trust his son at all,

539
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,600
and she has left the matter to the school.

540
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,370
Moriguchi-sensei is
taking advantage of that

541
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,505
to push for expulsion.

542
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,308
Without even hearing Nanami's side?

543
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,378
The school can expel a student

544
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,647
with parental consent,
even without theirs.

545
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,282
No...

546
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:21,319
Today, Nanami's
been absent without notice, right?

547
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:23,454
Yes.

548
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,558
We have to get him here fast
and convince his mother.

549
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,892
Understood.

550
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,996
But why would you tell me this?

551
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,301
I'm still a teacher, you know.

552
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,376
Since that incident in middle school,

553
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,245
things have been tense

554
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,348
<i>between me and Mom.</i>

555
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,418
But like SEE said,

556
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,688
I tried my best in high school

557
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,624
to become the version of me I want to be.

558
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,561
If I did that,

559
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,664
maybe she'd start believing in me too.

560
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,201
But…

561
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,541
So you didn't hit Tazawa?

562
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,177
I did think about it.

563
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,479
But…

564
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,350
I don't want to be like him.

565
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,552
I chose not to.

566
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,090
I see.

567
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,927
No matter what I do,

568
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,197
Mom won't believe me.

569
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,433
Even if I change,

570
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,870
if no one else believes it,
it doesn't matter.

571
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:48,873
I…

572
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,610
don't know what to do anymore.

573
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,152
INCOMING CALL URAMI

574
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:05,490
Hello?

575
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,592
Shizuka-sensei, are you all right?

576
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,463
I still feel kind of sick.

577
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,766
Sorry to bring this up now,
but it's urgent.

578
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:16,601
What happened?

579
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,405
Moriguchi called Nanami's mother
to school at four today.

580
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,207
<i>He's going to talk about expulsion.</i>

581
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,542
-What?
<i>-Today,</i>

582
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,744
<i>Nanami was absent without notice.</i>

583
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,748
-Yes…
-Moriguchi

584
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,952
plans to expel him by getting his mother's
agreement while he's not there.

585
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,254
<i>If she consents,</i>
<i>they can go through with it.</i>

586
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,522
What?

587
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:38,990
Shizuka-sensei,

588
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,726
can you go to the school

589
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,529
and talk to his mother
before Moriguchi gets to her?

590
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,530
<i>It's three p.m. now.</i>

591
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,665
<i>It takes an hour to get there.</i>

592
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,435
I think I can make it there.

593
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:54,439
Thanks.
I'll do everything I can from here.

594
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:55,807
Understood.

595
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,776
Nanami, let's go back to school.

596
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:00,678
-Hurry!
-Yes.

597
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,248
-Sensei's here.
-Why?

598
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:05,883
What's going on?

599
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,587
Tazawa, I need to talk to you.

600
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,763
TAXI FARE 8900 YEN

601
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,932
<i>Climbing fast…!</i>

602
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,668
Expulsion, huh?

603
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,704
I won't let them expel you.

604
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,040
I'm paying this much…

605
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,074
TAXI FARE 9100 YEN

606
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,142
Woah!

607
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,687
WHAT KIND OF VIOLENCE

608
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:43,955
THAT IMPULSE HAPPENS TO ANYONE

609
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,924
MRS. NANAMI, YOU'RE JUST LIKE
JAPANESE SOCIETY

610
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,192
IF YOU WON'T ACCEPT HIM…

611
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,263
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

612
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,932
Thank you for coming today.

613
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,305
His homeroom teacher, Urumi-sensei,
is absent due to illness.

614
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:02,874
Moriguchi-sensei

615
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,911
-will join us in her stead.
-Nice to meet you.

616
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,114
-Get out!
-Okay.

617
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,985
-Let's go!
-Yes.

618
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,920
Regarding what they were doing

619
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:18,723
behind the gym…

620
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,125
Nanami himself isn't here.

621
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:27,130
The school has no choice but to take that
as a refusal to speak up.

622
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,733
Is that acceptable?

623
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:31,268
I apologize for the trouble.

624
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,504
So that means,

625
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,306
What Nanami said was a lie,

626
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:39,744
and Nanami hit Tazawa.

627
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,946
He would be admitting that, correct?

628
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:43,848
Yes.

629
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,056
Urumi-sensei. Weren't you feeling unwell?

630
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:55,793
I'm fine now. Sorry.

631
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,629
Hello, I'm Shizuka Urumi,

632
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,700
Nanami's homeroom teacher.

633
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,069
May I speak with you for a moment?

634
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,137
Unfortunately,

635
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,706
we've already spoken with her.

636
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,909
Nanami, you're being expelled.

637
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,212
She gave her consent.

638
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,981
Has she signed the withdrawal form?

639
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,750
-Not yet.
-Then it's not final.

640
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,886
We'll get a form immediately.

641
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,122
-The form!
-Yes.

642
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,493
SCRIPT

643
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,563
Do you really believe

644
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,934
Nanami would hit someone?

645
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,172
Yes, I do.

646
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,909
He has caused

647
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,412
this sort of trouble in the past.

648
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,617
You're saying once someone does it,
they'll do it again?

649
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,925
His father was that kind of person.

650
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,263
Kaito is his son.

651
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,265
That's just who he is.

652
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,133
That's enough.

653
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,371
His father is one thing.
Kaito is his own person.

654
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,108
Violent behavior isn't hereditary.

655
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,510
It's shaped by one's environment.

656
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,379
If Kaito turns out this way,

657
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,315
you share the blame.

658
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,851
How dare you say that to his mother!

659
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,319
Let me ask you.

660
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,657
What violent actions
has he done, up until now?

661
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,494
The middle school incident,

662
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,598
and shoving you after you scolded him.
That's all, right?

663
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,171
That level of impulse happens to anyone.

664
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,475
And Kaito's tried to change since then.

665
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,312
People can change

666
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,948
if they try.

667
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,551
But if no one acknowledges that effort,

668
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,887
a person will stop changing.

669
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:05,656
Mrs. Nanami,

670
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,826
you're just like Japanese society today.

671
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,297
You refuse to accept those
with past flaws.

672
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,133
Without that recognition,

673
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,003
no matter how hard they try,
people lose motivation.

674
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,605
If you won't accept him,

675
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,140
you'll break him!

676
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,508
Wait a minute.

677
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,778
Kaito…

678
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,916
really has been trying to change?

679
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:35,620
Nanami,

680
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,022
you too.

681
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,760
You may be the type
who is reserved and doesn't say anything.

682
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,964
But if you don't say how you feel,
no one will ever understand you.

683
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,836
Have you ever told your mother
how you feel?

684
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,873
You made a mistake, once.

685
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,411
If you've learned from it
and want to earn trust again…

686
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,113
You have to

687
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,983
make an effort to convey your feeling
and sincerity, more than anyone else.

688
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:08,819
Nanami,

689
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,524
look your mother in the eyes!

690
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,070
‪Mom...‬

691
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,204
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

692
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:28,172
I…

693
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,781
Since that day in middle school, I swore
to never do that kind of thing again.

694
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,518
I didn't hit Tazawa.

695
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,722
I…

696
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,558
would never get violent against anyone.

697
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:52,229
I'd never do anything that would hurt you.

698
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,132
I…

699
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,605
I believed all this time that
I could become the person I want to be!

700
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,142
So please…

701
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,445
believe in me!

702
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:18,022
I know the abuse from your ex-husband
must still hurt, mentally.

703
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,058
But…

704
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,529
those scars weren't caused by Kaito.

705
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,469
Kaito is not his father.

706
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,607
Please remember this.

707
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,144
Kaito

708
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:45,249
is your child,
whom you've lovingly raised for 16 years.

709
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:49,687
And now he's asking you to believe in him!

710
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,058
As for whether he's lying or now,

711
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,295
I believe no one knows it
better than you, his mother.

712
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,474
<i>-We finished!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

713
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,476
<i>Yes!</i>

714
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:14,645
<i>Yes!</i>

715
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,620
So it really was Kaito who hit Tazawa?

716
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,588
There's no way Kaito would do that.

717
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:28,292
But he skipped school,
so that proves he had something to hide.

718
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,033
I agree with Hina-chan.

719
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,669
Kaito-kun didn't do anything wrong.

720
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:42,940
He isn't that kind of person.

721
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,785
Even if you have
a wonderful relationship with your child,

722
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,388
if Nanami used violence,

723
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,890
he can't avoid expulsion. Withdrawal form…

724
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,030
Kaito didn't use violence.

725
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,032
I believe in Kaito.

726
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,869
Then why was Tazawa bleeding?

727
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,412
-What is it?
-Hey. Tazawa.

728
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,253
It was…

729
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,655
all a lie.

730
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:39,063
Tell us the truth
about what happened here yesterday.

731
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,731
I told you,

732
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,667
he hit me, here.

733
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,870
-That's the truth.
-Tazawa.

734
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,538
For security purposes,

735
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,475
this school has cameras everywhere.

736
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,945
Of course, this area is recorded too.

737
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:59,750
We've requested footage from the time
you two were here together.

738
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,220
If you're lying…

739
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,657
tell us the truth
before we see the footage.

740
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,794
You always look at me
like I'm beneath you!

741
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,696
Say something!

742
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,469
What? Come on!

743
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,108
-Pathetic.
-Hey!

744
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,544
Why won't you hit me?

745
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,346
I'm not like my old man.

746
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,850
Wait, hang on!

747
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,592
Damn it!

748
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,794
Why did you lie?

749
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,297
Because I hate him.

750
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,199
He always looks down on me
and it pisses me off.

751
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,869
Nanami is not looking down on you.

752
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:54,071
You're the one who looks down on Nanami.

753
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,675
I just couldn't bring myself
to admit it was a lie.

754
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,244
Kaito didn't do anything.

755
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:03,581
I'm sorry.

756
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,227
Now there's no reason to expel Nanami.

757
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,364
It seems that way.

758
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,233
I'm glad.

759
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,836
I'm happy that

760
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,438
Nanami's name is cleared.

761
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,514
Sensei…

762
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:42,419
Thank you.

763
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:46,190
It's nothing.

764
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,359
Looks like SEE saved me again.

765
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,794
By the way,

766
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,763
why did SEE…

767
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,299
disappear from the internet?

768
00:43:58,202 --> 00:44:00,404
Shizuka-sensei!

769
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,508
Still, I'm glad everything worked out.

770
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,212
How did you know about the gym camera?

771
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:09,680
Oh, that was a lie.

772
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,752
There are no cameras behind the gym.
I bluffed.

773
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:21,959
I'm surprised you could
pull off a trick like that on a student.

774
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,294
Or have you just been

775
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,730
pretending to be dumb?

776
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:31,902
You seem to know
the camera placements well.

777
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,673
Could it be…

778
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,309
you were the one who

779
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,345
put up the posters?

780
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,090
Saying it's okay to run away
isn't just an excuse

781
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,491
-to escape reality!
-<i>I'm sure there's a purpose behind it!</i>
