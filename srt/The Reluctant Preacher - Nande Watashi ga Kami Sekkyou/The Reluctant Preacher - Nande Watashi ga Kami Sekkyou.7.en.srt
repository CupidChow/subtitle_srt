1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,238
If you know anything

2
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,308
about this notice,
you have to explain it to me!

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:13,947
It might’ve been someone inside
who knew the camera layout.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,616
You're saying the culprit
is among us teachers?

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,985
It's true that I'm a murderer.

6
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:21,521
That wasn't your fault alone.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,457
She doesn’t remember.
Even when she has met me.

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,160
She killed my little sister.

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:29,929
SHIZUKA URUMI IS A MURDERER

10
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:33,633
The one who posted this
was Aika-sensei, right?

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:36,870
Yes.

12
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,305
I was shocked…

13
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:45,211
to learn that Shizuka-sensei was the one
who drove Aika’s sister to her death.

14
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,213
Drove her to her death?

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,415
That can’t be true.

16
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,749
What SEE said…

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,752
triggered Karen’s death.

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,422
That’s what Aika believes.

19
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:01,895
How did she find out…

20
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,597
Urumi-sensei was SEE?

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,902
Goodbye.

22
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,370
Sensei, are you SEE?

23
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,773
SEE?

24
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,076
What do you mean, SEE?

25
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,311
She tried to play dumb…

26
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,313
People don't have a high opinion of us.

27
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,949
-But the proof was…
-Geez, I see…

28
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,751
…right there on her phone.

29
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,155
Once Aika realized she was SEE,

30
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,725
she started getting close
to Shizuka-sensei.

31
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,300
So what do you plan to do
about Urumi-sensei?

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,640
I want to talk to Aika.

33
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,312
Good morning.

34
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,580
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

35
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,787
Please, could you give everyone

36
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,857
the same disciplinary suspension instead?

37
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,227
Dammit!

38
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:10,530
-Dammit!
-Couple days after that incident,

39
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,867
Moriguchi Sensei
and the others are acting normal…

40
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,503
There hasn't been much going on…

41
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,105
It's creepy and it honestly scares me.

42
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,007
Well…

43
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,611
if they’re not doing anything,
then there’s nothing to worry about.

44
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,613
-I guess you’re right--
-Wait.

45
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,615
-I’m busy.
-What?

46
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,821
As I’ve said before,
anyone who failed the midterm

47
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,556
will have a remedial class on Sunday.

48
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,490
Don’t forget.

49
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,526
-Don't forget, okay?
-She meant you!

50
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:40,527
Oh, me, huh.

51
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,663
It's a remedial class,

52
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,766
so you’ll be dismissed
as soon as you finish the assigned tasks.

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,401
What about you, sensei?

54
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,603
Oguchi-sensei will be in charge tomorrow.

55
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,005
That’s not fair!

56
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,107
You’re the one who failed.

57
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,376
Hey, you too?

58
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,011
-I'm doing my best here!
-Yes.

59
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,245
What a pain…

60
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,114
-Bet you got remedial class too!
-I don't!

61
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,115
Well, sorry, then!

62
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,218
I'm sorry!

63
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,419
It’s peaceful.

64
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,288
I'll do my best.

65
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,360
Has Kyoko been busy?

66
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,498
She hasn’t been visiting lately.

67
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,236
Seems like she’s got her hands full.

68
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,372
It’s lonely without her around, right?

69
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,009
It is lonely, but…

70
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,713
It’s peaceful!

71
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,649
Since I became a teacher,

72
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,252
have I ever had a weekend this quiet?

73
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,856
Let me go!

74
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,325
-Quit it!
-It should…

75
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,293
…had been…

76
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,362
-I really liked you.
-Stop!

77
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,563
Coward!

78
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,999
-a calm Sunday…
-Wait!

79
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,001
Dai-kun!

80
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,036
Can you all knock it off already?

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,846
JUNE 1ST, SUNDAY 11:30

82
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,081
Touch the handles!

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,884
Push up!

84
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,755
Touch the handles!

85
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:21,761
Four, three, two, one…

86
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,896
Good job!

87
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,166
Nice riding!

88
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,975
Feels great, right?

89
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,746
Morning exercise boosts happy hormones

90
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:43,616
like beta-endorphins and serotonin.

91
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,718
They lift your mood.

92
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,988
Once I started,
I stopped getting irritated

93
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,757
by little things.

94
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,028
I bet you'll have an amazing day too.

95
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,031
He's kind of annoying…

96
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,399
Thank you very much!

97
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,937
Normally I’d be annoyed, but not today.

98
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,040
As he said,

99
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:10,576
maybe it’s thanks
to the exercise this morning?

100
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,478
Cut the crap! Hey!

101
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,981
You messing with me? Huh?

102
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,850
I’ll kill you if you keep talking shit!

103
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,720
So damn annoying!

104
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,390
You'd better do something by today!

105
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,894
Anyway,

106
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,464
today’s going to be
a calm and productive Sunday!

107
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,504
SEIRA HAYASHI
HELLO! SORRY I CALLED YOU ON YOUR DAY OFF.

108
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:45,044
I didn’t know there was
such a nice place near our school.

109
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,379
The food’s really good too.

110
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,714
Oh… I'll try it.

111
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,815
Let's eat.

112
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,221
Delicious!

113
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,526
But what’s up?
You invited me to lunch on a Sunday.

114
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,996
I was stuck at school this morning,
grading tests.

115
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,132
Wait, on a Sunday?

116
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,068
Did siding with the principal
make you motivated again?

117
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,537
It's not because of that!

118
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,242
I didn’t have plans this afternoon,

119
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,978
and being home alone…

120
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,280
makes me think of him…

121
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,349
Let's break up.

122
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,086
I can't deal with you anymore, Seira.

123
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,894
Why didn’t it work out?

124
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,529
What’s wrong?

125
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,865
What do you think I did wrong?

126
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,068
Here it comes. The annoying questions…

127
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,203
I wonder…

128
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,674
How do you move on?

129
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,143
I have no idea.

130
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,814
Do you think I should delete
his photos from my phone?

131
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,049
Do what you want.

132
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:01,053
I didn’t want to waste
a peaceful Sunday on this.

133
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,455
It’s gone!

134
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,023
It’s gone!

135
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,592
-What’s wrong?
-My wallet’s gone!

136
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,363
I might’ve left it in the faculty room…

137
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,398
Nice play!

138
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,299
Let's go!

139
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,200
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

140
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,635
Fly ball!

141
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,702
-Yes!
-All right!

142
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,938
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

143
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,873
Now we're looking for a wallet…

144
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,009
My Sunday’s getting hijacked.

145
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,680
We better find it quickly
so I can get back to enjoying the day!

146
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,755
Seira.

147
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,357
Why are you here?

148
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,431
Wait! Dai!

149
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,168
Hey! Dai!

150
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,804
Hey!

151
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,705
What?

152
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,106
What’s going on?

153
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,946
Seira-sensei! What’s going on?

154
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,280
Dai…

155
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,484
went inside the restroom.

156
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,818
Dai?

157
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,487
My ex.

158
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,822
What? Why is he at school?

159
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,657
I don’t know…

160
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,495
Maybe… he wants to make up with me?

161
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,131
-Making up?
-There's no other reason, right?

162
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,367
Why else would he show up
at his ex’s workplace?

163
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,703
Wouldn’t most people just call or message?

164
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,539
Even if he came in person,
he could’ve waited out front.

165
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,475
Coming into the school? That’s bold.

166
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,610
And it’s Sunday…

167
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,478
Dai…

168
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,548
always acts without thinking.

169
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,817
BOYS' AND GIRLS' RESTROOMS

170
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,818
Wait.

171
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,053
If he says he wants to make up,
what will you do?

172
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,154
I don’t know…

173
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,157
I’d have to talk to him.

174
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,800
JUNE 1ST, SUNDAY
13:03

175
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,135
JUNE 1ST, SUNDAY
13:15

176
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,338
It’s been 10 minutes,
but he’s still not out.

177
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:07,380
Now we wait for him to come out
of the toilet?

178
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,883
Why am I waiting, though?

179
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,986
They already broke up. Who cares?

180
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,957
Hasn't it been a while?

181
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,692
Maybe try calling him.

182
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:24,096
He has been ignoring my messages.

183
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,400
What if something happened?

184
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,668
Like what?

185
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,036
Maybe he fainted in there?

186
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,340
Dai? Are you okay? Say something!

187
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,076
Shouldn’t you go in and check?

188
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,144
It’s the boys’ restroom.

189
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,212
But still, this situation seems serious.

190
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,147
There’s…

191
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,482
a security camera recording everything.

192
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,385
I don’t want this
to become a problem later.

193
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,356
Sitting here and waiting is even worse!

194
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,259
If it were a man, they could go in…

195
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,761
Ca… Can you check the staff room?

196
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,963
The vice-principal's there!

197
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,365
-Hurry!
-What?

198
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,100
-Hurry!
-Me?

199
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,168
Hurry!

200
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,606
This is so annoying!

201
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,407
FACULTY ROOM

202
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,875
FACULTY ROOM

203
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:24,123
My peaceful Sunday
is turning into nonsense!

204
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,325
Where is the vice-principal?

205
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,264
Vice-Principal!

206
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,169
Oh… why are you here on a Sunday?

207
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,071
Oh, some things happened.

208
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,007
Why is he in jogging gear?

209
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:42,842
I see, good luck.

210
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,711
-Wait, please!
-What?

211
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,447
I wanted to ask you a favor…

212
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,849
I’m busy!

213
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,355
Urumi-sensei!

214
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,524
Why are you at school on a Sunday?

215
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,395
It’s a long story…

216
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,295
I see…

217
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,803
NOT YET?

218
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,441
SEEMS THE VICE-PRINCIPAL IS BUSY

219
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,144
JUST BRING A MAN! I DON'T CARE WHO!

220
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:24,517
BOYS' AND GIRLS' RESTROOMS

221
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,584
Dai?

222
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,188
Can you hear me? Dai?

223
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,600
I can't interrupt the students'
remedial lesson…

224
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,650
-Let's go!
-Okay!

225
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,085
Okay!

226
00:11:59,151 --> 00:11:59,985
Alright!

227
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,524
Nishihata.

228
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,994
What? What are you doing here?

229
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,531
It’s a long story…

230
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,368
Anyway, what about the remedial class?

231
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,507
I just don’t feel up to it…

232
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,008
Are you unmotivated?

233
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,647
Sensei, why do we even study?

234
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:29,915
What?

235
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,451
The most cliché adolescent question ever.

236
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,253
Why now, all of a sudden?

237
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:39,525
How many teachers
have answered this before me?

238
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,895
It feels kind of embarrassing to answer…

239
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:55,040
Maybe… to enrich your life…?

240
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,978
That’s a super cliché answer.

241
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,715
What’s wrong with a cliché answer
to a cliché question?

242
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,151
Shouldn’t you go back to your class?

243
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,987
I told you, I’m not feeling it…

244
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,022
What are you doing?

245
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,260
Nothing.

246
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,596
Why are you here, sensei?

247
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,133
A lot happened…

248
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,504
Anyway, Nanami,
why aren’t you in remedial class?

249
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,173
Rui's missing, so I went to find him.

250
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,076
I just don't feel like studying…

251
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,213
How do you get motivated?

252
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,917
Dai, are you okay?

253
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,086
Answer me!

254
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,256
BOYS' RESTROOM

255
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,428
BRING ANY MAN!

256
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,863
I DON'T CARE WHO!

257
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,064
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

258
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,311
So forget it already!

259
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,346
I can’t forget it! That’s the problem!

260
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:12,251
-It’s none of your business!
-Hey!

261
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,886
Say it again! "None of my business"?

262
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,187
Let me go!

263
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,589
Quit it!

264
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,759
Nanami, didn't you promise
you won't do things like this?

265
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,728
You don’t get how I feel!

266
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,665
Shizuka-sensei!

267
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,768
What are you doing here?

268
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,712
I'm taking these two…

269
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:48,821
CALL

270
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,190
Yes?

271
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,759
This is Kyoko Kago.

272
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,996
It's been a while. Please come in.

273
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,334
BOYS' RESTROOM

274
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:06,238
A man went in here
and hasn’t come out since.

275
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,207
Something could have happened.

276
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,442
Can you please check on him?

277
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,787
Don't push me!

278
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,360
It's here, right?

279
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,530
Take a peek.

280
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,633
-Me?
-Please!

281
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:37,970
Is anyone there?

282
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,472
Someone’s in there.

283
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,110
Are you okay?

284
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:47,646
Did he faint?

285
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,715
Excuse me!

286
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,217
If you don’t answer,
I’ll climb over and peek in!

287
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,287
May I?

288
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,694
What?

289
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,863
What’s going on?

290
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,936
Is someone in there?

291
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,237
Well…

292
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,073
Well…

293
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,742
Why are you mumbling?

294
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,148
There’s someone in there,

295
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,684
but he said he can’t come out right now.

296
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:33,926
Coward!

297
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,463
You just keep running away.

298
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,064
Aren’t you ashamed?

299
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,103
Living while knowing your actions
have hurt someone…

300
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,171
Don't you feel any guilt?

301
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,211
I don't think living like a coward
is any fun!

302
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,682
Come out already!

303
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,152
She's saying all that for me…

304
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,123
Come out and talk to me!

305
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:18,404
DON'T LEAVE THE WATER RUNNING!

306
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,094
What?

307
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,364
What is happening?

308
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,269
MORAL EXCELLENCE

JUNE 1ST, SUNDAY, 10:00

311
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,289
-Good morning.
-Yeah.

312
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,558
Morning.

313
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,029
Why are you here on a Sunday?

314
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,399
I’m supervising the remedial class.

315
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,302
Right…

316
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,771
What about you?

317
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,175
Preparing for the school orientation.

318
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:32,711
I see…

319
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,690
Is it awkward?

320
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:46,925
Awkward?

321
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,728
Being alone with me.

322
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:05,277
Are you really planning
to end things with me?

323
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,082
What are you saying?

324
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,216
Ending things--

325
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,886
Are you saying we weren’t even
in that kind of relationship?

326
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,757
I really liked you,

327
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,526
Vice-Principal.

328
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,693
Stop!

329
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,295
This is a school!

330
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,697
Just tell me how you felt.

331
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,900
That’s all I want to know!

332
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,103
Well…

333
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,074
I…

334
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:39,645
-Good morning.
-Oh!

335
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,514
Hayashi-sensei.

336
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,917
What brings you here on a Sunday?

337
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,653
-I still haven’t finished grading tests.
-Oh, I see.

338
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,789
I see. Keep up the good work.

339
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,662
Did something happen?

340
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:58,997
He's acting really weirdly.

341
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,037
Well, I’m heading to the restroom.

342
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,375
What?

343
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,330
Wait! Are you trying to run away?

344
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,900
BOYS' AND GIRLS' RESTROOMS

345
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,368
Answer me!

346
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,038
-How do you feel-
-Stop it!

347
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,809
The students are waiting.

348
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,311
Go see them.

349
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,380
Well then.

350
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,489
Good morning. Come get your assignments.

351
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:04,263
Once you’re finished, you may leave.

352
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,300
The quicker you get it done,
the sooner you’re free.

353
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,168
So do your best.

354
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,103
Here.

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,004
REMEDIAL

356
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,773
I will be in the faculty room.

357
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,410
Please do your best.
I will check back at noon.

358
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,579
What a pain…

359
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,204
What? Dammit! What's going on?

360
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,740
Oh, it's leaking! Oh no!

361
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,882
Oh, no!

362
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:05,891
Hey…

363
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,827
Can you give me ten minutes?
I need love advice.

364
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,464
Sure!

365
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,467
Men are so selfish!

366
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,970
-Right?
-I know! Did something happen?

367
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,439
A lot happened…

368
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,808
A lot? Tell me more!

369
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:25,344
It's like… he was playing
with my feelings.

370
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,013
-How dare he!
-Why me?

371
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,248
JUNE 1ST, SUNDAY 10:46

372
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,552
It feels amazing
not having anything to worry about.

373
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,023
Was the sky always this blue?

374
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,326
PLUMBING COMPANY

375
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:45,364
Watch it, lady!
Keep your eyes on the road!

376
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,199
Sorry.

377
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,039
Well…

378
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,708
Not the best start,
but I’m not letting that ruin my day.

379
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,910
Sunday’s just getting started.

380
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,518
Okay! Time to sweat it out
and refresh myself.

381
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,855
SHIN-MEIGAOKA INSTRUCTOR
MAKOTO HAYAKAWA'S SPECIAL LESSON

382
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,026
-Hey, newbie.
-Yes?

383
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,497
Go to the faculty room and find out
what needs fixing.

384
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,565
Wait, me?

385
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,567
Get moving!

386
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,671
24 HOURS RAPID RESPONSE AND SOLUTION!

387
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,711
He comes to me when he wants me.

388
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,379
Things get tough, he tosses me aside.

389
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,047
I've had enough of him!

390
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,015
I totally get it!

391
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,884
You should stay away from men like that.

392
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,118
Absolutely!

393
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,928
I said ten minutes.
I should check on the remedial class.

394
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,033
-What?
-Oh…

395
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,034
Going to the restroom.

396
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,269
Oh, I see.

Jeez…

400
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,192
Still working?

401
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,295
It’s almost lunchtime.

402
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:26,097
Wrap it up and go for lunch, okay?

403
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,132
REMEDIAL

404
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,601
Where’s Nishihata?

405
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,205
Uh…maybe he's in the restroom?

406
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,006
Okay.

407
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,545
Now's the chance…

408
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,862
-One…
-Let's go!

409
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,864
-Let's go!
-One, two, three, four…

410
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,699
-One, two, three, four…
-One…

411
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,801
-Let's go!
-Yes!

412
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,539
Who…

413
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,607
Who are you?

414
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,709
I’m with Water Leak Busters.

415
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,143
Oh, I see…

416
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,212
And…you are?

417
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,983
I'm… the Vice-principal.

418
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,455
Why are you in running clothes?

419
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,624
Well…

420
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,292
-A pipe burst, and I got soaked.
-Oh.

421
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,162
So… you have a leaking toilet?

422
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:32,931
Oh, well…

423
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,202
I'll show you.

424
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,175
I’m starving…

425
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,481
THANK YOU!

426
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,515
HELLO.

427
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,957
SORRY FOR CALLING YOU ON YOUR DAY OFF.

428
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,425
WANT TO GO OUT FOR LUNCH?

429
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,462
Delicious!

430
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,731
But what’s up?

431
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,868
You invited me to lunch on a Sunday.

Vice-Principal!

435
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,747
-You…
-Oh, Oguchi-sensei!

436
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,983
Oguchi, Oguchi!

437
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,451
Wait!

438
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,386
Don't run away!

439
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,921
I said don't run away!

440
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,992
-Wait!
-Don't run away!

00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,898
All right. That should do it.

445
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,835
I'll clean up and head back to the van.

446
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,371
You. Get them to sign this report.

447
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,607

-What?

448
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,343
-Please clean up.
-Okay.

00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,793
Why are you here?

452
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,165
Wait! Dai!

453
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,068
Dai!

454
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:18,803
Wait!

455
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,112
Wait!

456
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,617
Vice-Principal!

457
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:38,189
Hey! Wait!

458
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,492
Wait!

SEEMS THE VICE-PRINCIPAL IS BUSY

461
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,164
BRING A MAN! I DON'T CARE WHO!

462
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,132
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

463
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,253
KAREN SUZUKI

464
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,762
Sorry. I know you must be busy.

465
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,799
It’s fine.

466
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,468
I wasn't really doing anything.

467
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,237
I see.

468
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,975
There’s something
I wanted to talk to you about…

469
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:33,745
Is it Shizuka Urumi?

470
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,030
-Rui!
-Hey!

471
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,434
Is your elbow okay?

472
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,636
This much is nothing.

473
00:28:58,703 --> 00:28:59,604
Okay.

474
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,239
So happy for you.

475
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,408
Hey, get back to practice.

476
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:05,810
Sorry.

477
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,754
I used to be in the baseball team
until my first year.

478
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,825
Back in junior high, I was the pitcher.
We won the prefectural championship.

479
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,662
Meishin’s baseball team is decent.

480
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:25,864
I actually got in

481
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,501
on a baseball scholarship.

482
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:32,604
Why did you quit?

483
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,776
I got into a car accident
in my first year.

484
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,647
I can live normally,

485
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,316
but I can't play baseball anymore.

486
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:49,487
Of course, there's no place for me
on the team now.

487
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,655
So I quit.

488
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:52,857
I see.

489
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,262
I hate studying too.

490
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:01,399
I really have no idea
what I’m supposed to do now.

491
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:06,437
Nothing’s fun anymore.
I’ve got no motivation.

492
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:07,806
Shut up already.

493
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,677
-What did you say?
-You’re being annoying.

494
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,048
I’m not.

495
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,317
It’s not like I enjoy studying either.

496
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,621
I failed too, so I can’t judge anyone.
But if you keep this up,

497
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,291
you’re going to repeat the year.

498
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,862
You’ve got no motivation? So what?

499
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,764
You can’t play baseball
so forget it already!

500
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,966
I can’t forget it! That’s the problem!

501
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,705
It’s none of your business.

502
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:42,874
So leave me alone.

503
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,709
What do you mean "none of my business"?

504
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,311
Say it again! "None of my business"?

505
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,645
Let me go!

506
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,147
Quit it!

507
00:30:58,122 --> 00:30:59,023
Where did he go?

508
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:02,260
What?

509
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,595
BOYS' AND GIRLS' RESTROOMS

510
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,163
What’s going on?

511
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:11,269
Is someone in there?

512
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,604
Oh…

513
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,105
Well…

514
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,975
Why are you mumbling?

515
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,081
There’s someone in there,

516
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,617
but he said he can’t come out right now.

517
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,125
Coward!

518
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,130
You just keep running away.
Aren’t you ashamed?

519
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,534
Living while knowing your actions
have hurt someone…

520
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,637
Don't you feel any guilt?

521
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,474
I don't think living like a coward
is any fun!

522
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:54,312
Come out already!

523
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,694
-Vice-Principal.
-Yes.

524
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,330
Have you finally made up your mind?

525
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,666
I'm not sure…

526
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,567
I don’t know why

527
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,603
-these two are like that.
-Everyone is here…

528
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,239
-But it’s obvious things are messy.
-I can't give an answer…

529
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,374
-Let’s talk it out! Okay?
-Yes.

530
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:24,709
Well…

531
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,512
She is really latching onto him.

532
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,314
-We need to talk this through!
-Okay.

533
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:32,250
Got it, but wait!

534
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,552
There’s one more person in there.

535
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,595
Dai.

536
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,699
This is chaos.

537
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,902
What is going on? Why are you here?

538
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,470
Why did you run away?

539
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,305
And why were you in there that long?

540
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,275
What exactly do you want?

541
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:01,079
Yes. I’ve been wondering that too.

542
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,917
There’s something… I need to tell you.

543
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,188
What is it?

544
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:15,059
JUNE 1ST, SUNDAY, 13:52

545
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,328
2 MONTHS AGO

546
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,763
We are advertising now.

547
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,465
-Thank you very much!
-Thank you very much!

548
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,300
We are advertising now.

549
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,935
How was the play today?

550
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,740
I don't know.
It felt a bit difficult for me.

551
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,843
How can a teacher not get it…

552
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:37,081
Anyway, Dai, don’t you think it’s time
you got a real job?

553
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:38,916
Maybe you should give up acting.

554
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,819
Well…I’ve been thinking about that too.

555
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,622
-Really?
-Yes.

556
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,261
So… could you lend me 20,000 yen?

557
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,896
I’m short this month…

558
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:55,433
Jeez…

559
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,540
Here.

560
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:03,508
Thank you.

JUNE 1ST, SUNDAY, 11:30

562
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,317
Touch the handles!

563
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,021
Push up!

564
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:20,825
Touch the handles!

565
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,729
GIRLS' RESTROOM

566

HAYAKAWA

567
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,105
Hello?

568
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,641
Hey! What about my money?

569
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,877
Can you wait a little more?

570
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,145
Don’t screw with me!

571
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:45,049
You’ve also borrowed money
from the whole troupe, haven’t you?

572
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:46,918
You owe us 100,000 yen total!

573
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,753
Bring it now!

574
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,255
I can’t…
There’s no way I can get that right now…

575
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:52,390
Cut the crap! Hey!

576
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,593
You messing with me? Huh?

577
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,663
So damn annoying!

578
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,866
You'd better do something by today!

579
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:05,169
Hey! Where are you now? Tell me!

580
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,438
Yes, goodbye.

581
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:11,242
There’s no way I can get 100,000 yen…

582
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,313
FACULTY ROOM

583
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,548
Excuse me.

584
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,853
Excuse me.

585
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,195
Excuse me.

586
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,831
Excuse me.

587
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,578
Who…

588
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:49,614
-Who are you?
-Uh…

589
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,015
I’m with Water Leak Busters.

590
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:55,253
JUNE 1ST, SUNDAY 13:00

591
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,661
Why are you here?

592
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,533
Wait! Dai!

593
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,336
BOYS' AND GIRLS' RESTROOMS

594
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,544
Wait! Dai! Wait!

595
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:24,382
Okay.

596
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,752
HAYAKAWA

597
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,655
Hello?

598
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,658
Do you have the 100,000 yen?

599
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,594
Yes… I do…

600
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:38,329
You serious?

601
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,330
Yes.

602
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,568
-Don't push me!
-I'll hang up for now.

603
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,241
-It's here, right?
-Yeah.

604
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,577
Take a peek.

605
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,580
Is anyone there?

606
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:57,782
Someone’s in there.

607
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,651
Are you okay?

608
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,188
Did he faint?

609
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,159
If you don’t answer,
I’ll climb over and peek!

610
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,362
-May I?
-Sorry.

611
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,832
I just can’t come out right now!

612
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,572
There’s someone in there,

613
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,175
but he said he can’t come out right now.

614
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,617
Coward!

615
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,920
Come out and talk!

616
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,341
Hey…

617
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,311
.I don’t know who you are,

618
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,748
but shall we go out there together?

619
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,790
-But wait!
-What?

620
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,093
-There’s one more person in there.
-What?

621
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,035
Dai.

622
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:28,673
There’s something… I need to tell you.

623
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:30,374
What?

624
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:35,980
You dropped this.

625
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,650
What?

626
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,952
I found it in the hallway…

627
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,188
You dropped it.

628
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,762
What?

629
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,598
Wasn't there cash inside?

630
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,234
-What?
-100,000 yen.

631
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:00,538
I always keep that much cash handy!

632
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,909
It's so rare to see someone
carry that much cash around.

633
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,013
It’s because Dai always says,
"I need to borrow some money."

634
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,549
So I’ve just gotten used
to having it ready…

635
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,751
Borrow…?

636
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,920
Are you that kind of guy?

637
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,358
Then where is the money?

638
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:22,159
I don't know…

639
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,961
Yo, Yamazaki!

640
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,096
What?

641
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,764
Where is my money, huh?

642
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,665
What?

643
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,033
The FeelCycle guy?

644
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,469
Hello, miss.

645
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,436
Why are you here?

646
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,238
-Hayakawa?
-You two know each other?

647
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,507
He is Dai’s senior in the theatre troupe.

648
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,408
Yes,

649
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,244
FeelCycle’s just my side gig.
I’m actually an actor.

650
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,580
But this guy here?

651
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,483
He’s borrowed money
from all the troupe members.

652
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,617
Pay it back already!

653
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,452
Hayakawa… Listen…

654
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,255
You said you would do something by today!

655
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:52,690
I think…

656
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,092
he has 100,000 yen on him now.
He can repay it.

657
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,195
Are you sure?

658
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,178
Can you all knock it off already?

659
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:22,386
Today was supposed to be a Sunday
with no stress and no drama.

660
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,589
A day to just focus on myself…

661
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,626
But watching

662
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:30,661
Nishihata, Oguchi-sensei,

663
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:34,064
and you, Seira-sensei…
I couldn’t take it anymore!

664
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,769
So I’m going to say it!

665
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,172
I didn’t have time to think it through,

666
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,674
so it'll probably not make any sense.

667
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,745
When we live our lives,

668
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,449
we end up carrying all kinds of baggage.

669
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,186
Some of it might be fun.

670
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,188
Some of it might be infuriating.

671
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:59,490
It could be painful and heartbreaking.

672
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,894
No matter how important that baggage is,

673
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,664
the more it piles up,
the more it weighs us down.

674
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,668
We stop moving forward,
get stuck in a place…

675
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,006
Sometimes,
we're ruled by negative emotions…

676
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,647
That’s why… past glories,

677
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,317
past romances,

678
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,953
regrets over things you did…

679
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,357
You can't always hold on.
Sometimes, you must let go!

680
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,862
Forgetting is hard,

681
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,465
but making the effort
might actually be what sets you free.

682
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,638
Oguchi-sensei, Seira-sensei,

683
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,508
and Nishihata.

684
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,214
Just let it go, already!

685
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:05,689
What are you planning to do

686
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,759
about Urumi-sensei?

687
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:11,695
I can’t forgive her.

688
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,268
Shizuka Urumi drove Karen to her death.

689
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,136
Urumi-sensei?

690
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,239
How did that happen?

691
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,578
Karen was trying her best to live on.

692
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,217
Karen, are you doing okay?
How’s life at the dorm?

693
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,351
Hey,

694
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:38,255
you haven’t called lately.
At least try to stay in touch.

695
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,426
Hey, big sis.

696
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,330
You've raised me

697
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,400
ever since we were kids. Thank you.

698
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,970
Wait, why so sudden? It's creepy.

699
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,475
You would be sad if I was gone, right?

700
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,010
What?

701
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:05,215
You would be sad if I was gone, right?

702
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,117
Of course!

703
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,119
Don't be silly.

704
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,060
Then I won’t run away…

705
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,898
I'll try to hold on just a little longer.

706
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,069
Karen…

707
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,771
was being bullied at school.

708
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,676
She probably didn't want me to worry.

709
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,614
She hid it all from me…

710
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,384
She endured it and kept on living.

711
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:43,287
But still…

712
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,298
SEE BLOG

713
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:58,736
MESSAGE

714
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,837
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO DISCUSS WITH YOU

715
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,074
THEY ARE SPREADING FAKE RUMORS ABOUT ME

716
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,342
I HATE EVERYTHING.
BUT I SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY, RIGHT?

717
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,482
I THINK IT'S OKAY TO RUN AWAY

718
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,916
YOU SHOULD LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANT

719
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,786
THANK YOU…
GOOD BYE

720
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,688
I…

721
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:21,325
won't forgive Shizuka Urumi.

722
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,629
She is the reason Karen died.

723
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,868
I…

724
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:36,907
I can never forget it,
how much it hurt to lose her!

725
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,378
If you don’t let go,

726
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,149
you can never move forward.

727
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:51,021
Because of Shizuka Urumi, my sister died!

728
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,122
You have no right to be a teacher!

729
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,025
If I quit teaching, will you forgive me?
