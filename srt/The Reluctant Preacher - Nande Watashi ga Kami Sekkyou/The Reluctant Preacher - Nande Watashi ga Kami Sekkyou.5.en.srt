1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,474
Did Nanami really hit you?

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,175
He's on this list.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:11,111
He's a student this school
has no need for.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,381
I believe he did resort to violence.

5
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,282
Kaito is not that type of person.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,452
No one trusts someone
who's made a mistake.

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,790
He is your son,
whom you've lovingly raised for 16 years.

8
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,360
And now he's asking you to believe in him!

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,629
For security purposes,

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,564
this school has cameras everywhere.

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,666
Tell us the truth.

12
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,235
Kaito didn't do anything.

13
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,170
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:41,107
You knew about
the camera in the gym, right?

15
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,809
Oh, that was a lie.

16
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,246
There's no camera behind the gym.

17
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,281
I bluffed.

18
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,017
I'm surprised you could pull off

19
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,586
a trick like that on a student.

20
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,755
Or have you just been

21
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,991
pretending to be dumb?

22
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,195
You seem to know
the camera placements well.

23
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,431
Could it be…

24
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,331
SHIZUKA URUMI IS A MURDERER

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,935
…you were the one who

26
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,870
put up the posters?

27
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,377
What are you talking about?
Why would I do such a thing?

28
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,382
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,385
I was bluffing.

30
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,628
PUB

31
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,298
Me, putting up the posters?

32
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,133
Give me a break.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,434
That guy's trying to turn

34
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,671
the principal's supporters
against each other.

35
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,142
I've never thought of myself
as one of the principal's people,

36
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,812
but for now, I shouldn't deny it.

37
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,747
Wa… wait a second.

38
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,584
You think I did it?

39
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,353
Of course not.

40
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,889
But…

41
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,858
If it were true, what should I do?

42
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,061
Sometimes it's someone close.

43
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,598
Maybe his normal behavior is a cover?

44
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,166
Why are you staying quiet?

45
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,337
Why are you grinning?

46
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:19,639
Sorry.

47
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:24,711
I imagined you as the culprit,

48
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,981
and it was too ridiculous not to laugh.

49
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,787
Moriguchi-sensei said
you pretended to be dumb,

50
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,624
but I think you're not.

51
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,827
So basically, I'm really dumb?

52
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,295
No, that's not what I meant.

53
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,164
-You think I can handle complaints?
-Huh?

54
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,098
What's wrong?

55
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
This sucks!

56
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,371
Seira-sensei.

57
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,774
So much work, a few days off,

58
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,644
and the students and parents are annoying.

59
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,878
It's seriously exhausting.

60
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,047
You're just venting nonstop, huh?

61
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,249
-If my boyfriend doesn't listen…
-Boyfriend?

62
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,784
-I'm going to go crazy.
-Seems like it.

63
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,820
So she likes that type.

64
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:11,858
Also, none of the teachers there
are any good either.

65
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,026
That again?

66
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,095
Like the male teacher next door…

67
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,330
Urami-sensei, right?

68
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,700
Yes, his face is kind of cute,

69
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,637
but his thinking is
so old-fashioned and simple.

70
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,307
He's a goofball, but in a good way.

71
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:30,043
He's a bit intense.

72
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,644
Anyway,

73
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,880
gossiping is just a way to relieve stress.

74
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,915
She didn't mean it.

75
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,117
So don't worry about it.

76
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,086
Also…

77
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,955
-Shizuka-sensei, right?
-Yes.

78
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:46,459
At first, she seemed shy
and not open to students,

79
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:50,163
so I thought we could get along.

80
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,298
But she is actually the opposite.

81
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,901
She's an intense, fired-up teacher.

82
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,003
She butts in to student issues

83
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,539
without being asked and lectures everyone.

84
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,541
It's gross! I can't stand her!

85
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,210
We don't match!

86
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:06,212
Now she's badmouthing you.

87
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,848
-Can you ignore it?
-Why all these weird people around me?

88
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,717
Honestly,

89
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,852
I hope karma strikes her

90
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,520
-right about now.
-Jeez…

91
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,056
Knock it off already!

92
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,726
You've been nothing but complaints
since you became a teacher.

93
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:21,794
It's not fun being with you.

94
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,864
Sorry…

95
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,667
Let's break up.

96
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,537
I can't deal with you anymore, Seira.

97
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,081
Good morning.

98
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,450
There will be final exams in a month.

99
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,718
Decide the test content

100
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,321
and submit it by next week's meeting,
please.

101
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,856
-Yes.
-Okay.

102
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,792
Hayashi-sensei, are you listening?

103
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,994
Hayashi-sensei?

104
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,929
Oguchi-sensei,

105
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,299
Seira-sensei isn't feeling it today.

106
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,402
Yesterday, karma--

107
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,306
Shut up! What?

108
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,908
Nothing.

109
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,911
It wasn't nothing. Yesterday--

110
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,514
-Not another word, okay?
-Yes.

111
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,715
-Yes.
-Understood.

112
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,983
-Listen to me.
-Yes.

113
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,952
That face is crazy!

114
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,587
What do you mean?

115
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,890
-That's how it is.
-Really?

116
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,359
Rude? Well, yes, it's rude.

117
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,328
You and Hina…

118
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,264
were speaking up for me, right?

119
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,399
Thanks.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,435
It's fine…

121
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,674
Let's go karaoke later. It's been a while.

122
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,209
What?

123
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,352
You too, Iroha.

124
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,854
Me too?

125
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,661
Let's go.

126
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,037
Urumi-sensei.

127
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,572
Can I have a moment?

128
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:14,841
Yes.

129
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:22,181
This is a souvenir from my trip.
I got you the best one.

130
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,717
For the other teachers, look!

131
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,019
Only one manju.

132
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,088
Don't tell anyone, okay?
I'm playing favorites.

133
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,556
Then, I shouldn't get this…

134
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,725
-It's a celebration.
-Celebration?

135
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,596
A celebration for saving Nanami
from Moriguchi-sensei.

136
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,598
That wasn't just me--

137
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,032
I'm so happy!

138
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,802
You used to be so passive about teaching,

139
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,604
but now you're so motivated.

140
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,938
I'm not really motivated...

141
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,775
Well, well…

142
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,882
Sensei.

143
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,317
Can we talk?

144
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,155
What happened?

145
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,424
Hina-chan and the others
invited me to karaoke today.

146
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:08,027
Looks like a setup.
Are they bullying you again?

147
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,063
No, nothing like that.

148
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,965
They just invited me normally.

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,902
I just played it cool

150
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,703
and be, like, "Fine," but honestly,

151
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,572
I'm really happy.

152
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,641
I see.

153
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,243
That's great.

154
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,180
It's all thanks to you. Thanks.

155
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,727
She laughed.

156
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,465
Being appreciated by students.

157
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,900
Doesn't it increase your motivation?

158
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,214
Being appreciated by students.

159
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,094
SHARE WITH ITSUKI

160
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,196
SHARE

161
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,000
You two!

162
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,569
-Are you students here?
-Kumi…

163
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:26,772
What's this?

164
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,942
-You were dating…
-I said it…

165
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,110
Wait a minute!

166
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,278
-This is crazy!
-Crazy!

167
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,179
PHOTO RECEIVED

168
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,314
Hey, look at this!

169
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,215
What?

170
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:38,484
-Crazy! What is this?
-Isn't it crazy?

171
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,453
KARAOKE

172
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:53,900
So much fun!

173
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,470
-Next…
-What should we do?

174
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,473
-What…
-Hina, look at this.

175
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:02,441
What?

176
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,045
Yesterday after school,

177
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,481
an intruder entered the campus

178
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,183
and randomly shared a photo

179
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,619
with all the students' smartphones.

180
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,255
It shows 11 current second-years

181
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:20,226
and two former female students
who were expelled last year,

182
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:24,463
smoking in a karaoke box.

183
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,335
We will now conduct
an internal fact-finding investigation.

184
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,003
Fact-finding investigation?

185
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,705
First, I, along with Oguchi-sensei,

186
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,174
the second-year head teacher,

187
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,878
Moriguchi-sensei,
the chair of the School Reform Committee,

188
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,980
and Hayashi-sensei,

189
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,317
will interview the 11 students involved.

190
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:47,820
The metadata from the photos

191
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,323
confirms it was taken last year.

192
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:54,894
At that time, all 13 students pictured

193
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,364
were in Class 1-8.

194
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,132
Their homeroom teacher

195
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,268
at that time was Hayashi-sensei.

196
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,170
Also…

197
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,808
the principal
will not be involved in this case.

198
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,943
If the principal steps in,

199
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,245
it would complicate the matter.

200
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,214
Are you fine with this, Principal?

201
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,516
It's…

202
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,552
the board's decision.

203
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,290
It seems someone is

204
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,827
getting help from their uncle
to silence me.

205
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:31,631
But I will still do all I can.

206
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,003
So please, everyone,

207
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,273
please refrain from unnecessary actions.

208
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,710
It's not good…

209
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,412
That photo... Will we be okay?

210
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,548
Just that photo alone

211
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,817
isn't enough proof that we smoked.

212
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,926
Now, let's start homeroom.

213
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,161
Sensei.

214
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,131
What's happening with that photo?

215
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,265
Photo?

216
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,334
The smoking photo.

217
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,671
That's none of your business.

218
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,373
It's not like it
concerns me directly, but…

219
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,410
Keita got expelled for compensated dating,

220
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,912
and Kaito hit Tazawa

221
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,480
and nearly got expelled.

222
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,382
I just wonder what'll happen next.

223
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,786
The investigation is still ongoing.

224
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,154
Everything depends on that.

225
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,855
Why an investigation?

226
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,525
Hina and her group didn't smoke, right?

227
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,126
We didn't.

228
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,461
Hey, what's with your tone?

229
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,930
Sounds like you actually did it.

230
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,901
Of course, I believe you.

231
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:45,204
Sorry. Honestly, I don't.

232
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,040
But Mai's mom's the PTA President, right?

233
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,743
If she speaks up,
you probably won't get expelled.

234
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,811
Well…

235
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,747
I didn't even smoke!

236
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,250
Among the students in the photo,

237
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:02,455
six are on Moriguchi's expulsion list.

238
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,924
The other five are not.

239
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,126
What is Moriguchi planning to do?

240
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,995
Expel the six students

241
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,530
and not the remaining five.

242
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,467
How can they do that?
That's discriminatory!

243
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,802
Exactly. It is supposed to be impossible.

244
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,637
We punish everyone equally,

245
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,406
or the parents won't accept it.

246
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,509
So… you mean we have to expel everyone?

247
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,844
No.

248
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,580
Among the 11 students, one is Kobayakawa.

249
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,515
Is it because Kobayakawa's mother

250
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,484
is the PTA president?

251
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,585
That too.

252
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,888
Also, the Kobayakawa family
has been in this area for a long time.

253
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,858
They have supported the school
since it was founded.

254
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,227
They still donate huge sums.

255
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,263
The board won't go against them.

256
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,899
So expulsion isn't happening.

257
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,268
What will they plan to do?

258
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,403
Moriguchi-sensei must be thinking hard

259
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,739
about how to handle this.

260
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,074
Well…

261
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,378
Besides, us pro-principal teachers
have already been pushed aside.

262
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,483
You just said you're pro-principal!
I'm so happy!

263
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,486
You finally admitted it.

264
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,420
Principal!

265
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,590
Let's make a team name to celebrate.

266
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,727
How about "Team Kyoko"?

267
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,828
That's so lame.

268
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,736
Anyway, we can't act for now,

269
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,372
so let's keep an eye on Moriguchi-sensei.

270
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,075
THE TEACHERS ALREADY KNOW.
NOT GOOD.

271
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,811
WE DIDN'T SMOKE.
ONLY KUMI AND CHIAKI DID.

272
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:40,286
Naito, Watanuki, Ota, and Kobayakawa,

273
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,254
may we have a word with you?

274
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,357
Yes, sensei.

275
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,258
TOTAL INTEGRITY

276
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,094
We finished interviewing all 11 students.

277
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,097
They admitted the photo was taken

278
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,300
after last year's culture festival

279
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,636
at a karaoke after-party.

280
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,539
What about the smoking?

281
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,309
As for the smoking, they all denied it.

282
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,880
They claimed the cigarettes were bought by

283
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,615
Kumi Matsumoto and Chiaki Iwai

284
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,450
who were expelled last year.

285
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,786
They also said only those two smoked.

286
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:18,424
Well…

287
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,294
They probably
just coordinated their stories.

288
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,132
As long as Mai Kobayakawa is involved,
expulsion isn't an option.

289
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,869
So we will conclude
that no smoking occurred?

290
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,770
Shall we close the matter with that?

291
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,106
Hayashi-sensei,

292
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,309
what kind of students

293
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,247
were Kumi Matsumoto and Chiaki Iwai,
formally from Class 1-8?

294
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,651
They were disruptive in class,

295
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,519
and smoked on campus.

296
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,054
I couldn't do anything about them.

297
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,491
Please give me their record.

298
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,993
What are you planning to do?

299
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,733
There's something I'd like to discuss.

300
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,701
Could I have a moment of your time?

301
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,471
Yes.

302
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,806
It's about…

303
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,775
Kai Moriguchi-sensei.

304
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,625
What are you doing?

305
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,129
I was just zoning out.

306
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,940
What will happen to the 11 students
in the photo?

307
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,643
Well…

308
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:46,712
I don't know.

309
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,015
Are you not worried?

310
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,786
I'm not interested in the students.

311
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,489
Getting involved only causes trouble.

312
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,226
I thought
you were that kind of teacher too.

313
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,296
I thought so myself.

314
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,866
Why do you get so worked up over students?

315
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,436
Why…

316
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,304
Why, I wonder?

317
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,575
I don't even want to get involved
with the students now.

318
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:20,646
I could never give lectures like you do.

319
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,449
I don't really want to do it.

320
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,485
Even thinking up lectures is a pain.

321
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,253
But…

322
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,290
It's all thanks to you. Thanks.

323
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,661
Was it my motivation?

324
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,832
It's nothing.

325
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,569
Anyway, for now,

326
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,672
I have other things to worry about.

327
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,950
INCOMING CALL
AIKA SUZUKI

328
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:02,621
See you.

329
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,794
You two. Once we're done today,
why don't we get dinner?

330
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,630
Sorry, I'm not in the mood.

331
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,666
I know you're feeling down
after the breakup, but…

332
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,703
How do you know about that?

333
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,239
Shizuka-sensei and I were at the bar

334
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,141
where you were dumped.

335
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:24,476
We overheard everything.

336
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,112
Did you really have to say it all?

337
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,948
I understand you're hurting,
but you're a teacher.

338
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,918
You shouldn't face students in that state.

339
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,354
I can't give you your relationship back,

340
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,722
but I can listen.

341
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,991
I told you before.

342
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,392
There's no point asking someone

343
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,329
simple-minded like you
for relationship advice.

344
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,131
Just leave me alone!

345
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,938
He always said I only complain
whenever we meet.

346
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,307
But it's not my fault!

347
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:58,510
I just wanted to tell him about work,

348
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,879
and it happened to be a complaint.

349
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,816
If he hated that,
he should've told me from the start.

350
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,251
I would've been more careful not to.

351
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,354
You can't expect me to just understand
with no warning.

352
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,690
Isn't that unfair?

353
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,594
I can't fix it now.

354
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,630
In the end, she just wanted
someone, anyone

355
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,667
to hear her out after getting dumped.

356
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,136
It could be anyone.

357
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,940
Even if it was someone she normally
mocks for being simple-minded.

358
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,142
I know you're miserable.

359
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,246
But there are people
who are even worse off.

360
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:38,517
Like someone
whose house was robbed last night.

361
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:41,553
If that's all you can say,

362
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,922
don't even offer to listen.

363
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,392
If you think about it,
it's not a big deal.

364
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,994
Cheer up!

365
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,598
-She got better!
-Yes, right.

366
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,867
-Why?
-What do you mean "why"?

367
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,568
Don't you understand?

368
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,407
-Have you ever dated anyone?
-I have.

369
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,710
With the terrible advice you just gave,

370
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,879
I can't believe you ever dated anyone.

371
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,148
Urami?

372
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,651
Aika-sensei?

373
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,219
Aika-sensei?

374
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,221
Why are you here?

375
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:17,189
I called her.

376
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,559
I thought she could cheer you up.

377
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,263
Aika-sensei! I wanted to see you!

378
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,498
We met before, right?

379
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,434
Yes, at the arcade…

380
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,537
Thank you very much.

381
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:35,941
I don't remember at all.

382
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,378
She used to be the homeroom teacher
for Class 2-10 before you,

383
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,445
Aika Suzuki.

384
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,148
Thanks for taking care

385
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,717
-of Class 2–10.
-You're welcome.

386
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:48,453
I heard you weren't feeling well.

387
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,588
Yes.

388
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,557
Are you okay now?

389
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,092
I'm a bit better.

390
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,194
Have a seat.

391
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,930
-Next to me.
-Okay.

392
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,966
Today she contacted me by chance,

393
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,368
I mentioned Seira-sensei,
and she wanted to meet up.

394
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,205
Aika-sensei!

395
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,673
Are you okay?

396
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,575
I'm not okay.

397
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,276
Still the same as ever, huh?

398
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,715
-Also… I wanted to meet you.
-Me?

399
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,952
Teaching 2-10 must be tough.
We have such unique students.

400
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,156
-It's more than tough.
-Let's drink!

401
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,290
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

402
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,160
Aika-sensei hasn't ordered yet.

403
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,462
-Oh, that's right.
-So narrow-minded.

404
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,733
Every day is exhausting.

405
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,703
Then I vented to my boyfriend
and got dumped.

406
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,873
I just hate everything!

407
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,875
I see.

408
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,911
There are times like that.

409
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,581
But…

410
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,553
when you're truly hurting,
I think it's okay to run away.

411
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,791
Enduring everything isn't always right.

412
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,928
If it sucks, say it.
If things are tough, say they are.

413
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:08,033
You only live once so do what you want.

414
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,369
Yes!

415
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:15,073
You really saved me, Aika-sensei.

416
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,475
That's great.

417
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,057
SEE BLOG

418
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,592
NEW MESSAGE

419
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,530
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN

420
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,831
FEBRUARY 15, 2023 8:16 P.M.
PLEASE HELP ME

421
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,234
I'M BEING BULLIED…

422
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,703
EVERY DAY IS HELL

423
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,974
I CAN'T SAY I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
SHOULD WE THINK THIS TOGETHER?

424
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,375
I HATE EVERYTHING.
BUT I SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY RIGHT?

425
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,411
NOT TRUE. I THINK IT'S OKAY TO RUN.
YOU SHOULD LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY YOU WANT

426
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,446
THANK YOU. RUNNING AWAY…
YOU SAVED ME. GOODBYE.

427
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,549
I THINK IT'S OKAY TO RUN AWAY.

428
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,890
THANK YOU… GOODBYE.

429
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,065
KARAOKE

430
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,833
Why did we do it?

431
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,202
It just seemed funny, so we did it.

432
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,503
You want to complain?

433
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,806
We dropped out anyway.
What else do you want?

434
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:21,707
Right?

435
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,011
Even so, I'm not here to accuse you.

436
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,913
Our students said

437
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,783
the only students smoking were you two.

438
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,485
Everyone else said they didn't smoke.

439
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,354
Huh? Seriously?

440
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,922
Everyone was smoking, right?

441
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,324
Is that really true?

442
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,425
Look.

443
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,996
Just do it. One wouldn't hurt.

444
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,466
-What?
-Seriously?

445
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,235
-It's okay.
-Yes.

446
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,070
-Here.
-It's okay.

447
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,919
This is…

448
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,254
As you can see,

449
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,357
it's a video of all of them smoking.

450
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:19,831
Moriguchi-sensei met with Kumi Matsumoto
and Chiaki Iwai,

451
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,900
who were expelled.

452
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:26,405
Well, it's obvious those two are the ones
who spread the photos.

453
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,707
I questioned them.

454
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,608
So…

455
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,344
when Oguchi-sensei

456
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,913
showed this video to all 11 students,

457
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,749
they all admitted to smoking.

458
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,420
Huh?

459
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,190
You said you would do everything, right?

460
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,525
Is it age?

461
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,162
Your moves are too slow.

462
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:56,101
So, what do you intend to do?

463
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,673
Since they admitted it,

464
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:05,777
we'll advise them to voluntarily withdraw.

465
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,213
All 11 of them?

466
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,616
Admitting to smoking is one thing,

467
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,752
but conspiring to deceive teachers.

468
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,321
We can't allow such disgraceful behavior.

469
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:19,357
Mai Kobayakawa is the daughter
of the PTA president.

470
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,827
Even so, you intend to do it?

471
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:23,995
Principal, are you saying we should

472
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,764
judge students by their parents?

473
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,534
Don't lecture me.

474
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,804
I've arranged a meeting with PTA

475
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,773
tomorrow, to explain the situation.

476
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:39,778
We'll explain everything,
and seek their approval.

477
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:42,581
We'll equally punish those

478
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,952
who committed a crime and deceived us.

479
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:49,888
As an adult,

480
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:51,957
isn't it the natural thing to do?

481
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:55,994
I'm afraid,

482
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:59,130
Moriguchi-sensei must have a plan.

483
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,733
He wouldn't openly go against the PTA.

484
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,803
What is he planning?

485
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,005
Where's Hayashi-sensei?

486
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,708
I believe she is currently
discussing tomorrow's meeting

487
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:12,377
with Oguchi-sensei and Moriguchi-sensei.

488
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,379
We should find out

489
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,715
what they talked about.

490
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,186
Oguchi-sensei and Hayashi-sensei.

491
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,488
I have a request for you two.

492
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,224
When you

493
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,261
questioned the 11 students,

494
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,632
some showed no remorse and lied

495
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,635
about not smoking,

496
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,272
while others were regretful
and admitted their guilt.

497
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:44,042
Please report this
to the PTA board tomorrow.

498
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,847
Of course, the six on the expulsion list

499
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,250
showed no remorse.

500
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,218
NO REMORSE

501
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:57,255
The five not listed did show remorse.

502
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:58,557
SHOWED REMORSE

503
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:02,127
We'll present two options:

504
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,663
Expel all 11 students,

505
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,400
or allow five students to remain

506
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,368
and expel the six on the list.

507
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,038
Naturally, they'll choose the latter.

508
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:19,411
This way, only the students on the list
will be expelled.

509
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:24,215
However, the expelled students
and their parents will object.

510
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,183
TOTAL INTEGRITY

511
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,851
But once the PTA decides,

512
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,020
it represents their collective will.

513
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,189
A decision by the school and PTA

514
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,627
can't be overturned, no matter what
the six students or their parents say.

515
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:37,462
In this world,

516
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,333
decisions are driven
by the will of a powerful few.

517
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,336
The same is true
for society and for schools.

518
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:50,542
Therefore, Hayashi-sensei,
please refrain from contacting

519
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,378
the Principal, Urami-sensei
and Urumi-sensei

520
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:55,213
until the meeting concludes.

521
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:01,086
Wouldn't want her sermons
to ruin my plans again.

522
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,323
Right, Oguchi-sensei?

523
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,629
Are you really okay, doing this?

524
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,832
As a teacher, this seems excessive.

525
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,142
If Moriguchi-sensei
becomes chairman next year,

526
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,443
I'd become principal.

527
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,612
He promised me that.

528
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:29,381
I have no choice

529
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,316
but to obey him.

530
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,754
If you don't like it, that's fine.

531
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,189
If you hate it that much,

532
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,425
then just leave me alone.

533
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,906
I'd love to hand you a handkerchief
to wipe away your tears.

534
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,309
But, I forgot my handkerchief.

535
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,046
But…

536
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,382
I had this…

537
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,084
in my pocket.

538
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,854
Here, take it.

539
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,097
Seira-sensei.

540
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:23,468
Is Moriguchi-sensei
really going to expel all 11?

541
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,303
Sorry.

542
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,640
I've been told not to talk
to you until tomorrow.

543
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,509
Sorry.

544
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,989
This isn't the time to be at a pub.

545
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,626
Sitting around
sulking won't solve anything.

546
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,996
You'll get better ideas by drinking
at a pub.

547
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,766
You're drinking cola though, right?

548
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,070
One more cola!

549
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,842
Lately, I've been drinking with you a lot.

550
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,010
That's true. How many days?

551
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,179
Three times in a row, even.

552
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:10,448
People might get the wrong idea.

553
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,083
Huh? Wrong idea?

554
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,053
Well, what I mean is...

555
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,858
Never mind.

556
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,497
Instead of drinking with me,

557
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,633
you should get a girlfriend
and drink with her.

558
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,235
-I have one.
-Oh.

559
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,571
You've never dated anyone before, huh?

560
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,740
-I'm sorry.
-I have.

561
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,910
I have a girlfriend.

562
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,312
She's coming now.

563
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:44,182
Good evening.

564
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,219
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

565
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,656
Actually, my girlfriend is Aika-sensei.

566
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,794
We've been dating
for about three years now.

567
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,964
Oh, then…

568
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,535
So you two were dating
within the workplace?

569
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,435
Pretty much.

570
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,938
What is it?

571
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,275
Relationships between teachers
at the same school…

572
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,744
It's kinda sexy.

573
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,980
No, let's stop these fantasies.

574
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:21,019
Wait, so…

575
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,024
have you two ever kissed at school?

576
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,298
Here is your cola.

577
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,066
Thanks.

578
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,339
What am I even asking?

579
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,575
I panicked and ran my mouth.

580
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:46,978
After two years of shutting myself in,
I don't know how to act around people.

581
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:50,181
I don't know what to talk about…

582
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,050
We never did anything like that at school.

583
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,353
You're actually answering. I'm so sorry.

584
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,656
We kept our relationship
a secret at school.

585
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:02,060
But now that Aika isn't at the school,
it's probably fine.

586
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,462
Sorry,

587
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,365
I've been interrupting
your drinking parties two days in a row.

588
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,800
No, not at all.

589
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,871
When I contacted Urami,
he said he was here with you.

590
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,074
Wait…

591
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,777
Could it be that she's jealous?

592
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,313
We went drinking so often.

593
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,182
Urami-sensei didn't even notice

594
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,151
that she was jealous,
and probably told her everything.

595
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,152
If that's the case,

596
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:32,390
I see now why she's here
to let me know she's his girlfriend.

597
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,025
Oh no!

598
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,661
-In front of everyone…
-Um…

599
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,599
-I'm going home.
-What's wrong? Why so sudden?

600
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:47,171
I just thought… I shouldn't be here.

601
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,575
Since you two finally get

602
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,810
to spend some time alone.

603
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,747
No, you really don't need
to worry about that.

604
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,883
Actually, you should worry a little more.

605
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,184
-Huh?
-Huh?

606
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,085
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

607
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,855
-I'll be leaving.
-Thank you for your hard work.

608
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,170
-Principal.
-Oguchi-sensei.

609
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:22,307
I heard from Urami-sensei.

610
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,676
That you helped save Nanami.

611
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,079
Tell me,

612
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,382
what are you trying to do?

613
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,422
What are you trying to find out?

614
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,362
For a principal, you sure act shady.

615
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:48,933
If you have something to ask,
just ask me directly.

616
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,569
Even if you do,
I doubt you'd tell the truth.

617
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,342
If you're not eating that, can I have it?

618
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:03,414
The principal's souvenirs are pretty good.

619
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,019
Yum.

620
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:16,461
As thanks, I'll tell you
what I'm planning, Principal.

621
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,398
Not that there's much you can do

622
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,900
to stop it now…

623
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,207
Didn't I tell you I was drinking
with Shizuka-sensei the other day?

624
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,842
-No, you didn't.
-What?

625
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:31,943
Um…

626
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:36,347
I really think I should be going.

627
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,550
You two can have your time alone.

628
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,419
I'm leaving.

629
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,024
INCOMING CALL
KYOKO

630
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,327
Hello?

631
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:54,298
Expel six and keep five?

632
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:58,603
You can't punish
the same crime differently!

633
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,204
What is he thinking?

634
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,539
What are you going to do?

635
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,241
We have no choice.

636
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:06,511
We'll crash the meeting with the PTA board

637
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:10,114
and expose all of Moriguchi's plans.

638
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,749
We'll shove that list in their faces

639
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,218
and show them how many students
he's trying to expel.

640
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:18,856
But even if we want to crash it,
we can't get in.

641
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:24,395
They've set up a meeting off campus,
so we can't interfere

642
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,999
like last time.

643
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:33,404
-Damn it!
-I think Moriguchi-sensei showed his hand.

644
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,306
Let's ask Seira-sensei.

645
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,308
If she helps us…

646
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,178
She refuses to speak to us.

647
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,915
Will she even help us?

648
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,158
Aika-sensei.

649
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,661
Sorry for calling you so late.

650
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:57,562
What's going on?

651
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,270
I asked Aika to bring you here.

652
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,239
What for?

653
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:13,311
I want you to expose Moriguchi's plot
to the PTA board tomorrow.

654
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,215
There's no way I can do that!

655
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,884
If you're going to do it,
do it yourselves!

656
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,719
Please! You're the only one who can.

657
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,187
No way!

658
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,657
I just can't right now.

659
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,260
Is it because you were dumped?

660
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:35,133
When you say it that way, it sounds cheap.

661
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,135
To me, it was serious.

662
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,705
It's not like I became a teacher
because I wanted to.

663
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,476
Anyway, I have no motivation as a teacher!

664
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,147
But I can't just quit either,

665
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,350
because I need the income.

666
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,954
So even if it's unfair,
I just follow orders.

667
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,022
It's easier that way.

668
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,758
You don't care
what happens to the students?

669
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,961
It's true that

670
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:07,131
I used to think about it,

671
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,399
like you guys.

672
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,702
I used to struggle
with how distant I was from them.

673
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,007
But the other day, Aika once said…

674
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:20,678
If it gets too hard,
it's okay to just run away.

675
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,549
It helped me breathe again.

676
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:28,352
My life isn't just for the students.

677
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,188
I just want my life to hurt less.

678
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,326
I can tell you are sincere.

679
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,032
Please.

680
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,568
Just leave me alone.

681
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,709
BUT I SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY, RIGHT?

682
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,412
I THINK IT'S OKAY TO RUN AWAY.

683
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,563
IT'S MOST FOOLISH FOR AN EDUCATOR.
IT'S DISCRIMINATION.

684
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,564
STUDENTS WHO COMMITED THE SAME OFFENSE…

685
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:23,474
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

686
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,715
Shizuka-sensei.

687
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,421
Do you need something again?

688
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,023
Just once more.

689
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,059
Listen to me.

690
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:45,830
SCIENCE PREP ROOM

691
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:46,831
What is it?

692
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,902
I remembered the regrets
I had from the past.

693
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,276
Are you trying to lecture me?

694
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,444
I'm a teacher, you know.

695
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:05,783
Someone who says they have no motivation
shouldn't act all high and mighty.

696
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,787
What's with that attitude?

697
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,090
Sure, I lack motivation.

698
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,059
But as an employee of Meishin,

699
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,061
I'm doing what the higher-ups ask of me.

700
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,195
Isn't that enough?

701
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,899
What if the higher-ups are wrong?
Will you obey without complaint?

702
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,701
Without questioning anything?

703
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:31,008
What Moriguchi-sensei is trying to do
is most foolish, for an educator.

704
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,611
Most foolish?

705
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,447
It's discrimination.

706
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,018
Punishing some students
while letting others stay,

707
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:45,089
even though they committed
the same offense.

708
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,492
if that's not discrimination, what is?

709
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,166
Discrimination

710
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,370
is the vilest act.

711
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,873
He's about to do that to the students.

712
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,242
And you don't even oppose it.
You just go along with it.

713
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,745
Stop pretending to be a teacher.

714
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,449
You say that, but...

715
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,752
It's not like I'm doing this
because I want to.

716
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,789
It's a pain to just argue
over small stuff.

717
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,860
I told you before…

718
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,429
I want to run away because it's hard!

719
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,733
Why can't I live my life however I want?

720
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,502
"Run if it gets too hard"
is meant for people

721
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,240
who've fought and struggled
and still couldn't make it.

722
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:43,414
It's a last resort for those
who have given their all.

723
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:48,986
It's not an excuse for people like you,

724
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,856
who avoid things
because they're troublesome.

725
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,993
You don't use it as an excuse
to escape reality!

726
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,762
I'm not cut out…

727
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,064
to be a teacher!

728
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,199
Cut out for it or not,

729
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,604
have you ever faced your job head-on?

730
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:14,245
Please…

731
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,813
Just once!

732
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,382
Try confronting it, with all your heart.

733
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,919
You'll never know
if it's fulfilling or right for you

734
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:23,888
unless you give it your all.

735
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,459
Teaching is about human connections.

736
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,763
Unless you face them sincerely,
they won't open up to you.

737
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:38,936
Of course, things won't
always go your way.

738
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,473
It's all thanks to you. Thanks.

739
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:50,614
Hearing that can give you
more motivation than you can imagine.

740
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:00,624
What are you doing here?

741
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,527
The principal and Moriguchi-sensei
are calling for you.

742
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:11,969
Sensei.

743
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,639
Are we going to be okay?

744
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:18,342
I…

745
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,311
Are we going to be expelled?

746
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,280
I don't know right now.

747
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:28,385
Sorry for causing you two trouble.

748
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,191
It's not just me.

749
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,962
Me, Hina-chan, Mai-chan, Riko-chan…

750
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,998
We don't know what to do anymore.

751
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,133
We're in trouble.

752
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,071
Please help us.

753
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,921
46TH PTA BOARD

754
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,892
Thank you all for gathering here today.

755
00:42:10,761 --> 00:42:14,465
Recently, photos were distributed
around the school,

756
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:20,971
claiming to show
11 second-year students smoking.

757
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:25,776
Now, Hayashi-sensei,
who was their homeroom teacher last year,

758
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,379
will present the investigation findings.

759
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,347
Please go ahead.

760
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,149
Yes.

761
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,291
Regarding these photos…

762
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:50,167
-Well…
-What's wrong?

763
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,344
Before…

764
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,881
we address the matter of the photographs,

765
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,817
there's something I want to say
to the parents here.

766
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,322
-What's going on, Hayashi-sensei?
-This school

767
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,158
is trying to expel
a specific group of students.

768
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,061
To rebuild the school's reputation,

769
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,664
they want to expel students
from "problematic" families.

770
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,934
Among the 11 students shown in the photos,

771
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,570
six are on a mandatory expulsion list.

772
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,673
Only five will be allowed to stay.
It's a discriminatory act.

773
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,241
-Stop it!
-I won't!

774
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:33,143
This school is completely wrong!

775
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:38,449
Parents, this kind of injustice
should never be allowed!

776
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:42,953
Hayashi-sensei,

777
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:45,522
please calm down.

778
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,394
I don't want to upset you, but…

779
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,730
We…

780
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,331
already know.

781
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,904
And the PTA board

782
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:04,008
supports the school's plan.

783
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:06,844
Why?

784
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,583
Because that's how

785
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,685
Meishin Academy
can become a better school.

786
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,792
It seems humans and human society

787
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,994
run on a logic different
from right and wrong.

788
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,196
So what is that "different logic"?

789
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,642
Shizuka Urumi is a murderer.

790
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,448
That's the truth, isn't it?

791
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:48,452
Karen…

792
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,089
I’m not going to let things go your way!

793
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,958
-Dammit!
-I’m going to shut him down!
