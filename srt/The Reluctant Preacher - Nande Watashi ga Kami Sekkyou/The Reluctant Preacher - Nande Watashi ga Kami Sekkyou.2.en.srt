1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,374
Starting today,
I'll be in charge of class 2-10.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,942
My name is Shizuka Urumi.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,911
<i>All of a sudden, I'm a</i>
<i>high school teacher. It's too much!</i>

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:13,713
Let's dance together, Sensei!

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,317
<i>They're definitely walking all over me…</i>

6
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,852
You're always looking down.

7
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:19,986
Shut it, brat.

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,721
What's so fun about bullying someone?

9
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:22,989
<i>Oh, no! I said it…</i>

10
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,724
Apologize to me in front of everyone!

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,359
<i>I won't apologize to Watanuki.</i>

12
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,462
Then, scold her properly.

13
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:32,232
Why do I have to lecture her?

14
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,433
What do I gain from it?

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,503
You're an adult.
Don't expect others to clean up your mess!

16
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,271
BULLYING AND TEASING ARE THE SAME!

17
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,306
Bullying and teasing are the same.

18
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,643
Don't call it "teasing" so lightly
when you don't even know how others feel!

19
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,745
People like that eventually lose

20
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:47,781
something important.

21
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,990
What do you think you're doing?

22
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,093
I told you to apologize.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,197
If anything happens,
you'll be held responsible.

24
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:07,634
So please, be prepared for that.

25
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,335
TOTAL INTEGRITY

26
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,071
I'm sorry…

27
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,210
Trying your best is great and all,

28
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,648
but if you cause trouble
for the vice principal,

29
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,184
I won't forgive you.

30
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,560
Urumi-sensei!

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,929
Are you okay?

32
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,299
Thank you…

33
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,104
<i>I'm just so tired of everything…</i>

34
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,940
<i>Maybe I really…</i>

35
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,175
No!

36
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,944
I haven't even said anything yet.

37
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,280
You were about to say you want
to quit teaching, weren't you?

38
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,351
You've only been a teacher
for two days, haven't you?

39
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,522
And you think you can already decide
whether you're cut out for it or not?

40
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,891
Even Shohei Ohtani wouldn't know

41
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,828
if baseball suited him after two days.

42
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,364
Well, I don't really know.

43
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,533
Wait, why did you come to my home,
Kyoko-san?

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,769
Because I figured
you might say something like that.

45
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,404
Here you go!

46
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,473
Wow, looks delicious!

47
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,041
Here.

48
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,178
So delicious!

49
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,580
You just came to eat my mom's food,
didn't you?

50
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,817
That too.
Kanoko's cooking is amazing!

51
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,753
You gave a pretty
impressive speech, Shizuka?

52
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,355
It wasn't anything impressive.

53
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,024
You reminded me
of how you were two years ago.

54
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:39,459
Back then,

55
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:43,029
if someone said even a little thing,
Shizuka would fire back full force.

56
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,899
Anyway,

57
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:50,403
if you can give a lecture like that,
you can be a teacher. So don't worry.

58
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,473
But like the vice principal said,

59
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,141
If something does happen--

60
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,609
It'll be fine.

61
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,312
I'm sure… nothing will happen.

62
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,517
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

63
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,294
Morning.

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,862
-Morning.
-Morning.

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,734
Morning.

66
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,403
Don't do anything lame.

67
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,841
-Morning.
-Morning.

68
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,643
What are you doing after school today?

69
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,844
Today?

70
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,847
-Today…
-Morning, Rintaro.

71
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,782
Morning.

72
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,785
You stayed up late again, didn't you?

73
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,119
Yes, super late.

74
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,688
You replied super late.

75
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,822
Sorry.

76
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,292
<i>It's okay.</i>

77
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,329
I'm sure… nothing will happen.

78
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,680
We're starting morning homeroom.

79
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:12,652
Nothing happened?

80
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,553
ACAI BOWL

81
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,954
It's been a week since then…

82
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,124
I thought the students
would be more defiant toward me.

83
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,559
But honestly,

84
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,963
I was even worried Watanuki's parents
would storm into the school.

85
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,968
Maybe they just thought you were annoying
and started avoiding you?

86
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,069
Annoying?

87
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,838
It's also possible that your words

88
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,440
actually reached them.

89
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,277
No one else at this school would

90
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,878
say something like that.

91
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,983
Yamaguchi, you got this! Hang in there!

92
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,621
Listen, falling in love is a great thing.

93
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,889
Do your best!

94
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,759
-Yes. Just contact him already.
-Okay.

95
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,495
If anything happens, just let me know.
See you!

96
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,496
-Thank you!
-See you.

97
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,466
Well, even if it goes wrong,
you still have us.

98
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,101
Thanks.

99
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:04,370
Another love consultation?

100
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,305
Sort of.

101
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,373
Urami-sensei

102
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,876
often gets girls asking him for
love advice.

103
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,778
-Huh?
-Huh?

104
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,479
Why are you so surprised?

105
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,014
Ah, sorry.

106
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,449
Are you good at giving advice?

107
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,151
Not really.

108
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:21,354
I don't get it either!
Why are you asking me?

109
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,657
You're more approachable

110
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,659
than other teachers.

111
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,062
Approachable, huh?

112
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,132
Still, why don't they realize there's
no point asking a simple-minded guy

113
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,734
like Urami-sensei?

114
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,769
Who are you calling simple-minded?

115
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,771
Most of the time, people just want

116
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,740
someone to listen.

117
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,242
They're not after the right answer.

118
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,146
So a simple mind is just right.

119
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,882
-I see.
-He wasn't complimenting you.

120
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,417
Oh, really?

121
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:56,422
Even though you're always gaming,

122
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,458
Moriguchi-sensei, you still notice things.

123
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,228
You're blushing!

124
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,466
Just be careful.

125
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:10,136
Love gets messy when outsiders butt in.

126
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,038
You'll get caught in the drama.

127
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,907
True.

128
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,449
You want to go to the arcade?

129
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,184
Wasn't it patrol duty tonight?

130
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,285
-Seriously?
-Yes.

131
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,521
It's fine if no one finds out.

132
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,589
Right, Rintaro?

133
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,324
Oh, I'll pass.

134
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,392
Why?

135
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,360
Does it matter?

136
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,263
Whoa! You're going out on a date!

137
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,565
-A date!
-Shut up!

138
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,034
You've been with her since middle school.

139
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,636
You two are close, huh?

140
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,205
Well… Don't tell anyone about the date.

141
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,410
<i>Sensei, are you a SEE?</i>

142
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,948
SEE?

143
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,484
What do you mean, SEE?

144
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,154
You don't know?

145
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,724
I don't.

146
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,594
Then…

147
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,802
What is the night patrol?

148
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,072
Twice a month, teachers patrol

149
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,408
the downtown area after school.

150
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:24,310
For what reason?

151
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,214
Moriguchi-sensei mentioned it before,

152
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,251
but our school used to be super-strict.

153
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:36,189
That scared applicants off,
so they loosened the rules.

154
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,557
Now, they've lowered the standards

155
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,660
and boosted enrollment.

156
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:43,563
That's why there are
ten classes per grade.

157
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,899
But that led to more problematic students.

158
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,268
Don't call them that.

159
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,471
Still, our students…

160
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,072
-Mine! Mine!
-No, it's mine!

161
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,074
I got it too!

162
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,975
Oh wow!

163
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,078
<i>…have a terrible reputation among</i>
<i>the locals, due to poor behavior.</i>

164
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,048
I'm taking a video! It's rolling! Great!

165
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,086
Patrol duty sucks!

166
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,689
Do teachers patrol together?

167
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,259
Yes, we go in pairs.

168
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,061
<i>In pairs?</i>

169
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,930
<i>Who will I be with?</i>

170
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,071
<i>This person, huh…</i>

171
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,839
How's school? Got used to it?

172
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,641
More or less.

173
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,111
How's the vice principal?

174
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,714
Huh?

175
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,251
Don't get me wrong.

176
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,120
He may sound harsh,

177
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,123
but it's all out
of concern for the school.

178
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,625
Try to understand that.

179
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,396
He's actually wonderful.

180
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:54,767
<i>Wonderful? How so?</i>

181
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,037
He's got a scary face,

182
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,873
but his wide eyes are cute.

183
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,774
<i>Where?</i>

184
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:06,546
If you look closely,
he's got a handsome aura too.

185
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,147
<i>Where?</i>

186
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,184
<i>I seriously don't know</i>
<i>how to deal with her.</i>

187
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,155
-Look!
-Are there students?

188
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,926
That <i>taiyaki</i> shop is amazing!

189
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,395
There's usually a huge line, but not now.

190
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,462
This is our chance!

191
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,198
<i>I still don't know how to deal with her.</i>

192
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,800
<i>But…</i>

193
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,336
Here you go.

194
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,837
<i>She's a good person.</i>

195
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,874
Thank you very much.

196
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,186
-Umm…
-Yes?

197
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,288
I'm just wondering…

198
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,625
Aren't we supposed to

199
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,828
-not scold, praise nor counsel students?
-Yes.

200
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,764
But we're doing it anyway.

201
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,800
Well…

202
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,069
If there are misbehaving students

203
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,073
and teachers ignore it,
it affects the school's reputation.

204
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,277
<i>So it's all about reputation in the end?</i>

205
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,211
Also,

206
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,082
the number of students caught up
in crimes is increasing every year.

207
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:20,686
Teenagers today might think
this is old-fashioned,

208
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,823
but the closer they are
to nightlife districts,

209
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,193
the higher the risk of trouble.

210
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,129
If we patrolling teachers

211
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,064
can reduce that even slightly,

212
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,734
then it's worth doing.

213
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:39,405
<i>She's actually a thoughtful teacher.</i>

214
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,641
Honestly though,

215
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,876
I'd rather not see any students.

216
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,714
KARAOKE

217
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,823
RIKO
INCOMING CALL

218
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,029
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

219
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,265
Why are you smiling?

220
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,567
Because it's fun being with you, Rintaro.

221
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,171
Let's sing the next one together.

222
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,240
But you know…

223
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,709
Even if us teachers patrol like this,

224
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:21,247
the kids will still get involved
with crime elsewhere.

225
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:22,281
Elsewhere?

226
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,517
This.

227
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:29,088
Smartphones allow sketchy adults to
get in touch with kids.

228
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:29,989
SHINJO

229
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,559
Sorry, just a sec.

230
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,029
Yes? Hello?

231
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,565
<i>The screen says "Shinjo,"</i>

232
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,734
<i>as in Vice Principal Shinjo?</i>

233
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,738
<i>Why is she being so sneaky?</i>

234
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,141
<i>She sounded really sweet on the phone.</i>

235
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:50,976
<i>What! No way!</i>

236
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,312
<i>Are they a couple?</i>

237
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,215
You're at the restaurant?
Be there soon. Okay.

238
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,652
Sorry, Urumi-sensei!

239
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,055
I'm so sorry, but

240
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,424
I just remembered something important.

241
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:07,927
-Important?
-Yes.

242
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,929
Well…

243
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,165
How do I put it?…

244
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,868
<i>Looks like she's making up an excuse.</i>

245
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,806
Yes, something important.

246
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,741
I really have to go.

247
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:22,908
<i>She gave up.</i>

248
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,744
Anyway, I'll leave this to you.

249
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,278
You can eat it.

250
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,613
See you!

251
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:33,419
<i>Why did she rush off</i>
<i>after a call from the Vice Principal?</i>

252
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,388
<i>What's going on between them?</i>

253
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:44,130
<i>Right. Better not dwell on it.</i>

254
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,999
<i>Getting involved seems like trouble.</i>

255
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,737
<i>I'm patrolling solo from here.</i>

256
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,273
<i>Hope nothing happens.</i>

257
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,445
-Hey, are we heading back now?
-Yes, I suppose.

258
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,280
What? Let's stay a bit longer.

259
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,315
<i>Whoa!</i>

260
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,351
<i>Those two. Are they from my class?</i>

261
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,219
Please, just 30 more minutes.

262
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,523
Somewhere you want to go?

263
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,025
<i>It's a date, isn't it?</i>

264
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:15,694
<i>Am I supposed to tell them off for this?</i>

265
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,532
<i>But high schoolers go on dates.</i>

266
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,100
<i>Telling them off seems silly.</i>

267
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,136
<i>Right, I'll pretend I didn't see anything.</i>

268
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,070
Yes!

269
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,942
<i>Don't come this way!</i>

270
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,051
<i>It's been ages since I went to an arcade.</i>

271
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,186
ARCADE

272
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,088
<i>Yes, it's been ages.</i>

273
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,959
<i>All right, let's take some pics!</i>

274
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,063
Wait, isn't the color different?

275
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,074
PHOTO BOOTH

276
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,048
Thanks.

277
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,491
Shizuka-sensei?

278
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,932
Um, I'm actually patrolling right now.

279
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,237
Rintaro.

280
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,819
Your pictures.

281
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,358
Thank you very much.

282
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,492
Sorry.

283
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,133
Good morning.

284
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,474
Good morning.

285
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,009
Whoa!

286
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,445
You went to a photo booth? How surprising!

287
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,949
Whoa. You went to a photo booth,
Shizuka-sensei? So surprising!

288
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,684
-Well…
-So surprising!

289
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,587
-Surprising!!
-Yes!

290
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,391
<i>Stop acting so shocked!</i>
<i>I can have fun too, you know.</i>

291
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,892
Huh?

292
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,064
Aren't those students from your class?
Hata and Ando?

293
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,532
Why are those two together?

294
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,802
Why? Aren't they dating?

295
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:41,307
No, Hata's supposed to be dating
Riko Ota from your class.

296
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,445
Riko, morning!

297
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,980
Morning.

298
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:49,815
-Wait, there's a test today, right?
-What?

299
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,817
-This sucks!
-I didn't know!

300
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,987
Rintaro Hata is dating Riko Ota,

301
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,489
but he was taking pictures with Ando?

302
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,792
I see.

303
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,694
What do you think I should do?

304
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,164
Didn't Moriguchi-sensei say

305
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,500
we shouldn't get too involved
in other people's relationships?

306
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,102
Yes…

307
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:11,670
-Good morning.
-Hello.

308
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,273
We said that in sync!

309
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,041
How many times has that happened?

310
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,614
-<i>A ring? Which means… he's cheating?</i>
-Good morning.

311
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,885
-I haven't changed it.
-Did I mess up?

312
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,288
-Morning.
-Morning.

313
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,457
-Morning, Rintaro.
-Morning.

314
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,926
Why were you ignoring my texts last night?

315
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,228
Sorry, I fell asleep.

316
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,796
That early?

317
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,164
Well…

318
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,368
The test's coming up soon. Are you ready?

319
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:43,836
Well…

320
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,605
Why do you keep saying "well, well"?
Get it together!

321
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,008
You aren't studying that much either,
Riko.

322
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,743
Don't lump me in with you, Rintaro.

323
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,947
If we don't study,
we won't get into the same university!

324
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,350
Oh, this is rare!
The perfect couple is fighting?

325
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,019
We're not fighting!

326
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,755
Wait, didn't you two
go on a date yesterday?

327
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,223
-Idiot!
-Huh?

328
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,790
What do you mean?

329
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,259
It's nothing!

330
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,795
-A date? What?
-Seriously, it's nothing!

331
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,131
It's not "nothing"!
He totally said "a date"!

332
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:15,067
You told me you were asleep!
What was the date about?

333
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,367
No, it's not what you think!

334
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,936
Rui just misunderstood! Right, Rui?

335
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,142
Oh, yes, maybe I did…

336
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,710
Sorry.

337
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,311
What's going on? An argument?

338
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:28,414
Shut up!

339
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,316
This is seriously shady!

340
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,385
Just be honest with me!

341
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,854
Rintaro, answer me!

342
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,729
<i>What is this tension?</i>

343
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,700
Please take your seats.

344
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,405
Ota.

345
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,008
Ota?

346
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,287
<i>That looked like trouble.</i>

347
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,590
<i>Did Ota find out</i>

348
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,991
<i>about Hata and Ando?</i>

349
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:13,992
Sensei!

350
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,329
Yes?

351
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,431
Sensei.

352
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:22,367
Please don't tell anyone about yesterday.

353
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,669
I'm begging you.

354
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,939
<i>Don't drag me into it.</i>

355
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,273
Urumi-sensei.

356
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,243
-Oguchi-sensei!
-Come here.

357
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,945
Sorry. Please don't tell anyone

358
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,681
I left the patrol early yesterday.

359
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,551
Yes.

360
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,452
See you!

361
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:46,225
<i>Everyone's such a pain.</i>

362
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,430
Where should I put it…

363
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,598
Ah, I went too far.

364
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,366
Sensei. Here you go.

365
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,668
Thank you.

366
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,104
-Okay then, excuse me.
-Okay.

367
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,643
I'm starving.

368
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,614
Time for a break.

369
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,821
Okay, I believe you, Rintaro.

370
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:17,890
Thanks.

371
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,396
This is your fault, loudmouth.

372
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,831
No, seriously, I'm sorry.

373
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,499
I'm really sorry.

374
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,269
Don't be mad, Rin-chan.

375
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,370
I'll be more careful.

376
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,144
What's wrong?

377
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:40,579
This…

378
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,155
<i>Forget it. Other people's relationships…</i>

379
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,791
<i>I should stay out of it.</i>

380
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,460
Yurina, what were you thinking?

381
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,698
Why aren't you saying anything?

382
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,500
I asked what your intentions were!

383
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,401
<i>Whoa…</i>

384
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,203
-Nothing really…
-<i>One look and I knew.</i>

385
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,438
-<i>This is hell.</i>
-Why are you dating Rintaro?

386
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:07,839
<i>This is…</i>

387
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,074
Apologize to Riko!

388
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,776
Why should I have to apologize?

389
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,878
You went after someone's boyfriend!
It's obvious!

390
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,113
<i>So it's true…</i>

391
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,449
Why? Yurina, you knew, right?

392
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,551
Rintaro and I are dating!

393
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,752
-Let me go!
-Why?

394
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,154
-Stop it!
-Wait!

395
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,156
Stop it!

396
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,058
Explain what's going on!

397
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,193
<i>Even though I know, I still have to ask.</i>

398
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,463
-Yurina went out with Rintaro yesterday!
-On a date?

399
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,233
Even though Rintaro is with Riko,
he dated someone else.

400
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,270
<i>So they found out. Why?</i>

401
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,471
I see.

402
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,406
Sensei, you knew too, right?

403
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,210
This!

404
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,012
<i>Why is this photo…?</i>

405
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,081
It was on your desk.

406
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:49,982
<i>Huh?</i>

407
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:52,117
How did you get this? It was on my desk.

408
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,454
I happened to see it when I went
to the staff room.

409
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,522
<i>Don't take things without permission…</i>

410
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,590
Stay out of this, Hina!

411
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,892
Riko's my best friend!

412
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,861
Tell Riko everything!

413
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,765
<i>It's this kind of third-party justice</i>
<i>that blows everything up.</i>

414
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,233
Why are you silent?

415
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,836
Watanuki, calm down.
You shouldn't get heated up…

416
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,337
This is so stupid.

417
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,640
I just went somewhere with him.
Not a big deal, right?

418
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,540
What?

419
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,342
Why am I the only one getting blamed?

420
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:18,577
-Huh?
-Let's stop--

421
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,246
It wasn't just once.

422
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,881
We've gone out together many times.

423
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,951
Are you okay?

424
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,619
You're the worst!

425
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,254
Don't cry. You're not a kid.

426
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,422
Ando, let's stop.

427
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,323
Hey, Rintaro!

428
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,059
You always said you have more fun with me.

429
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,827
I told you to stop!

430
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,702
<i>I didn't plan to butt in…</i>

431
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,537
Sensei, are you taking Riko's side too?

432
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:47,205
I'm not necessarily taking sides--

433
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:49,274
Then why am I the one getting scolded?

434
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,943
Is it wrong to fall for someone else's BF?

435
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,049
<i>Guess I can't get out of this now.</i>

436
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,483
1 HOUR AGO

437
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,818
<i>Just in case,</i>

438
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,021
<i>I have no choice</i>
<i>but to prepare an explanation.</i>

439
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:04,523
WRONG TO DATE SOMEONE ELSE'S BF

440
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,891
OPINION SURVEY

441
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:09,227
ABSOLUTELY WRONG
YOU CAN'T HELP IT

442
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,797
There are lots of ways to think about it,
but…

443
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,834
Falling for someone itself isn't wrong.

444
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,136
You can't control
who you feel attracted to.

445
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,473
That's a valid point of view.

446
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,407
So, it's no problem!

447
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,876
But that doesn't mean anything goes.

448
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,446
Is it wrong to tell someone I like them?

449
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,413
WHAT IS ALLOWED?

450
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,782
Confessing your emotions may be okay.

451
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,484
MOST UNFORGIVEABLE THING
A CHEATING PARTNER CAN DO.

452
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,252
But some things just aren't allowed.

453
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,988
That's a lie.

454
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,926
I won't blame you for
falling for a taken man.

455
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,495
But as a basic rule,

456
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,231
Hata shouldn't lie to Ota,

457
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,934
And Ando shouldn't make him lie.

458
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:51,670
What should I do?

459
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,171
After expressing your feelings,

460
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,975
you wait for Hata to decide.

461
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,010
Whether he chooses you or Ota.

462
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,980
You should've acted

463
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,316
after he made that decision.

464
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,754
That's the fair way
to love someone in a relationship.

465
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,862
<i>I feel like I just said</i>
<i>something vaguely profound.</i>

466
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:18,764
Riko…

467
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:23,635
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,105
Rintaro…

469
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,642
Sensei was right.

470
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:32,477
I…

471
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,080
I…

472
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,252
Let's break up, Riko.

473
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:41,820
<i>What?!</i>

474
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,657
-What are you saying?
-What?

475
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,859
That's none of your business!

476
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,028
I'm into Yurina now.

477
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:51,963
Why?

478
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,901
Riko, you always talk down to me,
it's annoying.

479
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,371
Honestly, it's more fun being with Yurina.

480
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,943
<i>How did it come to this?</i>

481
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,482
-Wait!
-Huh?

482
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,852
Urumi-sensei! What happened?

483
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,522
<i>I'm better off not getting involved</i>

484
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,492
<i>in other people's love lives.</i>

485
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,161
TOTAL INTEGRITY

486
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:27,265
Why are there so many problems
with class 2-10?

487
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm sorry.

488
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,373
What you want to do with your love life
is for you to decide.

489
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,577
As teachers we should not interfere,

490
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,179
but you are still students.

491
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:44,683
You have to prioritize your studies first.

492
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,718
Right? Do you understand?

493
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:51,189
<i>She's dodging the issue</i>
<i>with a generic, meaningless lecture.</i>

494
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,626
There are plenty of guys out there.

495
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,429
You don't have to fall for
someone who's already taken.

496
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,397
Is it wrong
to fall for someone's boyfriend?

497
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:03,001
-Huh?
-I've liked Rintaro for a long time.

498
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,338
But he's had a girlfriend
since middle school,

499
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,107
so I should just give up? Isn't it weird?

500
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,311
Love doesn't follow some sort of order.

501
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,581
Riko just happened to meet him first.

502
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,784
Why should I have to give up
just because I met him later?

503
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,886
I can't accept that.

504
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,357
Right…

505
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,792
<i>She was trying to dodge</i>
<i>the issue with some vague logic.</i>

506
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,029
<i>But Yurina made her confront</i>
<i>a difficult problem.</i>

507
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:36,234
I kind of get what you're saying, Ando.

508
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,837
How do I put it?

509
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,106
That's just how the world is.

510
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:44,209
<i>That's such a weak argument.</i>

511
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,946
What about people who cheat
and steal someone else's husband?

512
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,447
What do you say to that?

513
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,051
Yes, that's…

514
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,555
<i>Oguchi-sensei</i>
<i>probably can't respond to that one.</i>

515
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,823
<i>Because she is… yes.</i>

516
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,394
Rintaro told me he loves me, not Riko.

517
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,095
Isn't that enough?

518
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,602
I get where you're all coming from.

519
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,704
So for now,

520
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:18,376
please discuss it calmly
with your homeroom teacher,

521
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,612
Urumi-sensei.

522
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,515
<i>Oh no!</i>

523
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,918
<i>Totally dumped this on me.</i>

524
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,389
It's fine.

525
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:36,361
I won't let what happens between us
cause any trouble at work.

526
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,331
Yes…

527
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,800
Let's keep our relationship
strictly professional.

528
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,738
-Yes, sure.
-Vice Principal.

529
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,444
Please don't shout
outside the principal's office.

530
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,779
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

531
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,114
Do you need something?

532
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,517
Yes,

533
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,053
I'd like to speak with you.

534
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:07,425
Urumi-sensei caused
another disturbance today.

535
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,027
So, that happened.

536
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,796
No scolding. No praise. No advice.

537
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,965
That's our school policy.

538
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,367
"Our school," huh?

539
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,771
Isn't that just your
School Reform Committee's…

540
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:20,705
No.

541
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,642
Isn't it just the philosophy
of the true mastermind

542
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,343
behind your Committee?

543
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,179
Yes. That's correct.

544
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,015
So please,

545
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:35,654
don't get in the way of what she's trying

546
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,789
to do for this school.

547
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,628
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

548
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,666
<i>I just want to go home</i>
<i>and not deal with anything tonight.</i>

549
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,300
Heading home now?

550
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:54,172
<i>Deja-vu? Why is Naito here again?</i>

551
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,106
SHINMEIGAOKA STATION

552
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,508
Why are you here?

553
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,476
My house is in this direction.

554
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:01,913
Ah, right.

555
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:10,255
<i>Is her trouble with Watanuki</i>
<i>still ongoing?</i>

556
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:13,792
<i>As if the love triangle wasn't enough,</i>
<i>there's this problem too?!</i>

557
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,061
I was waiting for you.

558
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,062
<i>Why?</i>

559
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,165
I didn't talk to you about
what happened with Hina.

560
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:23,868
<i>I'm busy with a different problem now.</i>

561
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,336
<i>I guess it doesn't matter.</i>

562
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,540
We haven't spoken since.

563
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:34,846
Like you said,
there's no going back to being friends.

564
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,348
I'm a loner in class now,

565
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,386
but for some reason,
I kind of feel like it's okay.

566
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,458
<i>I'm the reason</i>
<i>she ended up like this, right?</i>

567
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:51,029
<i>Ugh, I should probably</i>
<i>say something clever.</i>

568
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,365
Well…

569
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,169
With high school friends…

570
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:04,109
after you graduate, you can go on living
without seeing any of them again.

571
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:06,911
What?

572
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,515
<i>What am I even saying?</i>

573
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,085
Are you sure a teacher
should say this to a student?

574
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,121
<i>Sorry.</i>

575
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:20,525
Still… maybe it's kind of true.

576
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,459
<i>Huh?</i>

577
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,797
Please keep giving me advice
about stuff, okay?

578
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,168
<i>If I stay a teacher,</i>

579
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,238
<i>I'm going to have to keep dealing</i>
<i>with student drama like this.</i>

580
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:36,574
<i>Maybe I'm just not cut out</i>
<i>for teaching anymore.</i>

581
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,743
No!

582
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,745
Why are you in my house again?

583
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:45,416
I wanted to eat Kanako's food again.

584
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:46,651
-Here.
-Thank you!

585
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,987
You just got here!

586
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,156
This simmered dish is delicious
so have some.

587
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,860
It's so good!

588
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,395
Really?

589
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,863
It's like you're my mom!

590
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,931
You two are classmates.

591
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,333
Hey, was there a love drama

592
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,602
in class 2-10 today?

593
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,073
High schoolers acting like they're
in some late-night adultery drama.

594
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,278
Why are you laughing?

595
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:18,383
It reminds me of the guy Shi-chan
dated back in high school.

596
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,518
Naoto-kun?

597
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,588
-Naoto-kun.
-Him?

598
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:28,359
While Naoto was dating Shi-chan,
he was seeing someone else too.

599
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:30,128
That's right.

600
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,931
He was cheating on me with
a college girl from his part-time job.

601
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,968
Right? You totally blew up on him.

602
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,703
Let's just drop it already.

603
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,439
Looking back now,
it's kind of a funny story.

604
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,209
Yes, I guess so. A funny story.

605
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:48,980
But back then, it really hurt, didn't it?

606
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,387
MEISHIN PRIVATE ACADEMY

607
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,092
I tell you, it isn't like that-…

608
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,097
Rintaro, morning.

609
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:07,999
Morning.

610
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,107
Good morning.

611
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,820
<i>And then, for the next two days,</i>

612
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,989
<i>Riko Ota was absent from school.</i>

613
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,463
Rintaro, what are you doing later today?

614
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:40,765
-Wanna go for some karaoke?
-Yes!

615
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,333
What is wrong with you two?

616
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,869
Don't you feel bad for Riko?

617
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:45,937
Doesn't matter!

618
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:48,339
-You stole someone's boyfriend, what's--
-Stop it!

619
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,974
-Don't be so annoying!
-Huh?

620
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,075
It doesn't involve you!

621
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,277
What are you doing?

622
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,619
Urumi-sensei.

623
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,055
Do you have a moment?

624
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,963
Urumi Sensei, can you persuade them?

625
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,032
-Rintaro chose me!
-Quiet!

626
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,734
You both made your own choices!

627
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,937
And be prepared to take
full responsibility for everything!

628
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,906
From Ota's mother?

629
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,541
That's right.

630
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:28,146
She contacted us thinking something
might have happened at school.

631
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,351
I understand how she'd be worried.
Ota never missed school,

632
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:37,221
and now she suddenly takes two days off.

633
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,122
Luckily,

634
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:43,528
it seems she hasn't told her parents
what happened yet.

635
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:46,164
Honestly,

636
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,269
we teachers don't need to interfere
with high-school romance drama,

637
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,504
but because you made it into a big deal…

638
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,139
<i>It's my fault?</i>

639
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:59,043
I don't want this
being blamed on the school.

640
00:32:59,110 --> 00:32:59,978
You get it?

641
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,181
<i>So what exactly do you want me to do?</i>

642
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,351
Urumi-sensei.

643
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:11,456
Before her parents find out
and it becomes an even bigger problem,

644
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:17,095
can you talk to Ota and convince her

645
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,397
to come back to school starting tomorrow?

646
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:25,970
<i>"Convince her," huh?</i>

647
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:29,140
<i>Just one headache after another.</i>

648
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,117
<i>She won't answer.</i>

649
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,921
<i>Then, there's nothing I can do.</i>
<i>Yes, let's just head back.</i>

650
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,966
Why did you come here?

651
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,902
Why?

652
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,572
I came to talk to you.

653
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,809
And what do you plan
to accomplish by talking?

654
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,778
Accomplish…

655
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,815
I was going to ask you
to come back to school.

656
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:15,219
I don't want to go back to that class.

657
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,223
I understand how you feel,

658
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,927
but you can't
keep running from it forever.

659
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:25,763
<i>Huh…</i>

660
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,966
<i>Do I really have</i>
<i>to go this far as a teacher?</i>

661
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,402
I've had enough.

662
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,572
I'm exhausted.

663
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,208
I just want to die.

664
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,489
RIKO OTA

665
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:56,561
All of you… don't talk about death
so lightly!

666
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,399
<i>I lost it. What am I doing?</i>

667
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,436
Why am I the one getting yelled at?

668
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,273
It's your fault. If you hadn't said that,

669
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,943
I wouldn't have lost Rintaro to Yurina.

670
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,888
Fine.

671
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,958
I'll go back to school.

672
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,661
In exchange…

673
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,132
you must make Rintaro and Yurina break up.

674
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,417
The students are
at a delicate age right now.

675
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,186
As adults,

676
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:59,423
we have to be careful not to say or do
things that may provoke or influence them.

677
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,426
-Where is Shizuka-sensei?
-That's all from me.

678
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,396
-Anyone else?
-I don't know…

679
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,065
SCIENCE PREP ROOM

680
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,408
-Is she okay?
-Oh, Shizuka-sensei?

681
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,144
What was she doing
during the staff meeting?

682
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,220
Please… keep your promise.

683
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,318
SCRIPT

684
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,754
Before we begin homeroom,

685
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,991
please let me continue from last time.

686
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,594
Do you remember

687
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,896
what I said?

688
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:14,865
Ando.

689
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,634
Hata.

690
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,236
Ota.

691
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,606
I said this to Ando:

692
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,243
You should wait
until Hata makes a decision.

693
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,311
Whether he chooses you or Ota.

694
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,182
And after he makes that decision,
then you act.

695
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,319
That's the fair way
to love someone in a relationship.

696
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,855
SCRIPT

697
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,190
So Hata…

698
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:45,463
You broke up with Ota
and started dating Ando, right?

699
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,964
Congratulations.

700
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:59,310
Actually, today,
Ota asked me to do something.

701
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,713
She wants me to break up Hata and Ando.

702
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,351
What are you even talking about?

703
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:08,586
That's enough!

704
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,655
What's with that attitude? Poor Riko!

705
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,090
It's not like I want to say this.

706
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,159
But their relationship is already over.

707
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,560
Rintaro chose me!

708
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,862
Quiet!

709
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:19,697
Why?

710
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,701
Why are you making me out
to be the bad guy?

711
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,003
Why am I always being blamed?

712
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,639
I'm not trying to
paint you as the villain.

713
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,575
Like I said before,

714
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,479
sometimes we fall for someone
who already has a partner.

715
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,984
Adultery has probably existed
for thousands of years.

716
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:46,023
Even with talk shows saying "It's wrong!"
It still hasn't gone away.

717
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,061
But what's most important…

718
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,930
is imagination.

719
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,835
If you fall in love with someone
who's already in a relationship,

720
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,304
can you imagine
how their partner might feel?

721
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,340
How do you care for that person,
emotionally?

722
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:05,209
What will other people think about them,
an adulterous couple?

723
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,512
What kind of backlash might they face?
What will happen in five or ten years?

724
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,216
Only people who are prepared

725
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:15,986
to face all of that should
enter into that kind of relationship.

726
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:20,458
Someone who just charges in recklessly,
saying "I love him/her!" isn't qualified.

727
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,694
So, Ando…

728
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,798
I think you should break up with Hata.

729
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,868
This is what Ando kept saying.

730
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,137
Why am I the only one getting blamed?

731
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,741
Couldn't you imagine this outcome?

732
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,579
And Hata. Seriously?

733
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:45,449
You lied to Ota without hesitation
just so you could meet her.

734
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,718
When you got caught, you were defiant,

735
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:51,655
Riko, you always talk down to me,
it's annoying.

736
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,825
Honestly, it's more fun being with Yurina.

737
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,763
Couldn't you imagine how deeply
Ota would be hurt?

738
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,336
And yet the two of you
keep playing the victim.

739
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,607
You both made your own choices!

740
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,478
So you should've expected
some backlash from people around you!

741
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,816
And be prepared to take
full responsibility for everything!

742
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:23,187
If you can do that,

743
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:27,124
I think you two will be able
to stay together as a couple.

744
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,363
Also, Ota…

745
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,803
I know this whole situation
has been nothing but awful for you.

746
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,471
But still…

747
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,142
You can't let yourself
be consumed by hatred.

748
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,246
The biggest waste after a heartbreak

749
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,850
is letting that hatred
steal your time forever.

750
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,522
Hatred only exists in the past.

751
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,226
If you're trapped in it,
you won't be able to move forward.

752
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,766
One last thing.

753
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,337
I'm sorry, but your relationship right now

754
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:17,007
isn't all that important
in the grand scheme of life.

755
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,443
Did you know?

756
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:24,215
High-school relationships
usually last six months to a year.

757
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,184
Whether Hata dates Ota or Ando,

758
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,020
in two or three years, they'll break up,
move on to someone else.

759
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,990
That's the extent of your love.

760
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,532
Ota…

761
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:48,706
In two years, you may remember today as
just a silly memory.

762
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,644
But this experience, someday,

763
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,613
will become your strength.

764
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,816
Your emotional intelligence.

765
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,535
Despite all your complaints,
you really do care about your students.

766
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,603
That's not it.

767
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,606
Actually, back in high school,

768
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:26,644
I got dumped when my boyfriend cheated
with a college girl at his part-time job.

769
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,846
I was hung up on it for about three years.

770
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:34,184
And just remembering that wasted time
really pisses me off.

771
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,720
So that's why
I gave that whole speech earlier.

772
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,128
Principal.

773
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,432
I have a request regarding Urumi-sensei,

774
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,034
the teacher you brought in.

775
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,136
What is it?

776
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,473
I'd like to recruit her
to the School Reform Committee.

777
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:02,479
We want her to be involved
in that project we discussed.

778
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,583
You can't refuse.

779
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,922
This is also… that person's wish.

780
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:15,659
I see.

781
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,195
Good morning.

782
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,129
MEISHIN ACADEMY

783
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,664
MEISHIN

784
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,705
There are a few things
I'd like to share with you all today.

785
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,707
<i>Why?</i>

786
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,109
First of all, starting today,

787
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:36,747
Urumi-sensei will also be joining
the School Reform Committee.

788
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:39,216
<i>Why am I being roped into this?</i>

789
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,685
I look forward to working with you.

790
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,089
Also,

791
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:46,090
‪SCHOOL REFORM COMMITTEE‬

792
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:51,395
as of today, I will step down
as commitee chairman.

793
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,131
I'll fall back to a supporting role.

794
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,286
From today, I will be…

795
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,624
the Chair of the School Reform Committee.

796
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,793
-What?
-What?

797
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,361
What are you talking about?

798
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,497
I will get straight to the point.

799
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,932
I'd like to tell you about some of

800
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,835
the major decisions being made
by the School Reform Committee.

801
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,839
Please look at the handout.

802
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,313
We hope to expel these 75 students…

803
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,214
STUDENT LIST CLASS 2-10, CLASS 12-6,
CLASS 13-8, CLASS 9-9

804
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,486
…by the end of this school year,

805
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,590
with your help.

806
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,168
So don’t say "I quit" so easily!

807
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,536
Well, I don’t have a concrete plan.

808
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,037
NEXT TIME RELUCTANT PREACHER
FIRST DROP OUT DUE TO?
