00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,552
=A Deadly Loop=

2
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:43,744
(Childhood sweethearts reunite
after years.)

3
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,040
Go.

4
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,720
Sorry, Yinmeng.

5
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,000
I am busy with the new store opening,

6
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,000
so I am a bit late.

7
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,920
You really don't need to get hands-on
with the store stuff.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,320
I'll have servants do the job.

9
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,920
Just some trivial stuff.

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,880
I've got this.

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,760
What matters to you matters to me.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,680
Why so distant?

13
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,080
I wouldn't dare.

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,880
My parents passed away in my youth.

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
All these years,

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,720
it's Mayor Gu's care

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,400
that has made me who I am today.

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,520
My dad cares for you

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,720
out of the relationships
of their generation.

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,360
I care for you out of self-interest.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,800
It's different.

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,160
I heard you're hiring a manager?

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,800
I've talked with my dad,

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,080
asking him to select

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,280
a capable shopkeeper from the town.

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,880
Our people are reliable.

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,000
Actually I...

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,720
By the way,

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,000
when your store opens,

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,360
I'll send you a jade screen.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,240
It'll be quite the scene, right?

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,120
The screen?

33
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,680
It's just a foreign goods store.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
It may not be needed.

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,160
It doesn't matter.

36
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,360
It needs to be grand and magnificent.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,560
Listen to me.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
I've given a heads-up
to the police station.

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,560
When your store opens,

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,280
it'll be full of rare items.

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,520
Safeguards must be enhanced.

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,880
In addition,

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,200
I've informed all my childhood friends,

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,160
asking them to visit your store often.

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,720
It's appreciated.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,640
Honestly speaking,

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,680
You come back from the Bund.

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm very happy.

49
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
Although Xuntang Town is small,

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,920
it has everything

51
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,320
we need.

52
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,760
Why struggle alone out there?

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,520
Right?

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,520
Remember this.

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
As long as I am here,

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,320
I won't let Fang Xuewen suffer.

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,680
The tea's too light.

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,240
How about we head somewhere

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,400
and have some yellow wine?

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,920
No need for that.

61
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,080
I have a meeting tomorrow.

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,320
Savor life's triumphs to their fullest.

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
Let them change the meeting time. Come.

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,320
Yinmeng.

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,960
(He finds out her feelings.)

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,520
Mr. Fang, congratulations
on your opening!

67
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you. Hope to see you often.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,568
No problem.

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,640
Mr. Fang.

70
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,840
Congratulations!

71
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
Congratulations on opening your store!

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,800
My friend is over there.

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,320
Excuse me.

74
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,920
Sure.

75
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,480
Congratulations!

76
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,280
Mr. Fang.

77
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
Your store is opening.

78
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,760
Why is she like the host?

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,600
I wanted to keep it simple.

80
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,680
But Yinmeng wanted it to be grand.

81
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,520
She has been spirited and determined

82
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,200
since she was a kid.

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
Frankly,

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,320
when is it between you?

85
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
What?

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,360
You know that.

87
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,520
Getting engaged.

88
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,680
She and I?

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,520
We grew up together.

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,920
We know each other too well,

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,720
just like siblings.

92
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,120
It's not what you think.

93
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,520
Really, Fang Xuewen?

94
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,080
How can you be so insensitive?

95
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,280
I'm telling you
with a woman's intuition.

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Her feelings for you
are clearly more than siblings.

97
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
We're not suitable.

98
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,400
I think Gu Yinmeng is quite nice.

99
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,280
She is beautiful and generous.

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
Although sometimes

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
she can be a spoiled rich lady,

102
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,520
she truly cares about you.

103
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
If you became a live-in son-in-law
for the Gu family,

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,680
many guys would be envious.

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,200
Little Witch, you really don't know me.

106
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,320
All this glory and wealth

107
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,600
is not what I want.

108
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,520
You're living in bliss
and don't even realize it!

109
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,760
But,

110
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,080
no one really figures out someone

111
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
as maverick as you.

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,400
What kind of woman do you actually like?

113
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Hard to describe.

114
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,560
Perhaps the simple sort.

115
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,800
Yinmeng appears to be drunk.

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,920
Go check on her.

117
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
Yinmeng, are you drunk?

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
I'll take you home.

119
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,640
Fang Xuewen, are you aware?

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,760
Everything I do is for you.

121
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,120
Yinmeng, you are drunk.

122
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,280
I'll take you home.

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,360
Fang Xuewen, I really love you.

124
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,840
(She and she go head-to-head.)

125
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,920
I'll look around first, thanks.

126
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,800
Alright, call me if you need anything.

127
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,120
Hello, take a look over here.

128
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,400
This is the jewelry
used by the French royal family.

129
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,440
Mr. Fang acquired it from Henry,

130
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,320
board director of the French Concession.

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,720
It comes with a royal certificate
of authenticity.

132
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,280
I do have a question though.

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,960
Why doesn't Mr. Fang

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,120
open a store on the Bund?

135
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Why come back

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,080
to this secluded corner of Xuntang Town?

137
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,680
Mr. Fang is cautious in his dealings.

138
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,960
He likes to keep it low-profile.

139
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,520
This small store has limited funds.

140
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,920
It cannot compare
with a prestigious gold shop.

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
It selects unique pieces
by personal preference,

142
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
seeking kindred spirits.

143
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Although Xuntang sits quietly
on the outskirts,

144
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,120
it has esteemed guests of your caliber.

145
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,320
Well said.

146
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,520
Judging by your accent,

147
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
you're not local.

148
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,120
Yes.

149
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,000
I am grateful
Mr. Fang doesn't mind this.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
I've just started my work here.

151
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,360
Where did you work before?

152
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Shanghai.

153
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,360
Shanghai's nice.

154
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,680
How did you come here?

155
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,200
It's just a coincidence.

156
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,320
What a coincidence.

157
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,080
Your boss Mr. Fang

158
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,880
also returned to Xuntang from Shanghai.

159
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,120
Maybe

160
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,760
you've already met in Shanghai.

161
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,760
I'm from a humble background.

162
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,880
Where would I get the chance
to meet Mr. Fang?

163
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,360
I'm just saying.

164
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,520
I know your boss well.

165
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,880
(The bond of childhood cannot rival
the destiny of a fated union.)

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,480
What's good about her?

167
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,920
What?

168
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,720
I mean her.

169
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,200
Who?

170
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
Jingzhi.

171
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,640
I heard that for her,

172
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,240
you even turned down Mr. Hua

173
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,200
introduced by my dad.

174
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,920
He came to complain about that.

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,720
Answer my question.

176
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,120
What question?

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,120
What's good about her?

178
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,320
She is young and beautiful,

179
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,520
with a good figure?

180
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,120
Why are you playing dumb with me?

181
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,960
You might have misunderstood me.

182
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,960
I just think Jingzhi

183
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,720
understands better what I want.

184
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,320
Better than I do?

185
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,960
Of course not.

186
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,800
A girl hired from out of town.

187
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
How well do you know her?

188
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,560
Do you know her past,

189
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,720
her background,

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,320
and her character?

191
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,280
I think she's alright.

192
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
Besides,

193
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
how much harm could a girl do?

194
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,560
You guys.

195
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,320
Yinmeng.

196
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,400
You're late again.

197
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,520
Have a penalty shot.

198
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,440
Today we drink only wine, not tea.

199
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,680
Enough, let's go.

200
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,880
You are drunk again.

201
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,480
Worry about me?

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,360
If you're like this,

203
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,480
I can't face your father.

204
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm afraid even if I'm not drunk,

205
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,080
you also can't face my father, can you?

206
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,760
I think you know

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,400
what I am talking about.

208
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,120
Fang Xuewen.

209
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,720
I always thought
that we understood each other.

210
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,920
But I was wrong.

211
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,280
To this day, I still don't know

212
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,320
what's really on your mind.

213
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,320
Of course, I have my issues too.

214
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,720
I naturally assumed

215
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,760
that you should know my feelings.

216
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,760
All these years,

217
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,800
don't you really get me?

218
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,200
You've always been the one in my mind.

219
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
I know.

220
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,760
But Yinmeng,

221
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
I've always treated you as my sister.

222
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,880
I...

223
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,080
Enough, stop it.

224
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,520
This is enough.

225
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,600
I may be willful, domineering,

226
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,720
and arrogant.

227
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,560
But when it comes to feelings,

228
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,400
I never complicate matters for anyone.

229
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,880
After finishing this cup,

230
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,120
you just tell me your answer.

231
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,120
Is it me, or her?

232
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,000
Great, it's clear.

234
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,400
I just like you as you are.

235
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
In that case,

236
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
from now on,

237
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
we shall make a clean break.

238
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,720
I will have nothing more to do

239
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,560
with you.

240
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,520
I hope you won't regret it.

241
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,120
(Let it be so.)

242
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,560
(Fang Xuewen.)

243
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,320
(All these years,)

244
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,960
(I have indeed misplaced my affections.)

245
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,880
(I never thought
getting drunk back then)

246
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,720
(made me closest to you for once.)

247
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,080
(After today,)

248
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,360
(you and I)

249
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
(will part ways forever.)
