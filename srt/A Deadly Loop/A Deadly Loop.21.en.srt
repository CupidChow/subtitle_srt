=Episode 21=

3
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,520
Qin Yaochuan.

4
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,160
A vicious bad guy.

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
Liu Yangchu.

6
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,080
Hypocritical and indecisive.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,360
Caught out by Qin Yaochuan.

8
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,520
Xu Zhaohe.

9
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,920
Greedy for profit,

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,920
and untrustworthy.

11
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,320
Jia Bonian.

12
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,240
Diligent and responsible.

13
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,640
But doubtful of my words.

14
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,280
And Xiaoxian.

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,520
Mr. Wang.

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
Treating me like family.

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,280
There shall not be
more futile sacrifices.

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,520
Also Luo Changsheng.

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,440
Luo Changsheng.

20
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,440
173.

21
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,240
73.

22
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:14,464
(Telephone Booth)

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Answer the phone.

24
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,440
Hello?

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,880
Hello?

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,720
I am Fang Xuewen.

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
I heard you're interested in it.

28
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
I brought it specially for you.

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
Save you the trouble

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,800
of fetching it.

31
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,080
I am quite curious

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,360
about how you know my plan.

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,440
People are

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
listening outside.

35
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,120
Since you are determined

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,080
to do this,

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,880
it means

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,480
you don't care if others know.

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,360
You've got some nerve.

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
You've ruined my plan.

41
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,960
Now you're here alone.

42
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,200
Aren't you worried you won't return?

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm here

44
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,240
to pitch in.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Fang Xuewen.

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,920
You really think

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,480
I am after your wealth?

48
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,600
What about

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,840
my life as well?

50
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,560
Frankly,

51
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,560
I have already died many times.

52
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,800
So I am not afraid of death this time.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm truly confused now.

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,200
What are you playing at?

55
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Losing money

56
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,960
and suffering a lot.

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,400
What do you want?

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,360
I also care about

59
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
the one you care about.

60
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,400
Huang Jingqiu and I have been together

61
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,600
for eight years.

62
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,440
For her,

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,080
I'd sacrifice my life.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,320
You say you care equally.

65
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
On what ground?

66
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,240
The last thing needed

67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,480
is to give one's life.

68
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,160
What is needed

69
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,920
is a man

70
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,440
keeping his word to a woman.

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,200
You think you've given a lot.

72
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,880
So Jingzhi should

73
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,960
give it to you just as much

74
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,040
or at equal values.

75
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,720
Is that so?

76
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,520
If love was an equal trade,

77
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,320
then please tell me,

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
how will you make up for

79
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
all these helpless days

80
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,480
Jingzhi has been through?

81
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,440
Eight years.

82
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,400
For eight years,

83
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,920
you can't give her a stable life.

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
I did it in one year.

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,400
What do you think is my ground?

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
What I can't have,

87
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
neither can you.

88
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,880
That's probably not what you truly mean.

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,640
If you just want
to vent your anger on me

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,920
for revenge,

91
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,720
that's fine.

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
You can have my life.

93
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,400
But I'm sure,

94
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,560
you'll regret

95
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
hurting Jingzhi.

96
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
What do you mean?

97
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,640
This is impossible.

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,640
Impossible.

99
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,880
What have you done?

100
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
What happened to her?

101
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,400
Don't ask me

102
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,160
this question.

103
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,080
Ask your old buddy,

104
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,840
Qin Yaochuan.

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,880
Ask him what he did to Jingzhi.

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,920
You don't still think
Qin Yaochuan is reliable, do you?

107
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,400
Let me tell you.

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,440
You've long been

109
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,360
on his purge list.

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
People change.

111
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,600
Your days

112
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,400
have been water under the bridge.

113
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,600
I have no idea

114
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,800
what you're up to.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
What trick you're playing?

116
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,720
Trying to fool me?

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,960
Why don't you go check out

118
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,240
the back seat of your car?

119
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,000
See what gift

120
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,480
your old buddy has brought you.

121
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Bad guy.

122
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,880
How do you know it?

123
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,120
If I say it's magical power,

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,880
do you believe it?

125
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't play games with me.

126
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,240
Do you still want to see Jingzhi alive?

127
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,880
Jingzhi.

128
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,640
Blood all over her on this photo.

129
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,360
I can assure you.

130
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,240
Jingzhi will appear before us

131
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,520
safe and sound.

132
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,440
You mean,

133
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,120
she's still alive?

134
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,720
Exactly.

135
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,920
At this very moment,

136
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,080
she is still alive.

137
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,200
But it won't be long

138
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,680
before Qin Yaochuan kills her.

139
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,120
Just like his long-planned

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,440
attempt to bomb you to death.

141
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,800
Why should I believe you?

142
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,760
I've never been to this place.

143
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,000
Where did you get it from?

144
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,120
It's the result

145
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
of you being so stubborn.

146
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,520
You thought you had everything

147
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,720
planned out perfectly.

148
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,160
But when you broke into my store,

149
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,240
your photo was taken.

150
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,160
The next day,

151
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,120
you were on the Extra,

152
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,880
as a notorious wanted criminal.

153
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,280
Sure,

154
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,000
it's not a big deal to you.

155
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,840
You are just changing from a prisoner

156
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,600
to a fugitive.

157
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,960
But have you considered Jingzhi?

158
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,800
Have you thought about her feelings?

159
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,720
Do you really want

160
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,880
your beloved woman

161
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,440
to live

162
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
a rough and tough life with you?

163
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,440
But the other person in the photo,

164
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,160
Qin Yaochuan,

165
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
is totally different.

166
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,080
He definitely doesn't

167
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
want to lose his job.

168
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,600
Let me put it this way.

169
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
He will destroy all the evidence,

170
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,480
and also

171
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,920
kill everyone involved

172
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,960
in this matter,

173
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
including me,

174
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,240
you,

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,080
and Jingzhi.

176
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,680
Luo Changsheng.

177
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,280
What are you doing?

178
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,600
No instructions.

179
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,440
No sight of you.

180
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
What time is it now!

181
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,280
What's going on?

182
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,320
Fang...

183
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
