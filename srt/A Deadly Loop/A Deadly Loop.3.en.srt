2
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,504
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,120
(It's 15 minutes into the first half
of the soccer final)

4
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
(of the 10th Far Eastern Games.)

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,800
(The Chinese team
started off well today.)

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,360
(The first goal
is expected to come soon.)

7
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,560
Am I back again?

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,720
6 o'clock.

9
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,480
An hour early again.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,840
Could it be that

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,840
each time the pocket watch

12
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,080
takes me to an hour earlier?

13
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,440
Step by step,
the future will become the past.

14
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,440
At 6 o'clock?

15
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
I was arguing with Jingzhi then.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,760
Who exactly was this person?

17
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,360
What on earth have you been doing?

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,880
It's not like you think.

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,680
Met him again last night?

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,480
No.

21
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,880
Then why did you go out so late?

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,000
Mr. Wang called last night.

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,880
I answered it.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,640
But there was no sound on the phone.

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,960
l was worried about it.

26
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,120
So I thought I'd go check it out.

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,880
And then?

28
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
What happened?

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,480
Nothing.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,600
Nothing happened.

31
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,280
Do you expect something to happen?

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,880
Can you stop using

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
going to the store as an excuse?

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,240
What about you?

35
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
What have you been up to?

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,760
Now I am asking you.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
Maybe I need to reconsider

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,640
our relationship.

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,360
Jingzhi is still alive.

40
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,400
Jingzhi.

41
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,720
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,720
My dear,

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,440
you really scared me.

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
I love you.

45
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,400
I truly love you.

46
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,160
I just said those horrible words to you.

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
I apologize.

48
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,240
I'll never leave you again.

49
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,440
It's my fault.

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
I shouldn't have kept anything from you.

51
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,760
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,120
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,320
I don't care.

54
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,160
Jingzhi.

55
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,560
From this moment,

56
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,160
you must believe me.

57
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,080
My dear,

58
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,280
what is it exactly?

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,480
Listen.

60
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,320
Stay inside, no matter what.

61
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Did you hear me?

62
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,760
Why?

63
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,280
Because they'll soon be here.

64
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,960
They...

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,160
Who are they?

66
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,000
Say it clear.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,320
Here's the thing.

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,120
I offended someone I shouldn't have
in business.

69
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,760
They're coming after me.

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,840
Why haven't you mentioned this before?

71
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,480
Didn't wanna scare you.

72
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,320
Listen to me.

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
Without my signal,

74
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,800
do not come out, never.

75
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,920
Okay.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,520
Just in case.

77
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,320
Take this.

78
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,800
I will come back for you.

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,840
Hello, Police Station?

80
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,680
I'd like to report.

81
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,280
Someone's coming to kill me.

82
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,920
Why would you think that?

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,360
I angered them.

84
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,200
What's your location?

85
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,480
No. 28, Guantang Street.

86
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,600
Is anyone else there?

87
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,760
My fiancée is also here.

88
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,360
Has anyone broken in already?

89
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,840
Or are they outside the house?

90
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
Do they have any weapons?

91
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,160
No to all.

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,880
Please send your team here ASAP.

93
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,280
Your Station is near my home.

94
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm very sorry.

95
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,400
The town's fireworks factory exploded.

96
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
All our people have gone to the scene.

97
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,360
I've no people right now.

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I'll call you back soon.

99
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Then...

100
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,640
Hello? Hello?

101
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,200
Someone's here.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,440
(The person who killed Jingzhi)

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,080
(must be him.)

104
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,360
(Playing tricks.)

105
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Xuewen.

106
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,120
Is it you?

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,048
Hello?

108
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Jingzhi.

109
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,960
Jingzhi.

110
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,200
Jingzhi.

111
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,960
Jingzhi.

112
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,320
I must

113
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,200
see who you really are.

114
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,480
I clearly remember

115
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,960
he just suddenly shot me.

116
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,640
Why is the wound
not as serious as before?

117
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,160
Does it mean

118
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
that each injury suffered last time

119
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,120
will be alleviated next time?

120
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,920
5 o'clock.

121
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,600
It's jumped ahead another hour.

123
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,840
(Pregnancy care?)

124
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,320
When was Jingzhi pregnant?

125
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,120
How come I didn't know?
