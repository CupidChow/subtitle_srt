3
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,744
(Half a Month Ago)

4
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,520
Coming.

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,800
Are you in charge here?

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,920
(Wanted)
Seen this guy?

7
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,760
Nope.

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:19,920
Recently,

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,200
this guy's committing crimes.

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,400
Make sure your doors are locked well.

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,320
Understand?

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,880
Understood, we'll be careful.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,320
Okay.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,760
Back to your work.

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,880
Thanks, officer.

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,960
Alright then.

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,640
Goodbye.

18
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,120
According to Fatty Xu's info,

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,440
the owner Fang Xuewen

20
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,680
received a batch of jewelry today.

21
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
Absolutely true.

22
00:02:44,544 --> 00:02:45,088
(Map)

23
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:45,800
I heard them say,

24
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
it's a pair of jewelry from France

25
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,160
brought over by Mr. Henry,

26
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,040
a Municipal Director.

27
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,320
Priceless.

28
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,520
This batch of jewelry will

29
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,560
stay in the store

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,720
for just one week.

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,360
Then shipped to Shanghai.

32
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
We must do it before

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,760
the last day.

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,280
Fang Xuewen did not hire any guards.

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,400
But there's an old man,

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,200
some

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,040
Mr. Wang.

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Right?

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,400
Right.

40
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,640
However,

41
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,800
without his glasses,

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
he's as good as blind.

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,000
Fang Xuewen has been leaving the store

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,120
in the hands of his girlfriend
Liu Jingzhi.

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,560
After eight every evening,

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,080
Liu Jingzhi will leave the store,

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,000
leaving that old man alone

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,720
in the duty room next to the courtyard.

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,120
From the main gate to the yard gate,
then to the display cabinets,

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,280
there are three security locks.

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,160
Around nine every night,

52
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,560
there's hardly anyone

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,400
on the streets.

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,440
Just

55
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,560
arrange someone

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,720
to be on the lookout.

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,360
After it's done,

58
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
I will take the jewelry

59
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,560
to the black market for sales.

60
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,640
Money will be split

61
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,520
equally among us four.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,960
Once Fang Xuewen calls the police,

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,120
the two detectives will

64
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,000
intervene in the case

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,800
as police officers

66
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,880
to sow confusion.

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,400
The time of action

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
will be tomorrow.

69
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,560
Hey, be careful.

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
Come down.

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,480
Left untouched for years.

72
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,280
So much dust.

73
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,280
It's okay.

74
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,320
It's not your fault.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
I'll just rinse my eyes with water.

76
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,200
Look.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,600
It's full of dust on top.

78
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,520
It's gotten into my eyes.

79
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,120
I'll hold them.

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
I'll rinse them with water.

81
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh, sorry.

82
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,480
It's okay.

83
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
It's fine.

84
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,320
Sorry about that,

85
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,000
Mr. Wang.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I thought you caught it.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,800
It's fine.

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Here.

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,560
Take care.

90
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,280
Miss.

(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

92
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
How is it?

93
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,240
Rest assured.

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,000
Area patrol is well arranged.

95
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,480
Not a single police officer will come.

96
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,920
Get to work.

97

(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

98
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Who's there?

99
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,920
(Why's the door unlocked?)

100
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,440
Mr. Wang.

101
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,560
