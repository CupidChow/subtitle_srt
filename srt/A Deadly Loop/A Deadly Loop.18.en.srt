00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,536
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,400
Don't move.

4
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,680
Didn't I tell you

5
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,480
to stay put?

6
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Haven't I told you

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,360
there are four of them?

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,240
Fang Xuewen,

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,360
I didn't expect us to meet this way.

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,000
We've met before.

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,840
Now that everyone is here,

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,400
we can just

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,640
end all this in one go.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,160
You are free to shoot.

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,720
But the other police will be here soon.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,120
No one of you can escape this town.

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,200
Then let's try it.

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,200
Detective Qin,

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,160
don't be impulsive.

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
Qin Yaochuan,

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm afraid

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,800
none of them is your friend.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,520
Do you know why

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,600
Xu Zhaohe was hiding?

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,240
Check out

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
what's in the pocket

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,520
of his jacket.

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,520
Inside the hall of my store

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,840
were all forgeries.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,920
The real ones

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,600
are in his pocket.

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,240
This fatso

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,760
probably hasn't told you the truth.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Ever since you stepped
through this door,

35
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,000
you've been fooled by him.

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,000
Luo Changsheng,

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,640
our scores

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,720
can be settled later.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,400
But I must

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,840
tell you the truth.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,560
From the beginning,

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,120
Qin Yaochuan

43
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,720
never intended

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,160
to let you leave Xuntang alive.

45
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,920
Since you stepped through this door,

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,360
he's been scheming

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,960
to plant all this

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,360
on you,

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,080
so that he can get away with it.

50
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,960
Just think about it carefully.

51
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,720
How could someone like him

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,800
possibly

53
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,440
let a fugitive

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,080
be at large

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,040
with a secret?

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,120
Liu Yangchu,

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,920
you are not in the photos

58
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,760
of my camera.

59
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,080
If Officer Jia and I

60
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,040
reach an agreement,

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,960
as long as you cooperate,

62
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:25,200
we can

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,680
get you out of this matter,

64
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,320
pretending nothing ever happened.

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,040
Fang Xuewen,

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,360
do you think they will believe you?

67
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,680
Detective Qin,

68
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,920
maybe we should stop.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Liu Yangchu,

70
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,160
have you forgotten

71
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,960
you killed someone?

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,080
A corpse still lies at the bottom

73
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,920
of the lake in the south of the town.

74
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,080
Jia Bonian,

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,520
are you really that aboveboard?

76
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,440
None of you is clean.

77
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,600
We deal

78
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,120
with these trivial issues all day

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,440
and meddle in others' affairs.

80
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,640
It's truly annoying.

81
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,960
Isn't that good?

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
Do you want to encounter major cases

83
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,840
of murder or robbery every day?

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,640
That would be good.

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,040
We could show our abilities

86
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,960
and achieve something.

87
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,160
Well,

88
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
don't get overconfident.

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,240
If you meet anyone really vicious,

90
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,040
don't wet your pants.

91
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Don't look down upon me.

92
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,120
Let's have a contest.

93
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,880
Hey, you guys.

94
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,240
If you have time to chat,

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,960
why not get the work done earlier?

96
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,760
Xuntang Town Police Station.

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,240
Is this Officer Jia Bonian?

98
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,560
Yes.

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,240
How may I help?

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,240
I'm Fang Xuewen, who owns
the Foreign Goods Store in town.

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,480
A gang of thugs

102
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,840
is currently robbing my store.

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,240
I hope you can come over now.

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,720
Are you in the store now?

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,360
Yes.

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,240
Have they found you?

107
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,360
Not yet.

108
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,480
But there are four of them.

109
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,560
You'd better send more people.

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
Okay, I got it.

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Alright.

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Time to get to work.

113
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:55,168
(Jingzhi, if I'm not home by midnight,
take refuge at Xu Xiaoxian's place.)

114
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:56,096
(Absolutely do not go to the store.
Xuewen.)

115
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:02,112
(No. 23, Petain Road)

116
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:12,600
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

117
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Hello, Master.

118
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Liu Yangchu,

119
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,040
what are you doing here?

120
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,920
Master,

121
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,440
I'm patrolling here.

122
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
What brings you here

123
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,480
so late at night?

124
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,440
Has anything happened?

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,760
Not at all.

126
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,720
Everything is normal.

127
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,320
But I just

128
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,440
got a call at the station

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,280
from the owner of the store,

130
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,360
saying someone broke in.

131
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,920
No way.

132
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,640
Master,

133
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,320
it could be a prank.

134
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,840
Whose cars are those?

135
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,040
I...

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,040
I don't know, Master.

137
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,080
Liu, pry open the door.

138
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,520
Wait, Master.

139
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,440
What are you doing?

140
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,280
Without a warrant,

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,560
you can't just break in.

142
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,520
What if something is happening inside?

143
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,720
Detective Jia?

144
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
Detective Qin?

145
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,960
How come you were inside?

146
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,080
When I got off work,

147
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,520
I heard some noises inside.

148
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,080
So I went in to take a look.

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
But it turned out to be a false alarm.

150
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm leaving.

151
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,440
Sorry

152
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,440
for bothering you

153
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,640
to come so late at night.

154
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,120
My name is Wang Jiulang.

155
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,680
I'm the keeper of this store.

156
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,760
I heard someone entering the store,

157
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
so I yelled.

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
I thought someone had broken in.

159
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
Fortunately,
Detective Qin was passing by.

160
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,480
He checked inside the store for me.

161
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,960
It turned out to be a cat.

162
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,120
But just now I got a call

163
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,280
at the police station.

164
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,720
It was made by the store owner.

165
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
He said someone had broken in.

166
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,280
I called him immediately

167
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,360
when I heard the noise.

168
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,040
So you mean,

169
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,640
you did not call the police

170
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,560
directly,

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,600
but instead

172
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,440
called your boss

173
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
to let him call the police.

174
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,560
And then

175
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,720
you asked Detective Qin for help?

176
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,360
Detective Jia,

177
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,240
what happened today

178
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,080
was a misunderstanding.

179
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,160
I've checked everywhere.

180
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,320
Nothing is wrong.

181
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
What?

182
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,480
You don't believe me?

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Qin Yaochuan,

184
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,280
stop putting on an act

185
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
in front of so many people.

186
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
May I ask who you are?

187
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,960
I am the one who made the call.

188
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
I am Fang Xuewen, the owner
of the store.

189
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,240
He says he's your boss.

190
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,080
Do you know him?

191
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520
I don't know him.

192
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,040
Of course you don't know me.

193
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,160
Because you know

194
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,280
my old shopkeeper.

195
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
Right now,

196
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,160
he's lying in his duty room.

197
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,080
Don't talk nonsense.

198
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,040
Qin Yaochuan,

199
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,440
say what you want

200
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
to say at the police station.

201
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,280
Liu Yangchu,

202
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,120
whose side are you on?

203
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,360
Master, I...

204
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,120
Jia Bonian,

205
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,560
why are you being sanctimonious?

206
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,920
Are you really

207
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,240
that honorable and upright?

208
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,520
How will you explain the dead body
at the bottom

209
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,040
of the southern lake?

210
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,320
How about

211
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,880
all of us

212
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,600
go and take a look together?

213
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,360
Liu Yangchu.

214
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,040
Do you still remember

215
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,360
what I said?

216
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,800
Don't cover up

217
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,320
one mistake with another.

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,920
That will only make you sink deeper.

219
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,800
Just stop,

220
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,560
Detective Qin.

221
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,840
Liu,

222
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,920
go.
