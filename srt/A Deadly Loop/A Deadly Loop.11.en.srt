Mr. Fang,

5
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,720
when did you come back?

6
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,520
Please sit down.

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,120
Why are you here all alone?

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
Where is Mr. Wang?

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,560
Mr. Wang has an emergency

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,720
at home these days.

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,320
So I am watching over the store for him.

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,560
You should go back and rest.

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,720
Don't sit here.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
It's quite chilly.

15
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,040
At the pier, I asked

16
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,360
about your boat's schedule.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,760
I knew you would come back late.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,720
I was afraid

19
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,480
you would starve

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,440
when you were back.

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,360

22
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,680
