=Episode 1=

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,080
(Latest News.)

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,200
(The soccer final
of the 10th Far Eastern Games)

5
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,360
(has concluded.)

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,720
(Led by Li Huitang, the Chinese)

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,920
(narrowly defeated the Japanese
with a score of 4:3)

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,000
(and won the championship.)

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,760
(Li Huitang secured the win
with a key goal,)

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,760
(proving his title
as Soccer King of Asia again)

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,400
(is well-deserved.)

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,680
(Liu Jingzhi, fiancée)
(A saying circulates among the people)

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,040
(one must watch Mei Lanfang's opera)

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,640
(Fang Xuewen, Foreign Goods Store Owner)
(and Li Huitang's soccer.)

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,920
(Jia Bonian, Detective)
You! Hands on your head. Don't move.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,480
Don't move.

17
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:22,440
(Qin Yaochuan, Deputy Detective)

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,240
Blunt force trauma.

19
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,240
You have a refined hobby.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,880
You like the game the foreigners play.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,920
I saw it once two years ago
at the Shanghai Global Sports Stadium.

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,320
They said it's called golf.

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,800
If this swing were made,

24
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,600
it'd require great strength.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,880
Detective Jia,

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,400
what do you mean?

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:48,920
I didn't kill her.

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,120
I'm not the murderer.

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,720
I'll ask you again.

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,480
Around 7:03 this morning,

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,040
what exactly did you do
to your live-in girlfriend, Liu Jingzhi?

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
It wasn't me.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Detective Jia.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,600
Give me a moment.

35
00:02:06,003 --> 00:02:09,600
(Lost and found. Turning back,
you can see the shore.)

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,640
How was your relationship?

37
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,840
I loved her very much.

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,240
She also loved me very much.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,040
We were planning
to get married next month.

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,400
After seven o'clock this morning,

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,040
apart from you two,

42
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,800
did anyone come to your place?

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
Then, during that time,

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,440
were you always with Miss Liu Jingzhi?

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,760
Or were you apart?

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,840
I went upstairs for a while.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
She was downstairs.

48
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,480
While you were upstairs,

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
what did you do?

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,600
Nothing.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Who was that person?

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
What exactly did you do?

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
My colleagues have asked your neighbors.

54
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,040
You've been having
intense arguments recently.

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,440
This situation has been going on
for half a month.

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,640
It's not that exaggerated.

57
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,440
Fang Xuewen,

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,680
I must remind you.

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,360
At 7:03 this morning,

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,240
Miss Liu once made a call
to the police station.

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,280
She got killed afterwards.

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,640
So during that time,

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,920
what did you do?

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
What did you hear?

65
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,440
You must tell me the truth.

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,920
I've seen many people like you.

67
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,720
Detective!

68
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,760
The fingerprint analysis is out.

69
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,080
It shows

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,160
the only weapon found at the scene
has only your fingerprints on it.

71
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,640
I'm asking you again.

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,880
Who cut off Liu Jingzhi's phone call?

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,080
I'm not the murderer.

74
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
I don't know why
the fingerprints weren't found.

75
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
But I can be sure

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,440
the murderer
is trying to frame me for this.

77
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,480
Alright.

78
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
How about this?

79
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,360
Let's talk about your fiancée's affair.

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
What have you heard?

81
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,040
Indeed, she was a woman who made all men

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,480
lose their minds.

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,080
Shut up.

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,160
But she betrayed you.

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
She cheated on you.

86
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,280
Shut up.

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,680
You wondered

88
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,360
how she looked
when being with another man.

89
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,640
Shut your mouth.

90
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,040
This is exactly how you looked.

91
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,320
Back then, you looked

92
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,920
just like this when you
lost your temper at Liu Jingzhi.

93
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,200
Look.

94
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,120
Look at this.

95
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,680
It wasn't me.

96
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,520
You framed me.

97
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,560
Fang Xuewen,

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,040
you still won't admit it?

99
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,480
Detective Jia.

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,480
Detective Jia.

101
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,240
Don't kill him.

102
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,240
Help.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Untie him

104
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,760
to let him breathe.

105
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,760
(They'll coerce me to confess.)

106
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,480
(I must figure out a way.)

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,200
Don't move.

108
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,920
Don't move.

109
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,504
Fang Xuewen,

110
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
what are you doing?

111
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,320
Put the gun down.

112
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Stay back.

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,520
Don't come over.

114
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,520
Don't come over.

115
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:03,400
Put down the gun.

116
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,040
Don't come over.

117
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,760
Quick. Detective Qin
has been taken hostage.

118
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
Don't come over.

119
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
Listen.

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,760
Even if you haven't killed Liu Jingzhi,

121
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,200
you broke the law.

122
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,320
Talking about the law?

123
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,320
Does law let you treat me this way?

124
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,440
Mr. Fang,

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,840
I can understand your feelings.

126
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,160
Please believe me.

127
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I can help you.

128
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,760
My fiancée is dead.

129
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,960
I can't let her die like this.

130
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,240
I must find out the truth.

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,640
I can't go on like this.

132
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,280
Fang Xuewen.

133
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,400
Listen to me.

134
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,240
Don't act rashly.

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,880
Before things are cleared up,

136
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,960
do not shoot.

137
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,240
Do not shoot.

138
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
Give me a car.

139
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,480
I want to leave here.

140
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,640
Otherwise, I will kill him.

141
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,440
Everyone, follow my command.

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,520
Prepare to shoot at the suspect.

143
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,320
You are silencing me by murder.

144
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Three.

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,680
It seems I can't escape this fate.

146
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,120
Two.

147
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,920
(The soccer final
of the 10th Far Eastern Games)

148
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,840
(is now in the second half.)

149
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,880
(The current score)

150
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,640
(is the Chinese team 3:3 tied
with the Japanese team.)

151
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,960
Just now, I was at the police station.

152
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,880
They... they shot me dead.

153
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,880
Is it because of this watch?

154
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,080
I've brought you a nice thing.

155
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,160
The truth is,

156
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,920
this watch is quite extraordinary.

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,920
It possesses magic.

158
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,120
What kind of magic?

159
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,200
When in danger,

160
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,880
it can help you travel back in time.

161
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,640
This story is well-made.

162
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,960
Jingzhi!

163
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,280
Jingzhi!

164
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Jingzhi!

165
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,320
Jingzhi...

166
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:00,360
It shows

167
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,920
the only weapon found at the scene

168
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,600
has only your fingerprints on it.

169
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,680
No.

170
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,880
This will only add more fingerprints.

171
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,600
