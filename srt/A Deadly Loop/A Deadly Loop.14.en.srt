00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,504
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,040
Mr. Fang.

4
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,960
Try the buns I made myself.

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,880
Mr. Fang?

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,040
Mr. Fang.

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,720
Your face?

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,520
Your clothes?

9
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,560
When did you change your clothes?

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,120
Dirt all over.

11
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,120
Little Witch.

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,520
What are you doing?

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,040
Mr. Fang.

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,520
You look like

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,240
you've been through a real disaster.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,800
Looks like
you've got a serious curse on you!

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,000
Wait a moment.

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,520
Oh, no.

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,200
You can't avoid this bloody calamity.

20
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,920
Little Witch,

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,200
you are right.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,400
Over the past few hours,

23
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,000
I've died over and over.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
Oh, no.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,520
Your brain's wrecked too!

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,840
Little Witch, sit.

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,040
Sit.

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,240
Little Witch,

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,360
listen.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
What I'm gonna say

31
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,520
may be hard to believe.

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,920
But I, Fang Xuewen, swear to God.

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,720
If there's a single word untrue,

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,920
may lightning strike me.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,680
Stop. Stop.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,760
Sorry. Sorry.

37
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,120
Mr. Fang.

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,440
You can't say that lightly.

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,840
If you believe in the supernatural,

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,560
then you should believe what I say.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,440
I've been to the future.

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
In a few hours,

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
some thugs will break into my home

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
and kill Jingzhi.

45
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,960
They collude with the police,

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
and frame me as the murderer.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,440
You are right.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,240
This bloody disaster.

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,920
I may have experienced it.

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,200
But I don't know

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,320
why

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,200
God gives me more than one chance

53
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,160
to return to the past.

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
Throughout this process,

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,360
I've gone through too much.

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,760
That explains why

57
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,920
I am like this now.

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,520
Uh, I...

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,320
These words

60
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
may require some efforts

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,880
for others to understand.

62
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,920
But you are different.

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,720
Little Witch,

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,800
you believe in the supernatural, right?

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,320
Yes, I do.

66
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,920
But you...

67
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,840
You...

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,400
Just over ten minutes ago,

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
I was silenced by two policemen.

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
One is Liu Yangchu.

71
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,960
The other is Qin Yaochuan.

72
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,800
They are both from
Xuntang Town Police Station.

73
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,920
Before that,

74
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,320
I wronged

75
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,240
another detective named Jia Bonian.

76
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,840
Although he treated me

77
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,960
not very nicely,

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,040
he acted with integrity, at least.

79
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,160
He didn't set me up.

80
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,320
Wait a minute.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
You just said

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,200
you were killed by two policemen?

83
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
I was buried alive by them.

85
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,920
They also strangled my neck,

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,320
and shot at me more than once.

87
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,840
Little Witch,

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,320
I am still alive now.

89
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,360
What I'm saying isn't important.

90
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,760
I just want to tell you

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,720
that I am quite normal now.

92
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,880
Clear mind.

93
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,920
Clear thoughts.

94
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,600
I am not mad.

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,320
I am not insane.

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
I'm not a demon, either.

97
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,080
Having said this much,
you believe me now?

98
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,560
I believe you.

99
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,920
With all due respect,

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,680
it is not very wise of us

101
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,240
to wait in such a place at this hour.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,520
Someone will pass by here soon.

103
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,240
Then you will believe what I said.

104
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,920
I do believe what you said.

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,960
I was just joking.

106
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,000
So,

107
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,560
you really know

108
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
what's gonna happen?

109
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,520
To be exact,

110
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,000
I haven't

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,600
experienced anything that happened

112
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,760
between now and one a.m.

113
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
But at earlier hours,

114
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,760
I did get bits of valuable information.

115
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,800
Before those bandits

116
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,320
broke into my home,

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,840
they looted the fakes in my store.

118
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
They also found

119
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,440
the authentic ones.

120
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,840
This means

121
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
someone in that gang knows me well.

122
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,520
This person

123
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,520
also has

124
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,520
some special connection with my store.

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,720
When Qin Yaochuan and Liu Yangchu
were burying me,

126
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,320
they mentioned a name.

127
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,320
To my surprise,

128
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
that Fatty Xu is the sliest one.

129
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,760
He hid a trick up his sleeve.

130
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,680
I believe this person

131
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,960
will show up in front of us soon.

132
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
How much longer?

133
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,960
Very soon.

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,480
The fireworks factory

135
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,880
will explode soon.

136
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Explode?

137
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,680
What?

138
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,080
Even worse things will happen.

139
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
So, we must stop them.

140
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,400
Seriously, Little Witch.

141
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,120
As a girl,

142
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,720
you don't have to risk it with me.

143
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,560
You can still leave now.

144
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,240
Maybe my lame fighting skills

145
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,320
work better than yours.

146
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,760
Remember what I told you earlier?

147
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,080
Should you face any difficulties,

148
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,080
I won't stand by.

149
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,800
Then let's get real.

150
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,480
Alright.

151
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,880
Here it comes.

152
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,280
Hey.

153
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,680
Who's parking here at night?

154
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,080
Mr. Fang?

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,600
Foreman Xu, long time no see.

156
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,880
Mr. Fang.

157
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,760
What are you doing here?

158
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,600
That's the question for you.

159
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,720
(Xu Zhaohe, Foreman of Foreign Goods Store)
Mr. Fang.

160
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,480
It has nothing to do with me.

161
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,480
Those two cops from the police station

162
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,680
brought me in.

163
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,800
Then why did you run?

164
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,760
I was scared.

165
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,040
I won't do it again.

166
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,960
I won't run.

167
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,000
What about this then?

168
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,280
Mr. Fang.

169
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,080
If I guess it right,

170
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
it contains

171
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,200
something from Foreign Goods Store.

172
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,920
This is the genuine jewelry

173
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,880
hidden in the warehouse.

174
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,560
Those aware of this

175
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
are only me and Jingzhi.

176
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,480
I almost suspected her

177
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,720
for this.

178
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,320
Turns out it's you.

179
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,800
Such a traitor.

180
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,280
Mr. Fang.

181
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,160
Save me.

182
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,120
When I was doing my job at your place,

183
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,880
I overheard this secret.

184
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,160
Apart from Mr. Wang,
the one who knows about this

185
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,280
is only you.

186
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,920
Please, let me go.

187
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,496
Tell me.

188
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:19,480
What is going on?

189
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,360
I'll tell you.

190
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,720
They forced me.

191
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,120
(A Month Ago)
Move.

192
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,120
Move.

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
Over there.

194
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Get a bowl and chopsticks
for Foreman Xu.

195
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,880
Please give me more time.

196
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll repay this money soon.

197
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,200
I never heard that

198
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,000
a casino is a place for raising money.

199
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,480
With your gambling luck,

200
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,880
you're going to lose money.

201
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,760
I'm begging you.

202
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,560
Please.

203
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,880
Spare me.

204
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,680
Look at you.

205
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,520
Get up.

206
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,360
Get up.

207
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,320
I asked you here today

208
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,880
for a good deal.

209
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
What do you mean?

210
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,480
In the town,

211
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,720
there's a Foreign Goods Store
owned by some Mr. Fang.

212
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,800
Do you know him?

213
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,000
Are you talking about

214
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,760
Mr. Fang Xuewen?

215
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
Mr. Fang is my client.

216
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,480
When he renovated the store,

217
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,200
he used

218
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,960
my construction team to help him out.

219
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Be more specific.

220
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,080
I...

221
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,560
From adhesive tapes

222
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,480
to furniture repairs

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,480
and lock replacement,

224
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,560
all were done by me.

225
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,960
Even the locks.

226
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,760
Seems he trusts him a lot.

227
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,000
Look.

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,280
When is a good time

229
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,480
for us to go and take a look?

230
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,320
Our boss

231
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,760
uses an appointment system
for the store.

232
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,800
There are some valuable foreign goods,

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,480
not for public display.

234
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,160
I mean,

235
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,000
when is a good time

236
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,560
to bring out

237
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,680
the treasures of the store?

238
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,720
Officer.

239
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,960
I... I wouldn't dare.

240
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
Besides, Mr. Fang is my client.

241
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,720
I can't.

242
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
He's also very nice to me...

243
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,560
If I remember correctly,

244
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,080
had I not spoken up for you,

245
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,080
the debts you owe

246
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
would make you die
several times over by now.

247
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,880
At the very least,

248
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,840
think about your wife and daughter.

249
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
I heard you sent them back to

250
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,360
your wife's parental home in Suzhou.

251
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,720
Yangchu,

252
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,440
how long does it take for a round trip?

253
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,200
Half a day should be enough.

254
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,760
Detective.

255
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,760
It has nothing to do with them.

256
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,880
Please leave them alone.

257
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,120
Then, think it over carefully.

258
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,720
Do you want to be loyal to your client,

259
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,200
or keep your family safe?

260
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,960
Alright then.

261
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,680
No rush to answer me.

262
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,960
You can go back

263
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,640
and think it through.

264
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,480
I'll give you one day.

265
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,560
You can leave.

266
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,680
Thanks.

267
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Thanks, Detective.

268
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,520
Leave.

269
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:08,160
Follow him.

270
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,680
Luo.

271
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,400
Why didn't you leave any meat to me?

272
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,680
Eat well, work well.
