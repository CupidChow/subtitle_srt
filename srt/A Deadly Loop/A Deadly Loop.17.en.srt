Xuewen.

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,480
What happened to you?

5
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,520
How did you get injured?

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,520
I ran

7
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,320
into some trouble.

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,560
What happens next

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,720
might implicate you.

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,120
I know this all seems absurd.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,560
But there is no time.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,240
But you look seriously injured.

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,320
Let's go to the hospital.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,440
No need.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,560
Who exactly did this to you?

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,240
I'll call the police.

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,000
Don't do that.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,400
They can't help.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,080
What on earth happened to you?

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,400
You've really scared me.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,120
There's enough time.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,240
Listen to me.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,640
In 15 minutes,

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,920
the ship at the dock leaves.

25
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,720
Let's pack our luggage

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,520
and depart now.

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,640
We're leaving here?

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Why?

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,520
To survive.

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,200
Look at me.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,720
Do you think I'm joking?

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,720
Okay.

Jingzhi,

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,920
find Mr. Henry
in the French Concession of Shanghai.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
He will protect you.

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,680
I will take you back
after everything is over.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
Aren't you coming with me?

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,960
I can't leave now.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,320
I have something very important to do.

42
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,240
As long as you are safe,

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,120
I will have no regrets.

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,280
Can you tell me

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,720
what exactly has happened?

46
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
I will definitely tell you.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Trust me.

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,720
But I cannot tell you now.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,320
Little Witch?

50
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,840
Little Witch!

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,320
Jingzhi!

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,840
I must stop these scoundrels.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,040
The tragedy must not be repeated.

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,160
I don't have the patience

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,160
to waste time with you.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,480
It's almost 7:50 AM now.

57
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,520
Just at midnight today.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,040
Before I get off work
from the police station,

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,600
the fireworks factory will explode.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
We will never let a criminal go.

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,400
Nor will we wrong a good person.

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,880
Master,

63
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,920
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,280
(It seems now)

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,360
(Officer Jia is the trustworthy one.)

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,920
Officer.

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Officer.

68
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,680
I need your help.

69
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,680
I own the Foreign Goods Store in town.

70
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,440
I'm Fang Xuewen.

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,280
My store

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,480
was looted by a bunch of thugs.

73
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,360
They injured me.

74
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,640
I barely managed to escape.

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,880
You must help me.

76
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,960
Where are they now? How many

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,880
of them are there?

78
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
There are four of them.

79
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
If nothing happens,

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,480
they're still at my store.

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
You are injured.

82
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
Go to the hospital for a check-up.

83
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,720
I'll deal with them.

84
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,296
Okay.

85
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:43,920
Follow me.

86
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,080
No need.

87
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,120
I know the address.

88
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,400
But there are four of them.

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,280
I know.

90
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
I have colleagues around there.

91
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,880
They should still be on patrol
at this time.

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,760
I can call them for backup.

93
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,720
Do you mean
Qin Yaochuan and Liu Yangchu?

94
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,560
How do you know?

95
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,800
They are in cahoots with the thugs.

96
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
You must be joking.

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,480
It's absolutely true.

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,760
They are using their positions
to commit crimes.

99
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
These injuries are caused by them.

100
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm telling you.

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
If you tell a single lie,

102
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,400
I'll make sure you pay for it.

103
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,360
No problem.

104
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
You must believe me.

105
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,960
Alright.

106
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,720
Let's go.

107
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,520
Okay.

108
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,160
Look.

109
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,840
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)
Their cars.

110
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
Are you sure

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,640
they're now in your store?

112
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,480
Yes, I'm sure.

113
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,680
And my housekeeper
might have been killed already.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,280
Liu Yangchu?

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,800
Right.

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,680
He's keeping watch.

117
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
Don't speak.

118
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,120
I can judge for myself.

119
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,280
Listen.

120
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,160
You stay here.

121
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't go anywhere.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Do not come out,

123
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,680
no matter what.

124
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,200
Okay.

125
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,280
It's done.

126
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Go inside and check.

127
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,120
They are fighting.

128
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,920
What happened?

129
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,680
Master?

130
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
Why are you here?

131
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,720
I happened to be passing by.

132
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,800
And I saw you.

133
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,600
You are still on duty?

134
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,760
This area is under my jurisdiction.

135
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm patrolling.

136
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,800
What's going on inside here?

137
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I was about to question,

138
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,920
and then you arrived.

139
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,480
Well, Officer,

140
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,480
I was working inside.

141
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,920
I just finished.

142
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,600
Why didn't you turn on the light?

143
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
I was packing up things.

144
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,920
I came out quickly.

145
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
Are you sure the people inside
were with you?

146
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,920
Yes.

147
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,200
I just finished and came out.

148
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Let's have a look.

149
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
What are you waiting for?

150
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,920
Okay, Master.

151
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,320
You go in too.

152
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,080
I...

153
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
Okay.

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Qin Yaochuan,

155
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,280
what's going on?

156
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,120
Didn't you deal with the police?

157
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,880
I don't know.

158
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,280
Fatso,

159
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,560
you betrayed us.

160
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,680
I was wondering

161
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
why you disappeared.

162
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,960
I didn't.

163
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,920
I really didn't.

164
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,360
Misunderstanding.

165
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,520
Misunderstanding.

166
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,880
Having a party?

167
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,200
You are all acquaintances.

168
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
Qin Yaochuan.

169
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,680
Help.

170
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,400
I thought you were here on patrol.

171
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
I didn't expect you to have a side job.

172
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
Since you've seen it all,

173
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,480
there's nothing to say.

174
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,120
You may as well shoot.

175
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,800
But tonight,

176
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,160
don't think
about leaving this courtyard.

177
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,560
