00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:41,312
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,160
Who is it?

4
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:52,032
(Xu Xiaoxian, The Little Witch)

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,640
Little Witch?

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,560
Why are you here?

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,960
I made a talisman for you.

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,200
I brought it over for you.

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,320
How about

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,200
a raincheck?

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,200
Your face...

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,040
I fell.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,280
I see.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,120
Pretty bad fall, huh?

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,240
Do you need help?

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm fine.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,880
Maybe another day.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,560
Wait.

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,720
Something has happened, right?

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,720
Nothing happened.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,360
Such a strong smell of blood.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,480
Little Witch.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Why did you do this?

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,280
I didn't kill Jingzhi.

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,200
I swear to heaven.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,520
I love Jingzhi the most.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,320
Even though

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,080
we argued over our relationship,

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,880
I am still willing

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,360
to exchange my life for hers.

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,680
I've known you for many years.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,600
I know what kind of person you are.

33
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,720
But this is a matter of life and death.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,560
There's no time left.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,720
Little Witch, listen to me.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,960
I have been to the future.

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,160
It's true.

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
They will come very soon.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,960
Who?

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,800
Two police officers.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,120
They will frame me,

42
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,080
saying I am the murderer of Jingzhi.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,720
Then I won't stand their torture,

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,880
and I grab one of their guns.

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,080
But while I am running away,

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,560
I am shot dead by them.

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,920
Mr. Fang, I think you've gone mad.

48
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
I suspect that you're the murderer.

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,080
I knew you wouldn't believe me
if I said so.

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,160
Let me put it this way.

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,600
One of those two

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,920
is called Jia Bonian.

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,440
He is in his fifties or sixties.

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,680
The younger one is named...

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,000
Qin Yaochuan.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,880
He is fair

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
and gentle

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,640
and looks somewhat thin.

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,360
How do you know?

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,000
I have told you.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,200
I have been to the future.

62
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,120
The radio.

63
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,400
It will broadcast the morning news
immediately.

64
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,400
In the 10th Far Eastern Games,

65
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,440
Li Huitang led the Chinese team
to win the Japanese team.

66
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,400
The score is 4:3.

67
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,120
Alright.

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,720
If it's like you said

69
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,680
and the police'll come,

70
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,960
but how do they know
that a murder has occurred here?

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,600
Jingzhi called the police.

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,720
Jingzhi knew who the killer is?

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,480
I am not sure.

74
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,200
I heard she called the police

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,720
from the mouth of the future police.

76
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,520
The future again.

77
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,920
You are talking nonsense.

78
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Little Witch,

79
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,480
help me.

80
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,920
Please help me.

81
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,920
We received a report saying...

82
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,560
Little Witch.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,480
(These two policemen
are indeed as he described.)

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,280
Little Witch.

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,160
Check her out.

86
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
No breathing.

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
Blunt force trauma.

88
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,400
Look for more clues.

89
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,960
Don't miss any single spot.

90
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,200
Protect the scene.

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,280
Yes.

92
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
Who are you two?

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
I am the owner of this house.

94
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,160
She was my fiancée.

95
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,440
And you?

96
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
My name is Xu Xiaoxian.

97
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm a friend of Mr. Fang.

98
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,720
Detective Jia.

99
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
I found a pistol.

100
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,920
An old-fashioned revolver.

101
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,800
What do you need this gun for?

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,600
Collecting.

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,120
Where did you get it?

104
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,000
French Concession.

105
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,400
I worked
at the Municipal Board of Directors.

106
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,480
I could get foreign goods.

107
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,280
Detective Jia,

108
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,200
He owns the foreign goods store in town.

109
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,880
Miss Xu,

110
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
come out with me.

111
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,280
How long have you had this gun?

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,760
About a month, I guess.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,720
I suddenly remembered something.

114
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,600
Two weeks ago,

115
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,760
your fiancée, Liu Jingzhi, came

116
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,680
to the police station to file a report.

117
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,480
I was the one who took the case.

118
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:07,200
(Half a month ago)

119
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,480
You want to file a report?

120
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,040
Yes.

121
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,640
Tell me what happened.

122
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm the manager
of a foreign goods store.

123
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,440
Recently, I've been feeling

124
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,680
someone has been following me.

125
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,360
The store holds some valuable items.

126
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
I worry

127
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
it might be targeted
by someone with ulterior motives.

128
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,240
Take note of this.

129
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,120
I've checked out that person.

130
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
Guess who it is.

131
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,880
It's you.

132
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,680
When Liu Jingzhi found out,

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,200
she withdrew her accusation.

134
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,160
So can you tell me

135
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,760
why on earth

136
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,200
you were following your fiancée?

137
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,960
I just wanted to figure out

138
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,720
exactly who was pestering her.

139
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,000
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)
(One month ago)

140
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51,968
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

141
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Where is Jingzhi?

142
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,000
Jingzhi?

143
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,320
Jingzhi just called,

144
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,160
saying she isn't feeling too well.

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,960
Tell me the truth.

146
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,560
(Mr. Wang, the Housekeeper)

147
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,160
Young Master,

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
don't blame me for being nosy.

149
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,240
Previously, Miss Jingzhi attended
to every little detail.

150
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,800
Lately, she seems different.

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,960
Something must be going on.

152
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,280
Something?

153
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
What is it?

154
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,480
Last time, a strange man came.

155
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,120
Miss Jingzhi looked very surprised.

156
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,080
Then she took the man out.

157
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,760
It was a while before she returned.

158
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
I took some pastries to her.

159
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,840
But I saw her hiding
in the inner room and crying.

160
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,240
It's kind of strange.

161
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
Jingzhi.

162
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,200
You scared me.

163
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,600
It's so late.

164
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
Why not turn on the light?

165
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,120
How come you came back early

166
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,320
without telling me?

167
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,080
You came back so late.

168
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
It's almost one o'clock.

169
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,560
The store has been busy lately.

170
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
I've just finished
handling this month's accounts.

171
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,680
I happened to visit the store today.

172
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,080
I heard from Mr. Wang
that you seemed to be feeling unwell.

173
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
I've brought you medicine.

174
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,480
I'm fine.

175
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,320
I'll go up and wash up first.

176
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,160
Wait.

177
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,680
In a month, we'll be getting married.

178
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,280
I've already laid

179
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,080
what I can give you before you
with no reservations.

180
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,880
I wonder how prepared you are.

181
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,480
Xuewen,

182
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,280
I'm a bit tired today.

183
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,360
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

184
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,440
(Xuewen,)

185
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,400
(will you forgive me?)

186
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,920
(Jingzhi,)

187
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
(why did you lie?)

188
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,280
Hello.

189
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,080
I'd like you to check

190
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,680
all the phone call records
at No. 28, Guantang Street,

191
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,960
for the past two months.

192
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
Please wait a moment.

193
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,880
Okay.

194
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,600
17373.

195
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,480
(July 20th, 17373)

196
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,600
17373.

197
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,160
Hello.

198
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,960
Hello.

199
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,800
Excuse me.

200
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,760
Which room did the lady

201
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,880
who just came in enter?

202
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,120
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,840
May I ask
about your relationship with her?

204
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,360
And who booked the room?

205
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:04,064
(Luo Changsheng, Nine)

206
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,880
Luo Changsheng.

207
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,000
Luo Changsheng?

208
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,960
Who is it?

209
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
(How come no one is here?)

210
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,400
Oh.

211
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,000
I see.

212
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,440
You're saying someone
was having an affair with your fiancée.

213
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,160
Right?

214
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,280
So you wanted to follow your fiancée

215
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,920
to find out the other man's identity.

216
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,000
As a man,

217
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,400
I understand how you feel.

218
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,720
If it's true,

219
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
it's not something to be tolerated.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
I didn't kill her.

221
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,600
Moreover, she was my fiancée.

222
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,320
We value evidence.

223
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,800
We will never let a criminal go.

224
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,920
Nor will we wrong a good person.

225
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,160
What do you know about Fang Xuewen
and his fiancée's

226
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,800
relationship?

227
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,880
Their relationship
has always been quite good.

228
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,720
All the others can prove that too.

229
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,600
(Latest News.)

230
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,000
(The soccer final)

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
(of the 10th Far Eastern Games
has concluded.)

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,520
(Led by Li Huitang, the Chinese)

233
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,720
(narrowly defeated the Japanese
with a score of 4:3)

234
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,800
(and won the championship.)

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
Could it be

236
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,080
he was telling the truth?

237
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,640
Mr. Fang,

238
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,840
I'll shoot if you keep running.

239
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,360
Wait.

240
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,280
A misunderstanding.

241
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,200
Don't obstruct me.

242
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,920
Go away.

243
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,600
Go.

244
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,120
Are you an accomplice?

245
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,840
Get out of my way.

246
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,560
