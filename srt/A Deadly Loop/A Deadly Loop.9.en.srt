=Episode 9=

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,920
Stand properly.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,760
I'm going to arrest you.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,960
Do you know what you are doing?

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
You attacked and kidnapped a policeman.

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,240
Do you know the consequences?

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,040
Police officer?

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,640
Scum like you

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,640
don't deserve that title.

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,120
Listen to me.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
I will personally

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,800
take you to the police station

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,200
and let your colleagues see

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,560
what kind of scum you are.

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,640
You can kill me.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,400
But you cannot insult me.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Save your quibbling.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,600
Don't you know

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
how much evil you did?

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,000
We have never met before.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,520
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,760
Then you better listen closely.

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,040
Abusing your post,

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,520
you colluded with Luo Changsheng,

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,960
robbed my store,

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
and killed my housekeeper, Mr. Wang.

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,840
Later, you killed your accomplice
over uneven spoils.

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,000
If I remember correctly,

30
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,600
you planned to break in,

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
kill my fiancée,

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,920
and then

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,920
put on your uniform

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,400
and throw dirt on me

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
before torturing me

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,640
for a confession.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,520
I still remember

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,480
how you treated me.

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,320
You scoundrel!

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
You thought your plan

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,600
was perfect, didn't you?

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,760
Too bad

43
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,200
heaven has been watching you.

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,640
You've ultimately fallen into my hands.

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,520
Speechless, aren't you?

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,720
You wonder
how I know so much, don't you?

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,840
No worries.

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,760
Once we're at the police station,

49
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,720
I will finish telling you the story.

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,120
Sir,

51
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,600
is there some misunderstanding
between us?

52
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,760
I mean,

53
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,720
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

54
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,120
Does the story you just told

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,320
have anything to do with me?

56
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Stop playing dumb.

57
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
Before the explosion occurred,

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,720
I'd been on duty at the station.

59
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,680
When I got the news,

60
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
I rushed to the scene

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,920
to deal with the case.

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,840
I was about to go home and rest

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,360
when you stopped me halfway.

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,640
Do you have to

65
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,440
call the police this way?

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,880
Why did you try to detain me?

67
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,560
Because I found something wrong with you

68
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,280
and your car.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
With your current condition,

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,520
you should get checked

71
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,560
at a psychiatric hospital instead.

72
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Shut up.

73
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
You talk too much.

74
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,856
(Substation Two, Xuntang Police Station)

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,640
Come out.

76
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,920
Is anyone there?

77
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
I need help.

78
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,640
There's no one inside now.

79
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,680
Shut up.

80
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,000
There must be someone on duty.

81
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,120
Move.

82
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,120
Where's everybody?

83
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,120
Listen.

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
The chief has called everyone

85
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,160
to the explosion scene.

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,000
Our police station is small.

87
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,440
It doesn't have many people.

88
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,400
Then I'll wait.

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
I'll wait even till dawn.

90
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,840
Can you uncuff me first?

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,720
My hand is injured

92
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,800
and bleeding a lot.

93
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm warning you.

94
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,800
Don't play tricks on me.

95
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,120
I'm telling you.

96
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,320
People like you

97
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,120
should have both hands disabled

98
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,320
to prevent you
from doing despicable things.

99
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:49,696
(Substation Two, Xuntang Police Station)

100
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,760
They're back.

101
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,880
Mr. Fang,

102
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,760
(Liu Yangchu, Police Officer)
what are you doing?

103
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,560
Officer Liu.

104
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,560
Officer Liu, please listen to me.

105
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
I originally came over

106
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,120
to report Jia Bonian

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,840
for being involved
in murder and robbery.

108
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,240
But he just

109
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,720
initiated an attack on me.

110
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
I had no choice.

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
I did this for self-defense.

112
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
He was a policeman.

113
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,160
He was not like you.

114
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,200
He was a bad guy.

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
Listen to me.

116
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,000
I have evidence.

117
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,200
My man is now dead in the store.

118
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,000
But the murderer is still at large.

119
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,240
I know where that person has fled to.

120
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
I can find the evidence.

121
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,120
Officer Liu,

122
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
you must believe me.

123
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Even if that's the case,

124
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,120
Mr. Fang,

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
you need to do as I request.

126
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
Please cooperate

127
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
and put the gun down.

128
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
Put the gun down.

129
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,320
Back off. Back off.

130
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,920
Hands on your head.

131
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,160
Get down.

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,880
Get down.

133
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,680
Officer Liu?

134
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:06,656
(One year ago)

135
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,360
Officer,

136
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,520
please let me go.

137
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,560
I'm just trying to make a living.

138
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,360
Smuggling is illegal.

139
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,040
Let alone that you're smuggling opium.

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Come with me.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,160
Don't resist.

142
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,400
I'm not smuggling opium.

143
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,160
Don't quibble.

144
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,560
I've seen many like you.

145
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Liu, let him go.

146
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,080
They're just selling illicit salt.

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,240
What's the matter with you?

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,280
Didn't you hold back?

149
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,320
You've killed him.

150
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
No. I didn't mean it.

151
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,080
When I caught him,

152
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,880
he resisted.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,880
I didn't know.

154
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,080
I didn't mean it, master.

155
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
One, two.

156
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,592
(Don't forget what you've done.)

157
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:59,584
(C: Jia Bonian)

158
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,320
Broken ring finger of left hand.

159
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,880
The one attacked me
at the police station

160
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,440
and my store

161
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,480
was the same person,

162
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Liu Yangchu.

163
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,480
And Jia Bonian

164
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,720
was also their accomplice.

165
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,480
The person who attacked me

166
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
and Luo Changsheng in the wilderness

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,800
was also him.

168
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,000
Obviously,

169
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,280
Luo Changsheng

170
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,320
and them had differences.

171
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,040
But what can't be confirmed now

172
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
is whether Jia Bonian

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
and Liu Yangchu had differences.

174
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,360
The three of them

175
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,600
acted separately.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,800
No. They weren't

177
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,880
the only corrupt cops.
