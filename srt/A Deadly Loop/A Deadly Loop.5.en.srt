=Episode 5=

3
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,000
Mr. Wang must be in trouble.

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,280
Ah?

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,400
Go look for Xu Xiaoxian right now.

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,600
Tell her I sent you to find her.

7
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,720
Don't ever come back.
She'll protect you.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,800
I'll go save Mr. Wang.

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,120
What exactly happened?

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,280
Should we call the police?

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,400
It's of no use.

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,640
Those cops only make things worse.

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,720
Don't worry about me.

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,920
I'll come back to you safe and sound.

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
Trust me.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Um.

17
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:38,176
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

18
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:51,936
(Luo Changsheng)

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,000
Mr. Fang.

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,000
I asked the Municipal Board of Directors

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
and found Luo Changsheng's details.

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,560
Here you are.

23
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,080
(Luo Changsheng Investigation Record)
He worked for Qing Gang,

24
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
and was fairly well-known
on the Bund back then.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,120
Eight years ago,
he was imprisoned for robbery.

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,400
By now, he should be out.

27
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,280
Mr. Fang.

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,040
How did you get involved with him?

29
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,592
(Imprisoned for Robbery)

30
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,000
(Luo Changsheng)

31
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:40,320
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,080
Mr. Wang.

33
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,600
(I)

34
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,160
(come too late.)

35
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
Like this.

36
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,600
Spread out a bit.

37
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
Impressive, huh!

38
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,680
Great!

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,600
Mr. Wang.

40
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,560
(I'll definitely find the killer.)

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,440
The killer didn't harm Jingzhi
inside the Foreign Goods Store.

42
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,720
Despite it all,

43
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,960
he came to the house
and killed her hours later.

44
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,320
Why on earth is that?

45
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,240
What exactly happened here?

46
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,240
(The jewelry hidden)

47
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,480
(is only known to me,
Mr. Wang and Jingzhi.)

48
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,040
(Mr. Wang would never betray me.)

49
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
(Could it be...?)

50
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:28,120
Done?

51
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,800
Hold on a moment.

52
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Let me see.

53
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,464
Not bad.

54
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,040
Check if that screw is tightened.

55
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
Okay, okay.

56
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,920
Alright. Just make sure
it doesn't fall off.

57
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,240
Okay, be careful.

58
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,840
Young master, it's done.

59
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,440
Why do you hang the camera there?

60
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,680
To prevent theft.

61
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,160
To prevent theft?

62
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,440
I know cameras can take pictures.

63
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,360
I've never heard they can prevent theft.

64
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:55,520
Mr. Wang.

65
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,480
Broadened my horizons.

66
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
Once someone jimmies this showcase,

67
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,440
it will trigger the device
connected to the camera.

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,040
Once the camera's mechanism
is triggered,

69
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,120
click.

70
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,520
Everyone present

71
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,040
will be clearly photographed.

72
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,040
Then, we just give the photo
to the police.

73
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,640
The rest is their job.

74
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,720
Ah, young master,

75
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,480
so clever!

76
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,880
Well, I learnt it

77
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,280
from those
of the Municipal Board of Directors.

78
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
In Europe, it's called

79
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,120
interior monitoring.

80
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,640
The camera was triggered.
Let's see what it caught.

81
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,800
(Missing a finger.)

82
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,080
(I brought back a handgun last loop.)

83
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,640
(I should bring the film this time.)

84
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,080
(I must see)

85
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,960
