=Episode 22=

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,680
What are you doing?

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,000
No instructions.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,880
No sight of you.

6
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,520
What time is it now!

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,720
What's going on?

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:53,680
Fang...

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,520
Mr. Fang.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,200
Operation is canceled.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,120
You can go.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,600
Luo Changsheng.

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,400
Are you messing with us?

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,840
Detective Qin.

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,000
Fang Xuewen

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,480
took the stuff here himself.

17
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,080
Such priceless jewelry

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,920
for nothing?

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,120
Aren't you guys

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,160
in cahoots

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,680
trying to scam us with fakes?

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,920
Why would you say that?

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,720
I... I have seen him use fakes

24
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,120
for exhibition.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Overthinking

26
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,200
may not be a good thing.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,840
You should go.

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,440
No one leaves today.

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,360
Now,

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,720
it's not your call.

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,600
Well.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,600
About to show your true colors?

33
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,120
Qin Yaochuan.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,960
Let me ask you.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,600
What's with the bomb

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,560
in the back of my car?

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,080
Over these years,

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,920
you've grown in your means.

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,720
Who are you

40
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,800
to talk to me like that?

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm a police officer.

42
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,480
You're just a thief

43
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,680
fresh out of prison.

44
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,600
Why should we be at your mercy?

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Why should we trust you?

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,880
Liu Yangchu.

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,720
Take his gun.

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,560
Wait a second.

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,320
Liu Yangchu.

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,200
You don't think only he

51
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
knows your secret,

52
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
do you?

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,960
Don't cover up one mistake

54
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,520
with another.

55
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,320
Your master told you this,

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,200
didn't he?

57
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,600
So many years have passed.

58
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,960
I believe

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,520
your master

60
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,880
has always lived in fear

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,200
and self-blame.

62
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,800
Killing a suspect

63
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,600
is indeed a mistake.

64
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
But you chose to conceal it.

65
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,480
This gives those with ulterior motives

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,920
the chance to take advantage.

67
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,800
Think about it carefully.

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,880
Are you just
letting yourself go like this?

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,840
Xu Zhaohe.

70
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
You're spying on me

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,360
and eyeing my stuff.

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,160
But I really don't care.

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,920
I just don't understand.

74
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
I've always treated you well.

75
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,120
Why are you setting me up?

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,080
If you just want

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
to repay your gambling debts,

78
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,960
you can just take these jewels.

79
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,280
Just check out

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
it they are real or fake.

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,600
Really necessary

82
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,120
to do sneaky stuff like this?

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,240
The clock is broken.

84
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,840
It saved me from a bullet.

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,400
Luo Changsheng.

86
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,600
Xuntang police station

87
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,720
got a report from a citizen.

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,080
Qin Yaochuan is suspected

89
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,120
of multiple extortion

90
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,200
and assault incidents.

91
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,960
Now we are making an official arrest.

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Liu Yangchu,

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,160
suspected of involuntary manslaughter,

94
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,520
will also face a public trial.

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,160
Accomplice Jia Bobian

96
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
has surrendered to the police.

97
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,480
Take them off.

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,920
Luo Changsheng.

99
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,080
(9:01 PM)

100
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,160
(I've finally made it.)

101
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,840
Xuewen.

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,120
You're finally awake.

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,120
Finally awake.

104
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,080
Finally awake.

105
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,360
Master, Madam.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
Rest assured.

107
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,320
I will never forget

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
your great kindness.

109
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,680
The young master has grown up now.

110
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,920
I will use my life

111
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,720
to protect his safety.

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,680
Rest assured.

113
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Extra! Extra!

114
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,840
Extra! Extra!

115
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,520
Police and citizens collaborate

116
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,960
to catch criminals.

117
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,720
Give me a copy.

118
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,320
Extra!

119
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,040
Extra!

120
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,240
Extra!

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,000
Extra!

122
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Here you are.

123
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,960
(Work Safety)

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,560
Slow down.

125
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,880
Slow down.

126
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,920
Slow down.

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,440
That's so sad!

128
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,720
Big brother,

129
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,760
thank you.

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,600
Thank you.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,120
You're welcome.

132
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,320
Smile.

133
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,280
Smile.

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,960
Mr. Wang.

135
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
Young master.

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,520
You're back.

137
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,800
This morning, someone

138
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
brought a package for you.

139
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,120
Here you are.

140
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,080
Are these jewels ours?

141
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,840
(Mr. Fang,
thank you for your generosity.)

142
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,120
(Zhaohe is much grateful. I'll
quit gambling and be an upright man.)

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Mr. Fang and Mrs. Fang.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Ready for the photo?

145
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,160
Get closer.

146
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,520
Right.

147
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,680
A little closer, please.

148
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,840
Just like this.

149
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,920
Fantastic.

150
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,560
Ready, three, two, one.

151
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
Wait.

152
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,680
Still leaving?

153
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,880
You are all lovey-dovey.

154
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,120
So it is too hard for me.

155
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,280
Changsheng.

156
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
These snacks

157
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,920
are for you.

158
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,520
Thank you for being

159
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,880
there with me on those days.

160
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,680
I'll never forget.

161
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,840
I was always upset before,

162
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,080
and worried that
you might be with another man.

163
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,520
Now I'm relieved.

164
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,080
A man with divine powers

165
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,680
risked his life for you.

166
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,560
He is better than me.

167
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,240
Divine powers?

168
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,440
This is our secret.

169
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:19,616
(Wenhua Hotel)

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,920
Here you are.

171
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,560
Take care.

172
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,600
Check it out.

173
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,560
Extra! Extra!

174
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,280
Fang's Store has a new building.

175
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,360
Get me a copy.

176
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Don't cry, okay?

177
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,480
Don't cry. Let's find Dad.

178
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,280
Xuewen.

179
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,680
Baby, don't cry.

180
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,560
It's so late.

181
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Why are you still awake?

182
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,320
I've still got some documents
to sort out.

183
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,480
Those regular customers

184
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,760
keep asking us to ship goods.

185
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,920
I am

186
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,440
so lucky

187
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,480
to have such a capable and virtuous wife

188
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,440
as you.

189
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,880
Smooth talker!

190
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,760
He's sleepy.

191
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,440
Go to bed.

192
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,560
Let's go.

193
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,600
Off to sleep.

194
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,200
