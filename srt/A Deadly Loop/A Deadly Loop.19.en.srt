=Episode 19=

3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,440
Take him back to the police station.

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,120
Call for backup.

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,920
Understood.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,000
Move.

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,920
Liu Yangchu,

8
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,320
I have always believed

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,800
that you're a kind-hearted young man.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,280
I am responsible for having

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,760
let things come to this.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,520
After going back,

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,520
I will confess to my superiors.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,000
If I had

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,360
enforced the law impartially,

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,080
I wouldn't have given this scum

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,400
any leverage.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,080
Master,

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,640
thank you for what you did.

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,320
Actually,

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
since that day,

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,320
I've been having nightmares every day.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,320
Now, I actually feel much better.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,600
Officer Jia,

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
with what you just did,

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,440
we will all be considered

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,920
the disgrace of the police force.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,520
Won't you regret this?

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,560
People can't

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,160
live in the shadows their entire lives.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,160
I'm impressed.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,840
I truly am.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,520
Take him away.

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,840
There's one more person.

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,600
Officer Jia!

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,960
Xu Zhaohe,

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,600
I've treated you well.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,920
Why did you betray me?

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,040
Mr. Fang,

40
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,560
I beg you.

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,520
Please let me go.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
Mr. Fang!

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,320
Put down the gun.

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,800
I have a family.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,320
I really need this money.

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Let me go.

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,120
Mr. Fang,

48
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,040
you are the only one who knows I'm here.

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm sorry,

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,200
Mr. Fang.

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
I don't have my glasses.

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,200
I can't see you clearly.

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,000
Chirp.

54
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
Chirp now.

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,480
Mr. Wang.

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,840
Young master,

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
you're back.

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,160
I'd like a favor from you.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,320
No problem.

60
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,720
Don't sleep here tonight.

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,560
Young master, did I do something wrong

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,680
so you want to fire me?

63
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm not firing you.

64
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,560
I just want you

65
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,920
to stay at my place for the night.

66
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,520
It's inappropriate.

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,040
The lock on my place's door is broken.

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,880
I'd like you

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,000
to come in case of theft.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
You could have called.

71
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
You don't have to come over in person.

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,880
Well, I have something

73
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,360
to deal with at the store tonight.

74
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,520
I must sleep here.

75
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,360
Young master,

76
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
it's inappropriate.

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
What's inappropriate?

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,000
Young master.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,560
Don't I know my own store well enough?

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,520
You should've called.

81
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,320
Take this.

82
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,240
It'll be fine. Trust me.

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
- Look...
- Trust me.

84
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,080
Young master.

85
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,880
Rest assured, Mr. Wang.

86
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,080
Relax. Just be at ease.

87
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
You shouldn't do this.

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
It's alright.

89
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,320
Alright.

90
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Bye-bye.

91
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,920
Rest assured.

92
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:20,256
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

93
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
What the heck?

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,120
Oh, no.

95
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,120
How could this be?

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,000
That's a camera.

97
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Don't shoot.

98
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Someone will hear it.

99
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
Climb up

100
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,920
and smash it.

101
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,520
What is this?

102
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,640
It's wood glue.

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
Wood glue.

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,920
It's gasoline.

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,960
Take off the shoes.

106
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,240
Nobody move.

107
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,120
Once I put the torch on the ground,

108
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,720
you'll soon be engulfed in flames.

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,840
The police will be here soon.

110
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,320
Surrender now.

111
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,200
Young master.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,880
Mr. Wang.

113
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,240
What's the matter with you?

114
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
You didn't tell me such a big thing.

115
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
Instead, you sent me away.

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,040
You're really inconsiderate.

117
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,160
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
I didn't want to implicate you.

119
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,440
So I thought

120
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,120
of such a plan.

121
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,280
Even the wise make mistakes.

122
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Luckily, I came in time.

123
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,080
Otherwise, you'd

124
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,480
have been hurt by them.

125
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,120
Mr. Fang,

126
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,720
this has nothing to do with me.

127
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,960
They forced me into it.

128
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,800
Save these words

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,040
for the police.

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
What are you doing?

131
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Mr. Wang,

132
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,120
tie them all up.

133
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,480
Don't move.

134
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
Behave yourself.

135
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Young master,

136
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,400
it's done.

137
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,920
By the way,

138
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,600
Mr. Wang.

139
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,640
Why did you think

140
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,560
of coming back?

141
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,080
I remembered

142
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,240
that Miss Liu called, saying

143
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,760
she left her handbag in the store

144
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,480
and needed to get it.

145
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
- What?
- So I just...

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,840
Jingzhi is coming over?

147
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,680
This is bad.

148
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,640
There's one more outside.

149
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
Stay put.

150
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,120
Mr. Wang!

151
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,400
Are you okay?

152
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,960
Release them all.

153
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,120
Put the gun down.

154
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,960
I said. Put the gun down.

155
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,560
Just stay calm.

156
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,520
Release them all.

157
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,240
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

158
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,560
Go quickly.

159
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Mr. Wang.

160
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
Who leaked the news

161
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,520
and got everyone over here?

162
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,520
Shoot them

163
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
to prove it wasn't you.

164
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,720
I don't dare.

165
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,040
Then you can

166
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
die with them.

167
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,520
If you don't shoot,

168
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,800
you'll join them in death.

169
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,800
Xu Zhaohe,

170
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,720
calm down.

171
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,320
Mr. Wang!

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,000
Stop it.

173
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,720
The police will be here soon.

174
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,760
Of course you can

175
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,920
walk away without any burden.

176
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,600
But I'm different.

177
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,720
Anyone who has seen what we look like

178
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,800
mustn't be spared.

179
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,760
We came to rob,

180
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,120
not to kill.

181
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,520
I'll take

182
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,320
this woman.

183
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,240
I can guarantee

184
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,760
she won't

185
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,720
leak any information.

186
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
I guarantee that once it's done,

187
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,360
you won't be shortchanged a penny.

188
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,120
Let's leave according to the plan now.

189
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
Is this your plan?

190
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,560
I found the people

191
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,360
and gave my effort.

192
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,200
What will

193
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,440
our men think?

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,920
Look at you.

195
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,840
With treasure in your pocket,

196
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
you even want to take a woman.

197
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,040
Qin Yaochuan,

198
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,800
you don't seem

199
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,440
to be the one calling the shots today.

200
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Then who does?

201
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,920
With just your word,

202
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,800
you came up with such a lousy idea.

203
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,640
Luo Changsheng,

204
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,240
I've felt something off about you.

205
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,040
Can't you see the situation?

206
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,720
And you're thinking

207
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,640
about a woman?

208
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Fang Xuewen,

209
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
what exactly is

210
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,760
his relationship with your woman?

211
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,120
It seems there is indeed a relationship.

212
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,720
Yangchu,

213
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,720
take his gun.

214
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Jingzhi.

215
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,960
