00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:41,568
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,960
What's the matter?

4
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,520
I didn't see anyone rush out.

5
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
Luo Changsheng.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,440
Just died.

7
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,160
Died.

8
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,520
Do you know him?

9
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,520
He's Luo Changsheng.

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,280
He's in cahoots with Jia Bonian

11
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,360
and Liu Yangchu.

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,640
What's going on?

13
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,920
Got hit and died.

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,480
Detective Qin.

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,120
What are you doing here?

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,920
I'm assisting this gentleman.

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,960
He said something's wrong

18
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,280
and asked me to the scene.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,360
I didn't expect to

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,200
bump into this guy
halfway in this alley.

21
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,160
At the fireworks plant,

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,920
I saw this suspicious guy

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
carrying a gun

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,960
and looking for someone.

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,080
I suspected
he was involved in the explosion.

26
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,640
I was about to go up to him,

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,120
but he ran away as soon as he saw me.

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,720
I chased after him with Yangchu.

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,440
Unexpectedly, he got hit and killed.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,520
Hey,

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,800
who was driving the car?

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,440
Him.

33
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,720
How should I address you?

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
Fang Xuewen.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,880
He's the one

36
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,920
who asked for your help?

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:17,960
Yes.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Yangchu.

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,800
Call the hospital.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,560
Okay.

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,120
Mr. Fang.

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,360
You can't leave here yet.

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,320
I need to get someone to handle this.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
Sorry.

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,640
I can't stay here now.

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,000
Someone died here.

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,400
No one is leaving this place.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,600
Detective Jia,

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,960
I can prove

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
that Mr. Fang did not intentionally
hit him.

51
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,280
No one is leaving.

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,560
This is the rule.

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,800
Besides,
his identity remains unverified.

54
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,880
How about this?

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,320
I'll take Mr. Fang to the car
for a rest.

56
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,720
He's of no use here anyway.

57
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,960
Detective Qin,

58
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,320
listen to me.

59
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,280
Luo Changsheng was in cahoots with them.

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,080
But they had infighting.

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
We must figure out a way

62
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
to leave here now.

63
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,160
Otherwise,
we will be their next targets.

64
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,920
Believe me.

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
Mr. Fang,

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,120
please calm down first.

67
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,920
It's quite clear

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
that they don't know your identity yet.

69
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,320
I will find a way to help you get away.

70
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,680
Before that,

71
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,920
don't panic and mess things up.

72
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,560
No one answers the on-call line.

73
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
At this hour,

74
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,160
all doctors were at the explosion site.

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,320
The injury on your neck.

76
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,320
What happened?

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I accidentally got hurt.

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,640
Mr. Fang,

79
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,400
before things are cleared up,

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,520
you cannot leave here.

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,520
Detective Jia,

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,000
we have an emergency.

83
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,920
No.

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,320
Mr. Fang.

85
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,120
Let me ask you.

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,960
Do you know the person

87
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,160
lying on the ground?

88
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,880
No.

89
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,120
Then why at the explosion scene,

90
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,520
he was aiming a gun at you?

91
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,880
What?

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,000
What exactly happened between you?

93
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,720
I don't know what you mean.

94
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
Qin Yaochuan.

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,520
Did you notice his injuries?

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,400
The marks on his neck were just made.

97
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,520
It's quite strange.

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,920
Detective.

99
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,360
Half an hour ago,

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,920
I just arrived at the scene by car.

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,480
I've been talking
with your station officer.

102
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,800
I have no idea

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
who would

104
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,080
point a gun at me.

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
As for the injury on my neck,

106
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,280
it has nothing to do

107
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,800
with this explosion.

108
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,400
I really can't stay here now.

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,080
I must go home to my fiancée now.

110
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,920
How about this.

111
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,120
After I've dealt with my family affairs,

112
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,960
I can cooperate with your investigation.

113
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
Alright?

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,760
Before that,

115
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,280
Detective Qin can follow me.

116
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:10,280
Okay.

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,600
I can go with you.

118
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,520
Yangchu,

119
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,120
stay here and wait for support.

120
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,920
No need.

121
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
Detective Qin can handle it.

122
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
What are you really afraid of?

123
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,680
I've told you.

124
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,800
Nothing.

125
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,320
Let me tell you.

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I've been doing this for over 30 years.

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,160
When one's feeling guilty,

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,560
I can tell it with just one glance.

129
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Detective Qin,

130
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,920
do you believe what I say?

131
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Detective Qin.

132
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,280
I knew this is fishy.

133
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
Save me.

134
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Jia Bonian,

135
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,480
put the gun down.

136
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,240
Qin Yaochuan,

137
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,120
what is this?

138
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,760
Do you really believe
this person's nonsense?

139
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,280
Yangchu,

140
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,880
disarm him.

141
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,960
Yangchu,

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
what are you waiting for?

143
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,480
Don't you see he's pointing a gun at me?

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Yangchu,

145
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,520
it's your show now.

146
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,520
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,720
I didn't

148
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,520
want it to end this way.

149
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,280
Please forgive me.

150
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,600
I'll repay you in the next life.

151
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,880
Who is it?

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,320
Look how scared you are.

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Senior.

154
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,160
Why are you here?

155
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,920
You know why.

156
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,600
Did you put the note on the table?

157
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,920
So you know everything.

158
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,120
Well, people

159
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
all make mistakes,

160
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,320
right?

161
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,600
Did Jia Bonian teach you this?

162
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
Nothing to do with him.

163
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
It's all my fault.

164
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,520
He just...

165
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,400
He just covered it up for you.

166
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,120
Knowingly breaking the law

167
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,720
is also a capital offense.

168
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Senior,

169
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
I'll do

170
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,280
whatever you want me to do.

171
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
You are too serious.

172
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,920
Jia Bonian and I
have long been colleagues.

173
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,280
His apprentice is my apprentice.

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
Are you saying

175
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,360
that you'll just keep it to yourself?

176
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,960
You are a smart person.

177
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,920
You know what to do

178
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
from now on.

179
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
Master,

180
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,320
I'm sorry.

181
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,120
To my surprise,

182
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,000
that Fatty Xu is the sliest one.

183
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,520
He hid a trick up his sleeve.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Right, senior,

185
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,080
can you spare Detective Jia?

186
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,640
After all, he is my master.

187
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,480
If he doesn't die,

188
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,040
you

189
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,400
and I

190
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
both have to die.

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Then

192
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,120
how do I explain this to my superiors
when I go back?

193
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,160
Let me tell you

194
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,400
what to do.

195
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,760
(It is him.)

196
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320
Alcohol merely compounds sorrow.

197
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
Enough is enough.

198
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,960
Mr. Fang.

199
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,360
Speaking of your skills,

200
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,880
I really

201
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,920
respect you.

202
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,840
So what concerns you

203
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,120
has something to do with me?

204
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,480
Do you remember that fortune stick

205
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
you interpreted for me a month ago?

206
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,760
Fortune stick?

207
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,520
Birds are nesting in the trees.

208
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,400
Villains plot and set fires.

209
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,080
With restless hearts and busy minds,

210
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,320
all plans go to waste.

211
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,720
Well,

212
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,960
you totally called it.

213
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,120
My fault. My fault.

214
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,720
No worries.

215
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,520
I don't blame you.

216
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,520
If anything, I blame myself
for trusting that woman too much.

217
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,080
Wait a moment.

218
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
My buns are ready.

219
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,600
Wait here.

220
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,640
Buns.

221
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
Alas.

222
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,200
Buns.

223
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,200
Buns.

224
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,680
Mr. Fang.

225
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,600
Try the buns I made myself.

226
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,280
