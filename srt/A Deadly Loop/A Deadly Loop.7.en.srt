00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,240
(One Year Ago)

4
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,880
Everyone,

5
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,320
my young master will arrive shortly.

6
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,080
Please wait here for a moment.

7
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,400
Young master.

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,320
These three are the candidates.

9
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,640
You two are

10
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,120
senior shopkeepers in the town.

11
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,240
Speaking of seniority,

12
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,880
you are my predecessors.

13
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,200
I fear my humble shop may be

14
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,280
undeserving of your talent.

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,120
Not at all.

16
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,280
But I would like to hear

17
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,240
what this lady

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,000
thinks about managing the shop.

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,240
Such a young girl.

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
What does she know?

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,120
Exactly.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,800
Mr. Fang chose to open
the Foreign Goods Store in Xuntang,

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,880
surely to avoid the hustle and bustle,

24
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,960
and keep a low profile.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,680
I heard when I was on the Bund

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
that luxury stores

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,800
adopt a European-style
membership system.

28
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,360
Personalized services by appointment

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,600
ensure top shopping experience

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,800
and retain customers.

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,240
It's highly suitable here.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,040
What is this crap?

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,440
Can it work?

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,960
The two of you,

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,640
this way, please.

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,080
Mr. Fang.

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,480
What does it mean?

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
You've been hired.

39
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,320
If you don't like it,

40
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,600
check out those new arrivals.

41
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,840
It's a European-style dressing mirror,
newly arrived.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,600
Check out its craftsmanship.

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,560
Completely different from ours.

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,720
And this one here.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Look.

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,040
Here's another one.

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,920
Look, this too is unique.

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,160
Look, its craftsmanship is top-notch.

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,480
Careful.

50
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,560
Slow down.

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,840
Good.

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
To the left.

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,600
Forward.

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,600
Almost there.

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Right here.

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,040
Turn right.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,720
Surprise.

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,640
Just exquisite.

59
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,200
Such a big scene.

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240

how to run a store well,

at that very moment,

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,840
I was deeply attracted to you.

00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,200
And at this moment,

74
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,160
I solemnly propose to you.

Jingqiu.

92
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,680
Mr. Wang,

93
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,080
this is a friend of mine.

94
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Mr. Wang,

95
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,760
attend to the guests
in the hall, please.

96
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,560
I need to settle some things first.

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,000
Alright.

98
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,160
Let's go.

99
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,480
Why are you avoiding me?

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,960
How did you find this place?

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,640
After I was released,

102
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,640
for months

103
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,680
I've been looking for you.

104
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,840
You shouldn't have come here.

105
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,160
Qiang told me

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
that he saw you at the Xuntang pier.

107
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,360
So I came to Xuntang,

108
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,480
and asked throughout the place.

109
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,520
No one knew Huang Jingqiu.

110
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,960
Until that day,

111
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,640
I saw you on the street.

112
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
What do you want?

113
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,320
Who is that man?

114
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Luo Changsheng.

115
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,120
We are over.

116
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,680
You said otherwise before.

117
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,280
I did promise that I would wait for you.

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,880
But it's been eight years.

119
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,080
Eight full years.

120
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,720
Do you know what I have been through?

121
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
But now I am back.

122
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,800
I'll make up for

123
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,000
everything I owed you.

124
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,200
By stealing?

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Or by robbing?

126
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,880
I've turned over a new leaf

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
and started fresh.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,920
Please trust me.

129
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,240
Trust me, okay?

130
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,440
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,920
We are over.

132
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,720
I no longer trust your promises.

133
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
Please do not disturb me again.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,680
I was able to survive that place

135
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,120
because of one belief.

136
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,520
I want to see you.

137
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,560
Sometimes I just thought about
ending it all.

138
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,400
But every time I reached my lowest,

139
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,520
I think of you.

140
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,880
I now have a new family.

141
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,600
In two more months,

142
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,280
I'm getting married.

143
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
What about our child?

144
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,320
Huang Jingqiu.

145
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Why didn't you keep the child?

146
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,560
Take a look.

147
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,400
Are these newly made?

148
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,040
Hello?

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Who's there?

150
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,760
Hello?

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Hello?

152
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,240
Jingqiu.

153
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,920
Apologies for earlier.

154
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,880
I miss you dearly.

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,800
Let's meet at our old place.

156
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,560
Where is the old place?

157
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,160
Where exactly is the old place?

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,880
Xuewen.

159
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Listen to me.

160
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,960
Don't go looking for him, okay?

161
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
I beg you.

162
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,400
Don't go looking for him.

163
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,360
Are you still protecting him?

164
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,920
No.

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,480
I'm worried that you'll get hurt.

166
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,600
Do you really care about me?

167
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,320
Please.

168
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,880
Please don't go, okay?

169
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
Jingzhi.

170
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,280
If you still love me,

171
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,520
then tell me

172
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,320
where he is.

173
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,840
Xuewen.

174
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Luo Changsheng.

175
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't be a coward.

176
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
Be a man.

177
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,080
Get out here.

178
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,000
In front of a woman,

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,200
put your gun down.

180
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll show you

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
how I beat you to a pulp.

182

Xuewen.

183
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,400
This punch is for Mr. Wang.

184
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,200
This punch is for Jingzhi.

185
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,120
This punch is for the good old days.

186
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,880
You scoundrel.

187
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,560
(Why no tattoos?)

188
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,600
(Nor a severed finger.)

189
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,440
Xuewen.

190
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,520
Despicable.

191
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,880
Despicable?

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,840
I haven't told you

193
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,880
the more despicable part.

194
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,480
Do you know how Jingqiu and me made out?

195
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,520
Do you know

196
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,280
what sweet talks

197
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,040
we had in bed?

198
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,640
You think you can buy love

199
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,160
with your money?

200
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,720
Get real.

201
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,800
Let me tell you.

202
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
In Jingzhi's heart, it's always me.

203
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,080
Always.

204
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,320
Now I'm gonna kill you,

205
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,200
take over your store,

206
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,520
and take Jingzhi away for a new life.

207
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,640
Fang Xuewen.

208
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,440
I am the winner.

209
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,440
Stop it.

210
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Xuewen.

211
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
Are you okay?

212
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,920
Why is that?

213
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,880
Luo Changsheng.

214
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,480
Please let us go.

215
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,520
You see?

216
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,320
She chose me.

217
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,880
Let us go, please.

218
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,320
Why are you doing this to me?

219
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,200
Why pretend

220
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,720
like you care about me?

221
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,400
I help you

222
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,760
because of our past.

223
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,520
I hope you can truly move on,

224
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,080
instead of dwelling on the past.

225
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,520
Behave yourself.

226
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,400
Mealtime.

227
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,080
Mealtime.

228
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,520
(Jingqiu.)

229
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,640
(For you,)

230
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,280
(I will live on.)

231
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,040
(Changsheng,)

232
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,040
(I will wait for you.)

233
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:38,944
(Songhu Southern City Prison)

234
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,360
(Jingqiu.)

235
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,800
(Eight years passed.)

236
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,840
(We can finally be together.)

237
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
Isn't it just because he's rich?

238
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,080
Luo Changsheng.

239
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,200
Do you know what disappoints me most

240
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,160
in you?

241
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,840
It's that even to this day,

242
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,800
you still equate money

243
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,960
with love.

244
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,440
you'd listened to me back then

245
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,000
and hadn't taken the plunge

246
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,200
again and again,

247
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,160
today

248
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,200
I would still be with you

249
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,960
living in that broken house.

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,080
You're the one who destroyed that home.

251
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,480
I have been alone and miserable.

252
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,560
How much I've suffered

253
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,080
over the years,

254
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,160
do you have any idea?

255
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,960
Now I've finally

256
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,400
got a new home.

257
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,040
You just want to destroy it again.

258
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,920
Don't you think you're being too cruel?

259
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,280
Alright, Jingzhi.

260
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,040
Jingzhi.

261
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,360
Hey!

262
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,920
