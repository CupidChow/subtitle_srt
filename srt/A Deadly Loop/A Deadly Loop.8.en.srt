3
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:51,968
Hey.

4
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,960
Luo Changsheng.

5
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,240
Got you at last.

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,720
Liu Jingzhi is here too.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Saves me the trouble of looking for you.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Xuewen.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,368
You.

10
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,720
Go get the gun.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,640
Stop being so wishy-washy.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,240
Hurry up.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,720
I'd like to find out for them

14
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,480
who you're gonna choose.

15
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Choose one person.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
And kill him.

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,680
Don't dilly-dally.

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,320
Otherwise, I'll shoot them both.

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,240
Changsheng.

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
Live on.

21
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,280
Xuewen.

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,800
Thank you.

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,320
I have never betrayed you.

24
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Although

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,440
I had histories,

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,280
the one

27
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,280
I chose to be with for life

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,160
is only you.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,080
Fang Xuewen.

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,200
I hope you trust me.

How is it?

50
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,840
Why can't he be a son?

51

Then let's have both a son
and a daughter.

I misunderstood you.

Past experiences

65
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,080
have proven your innocence.

66
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,720
I shouldn't have involved you.

67
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,400
Luo Changsheng.

68
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Mystery Man A.

69
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,600
Mystery Man B.

70
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,480
What is certain is that

71
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
Luo Changsheng wants revenge.

72
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,640
And he is not alone.

73
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,840
He has neither a tiger head tattoo,

74
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,960
nor a severed finger.

75
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,760
But Mystery Man A
has a tiger head tattoo.

76
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,800
But it's unclear
if he has a severed finger.

77
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,240
This person

78
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,360
is the one

79
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,080
who entered the house
and killed Jingzhi.

80
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,200
Mystery Man B

81
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,400
had set a trap at the store,

82
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,360
to burn me alive.

83
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,480
He has a severed finger.

84
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
But I'm not sure if he has that tattoo.

85
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,160
This means

86
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,760
that A and B may not be the same person.

87
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,760
If this is the case,

88
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
Luo Changsheng

89
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,040
has at least

90
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,040
over three complices.

91
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,640
However, what's now certain is

92
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,640
that they are internally divided.

93
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,680
Luo Changsheng was already injured

94
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,760
before dueling with me.

95
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,680
After Mystery Man B

96
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,360
arrived,

97
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,040
he spared nothing

98
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,520
to take Luo Changsheng's life.

99
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:02,640
Between them,

100
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,080
there is a significant disagreement.

101
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,840
Then, what is it?

102
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,040
I've never

103
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,160
had any grudges in Xuntang.

104
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,240
If Luo Changsheng just

105
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,000
wants revenge,

106
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,960
then the others

107
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
are mostly in it

108
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
for money.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,240
Then the reason for their infighting
would be

110
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
uneven division of spoils.

111
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,640
Anyway,

112
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,760
right now I'm outnumbered.

113
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,000
I can't do this alone anymore.

114
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,640
Xuewen.

115
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,160
What happened?

116
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
Where are you going?

117
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,880
My dear,

118
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,800
I apologize for

119
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,760
our misunderstanding.

120
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,680
But now I have something

121
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,080
very, very important

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
to do.

123
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,880
After everything is over,

124
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,080
I'll tell you

125
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,400
what exactly happened.

126
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,640
Before that,

127
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
just wait for me here.

128
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Okay?

129
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,440
Okay.

130
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,880
Police.

131
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,240
One moment, Officer.

132
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,680
What happened?

133
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,840
Oh, Officer,

134
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,280
can I ask about

135
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,560
the direction of the hospital?

136
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
This is the opposite way.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's in that direction.

138
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,920
Thank you.

139
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,320
Wait.

140
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,440
Why the anxiety?

141
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,360
Officer.

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,160
I'm feeling unwell,

143
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,800
rushing to the hospital.

144
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,400
A local license plate, huh?

145
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,280
You look familiar.

146
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,440
Are you the owner
of Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store?

147
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,960
Yes.

148
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
How come you don't know
where the hospital is?

149
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
I was lost for a second.

150
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,440
Well, Officer,

151
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,560
proceed with your duties.

152
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,040
Sorry to bother you.

153
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,320
Wait.

154
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,800
I need to inspect your car.

155
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,960
Get out of the car.

156
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,120
Get down.

157
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,560
Stand there.

158
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:14,304

(Luo Changsheng)
Is that you?

160
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,960
Do I look like him?

161
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,320
Why do you have

162
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,560
the Criminal Records?

163
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,160
You're not a police officer.

164
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,160
I've friends at the Municipal Board of Directors
in the French Concession.

165
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,000
How are you related to this person?

166
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,760
We had a little misunderstanding.

167
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,360
How come you, a store owner,
in such a mess?

168
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,920
Officer,

169
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
I'm really alright.

170
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,600
Hurrying to hospital.

171
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Talking nonsense.

172
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
Stand properly.

173
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
