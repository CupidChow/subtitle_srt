3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,080
Mr. Wang.

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,280
Are you there?

5
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,200
(Jingqiu?)

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,480
Nobody else dies tonight.

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
You killed him...

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,800
Do as I say.

9
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,920
Yes, I'm here.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,960
What's the matter, Miss?

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,520
Just now,

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,160
did you call me?

13
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,320
Nothing important.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,400
Then,

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,960
I'll go open the door for you.

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,360
No bother.

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,720
I was just a little worried.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,080
If all is well,

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,920
I'm leaving now.

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,960
Remember to lock the door.

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,160
Sure, Miss.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,920
Take care.

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,400
You... you... you killed people?

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,720
Useless.

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Oh no.

26
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,720
There's a trap.

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,960
So what?

28
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,240
We've got it.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,160
That's a camera.

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
If they develop the photos,

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,280
we'll all be arrested.

32
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,880
I won't be able to wear

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,320
this police uniform.

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,480
In the worst case,

35
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,680
we'll flee together.

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,120
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

37
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,920
Got it?

38
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,240
Go check inside.

39
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,560
They are fighting.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Hurry.

41
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
I couldn't stop them.

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,920
What's going on?

43
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,760
I'm not like you.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,680
I am a police officer.

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:29,960
Putting on that

46
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,480
makes you a good guy?

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,520
Forget that you used to be a thief?

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,640
Luo Changsheng.

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,080
What do you mean?

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,840
What?

51
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
Fake.

52
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,200
Why are you here?

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Fatty Xu said

54
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,240
you two were fighting.

55
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,280
Asked me to check on you.

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,360
Liar.

57
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,000
After him.

58
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,600
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

59
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
He drove my car.

60
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,000
Chase him.

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
He still has the jewelry.

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,160
I'll talk.

63
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,520
They forced me.

64
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,120
Sir,

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,920
do we have some misunderstanding?

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,040
Luo Changsheng.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,120
Still remember me?

68
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,080
Fang Xuewen.

69
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,720
Why is he here?

70
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
Who leaked the news?

71
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,120
Isn't that obvious?

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,560
You found that fat guy.

73
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,840
Do they look like a team to you?

74
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,960
So what exactly is going on?

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,920
How would I know!

76
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Mr. Fang.

77
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,120
I'm from Xuntang Police Station,

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,920
Officer Liu.

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,360
We've met before.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,920
Put your gun down.

81
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Stay calm.

82
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,320
Put the gun down first.

83
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Mr. Fang.

84
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,680
I'll go with you.

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,280
I'll tell you everything.

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,000
Keep quiet.

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,360
I know exactly

88
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,040
what you guys have done.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,800
Qin Yaochuan.

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,320
Xuntang Police Station
is tainted by your presence.

91
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,920
You are simply a disgrace
to the police force.

92
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,000
Fang Xuewen.

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
Don't bluff.

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,520
What could you possibly know?

95
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,080
Your filthy business.

96
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,160
Your little buddy already told me all.

97
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,120
Liu Yangchu,

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,680
you betrayed me.

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,600
I didn't.

100
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
To be frank with you,

101
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,320
the camera in my store

102
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,160
has captured you

103
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,720
crystal clear.

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,520
With no surprise,

105
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,760
you'll be on Extra tomorrow

106
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
as wanted criminals.

107
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,720
As for Officer Liu,

108
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,960
I can show some mercy.

109
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,520
Your conscience remains, after all,

110
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
knowing to pull back

111
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,600
at the crucial moment.

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,840
Don't listen.

113
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,000
He's playing us off.

114
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,920
Idiot.

115
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
What exactly are you doing?

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,720
Shut up.

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Luo Changsheng,

118
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
I already know exactly

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,800
your relationship with Jingzhi.

120
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,960
If you just want to take revenge on me,

121
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,920
there's no need to

122
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,320
use such despicable means.

123
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,440
We can have an honest

124
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,400
duel.

125
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,640
That's why

126
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,120
you won't let me kill that woman.

127
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,280
So

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,520
you two had a thing.

129
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,960
Luo Changsheng.

130
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,480
You're using me.

131
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,080
How dare you point a gun at me.

132
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,320
Without me...

133
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,520
Cut the crap.

134
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm a cop now.

135
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
You're a thief.

136
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
You still think you're a cop.

137
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,720
Little Witch.

138
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,880
Mr. Fang.

139
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,320
Little Witch.

140
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,680
Now I believe what you say.

141
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,920
Don't be sad.

142
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,600
A warrior dies for their bosom friend.

143
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,320
I have been dealing
with the supernatural

144
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,120
all my life.

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,680
It's definitely worth it

146
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,680
to see this

147
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,600
before I die.

148
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
Little Witch.

149
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,720
Little Witch.

150
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:29,640
(Natural, Reflection, Radiance, Shake,
Ground, Gorge, Bound, Field)

151
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,000
It's raining. Let's call it a day.

152
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,120
No money for food again.

153
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,920
New here?

154
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,480
Gentlemen.

155
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,120
Did you pay the stall fee?

156
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,840
What stall fee?

157
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,560
Can't believe it.

158
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,280
Smash it.

159
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,600
No place for you here.

160
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,600
What are you doing?

161
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,520
You dare to fight back?

162
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,360
Why are you kicking my stuff?

163
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,040
Get up.

164
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,720
Stop it.

165
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:00,760
(Green Bean Cake)

166
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,640
What are you doing?

167
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,400
Mr. Fang.

168
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,520
The newcomer knows no rules.

169
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,400
Her protection fees.

(Anchovy Wontons)

171
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,840
How about this.

172
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,280
I'll pay for her.

173
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,240
Can you please not

174
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,120
bother her anymore?

175
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,840
No problem.

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,880
Thank you, Mr. Fang.

177
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,520
Let's go.

178
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:23,584
(Fortune-Telling Divination)

179
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,720
Thank you.

180
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,040
What's your name?

181
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,760
My name is Xu Xiaoxian.

182
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
How is it? Good?

183
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,680
Very good.

184
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
I won't ask for more.

185
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,680
My friend owns the shop.

186
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,920
It happens to be vacant.

187
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,640
Then you'll have a place to stay

188
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,320
here in Xuntang.

189
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,040
Really?

190
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,280
Then thank you, Mr. Fang.

191
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,960
The rent...

192
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,320
When I earn money,

193
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,120
I'll pay you back.

194
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,960
Forget about the rent.

195
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,520
Just treat me to a few drinks.

196
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,440
No problem.

197
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,560
Then,

198
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,280
if you need

199
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,600
anything from me,

200
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,840
I

201
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
will surely do my utmost.

202
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Alright then.

203
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,560
Get yourself settled.

204
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,520
I'll go for my business.

205
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,480
Take care, Mr. Fang.

206
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,960
You got it right.

207
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,880
My fault. My fault.

208
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
Should you face any difficulties,

209
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,880
I won't stand by.

210
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,560
This isn't what I wanted.

211
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,480
If saving someone

212
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,080
has to sacrifice these friends,

213
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,320
I will live in guilt
for the rest of my life.

214
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,200
I must kill myself

215
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,120
before the time comes

216
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,880
to enter the next loop.
