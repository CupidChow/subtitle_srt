=A Deadly Loop=

2
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,632
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,000
When was Jingzhi pregnant?

4
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,760
How come I didn't know?

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,960
This divination
signifies great misfortune,

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,480
the worst omen.

7
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,720
A disloyal wife,

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,080
or a calamity of blood.

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,200
Avoid these if you can.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,520
Miss Jingzhi

11
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,360
looked surprised.

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,360
She then dragged the man out,

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,720
and came back after quite a while.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,160
I brought her pastries,

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,840
but saw her secretly wiping tears.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,880
It's strange.

17
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:19,680
(Luo Changsheng)

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,280
Luo Changsheng.

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,400
Luo Changsheng.

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,640
(Never thought this watch)

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,080
(not only takes me back in time,)

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,400
(but also speeds up the healing.)

23
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,680
Xuewen.

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
What happened?

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,280
Jingzhi.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,880
Don't come up.

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,680
I'm taking a bath.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
I'll come down in a bit.

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,080
Are you okay?

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360
I'm fine.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,400
Don't come up.

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,000
What happened to you?

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,080
Jingzhi.

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,200
Go down and wait for me.

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,920
I'll first change my clothes.

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,880
Gosh.

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,000
What exactly happened?

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,680
Xuewen.

39
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,280
I just fell down.

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,320
It's nothing.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
How could you fall so hard?

42
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,640
Nope.

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,200
The wound will be infected soon.

44
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,680
Disinfect it immediately.

45
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,784
(Prenatal Care)

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,920
Who is Luo Changsheng?

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,680
It's not like you think.

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,880
Bear with it.

49
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,880
Who exactly is Luo Changsheng?

50
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:22,520
(Eight Years Ago)

51
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,320
Stop running.

52
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
Stop running.

53
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,240
Stop right there.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,320
I told you to stop running.

55
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,200
Go.

56
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,760
Go.

57
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,240
You promised me that you would stop.

58
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,600
Why still do that?

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,600
Doing this for so many years,

60
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,880
I've never missed.

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,920
I thought it would be the last.

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,360
After this,

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,560
I'm done with this.

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,480
Never expected
that during this last job,

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
I messed it up.

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,080
It's fate.

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,960
Changsheng.

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,480
Is it that in your eyes,

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,600
nothing matters

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,880
but money?

71
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720
You know what I stole
for this last time?

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,320
It's a unique gold ring.

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,000
Because I think
only this is good enough for you.

74
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,080
I was staking it out for months,

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,760
and finally got the chance.

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,880
We opened the entire vault.

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
I could have taken everything.

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,920
But this time I wasn't greedy.

79
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,880
I only took a tiny ring.

80
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,120
My bros asked me why.

81
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
What for?

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,080
I said I'd use it to propose to Jingqiu,

83
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,480
and be a good man from then on.

84
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,960
My girl.

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,000
Come closer.

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,280
About that ring,

87
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,520
I didn't confess.

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,720
I hid it in the coal pile
under the stove.

89
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,880
Keep it well.

90
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,160
I traded my life for it.

91
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,480
Never lose it.

92
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Changsheng.

93
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,760
I'll wait for you.

94
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Okay.

95
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,320
Take good care of our child.

96
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:28,640
(One Month Ago)
(Wenhua Hotel)

97
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,760
Changsheng.

98
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,880
Jingqiu.

99
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
Okay. It's alright.

100
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,880
Here's 2000 yuan for you.

101
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,720
If it's not enough,

102
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,120
I can withdraw more.

103
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,920
Did I ask you for money?

104
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,880
How can you go without money?

105
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,360
Jingqiu.

106
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,640
Hadn't we agreed to depart Xuntang
together?

107
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,400
When was that agreed?

108
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,240
I've bought the boat ticket.

109
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,400
Leave early tomorrow morning,

110
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,280
to Guangzhou.

111
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,920
I have some friends there.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
They will settle you in.

113
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,720
Then you...

114
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,680
Huang Jingqiu.

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
I hardly recognize you.

116
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
People change.

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,920
Also,

118
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,320
my name is not Huang Jingqiu.

119
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm Liu Jingzhi.

120
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
You forgot what you told me?

121
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,080
You promised!

122
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,120
What did I promise?

123
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
You promised that you would wait for me.

124
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
Huang Jingqiu.

125
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,080
Simply put,
you're in love with someone else.

126
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Now you wanna get rid of me.

127
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
What made you so greedy?

128
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,280
Changsheng.

129
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,760
I know you've suffered a lot in it
these years.

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,000
But do you know how I've been
these years?

131
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,680
I don't even have a place
to call my own.

132
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,400
I just want a home.

133
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,680
Now I am here.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,280
I can give you a home.

135
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,600
We can't go back anymore.

136
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,880
I already have a new life.

137
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,720
Too late to turn back now.

138
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
Isn't it all for money?

139
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
I can earn it too.

140
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,680
I will make you live a good life.

141
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,080
Why don't you understand?

142
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,680
I gave you ample chances.

143
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,400
But you just let me down time and again.

144
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,080
I really can't go back.

145
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,120
I'm done living in fear like I used to.

146
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,120
You can't leave me.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,320
Let me go.

148
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,320
I haven't done you any wrong.

149
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,400
Then why didn't you tell me
you're pregnant?

150
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,280
What's there to hide?

151
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,880
I wanted to be sure about this
before telling you.

152
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,720
I don't understand.

153
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,080
You're taking pregnancy care.

154
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,280
Still not sure about this?

155
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,480
You don't believe me.

156
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,160
Right, I don't.

157
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,880
Do you believe me now?

158
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Jingzhi, put down the gun.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,880
Put down the gun.

160
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,600
Xuewen.

161
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,920
It's all right now.

162
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,880
It's all right now.

163
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Jingzhi.

164
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,520
I promise you.

165
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,840
I won't be that impulsive

166
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,880
to say such things.

167
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,080
But will you please be honest with me?

168
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,800
Where did you go last night?

169
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,280
To the Foreign Goods Store.

170
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,000
Why went there so late?

171
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,720
What are you still suspicious about?

172
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,480
No.

173
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,320
I'm not suspicious about you.

174
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,400
I believe everything you say now.

175
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
I just want you to know

176
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,200
that anything that concerns you

177
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,320
is my business.

178
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,280
At 10:30 last night,

179
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,080
I was about to go upstairs and rest.

180
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,680
Suddenly, I received a phone call.

181
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,480
But strangely,

182
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,360
there was no sound on the phone.

183
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,000
Who is this?

184
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,160
I asked several times.

185
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,760
But no reply.

186
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,720
Then the call was abruptly hung up.

187
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,320
Although there was no sound,

188
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,160
I heard birds.

189
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,280
I remembered

190
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,560
it's the parrot
Mr. Wang kept in the duty room.

191
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,760
I guessed it was called from the store.

192
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,200
Fearing something might happen,

193
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,800
I went to the store.

194
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,880
(Why isn't it locked?)

195
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:24,544
(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

196
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,720
Mr. Wang, are you there?

197
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,160
Ah, yes.

198
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
What's the matter, miss?

199
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,320
Did you just call me?

200
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,080
Yes, I did.

201
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,760
What was it about?

202
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,320
Nothing important.

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,280
Well, Miss, I'll get up
and open the door for you now.

204
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,360
No bother.

205
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,960
I was just a little worried.

206
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Should all be well,

207
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm leaving now.

208
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,000
Do lock the door.

209
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,920
Alright.

210
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,880
Take care, Miss.

211
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,240
He's aged.

212
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,480
I don't want to trouble him.

213
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,760
Just let him rest.

214
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,080
Don't get up for me.

215
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,360
Then I came back home.

216
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,280
Nothing strange?

217
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,840
Nope.

218
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,480
Oh,

219
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,560
I remember.

220
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,800
When I arrived
outside the Foreign Goods Store,

221
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,280
several cars appeared to be parked
across the street.

222
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,520
I didn't think much of it back then.

223
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,680
But now it feels quite odd.

224
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,720
Why did several cars park there then?

225
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,080
There were no residential houses nearby.

226
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,520
How many?

227
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,960
What type?

228
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,960
Two, both black sedans.

(Xuewen's Foreign Goods Store)

230
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,360
Oh no.

231
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,080
Xuewen.

232
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
