1
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:39,584
=A Deadly Loop=

2
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,800
What's this?

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,360
Out of cards.

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,920
I can't handle this.

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,200
Your turn. Hurry up!

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,840
Okay now?

7
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,760
Overtrump!

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,840
Can't you just overtrump him?

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,719
Anyone else?

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,440
Need a pair of threes?

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,928
Why are you yelling?

12
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:58,368
- Forget it.
- Come on.

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,680
Out of cards.

14
00:01:00,848 --> 00:01:02,288
- Wait.
- Your turn.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,800
Look, it's done!

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,560
Look at you guys.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,120
Not like police at all.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
Chief Hu.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,040
With your protection over Xuntang Town,

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,880
everyone lives in peace and joy.

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,520
We are out of business now.

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,080
Alright.

23
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,680
Stop buttering me up.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,920
Before newcomers,

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,720
mind your image a bit more.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Set a good example.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,240
Yes.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,280
Line up.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,800
Come.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,520
Let me introduce

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,520
the newly recruited officer

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,880
of our Police Station.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,360
Liu Yangchu.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,560
Welcome.

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
I am Liu Yangchu.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,120
It's an honor to meet you.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,720
I'll learn from you.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,160
This is some local specialty
from my hometown,

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,200
pickled duck eggs.

40
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,720
Have a try.

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,480
Please, try this.

42
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:34,080
Try this.

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
Alright, Liu Yangchu.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,880
Get acquainted with everyone.

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,920
I've got to go.

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,640
Okay.

47
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,328
Well.

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,200
Jia Bonian.

49
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,800
Yes?

50
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,760
You will be
in charge of mentoring Officer Liu.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,440
Take good care of him.

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,360
Chief Hu.

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,640
Why is it always me to mentor newbies?

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
See you, Chief Hu.

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,600
Come on, let's continue.

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,280
Continue.

57
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,400
My cards.

58
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,200
I must win this time.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
Come on, continue playing.

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,640
It's your turn, right? Come on.

61
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,680
Start over.

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,960
Why standing there?

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,280
So, what should I do?

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
Go do what you need to do.

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,360
Chief Hu says,

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,240
from now on, you are my master.

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,560
I will follow your orders.

68
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,080
See the gate?

69
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,680
Go run circles outside.

70
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,880
Do some exercise.

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,520
Yes.

72
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,080
What are you doing here?

73
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,480
Following your instructions,

74
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,520
run in circles.

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,920
Running all this time?

76
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,920
Time's up, off work now.

77
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,960
Pack up and leave.

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,920
Such a stubborn guy.

79
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,320
Quite stubborn.

80
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,200
Good morning.

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,520
Morning, master.

82
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,280
Why so busy early in the morning?

83
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,280
Hey, Li.

84
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,880
Can you pop down
to Youfang Street today?

85
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
There are 38 household registrations

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,920
to be filled in.

87
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,720
Thank you.

88
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,400
Okay.

89
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,240
His family name is Liu.

90
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,960
You bossed him around,

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,240
but don't get his name right.

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,200
It's okay.

93
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,920
Sorry, Liu.

94
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,440
Don't forget to go to Gangxia Village
in the afternoon.

95
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
That cattle theft case

96
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,840
needs follow-up.

97
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Okay.

98
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,120
Liu.

99
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,080
Can we switch shifts for the patrol
on Guanqian Street tonight?

100
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,360
Got some home issues today.

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,040
No problem.

102
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,520
This is my assistant.

103
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,760
How come you're giving orders?

104
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,000
Go.

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,736
Master.

106
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,320
Do you have any instructions?

107
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,640
Continue with your work.

108
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,880
You've got some serious skills!

109
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
What's going on?

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,960
Master.

111
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,320
Yesterday, I passed a house.

112
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,040
Their cat was trapped on the balcony.

113
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,760
So I climbed up to get the cat.

114
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,080
I say, you're really something.

115
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,440
Wanna help with everything?

116
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
Well.

117
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,160
You'll get two days off.

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
Go back and have a good rest.

119
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,000
That won't do, master.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,120
Work cannot be delayed.

121
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,520
You kid.

122
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,200
Officer Jia.

123
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,640
You're on duty today?

124
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,680
This New Year's Eve, I'm on duty.

125
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,880
I got lucky.

126
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
Hard work.

127
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
How about I'll bring you

128
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,680
some food for this New Year's Eve?

129
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,560
No need.

130
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,760
Go back early for your dinner.

131
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,600
I'm leaving.

132
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,168
Okay.

133
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,920
Liu, why are you still here?

134
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,840
Master, how about you go back

135
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,880
and I cover your shift?

136
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,920
No, no.

137
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,040
My family isn't in Xuntang.

138
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,560
It's no fun for me to go back alone.

139
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,720
Let me cover your shift.

140
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,480
Liu.

141
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,760
I bet with Detective Qin

142
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,040
that you would change soon.

143
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,680
But it's been over a year.

144
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,480
You remain as dedicated as upon arrival.

145
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:40,040
Even I

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,120
am impressed.

147
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,160
Master, I'm flattered.

148
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,440
I just really cherish this job.

149
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,200
Being a cop

150
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,280
is an honor

151
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,520
for my family.

152
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,520
My parents hope I can perform well,

153
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,600
and establish my reputation.

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,520
Good. Good.

155
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:01,248
(Outstanding Officer)

156
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,760
I announce

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,120
this year's outstanding officer

158
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,920
is our new colleague,

159
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,120
Liu Yangchu.

160
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,080
Keep up good work.

161
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,760
I hold great hope for you.

162
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,320
Thank you, Chief Hu.

163
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,120
Officer Jia.

164
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,360
What's going on?

165
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,920
There's a small alleyway

166
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,160
down that street.

167
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,320
I've been watching them for a month.

168
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,720
Tomorrow,
contraband will be traded here.

169
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,120
What contraband?

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Opium.

171
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,440
Substantial sum.

172
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,640
Is it reliable?

173
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,360
Officer Jia.

174
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
I've been your informant
for quite a while.

175
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,720
Could I be wrong?

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,840
Go.

177
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,320
It's top-quality.

178
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
It'll surely please you.

179
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,120
Later, follow my lead.

180
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,520
They might have weapons.

181
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,360
Be careful.

182
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,320
Okay, master.

183
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,920
Nobody moves.

184
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
Stop right there.

185
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
Stop right there.

186
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,520
You chase him.

187
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,160
Okay.

188
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,680
Stop there, or I'll shoot.

189
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,120
Get down.

190
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,160
Why salt?

191
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
Officer.

192
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,640
Please let me go.

193
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,560
I'm just making a living.

194
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,520
Smuggling is illegal.

195
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,120
Besides, you're smuggling opium.

196
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,920
Follow me.

197
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
Stop resisting.

198
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,320
Who's smuggling opium?

199
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,280
Stop it.

200
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,680
I've seen many people like you.

201
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,840
Liu, let him go.

202
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
They are just salt smugglers.

203
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,200
What's wrong with you?

204
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
Haven't you had any sense?

205
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,560
You killed him!

206
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
No. I didn't mean it.

207
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,000
I caught him. He resisted.

208
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't know.

209
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
I didn't mean it, master.

210
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,800
You caused serious trouble, you know?

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,920
Listen.

212
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
Do as I say.

213
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,760
Why standing there?

214
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,600
Give me a hand here.

215
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
Master, I killed someone.

216
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,120
Perhaps I should surrender.

217
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,000
You listen to me.

218
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,000
He's just a salt smuggler.

219
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,720
It's not worth a lawsuit for him.

220
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,880
Think about your parents,

221
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,080
and your future.

222
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,440
This matter

223
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
is only between you and me.

224
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,640
Since now, forget about him.

225
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,880
Heard me?

226
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,360
Throw it off.

227
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:20,880
Come on.
