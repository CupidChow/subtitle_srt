3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,720
4 o'clock.

4
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,920
Xuewen,

5
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,120
what happened?

6
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
Let's talk.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,760
You said you went to the store?

8
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,240
Yes.

9
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
At 10:30 in the evening,

10
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,680
I received a phone call.

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
Then...

12
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,000
Then you heard no response
from the other end,

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,560
just a few bird calls.

14
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,720
So you concluded it was from Mr. Wang.

15
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,520
Then you went to the store.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
But you found nothing unusual.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,560
I know all this.

18
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,480
How do you know that?

19
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,480
I say it's my third eye.

20
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,280
Do you believe it?

21
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,560
Fang Xuewen.

22
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,120
You scared me.

23
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
Mr. Wang is dead.

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,680
What did you say?

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,760
At this very moment,

26
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,560
Mr. Wang is lying in his room, murdered.

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,800
Are you kidding?

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,160
I saw it with my own eyes.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,160
You didn't go out all tonight.

30
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
You went upstairs for a while,

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
then came down to tell me

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,600
you went to the store,

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,760
and saw Mr. Wang killed.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,080
Did you fly there?

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,720
Otherwise what do you think I did?

36
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,880
Be a normal person, please.

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,200
Let's have a proper chat.

38
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,160
You said you went to the store.

39
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,360
Did you see anything else?

40
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
Think carefully.

41
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,720
I saw two cars across the street.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,680
I know this.

43
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,760
What else?

44
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,680
Anything happened on the road?

45
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,520
Met anyone?

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,880
When I was close to the store,

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,080
I met patrolling Officer Liu.

48
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,200
Which Officer Liu?

49
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,680
Liu Yangchu.

50
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,920
We've dined together.

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,000
I've tipped him.

52
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,080
What was he doing?

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,200
He was just patrolling as usual.

54
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,920
Did you talk?

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,480
Our eyes met.

56
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,720
Nothing else.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
Why didn't you mention this

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,360
when I asked you earlier?

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
When did you ask me?

60
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,880
You've just started questioning me.

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
Let me ask you.

62
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,880
Why didn't you ask

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,080
Officer Liu to check the store with you?

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,080
Nothing happened.

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,480
Why would I trouble him?

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,640
That's not right.

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,200
It's illogical.

68
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,160
You answered the phone,

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,160
and went to the store
because you noticed something strange.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,480
Then you met the police on the way,

71
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,400
but asked for no help.

72
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,960
When you were there,

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,680
merely a few replies

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
and the shadow in the room

75
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,880
erased all doubts.

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
Does that make sense?

77
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
Mr. Wang is dead,

78
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,480
with blood all over him.

79
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,280
The room is a mess.

80
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
And you're telling me it's normal?

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
I don't know how to explain it to you.

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,160
Let's just call the police.

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,520
Why is nobody answering?

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,280
Stop calling.

85
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
The town's fireworks factory exploded.

86
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,080
From last night until now,

87
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,800
all officers have been dispatched there.

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
So how could Liu Yangchu possibly
be on patrol?

89
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,080
But why would I lie to you?

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,680
I also want to know why.

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,520
You are the person I trust the most.

92
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,200
The jewelry hidden in the warehouse
was stolen.

93
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,640
The ones who know about it are only me,

94
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,480
Mr. Wang,

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
and you.

96
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,800
Actually, all the jewelry pieces

97
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,080
in our store's main hall are fakes.

98
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
Huh?

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,680
I have a few cards hidden.

100
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,680
Apart from Mr. Wang,
the only one who knows about this

101
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,680
is you.

102
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Now that Mr. Wang is dead.

103
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
Are you suspecting me?

104
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,680
I'm not suspecting you.

105
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,120
You suspect I killed him for money?

106
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,760
Before those questions,

107
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,000
I searched for excuses for you.

108
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,960
I didn't believe you would do this.

109
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,080
After hearing your answer,

110
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,480
how can I believe you?

111
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
How about we head to the store now,

112
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,880
and see what has actually happened?

113
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,280
Even if you want to throw dirt on me,

114
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
at least convince me.

115
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,680
Then I'm afraid
I might even lose my own life.

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
What do you mean?

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,320
I will die there.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If I go there now,

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll just die.

120
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,400
What exactly do you want me to do?

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
How can I do to make you believe me?

122
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,360
Forget it.

123
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
It's an old trick.

124
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,880
What exactly do you want?

125
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
Call Luo Changsheng over.

126
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,200
What?

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,720
Call Luo Changsheng over,

128
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,640
now, immediately.

129
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,080
To be honest,

130
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,520
I've long sensed something off
about you.

131
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,160
I've been following you these days,

132
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,520
and found

133
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,320
that Luo Changsheng,

134
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
who was jailed for burglary.

135
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,320
It was totally a surprise.

136
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,760
A few months ago,

137
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,640
after he was released,

138
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,680
he just came to Xuntang Town to see you.

139
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,680
I had no idea

140
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,640
how you two hooked up so quickly?

141
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,600
Liu Jingzhi.

142
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,360
I, Fang Xuewen,

143
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,560
have never wronged you.

144
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,840
How can you be so cruel to me?

145
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,160
Let me tell you this.

146
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
It won't take long

147
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,040
before that bad guy
breaks into our house,

148
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,680
and then kills you.

149
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,560
You don't have to love me.

150
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
But you can't defame me.

151
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,840
Still lying?

152
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,920
I hold the evidence.

153
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,120
I'll show it to you right now.

154
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,880
You can't leave.

155
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,080
Let me go.

156
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Let me go.

157
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,680
Let me go.

158
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,040
Why keep pestering me?

159
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Because I hate you.

160
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,960
Why didn't you keep our child?

161
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
Do you want to know the truth?

162
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,320
Our child got killed because of you.

163
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,920
What?

164
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,280
After you went in,

165
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,200
those people you offended

166
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
found me.

167
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
Where to?

168
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,120
Don't come over.

169
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,480
Don't come over.

170
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,520
If Changsheng finds it out,

171
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,840
he surely won't let you off.

172
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,160
You dare mention that bad guy?

173
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,440
When he snatched our turf back then,

174
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,720
he wasn't nice to us at all.

175
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,160
Now he's in,

176
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,640
you should pay for his debts.

177
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Bro,

178
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,040
she's good, huh?

179
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,720
Your reward.

180
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,880
Don't come over.

181
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,240
I'm begging you.

182
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm pregnant.

183
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Oh!

184
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,040
You're carrying that person's kid.

185
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,480
Don't expect us to play nice.

186
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
I now carry Fang Xuewen's child.

187
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
I will protect him with my life.

188
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,320
It won't be like before.

189
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,640
I've kept this ring all along.

190
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,240
Now, I'm returning it to you.

191
