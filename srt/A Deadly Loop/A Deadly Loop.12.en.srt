2
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,568
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,720
You,

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,520
come here.

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,320
What's with the injuries on you?

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,880
You were caught in the explosion?

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,800
No, Chief Hu.

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,080
It's urgent.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,280
I'll make a long story short.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,600
I've come to ask for your help.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,680
There are corrupt cops in your station.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,360
If you spout nonsense,

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,680
you'll be shot.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
It's the absolute truth.

15
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,120
I can guarantee it with my life.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,560
Over the past period,

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,600
I've been attacked by your men.

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,400
These injuries are caused by them.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,160
Is it related to the explosion?

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,280
It seems not for the time being.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,760
But I feel

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,480
that there must be
some special connection.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,880
What's the gibberish?

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,840
Well, I find

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
your words have no logic.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm so busy right now.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't have time for you.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,480
But I haven't told you their names.

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
I'm warning you.

30
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,280
If you spout nonsense again,

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,680
I'll arrest you immediately.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Jia Bonian, Liu Yangchu.

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
They are corrupt cops.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,920
If I'm not mistaken,

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,600
they are master and apprentice.

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,880
Are you so sure?

37
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm sure.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,080
And it won't be long

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,560
before they kill me and my wife

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,880
and implicate more people.

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,360
Chief Hu,

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:57,840
I believe

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,080
you wouldn't want this

44
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,680
to reach Mayor Gu's ears, right?

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,040
Qin Yaochuan.

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,600
Yes?

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,280
Where are Bonian and Yangchu?

48
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,600
I don't know, Chief.

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,200
Chief Hu,

50
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,480
Mayor Gu is here.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,280
How about this?

52
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,680
I'll send someone

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,080
to investigate this thoroughly.

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,960
Rest assured.

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,880
We won't let any bad person get away

56
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,480
or wrongly accuse any good person.

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,680
The rest of you, go back to work.

58
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,680
No one at the scene

59
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,360
is allowed to talk nonsense to Mayor Gu.

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
Keep that in mind.

61
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,760
Yes.

62
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,760
Qin Yaochuan,

63
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,480
investigate this thoroughly.

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,400
Report back to me.

65
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
Remember.

66
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,680
Don't alarm them.

67
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,480
Yes.

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,120
Take care,

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,880
Chief Hu.

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,280
Mr. Fang,

71
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
let's talk somewhere else.

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay.

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,640
Godfather.

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,200
What's going on?

75
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,040
Being such an old man,

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
I can't take staying up all night.

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,480
What happened?

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,960
Godfather,

79
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,920
you've suffered.

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,400
As you can see,
the scene is almost dealt with.

81
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
How about

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,840
you go back and rest first?

83
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,680
Rest my foot.

84
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,680
Hu,

85
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
I don't get it.

86
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Why must it happen now?

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,960
It had to cause me trouble now?

88
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,280
My daughter just got married.

89
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,080
I hadn't been on the seat

90
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,560
as the bride's father for long

91
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,120
before you people hauled me over here.

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
What a disgrace!

93
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
I'll cut to the chase.

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,160
You look somewhat familiar to me.

95
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,640
I own the foreign goods store in town.

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,960
People come and go there.

97
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,160
Perhaps we have met before.

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,880
I see.

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,240
By the way,

100
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,240
you said you encountered some problems.

101
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
What problems?

102
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,040
Detective Qin,

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,960
I'm desperate.

104
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,320
Who is it?

105
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,640
After them.

106
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,280
Okay.

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,040
A gang robbed my store

108
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,800
and killed my butler, Mr. Wang.

109
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,440
During that time,

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
my fiancée received a call
from Mr. Wang.

111
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,320
So she made a trip to the store.

112
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,040
Out of some unknown reason,

113
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,080
they didn't kill her in the store.

114
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,480
Instead, a few hours later,

115
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,040
they broke into my home and killed her.

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,720
What does this

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
have to do with those two officers?

118
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,840
Jia Bonian and Liu Yangchu
were involved in this.

119
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,440
I witnessed their crimes.

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,280
While other officers

121
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,680
rushed to the explosion scene.

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,560
They went in the opposite direction

123
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,920
and committed heinous acts.

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,560
I even suspect

125
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,400
that they created

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,680
the explosion on purpose

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,640
to divert attention

128
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,920
and break into my home.

129
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,640
Wait a minute.

130
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,920
You mean they robbed your store?

131
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,280
Were there

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,440
any rare treasures there

133
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,120
worth their great effort?

134
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,280
It's the jewelry

135
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,840
Mr. Henry brought over from France.

136
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,040
In Shanghai,

137
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
I had some business dealings with him.

138
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
He trusted me a lot.

139
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,120
So you're saying

140
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,960
they were after the money?

141
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Yes.

142
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,520
You mentioned

143
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
they would kill your fiancée.

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,880
Could it be

145
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,720
that she discovered something?

146
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,640
I don't know.

147
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,480
Where is she now?

148
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,120
At home.

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,040
You let her stay at home alone?

150
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,800
In the past,

151
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,840
I tried many ways.

152
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,960
I even tried to take her away
from this town.

153
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,680
But doing that

154
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,080
would only cause more trouble.

155
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
What kind of trouble?

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
It doesn't matter.

157
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,560
Detective Qin,

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
you are one of the few officers

159
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,080
who I believe to be decent.

160
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,240
I hope you can help me

161
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,040
and send more men to my place

162
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,040
to protect us through the night, okay?

163
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,440
As you can see,

164
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,440
there aren't enough police on the scene.

165
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,240
Hadn't Mayor Gu come,

166
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,960
Chief Hu

167
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,760
wouldn't have let me handle your case.

168
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,440
Detective Qin,

169
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,640
I really have no other choice.

170
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm desperate.

171
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,600
How about this?

172
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,560
I'll accompany you back first.

173
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,560
Okay.

174
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,440
Who told you to shoot?

175
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
I was afraid he'd run away.

176
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:01,088
(On Sale)

177
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
Get out of the car.

178
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,240
Search quickly.

179
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,840
Okay.

180
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
Judging by your look,

181
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
you are badly injured.

182
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,080
Did you confront them directly?

183
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
No.

184
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,480
I cut myself by accident.

185
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,560
If you believe in me,

186
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,240
you should tell me the truth.

187
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,840
Yes.

188
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,560
I did

189
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,880
confront them directly.

190
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,080
But I escaped.

191
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,040
But

192
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,320
why are you so certain it was

193
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,680
Jia Bonian and Liu Yangchu?

194
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
You should know

and you will believe me.
