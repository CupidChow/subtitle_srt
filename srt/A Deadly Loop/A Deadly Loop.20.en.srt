00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,920
Detective Qin,

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,000
please accept this month's
protection money from the casino.

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,000
You've been doing well recently.

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,680
Go.

8
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,960
Old habits die hard.

9
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,560
Who is it?

10
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,960
What?

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,240
You don't recognize me?

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,160
Back then, on the Bund,

13
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,640
you got beaten half to death

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,720
for stealing tobacco.

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,040
Changsheng,

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,520
sorry for not recognizing you.

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,440
If it weren't

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,520
for your help back then,

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,160
I wouldn't be here today.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,440
You're quite something.

21
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,480
Look at you.

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,720
You've become a police officer.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,160
I'm just making a living.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,880
Changsheng,

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,560
it's been long since we last met.

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,120
I heard that later on you went to...

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,600
Let's not mention the past.

28
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,320
I've been in Xuntang for some time now.

29
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,400
Qiang told me

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
that you were also here.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,440
So I came to chat with you.

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Changsheng,

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,920
do you have any orders?

34
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
They're not orders.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
I'm here

36
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
for something good.

37
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,320
What brings you here this time?

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,120
It's definitely better

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,920
than those paltry dealings you have.

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,120
It's up to whether you want to be rich.

41
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm all ears.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,000
Changsheng,

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,520
this is Liu Yangchu
from our police station.

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,320
He's a rising star of the police.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,120

From the gate to the front door,

47
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,960
then to the display cabinets,

48

there are three lines of defense.

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,240
The times are different.

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
Don't take yourself so seriously.

51
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,840
Today, I'll definitely

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,120
take everything.

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,600
Qin Yaochuan,

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,960

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,200
Hello?

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,040
Hello?

60
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,920
This is bad.

61
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,240
There's a trap.

62
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:21,120

It's done.

63

Go inside and check.

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
They are fighting.

65
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,440
What happened?

66
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,800
Why are you here?

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,760
Fatty Xu said you two were fighting

68
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
and asked me to stop you.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,880
He was lying.

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,520
After him.
