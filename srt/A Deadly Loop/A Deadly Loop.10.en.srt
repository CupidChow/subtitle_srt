=Episode 10=

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,040
No. They weren't

4
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,200
the only corrupt cops.

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
When we call the police,

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,600
it's like walking into a trap.

7
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,160
We must

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,520
leave Xuntang Town immediately.

9
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,360
Sorry, Jingzhi.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,320
I know this is very abrupt.

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,400
But we are

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,360
running out of time.

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,440
I don't have time

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,960
to tell you what exactly has happened.

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,720
Nor do I have the time

16
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,120
to clear our misunderstandings.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,920
You must trust me now.

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,360
We must leave Xuntang.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,320
When we reach a safe place,

20
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,920
I'll explain everything.

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,720
Alright?

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,520
But how am I

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,120
supposed to trust you like this?

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,280
What exactly happened,

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,960
Xuewen?

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,120
To be honest,

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,560
during this period,

28
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,800
I've died more than once.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,240
Tell me the truth.

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,160
Did you do something out of line?

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,640
Do you remember Luo Changsheng?

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,560
You know all about it?

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
Jingzhi, listen to me.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,440
I admit I doubted you before.

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,560
But now I feel guilty

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,720
for my suspicions.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,360
At this very moment,

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,520
I completely believe what you said.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
And I swear,

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,200
I haven't gone to Luo Changsheng.

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
I mean it.

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,840
Do we really have to leave Xuntang?

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
Yes.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
We must leave tonight.

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,160
Then where do we go?

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,040
French Concession, Shanghai.

47
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,760
My friends at the board will receive me.

48
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,520
They will protect us.

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Xuewen,

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
the car might not have enough fuel.

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,400
What?

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,920
I drove back and forth a lot today.

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,040
Normally speaking,

54
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
it's just enough for us
to leave Xuntang.

55
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,920
To the dock then.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,920
If I remember correctly,

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,160
the rice ship

58
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,400
leaves every two hours.

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,240
We can catch the next one.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,320
Let's go now.

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,960
Okay.

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,720
It's so cold.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,840
Feeling better?

64
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,960
It's much better.

65
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,440
If...

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,800
I mean, if

67
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,520
we could go back

68
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,760
to the time we first met,

69
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,240
would you still choose me?

70
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,040
Why do you ask this?

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,520
I've done many things
that may disappoint you.

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,920
Not at all.

73
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,160
Although you've been secret lately,

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,800
that doesn't affect

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,000
my choice of you.

76
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,000
Jingqiu?

77
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,240
Luo Changsheng?

78
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,720
What are you doing here?

79
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,920
Xuewen,

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,320
what on earth is going on?

81
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,760
Did you arrange all this?

82
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,480
No.

83
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,560
I didn't expect him to be here.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,960
You know him?

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
You said you've never seen him before.

86
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
I know him.

87
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,960
No.

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
I might have seen him before.

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,320
But I haven't seen him yet
in this timeline.

90
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,920
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,200
Did you drag me

92
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,960
to this place

93
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
just to humiliate me?

94
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,200
No.

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,160
You two.

96
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,920
What are you two doing here?

97
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,640
Don't you know

98
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,720
what you have done?

99
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,120
I'm truly puzzled.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,520
How is it such a coincidence

101
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,880
that at this very moment,

102
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,720
you two would appear here?

103
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,600
Logically speaking,

104
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,080
you should now

105
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,680
be plundering my store

106
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
and fighting your accomplices

107
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
over uneven spoils.

108
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,600
What?

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,880
You robbed his store?

110
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,120
I don't have time to nag with you now.

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,720
I advise you to leave quickly.

112
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,120
People are after me.

113
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,520
Who are after you?

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
The police.

115
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,520
His accomplices.

116
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,520
What?

117
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Wait.

118
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,440
How do you know everything?

119
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,200
Don't move.

120
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,040
Let's go quickly.

121
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,640
Jingzhi!

122
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,440
Jingzhi.

123
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,680
Who are you?

124
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,520
Why did you stop us
from catching the criminal?

125
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,840
Xuewen,

126
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,600
this is fine.

127
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,200
I wanted

128
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,240
to give you a surprise.

129
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,120
I'm pregnant.

130
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,760
Why

131
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,920
didn't you tell me earlier?

132
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,040
My past

133
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,880
makes it impossible for me
to explain to you.

134
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,520
I am actually an unchaste woman.

135
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,640
I was pregnant
with someone else's child before.

136
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,400
But in the end, I couldn't save it.

137
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
The doctor said

138
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,720
that if I have another miscarriage,

139
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,960
I will never

140
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,640
have children again in my life.

141
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,160
So I didn't know how to explain to you.

142
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,640
I could only silently pray

143
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
that our child could safely

144
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,480
come to our side.

145
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,240
Jingzhi.

146
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,320
It's such pity.

147
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,560
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,240
Stop talking.

149
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,040
Stop talking.

150
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,080
Stop talking.

151
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,160
Stop talking.

152
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,440
Stop talking.

153
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,640
Jingzhi?

154
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,000
Jingzhi?

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
Jingzhi!

156
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,120
Master,

157
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,560
did you hit Luo Changsheng?

158
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,440
He has disappeared.

159
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,240
Take them into custody.

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,600
Call for backup.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
We must find him, alive or dead.

162
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,032
Yes.

163
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:33,280
We must capture Luo Changsheng.

164
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,120
Mr. Fang?

165
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,920
Do you know them?

166
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,920
He owns Foreign Goods Store.

167
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,240
This lady is his fiancée.

168
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,360
How did you

169
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
get involved with Luo Changsheng?

170
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,120
Put the gun down.

171
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,760
Put it down.

172
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,480
Let him go.

173
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,320
Put the gun down.

174
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,560
Otherwise, I'll kill him.

175
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,400
Let him go.

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Jingzhi.

177
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,040
Jingqiu!

178
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,320
Put the gun down.

179
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,600
I will join you.
