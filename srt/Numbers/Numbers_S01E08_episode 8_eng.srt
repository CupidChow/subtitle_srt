1
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,940
   

2
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,410
   

3
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,700
 It wasn't An... 

4
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,060
It was Han.

5
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,700
   

6
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,750
 Han Je Gyun. 

7
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,500
If V.P. Han Je Gyun really is the one who runs the private equity fund,

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,580
that is illegal. It's a crime.

9
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,240
If it were me,

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,160
I would see Director Han Seung Jo first, not your noona.

11
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,630
You know there's something between the two.

12
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,610
You should let Director Han Seung Jo tell her himself.

13
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,270
H-How did you know that?

14
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,860
Again, again! Is that really important right now?

15
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,630
Why? What is it?

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,730
Go with me.

17
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,900
Where did he go?

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:45,080


19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,470
Yes?

20
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,520
 Where are you? I have something important to tell you. 

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,750
You see.

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,660
I told you it wouldn't be V.P. An.

23
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,620
How did you know?

24
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,560
Could you open the desk drawer in my office?

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,860
   

26
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,690
   

27
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,920
 Are these the only bids placed for Haebit Construction's special auction? 

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,890
 Just Sangah Group and HK Private Equity Fund? 

29
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,770
 I mean, Haebit Construction's patent was a trending new technique. 

30
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,670
 But only two bids were placed so we didn't profit much. 

31
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:34,020
 It was the first time Taeil Accounting, acting as Sangah Group's representative, failed to get a successful bid.  

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,120
 It was a bit peculiar. 

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,640
   

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,660
   

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,500
Only a million won ($800) difference?

36
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,770
It's an amount that seems to show that

37
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,860
HK Private Equity Fund knew Sangah Group's bidding price in advance.

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,030
Yes, right.

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,830
They probably knew in advance

40
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,990
since V.P. Han Je Gyun, who was Sangah Group's bidding representative,

41
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,960
is the manager of HK Private Equity Fund.

42
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,560
Jang Ji Soo has a child.

43
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,880
Interesting.

44
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,650
Yes?

45
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,360
   

46
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,720
Let's go now.

47
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,740
 Mr. Ho Woo, your acting like this... It's not just due to the slush fund, right? 

48
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,710
 I'm too ashamed to face you. 

49
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,870
 This is yours, right? 

50
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,900
 Ahjussi, wake up! 

51
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,720
 Please! 

52
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,110
 If you naively overstep your bounds again, 

53
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,450
  I will teach you how cruel a person, who loses 

54
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:17,640
 his equanimity and rationality, can become. 

55
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,960
I have something to say to you.

56
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,020
I don't.

57
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,770
Ji Soo.

58
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,400
It's my father,

59
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,980
the HK Private Equity Fund manager you're looking for.

60
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,990
What did you just say?

61
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,990
It's him, V.P. Han Je Gyun.

62
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,940
I came to you because I thought I should tell you first.

63
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,550
The one who stole the patents

64
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,470
and destroyed my dad's company

65
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,140
was Han Je Gyun?

66
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,610
You should stop now.

67
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,700
I'll stop him this time.

68
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,200
I found out that Sangah Shipping had set up a slush fund of ₩200 billion ($158 million)

69
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,250
after we'd already given them an unqualified opinion for the audit report.

70
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,310
It was my mistake for not realizing it earlier.

71
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,740
I should have corrected things, even if it was late.

72
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,130
It's not easy to personally expose my own mistake

73
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,250
that no one knew about but me.

74
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,040
That guy, Kang Hyun... The more I consider it, the more amazing he seems.

75
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,030
He managed to do what I'm still unable to do.

76
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,100
Do you remember...

77
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,140
what I told you before?

78
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,870
 Do you like the act of goodwill I carried out for you, Vice President? 

79
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,090
 Yes, very. 

80
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,730
 It's perfect. 

81
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,970
 Then, Vice President, 

82
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,690
 you should also grant... one of my requests. 

83
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,400
Tell me.

84
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,090
I need your strength...

85
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,730
to bring someone down.

86
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,990
If the reason you need me...

87
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,270
is Han Je Gyun,

88
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,660
then so be it.

89
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,640
   

90
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,990
   

91
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,830
 Using an accounting firm to illegally fill his own pockets like V.P. Han Je Gyun 

92
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,100
 is cause for discipline. 

93
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,940
 But the punishment's severity would be... 

94
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,000
 How would it be? 

95
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,140
 It's merely a fine of less than ₩3 million ($2,400). 

96
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,880
 Even if he took billions of won? 

97
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,410
 It won't be much different, but I suppose it will have a minor impact. 

98
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,610
 I wasn't expecting anything, 

99
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,720
 but I guess it will be impossible to punish V.P. Han Je Gyun with something like that. 

100
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,280
 It would be possible through other means: 

101
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,550
 The Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. 

102
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,550
 Violating the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act by money laundering abroad is a serious crime. 

103
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,570
 There would be records at Hanguk Bank. 

104
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,240
 It's true that Hanguk Bank handles the foreign exchange transaction reports, 

105
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,310
 but this involves checking the amount of foreign currency possessed. 

106
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,380
 It's essentially like statistical data. 

107
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,500
 Judging whether the data is true and actually sending money abroad 

108
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,470
 is completely dependent on commercial banks. 

109
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,260
 President Jin Tae Soo? 

110
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,620
A bank...

111
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,430
Your being removed from all major tasks recently may actually be a good thing.

112
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,020
They say if you fall, take a break before you get up.

113
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,760
Though this is not a mega-client case,

114
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,410
it's still meaningful although it's not a big case.

115
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,110
I plan on doing what I can, one thing at a time.

116
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,170
If I keep doing so,

117
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,240
a chance will come sooner or later.

118
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,940
Ms. Yeon Ah,

119
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,760
one second, please.

120
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,960
- Then I'll see you in the conference room. 
 - Okay.

121
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,090
You're entering the meeting knowing what it's about, right?

122
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,110
I heard Ilseong Baby Formula is under a workout.

123
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,820
I'll tell you in advance. If you cause trouble this time, you're done for.

124
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,250
Yes, yes, we'll see.

125
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,160
I've searched in distant places, not knowing you were here...

126
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,910
"A.N."

127
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,860
It would have been better if I knew from the start.

128
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,980
It's not like there's a name to money.

129
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:55,120
An athlete just needs to play the game well.

130
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,600
What good is it knowing the team owner?

131
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,830
If people find out the V.P. of Taeil Accounting

132
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,160
was the hidden manager behind HK Private Equity Fund,

133
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,570
the public will also find that interesting, as I do.

134
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,720
Are you threatening me?

135
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,970
There is...

136
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,040
something quite interesting here.

137
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,430
I learned some babies can't drink ordinary baby formula from birth.

138
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,830
Yes.

139
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:25,290
A lot of people don't know there are babies that require a special baby formula.

140
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,430
There are adults who can't drink milk.

141
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,210
At least adults can eat something else,

142
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,050
but if a baby is like that, how would the baby's parents feel?

143
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,430
The only domestic company in South Korea that makes special baby formula is Ilseong Baby Formula, right?

144
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,160
Yes.

145
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,290
Ms. Hye Won's father does something really honorable.

146
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,640
He does what's honorable, but it's not profitable; thus, the workout.

147
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,790
 Gosh, Han Seung Jo, must you speak like that? 

148
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,240
Her father's company is in the middle of a workout,

149
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,080
yet she can't get involved as a family member.

150
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,600
 She must feel terrible. 

151
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,810
 Mr. Yang Jae Hwan is probably in a similar boat. 

152
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,320
 A son-in-law is also a family member. 

153
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,680
I heard that a congenital metabolic disorder occurs once in every 50,000 people.

154
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,980
There's not much of a market for it.

155
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,500
It's true that it's not profitable.

156
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,440
What can they do if they suffer losses by producing more?

157
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,700
As an accountant, it is a business that must close immediately.

158
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,090
It's not profitable...

159
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,590
I feel bad for Ms. Hye Won, too.

160
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,870
I want all the data on Han Je Gyun.

161
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,830
If you've been his faithful follower for so long,

162
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,060
you would know a lot about him as well.

163
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,170
I believe you owe me something.

164
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,140
Ms. Hye Won, how are you here?

165
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,520
I used my PTO (Paid time off).

166
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,700
Today, I'm not a fellow accountant from work.

167
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,810
I'll show you around on my father's behalf,

168
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,680
as a representative for Ilseong Baby Formula.

169
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,410
Let's go.

170
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,220
On the outside, it doesn't look much different from ordinary baby formula,

171
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,170
but this is a special baby formula for babies with congenital metabolic disorder (such as Phenylketonuria).

172
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,590
Children who biologically lack metabolic routes,

173
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,910
such as enzymes and coenzymes, cannot drink normal baby formula.

174
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,730
 Everyone is probably oblivious to this, 

175
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,980
 but one out of every 50,000 citizens suffers from this. 

176
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,340
   

177
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,180
The bank will no longer provide any new loans for Ilseong Baby Formula.

178
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,880
I'm sorry to Ms. Hye Won, but it wouldn't be weird to see that business go under at any point.

179
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,420
Suffering losses without a willingness to change...

180
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,030
And it's not like special baby formula will suddenly become high in demand.

181
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,060
If getting new loans is difficult, how about getting new investors?

182
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,980
Would you invest in it if it were you, Ms. Yeon Ah?

183
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,290
- I wouldn't if it were me. 
 - Still, if you search—

184
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,040
What about interest costs in the meantime?

185
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,520
Every time you breathe, the interest accumulates.

186
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,810
Then what if they seize your salary?

187
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,740
Still...

188
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,830
So we've come to a conclusion, right,

189
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,150
to stop producing special baby formula?

190
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,990
Under the condition that they utilize their facilities and resources to make normal baby formula,

191
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,520
we'll extend loans to Ilseong Baby Formula.

192
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,770
- If not, then... 
 - It seems so if you just view numbers.

193
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,880
However, when you consider the babies who need special formula...

194
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,340
An accountant makes an assessment based on capacity, not sincerity,

195
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,580
an objective assessment that everyone can accept.

196
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,170
So money is more important than people's lives.

197
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,380
We are not the babies who drink the special baby formula,

198
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,340
but adults to save Ilseong Baby Formula from financial ruin.

199
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,580
Don't get it confused.

200
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,210
Meeting is over.

201
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,810
This is why our job is difficult.

202
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:10,010
With only numbers, there's nothing to worry about.

203
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,940
Mr. Ho Woo...

204
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,070
We should also go.

205
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,850
If I tell people around me

206
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:33,390
about a company that makes special baby formula to save babies out of pure conviction,

207
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,030
ten out of ten would say such a company must be saved.

208
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,940
However, everyone here says the only solution is to stop production.

209
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,020
Ten out of ten...

210
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,480
Why didn't I think of that?

211
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,590
It's not like it costs anything extra, and though it's not 100% reliable,

212
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,730
if we make a favorable factor...

213
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,840
Right, then we'll have a chance!

214
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
And new investors may appear as well.

215
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,700
If only that could happen,

216
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,990
we may be able to prevent halting production of the special baby formula.

217
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,680
Let's go.

218
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,960
 Who is it? 

219
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,930
Hye Won, Hye Won! I really have something to tell you today.

220
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,880
I mean it.

221
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:33,100
You said you have something to tell me.

222
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,850
Hye Won...

223
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,560
What is this?

224
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,680
Please hug me...

225
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,730
Did you buy stocks?

226
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,890
Did you lose all your money investing in coins?

227
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,100
   

228
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,010
Our daughter is so pretty.

229
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,640
She seems pretty to you since you only see her when she's asleep.

230
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,840
With open eyes, she's fierce.

231
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,760
She was being so difficult just yesterday too,

232
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,010
asking when Daddy was coming.

233
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,250
Hey, don't worry.

234
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,860
It's not like you're dying today.

235
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,600
Besides, it's not like we'll starve.

236
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,770
I'm an accountant.

237
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,800
You think you're the only accountant.

238
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,420
Why don't you eat snacks with the alcohol?

239
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm on your side.

240
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,670
Did we fight when life was tough on us?

241
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,000
We always clashed, trying to boast and one-up each other.

242
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,380
   

243
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a shame that the eyes

244
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,870
of a young man like you ended up like this.

245
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,890
So what did you say you're asking for?

246
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,670
I asked for appropriate compensation and a proper end,

247
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:19,000
and that Ms. Son Hye Won of the Deals Department will receive those benefits instead of me.

248
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,740
If you came all the way here, that's probably not the end.

249
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,910
These are the call records and messages burying the problem

250
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,160
through compensation money, not fixing safety facilities,

251
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,450
when Sangah Group's subcontractor employees protested.

252
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,160
There are also files on Haebit Construction from five years ago.

253
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,030
"Haebit Construction"?

254
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:54,960
What you ordered me to do for getting loans for Ilseong Baby Formula, my father-in-law's company—

255
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,330
Mr. Yang Jae Hwan.

256
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,640
Mr. Yang Jae Hwan seems to be quite mistaken about something.

257
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,580
Just as

258
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,970
Mr. Shim Hyung Woo knows,

259
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,460
I've never given orders before.

260
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,020
All I've done was give appropriate opinions.

261
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,560
If you can't believe that, why don't you reread the texts I've sent you?

262
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:29,560
The one who heard my opinion and acted

263
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,710
was by all means done of your own accord.

264
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,480
Mr. Yang,

265
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,790
aren't you an expert?

266
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,800
V.P. Han.

267
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,110
- That's an inappropriate— 
 - Mr. Yang.

268
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,920
Have you ever seen an ambulance keep the speed limit?

269
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,650
   

270
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,990
 He lacks flexibility. 

271
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,060
 Whether they're my guys or not, 

272
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,940
 no one knows to keep a secret. 

273
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,600
 Director Shim Hyung Woo... 

274
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,290
 check carefully. 

275
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,870
 There may be more like him. 

276
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,710
 I've been clearing them out, but I'll check once again. 

277
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,030
 Do you, by chance, 

278
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,050
 also want something more? 

279
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,080
 I think that would be of sufficient value. 

280
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,020
   

281
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,720
   

282
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,700
Hello, Director Shim Hyung Woo.

283
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,570
Ma'am, please give me one soju glass.

284
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,440
 Okay. 

285
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,620
My successful colleague, you're making it so obvious that I'm unwanted here.

286
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,550
That's upsetting.

287
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,810
Eat a lot while you can.

288
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,920
When you grow old, even your throat doesn't listen to you.

289
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,280
Thank you.

290
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:12,260
As usual, this place has great heartwarming generosity more than taste.

291
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,480
Sunbae!

292
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,140
Here.

293
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,830
I was supposed to meet him so I called him here. That's okay, right?

294
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,960
Sit down.

295
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,570
It's been a while, Shim Hyung Woo.

296
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,620
Look at how much better you look.

297
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,710
Is working at an asset management company good?

298
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,080
If you're jealous, you should leave your company, too.

299
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,860
Should I?

300
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,930
Here.

301
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:43,840
I used to bring you guys and Seung Jo here often when you were new staff.

302
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,710
- Oh, Ma'am! 
 - Have you been busy?

303
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,960
Oh, yes. After I moved companies, I was so busy.

304
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,810
I'll get angry if you don't come often.

305
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,120
Yes, Ma'am! I'll make sure to come often.

306
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,310
All right.

307
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,730
The Shim Hyung Woo back then

308
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,700
was so chaotic, clumsy, and hectic.

309
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,960
Still, he was quite a decent accountant.

310
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,610
But if anyone asks me if I want to return to those days,

311
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,120
I can't, even if they pay me trillions in gold.

312
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,780
I think I would.

313
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,780
Is something going on with you?

314
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,140
Did Han Je Gyun say something to you?

315
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,040
What? Han Je Gyun is Han Je Gyun... so what?

316
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,710
I spoke the name of the vice president you serve so devotedly, so what?

317
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,490
Are you okay?

318
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,510
Living like that...

319
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,220
You should speak up when you need to.

320
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,720
I won't ask any questions; I'll just listen.

321
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,380
So come by anytime you want.

322
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,420
   

323
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,760
   

324
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:28,290
   

325
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,660
I'll go home early today.

326
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,700
Vice President.

327
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,880
He's coming in, Vice President.

328
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,420
V.P. Han,

329
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,650
I was wrong.

330
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,710
Hye Won...

331
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,660
I mean,

332
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,850
Ms. Son Hye Won did nothing wrong.

333
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,990
You know that as well, V.P.

334
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,900
V.P. Han.

335
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,340
I'll just say none of it ever happened. No, I'll bury it all as my own mistakes.

336
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,570
So if you could just promise to take care of

337
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,700
Ms. Son Hye Won's career, I will do anything.

338
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,320
Can you really take responsibility for what you just said?

339
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,440
Yes. I'll do anything you order me to.

340
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,270
No.

341
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,570
Not what I order you to do,

342
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,460
but of your own accord.

343
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,430
Yes.

344
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,090
What's with that odd combination? 
    

345
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,130
Powdered milk... beer...

346
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,080
Don't talk to me right now.

347
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,510
I'm busy trying to save the world.

348
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,000
I told you to use that time to sleep.

349
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,540
- Oh, hey. 
 - Hey.

350
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,570
Hello.

351
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,990
Hey, what are you doing with that?

352
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,630
There's no way you're drinking just that much.

353
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,230
On the way in, I saw that a stray cat had babies.

354
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,740
I need to help as a good neighbor.

355
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,980
What do you think you're doing?

356
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,790
You also think it's too small, right?

357
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,440
Whatever it is, bigger is always better.

358
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,710
Have you ever heard of "lactose intolerance"?

359
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,290
What?

360
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,960
You see this?

361
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,780
"Lactose intolerance."

362
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,350
Since cat and dog intestines lack enzymes to break down lactose,

363
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,990
you have to feed them stuff like this.

364
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,890
You almost killed all the cats in the neighborhood.

365
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,560
Cats eat powdered milk?

366
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,340
Yes, cats need...

367
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,010
 Pet powdered milk? 

368
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,470
Yes, powdered milk made for pets.

369
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,680
There are a few details to refine,

370
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,000
but since dogs and cats also lack enzymes to break down lactose, the formula base is the same.

371
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,690
We can use the existing production line without any added costs.

372
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,280
Not only can it be used for pet powdered milk, but also for lactose-free supplements for elders,

373
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,770
and for foods aiding health and dieting.

374
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,310
So you're suggesting producing more rather than stopping production?

375
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:45,650
Mr. Jang, you realize you're suggesting the opposite of what other accountants have said, right?

376
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,280
The purpose is sufficient, but specialized powdered milk makes no profit.

377
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,990
Didn't you say the demand was too low to have a viable market?

378
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,920
So in order to make profit, shouldn't we expand the market

379
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,590
by making more products with a definite market value?

380
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,560
I mean, I guess that's true.

381
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,160
Instead of aimlessly looking at the unchanging financial statement numbers,

382
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,680
changing what needs to be changed is the best way to resolve the problem.

383
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,260
In contrast to the falling fertility rate, the market for pets is growing rapidly.

384
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:19,110
And since the elderly population is increasing, the demand is definite.

385
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,870
And this here is also Mr. Ho Woo's idea.

386
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,730
We decided to get help from the sponsors and upload statements online as well.

387
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:31,010
Once an active public opinion forms, possibly, new investors will join.

388
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,650
- What do you think? 
 - Think what?

389
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:36,280
You were honestly uneasy about it, weren't you?

390
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,960
But I guess we found a way to save this.

391
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,720
I already wrote the report saying we would cease production.

392
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,160
Jang Ho Woo,

393
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,070
you created this mess so take responsibility

394
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,250
and rewrite a whole new report for Ilseong Powdered Milk.

395
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,940
If you make a mistake on even one word,

396
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,710
you're dead.

397
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,150
That means...

398
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,960
Yes! I did it.

399
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,350
When Ms. Hye Won hears you saved the special baby formula, she will be so happy.

400
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,490
You two achieved a big thing.

401
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,510
Han Seung Jo's actually thrilled on the inside.

402
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,300
♫  Don't want to lose all my pride  ♫

403
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,890
♫  You're not the man at the wheel  ♫

404
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,450
   

405
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,990
   

406
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,700
   

407
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,120
   

408
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,850
   

409
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,800
   

410
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,290
   

411
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,120
I said I'll take care of it, Dad.

412
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,960
Then why haven't I heard anything from you?

413
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,450
When do I get to see the eye candy at your firm?

414
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,080
No...

415
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,640
Anyway, I'm busy.

416
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,290
 Could an accountant be any busier than a bank president? 

417
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,630
What can be so important when your dad is asking to meet him?

418
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:40,850
Yes, this person is really important.

419
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:43,630
- Dad, I'll talk to you later. 
  - Will you really be like this? 

420
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,740
 Oh, Jang Ji Soo... 

421
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,010
I remember her since she ordered international shipping as far as Hong Kong.

422
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,000
She was originally our client, and

423
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,440
she has continued to sponsor us ever since her child became healthy.

424
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,660
Her first order for baby formula was five years ago...

425
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,250
So the child must be around six now.

426
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,270
Is the child okay now?

427
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,530
Yes.

428
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,870
How did you know?

429
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,080
Your name was on the Ilseong Baby Formula sponsor list.

430
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,010
The person you spoke to every time you donated is my junior.

431
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,550
How futile.

432
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,740
I was so careful.

433
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:58,390
How about going back to Hong Kong and being with the child there?

434
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,070
I still have things to finish here.

435
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,720
I know you'll be careful for the child's sake, but I'm more worried about you.

436
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,080
Please don't jump into this all-out war with my father.

437
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,670
It's something I have to do.

438
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,580
♫  I wonder what you look like now  ♫

439
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,330
Ji Soo...

440
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,930
I couldn't protect you then, but I am not making the same mistake now.

441
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,390
I'll get going.

442
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,190
Why don't you ask?

443
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,120
♫  By chance, do you remember?  ♫

444
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,680
Because I think I know even if you don't tell me.

445
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,470
And I feel...

446
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,000
so bad.

447
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,430
♫  Even though the strong scent seeped into me is gone  ♫

448
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,370
If I'm right about what my father is doing,

449
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,080
I don't think I can say anything right to you.

450
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,270
I'll be back.

451
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:14,900
♫  Remember you  ♫

452
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,220
♫  I'll remember you  ♫

453
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,260
We should have killed off Lee Seong Joo, that b*stard!

454
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:40,040
You've definitely killed the stock price while you've been hospitalized

455
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,430
so please find satisfaction in that.

456
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,910
Thanks to your causing the accident, Chairman,

457
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:49,740
your son, Bo Sung's succession plan has been launched.

458
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,790
Since the stock price fell naturally without having to do any separate work,

459
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,980
we have begun accumulating shares.

460
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,720
While the stock price is rock bottom, we need to buy all the stocks we can under Bo Sung's name.

461
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,090
Thanks to this, tax was deducted so the stock donation is also in progress.

462
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,660
Exactly!

463
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:08,020
Just like others, I should have used Covid time when stock prices dropped by half

464
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,180
to finish the succession plan.

465
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,970
Isn't the best timing... something people can make?

466
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,480
Oh, is that so?

467
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:26,110
But... Lee Seong Joo, that b*stard, said Sangah Group would fall!

468
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:31,280
I think he asked Accountant Han Seung Jo to gather bonds due to that.

469
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,690
I won't let him get away with it!

470
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,660
Yes?

471
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,160
I know you're busy gathering Sangah Group bonds,

472
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,300
but take a look at this. You won't regret it.

473
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,080
I see they're trying to use me in this smoke screen operation.

474
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,120
They are making me appear an idiot.

475
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,870
Why not let them use you since they already are?

476
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,970
What?

477
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,780
Let's hide from them... the fact that we know.

478
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,820
It's time for the stock prices to stop dropping.

479
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,400
It doesn't want to go up at all!

480
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,080
At this rate, I fear my credits would get liquidated,

481
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,340
I'd lose my stocks, and even have to repay double.

482
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,170
I can't sleep at night!

483
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:08,710
You're waiting so patiently; you should hear some news soon.

484
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,190
What the heck? I told you not to disturb me when I have a guest!

485
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,810
My apologies.

486
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,680
What is it?

487
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,150
   
   

488
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,200
"Participation in management"?

489
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,800
Has this been disclosed?

490
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,420
This b*stard... When did he take this much stock?

491
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,160
   

492
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,830
   

493
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,980
These b*stards have lost their minds!

494
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,480
Who says to open a shareholders' meeting?

495
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,560
I can see that you are busy.

496
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,070
I will get going now.

497
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,810
Lee Seung Joo, this b*stard, there's no way.

498
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,760
 Chairman Lee Chan Joo is easy to deal with. 

499
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,200
 But... 

500
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,450
 sweet-talking someone too dense to have a proper conversation and getting peanuts in return... 

501
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,100
 Are you satisfied with that? 

502
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,700
 I am not in any kind of rush. 

503
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,700
 Don't you want to climb higher with me and achieve greater dreams? 

504
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,440
 And when we go... you should leave behind that bothersome "Vice" in your title. 

505
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,050
 A man who wants to go up so high... 

506
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,160
 Someone like that... shouldn't be in such a state of health. 

507
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,000
   

508
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,940
 Right here. 

509
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,060
 You just need to sign right here. 

510
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,070
 What if I reject? 

511
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,730
 Why ask such an unnecessary question? 

512
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:13,530
 Then I guess HK Private Equity Fund... would need to find a new player. 

513
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,820
 Since there would be no reason to keep a player with a different mindset. 

514
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,210
   

515
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,530
Then I guess I will see you at the special stockholders' meeting,

516
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,330
Chairman Lee.

517
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,580
Hey, V.P. Han—

518
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,530
V.P. Han Je Gyun!

519
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:52,430
V.P. Hey, Han Je Gyun!

520
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,710
Hey, Han Je Gyun!

521
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,010
In the midst of the severe financial crisis,

522
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:30,600
under this unstable owner system that harms the corporation,

523
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,100
there is no future for Sangah.

524
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,560
Thus, we are in favor of Chairman Lee Chan Joo's dismissal

525
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,790
and reappointment of a new chairman.

526
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:45,610
- I second the motion. 
 - I second the motion.

527
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:58,160
   

528
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,880
You must have been busy.

529
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,060
Gathering stocks without people knowing.

530
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,010
Nothing to be surprised about.

531
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:12,120
I can understand the one who devised a plan using his son.

532
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,530
That one must have lent the money.

533
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,170
When you asked me to gather Sangah Group bonds,

534
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,490
it was a gimmick to reassure Chairman Lee Chan Joo.

535
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,040
Is that right?

536
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,130
I really do thank you, Accountant Han Seung Jo.

537
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,240
For the time I asked you to collect the bonds,

538
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,590
and for telling me to gather stocks,

539
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,690
I won't forget your advice.

540
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,330
I will consider this as my payment for using your name.

541
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,630
Ultimately, between either Lee Chan Joo or Lee Seong Joo,

542
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,240
it'll be determined based on who holds the dominant share.

543
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,930
Who knows?

544
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,600
In the current state where employees are putting their backs against their owners,

545
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:07,450
I wonder if such a dominant share is left for Chairman Lee Chan Joo.

546
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,870
Yes. Very much so.

547
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,200
I did my best to bury it without any evidence left in the ledger.

548
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:45,100
Do you do this kind of work often?

549
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,040
Does V.P. Han tell you...

550
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,750
   

551
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,940
We will announce the ballot results.

552
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,270
For quick understanding, I will announce results in percentages.

553
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,620
First,

554
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,780
for Lee Seong Joo:

555
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,710
thirty-one percent.

556
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,590
Next, for Lee Chan Joo:

557
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,100
thirty-one percent.

558
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,510
 We'll accumulate friendly stakes for you, Sir. 

559
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:26,740
 How could I trust you two? 

560
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,620
 And on top of that, you're V.P. Han Je Gyun's son. 

561
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,140
 There is a clear reason to help you, Chairman. 

562
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,760
 Han Je Gyun. 

563
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:40,180
 If you stay at Sangah as the chairman, 

564
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,940
 V.P. Han Je Gyun would lose Sangah Group. 

565
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,030
 It would mean his one place to hide 

566
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:51,400
 would disappear. 

567
00:46:53,530 --> 00:47:00,090
Lastly, HK Private Equity Fund which holds 14% of the stakes...

568
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,610
   

569
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,660
Why are there two of these?

570
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,400
One for Chairman Lee Seong Joo.

571
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,100
And the other for Chairman Lee Chan Joo.

572
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,980
So HK Private Equity Fund is...

573
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,840
The candidate that HK Private Equity Fund supports is

574
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,790
Lee Chan Joo.

575
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,900
I have been delegated by HK Private Equity Fund to put in the vote.

576
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,740
 It's not that we like Lee Chan Joo. 

577
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,020
 It's because he's still useful for us. 

578
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,150
 Even if you publicly support Lee Chan Joo, V.P. Han Je Gyun... 

579
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,990
 can never come forward and say he's not A.N. 

580
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,360
 There is no official designation, 

581
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,220
 and if he were going to come forward, he wouldn't have hidden in the first place. 

582
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,760
 I also want to help, but... 

583
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,220
 V.P. Han Je Gyun already came to me with a power of attorney. 

584
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,520
 There was a good reason for that too. 

585
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,710
 No. 

586
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,970
 It's actually even better that he already got it from you. 

587
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,620
 Noona, just come to the special shareholders' meeting. 

588
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,220
 We'll show them what it's like... 

589
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,440
   

590
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,320
 to be caught like a sitting duck. 

591
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:37,790
 Is Han Seung Jo helping as well? 

592
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,320
 You, who lost a father, 

593
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,680
 as well as Han Seung Jo, who lost you due to his father, 

594
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:48,730
 now both need to risk everything to stop Han Je Gyun. 

595
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,410
 You make the decision, Noona. 

596
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:53,500
 I believe that Accountant Han Seung Jo 

597
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,170
 is different from V.P. Han Je Gyun. 

598
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,410
Where there are two powers of attorney from the same shareholder,

599
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:09,620
the first one can be overturned by the latter one,

600
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,520
since the latter power of attorney

601
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,800
is the shareholder's final decision guaranteed by law.

602
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,380
As a result, I announce that Chairman Lee Chan Joo's dismissal

603
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:34,820
and Chairman Lee Seong Joo's appointment are rejected. 
    

604
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,930
Yes!

605
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,160
Hooray!

606
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,500
Find out who that b*stard is immediately.

607
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,440
I'll take you home.

608
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,350
It's okay.

609
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,000
Listen to me.

610
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:24,880
   

611
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,440
   

612
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:42,930
 We fabricated the ledger by importing raw materials from overseas 

613
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,250
 and increasing inventory prices. 

614
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:49,370
If we cover up with a warehouse fire, there should be no problem.

615
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:53,600
Nothing is more definite than burning the whole thing down.

616
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,830
I will make sure to take good care of it.

617
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,710
Director Shim Hyung Woo.

618
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,290
Yes, V.P. Han.

619
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:06,640
While burning those, could you burn one more bad inventory?

620
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,550
Which one?

621
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,600
I'll promise you a partner position once you take care of it.

622
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,830
The decision is up to you. So slowly...

623
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,670
very slowly, take your time to think over my offer.

624
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,780
Shim Hyung Woo.

625
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,650
Sunbae.

626
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,830
What's wrong? What happened?

627
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:16,420
I thought I tried my best in life,

628
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,780
but I must have been wrong.

629
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,700
Once Ilseong Baby Formula starts making pet powdered milk and supplements,

630
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,240
Sangah Supermarket and Sangah Department Store will distribute them.

631
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,090
I heard of new investment as well.

632
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:43,460
With a new plan in place, as soon as you shape public opinion online,

633
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,100
I believe the problem will surely be resolved.

634
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,530
Thank you, Mr. Ho Woo. This is all thanks to you, Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

635
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,630
No, it's thanks to your father

636
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:57,860
since he didn't give up after merely judging the numbers like others.

637
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:03,080
- Thank you, too, Ms. Yeon Ah. 
 - Don't mention it.

638
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,020
Drink this.

639
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,560
What?

640
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,830
Thanks

641
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:35,670
for working hard on the Ilseong Baby Formula case.

642
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:41,970
It seems I'm terrible at... judging people.

643
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,660
All this time,

644
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,430
I disregarded and judged you as a high school graduate.

645
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,110
I really do apologize.

646
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,480
For all you did for Ms. Son Hye Won,

647
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,890
if I could ever repay it...

648
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,820
I will find a way to repay it.

649
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,370
You probably won't need it anyway.

650
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:06,980
Please...

651
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,960
do repay it.

652
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,670
I will be waiting.

653
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,200
Let's do that.

654
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,030
Mr. Ho Woo.

655
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:07,870
This is perfect. You have nothing to do anyway; you could just leave with President Jin.

656
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,670
Well, Ms. Jin Yeon Ah has recently been having so much fun at work

657
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,640
so she likely wouldn't want to accompany her dad.

658
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,270
Bye now.

659
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:26,010
"Dad"?

660
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,490
I will report as soon as I finish the burning.

661
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:51,310
I will see you when you get back.

662
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,350
Let's eat once Yeo Jin comes.

663
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,810
Yeo Jin has been waiting since the moment she left for work.

664
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,630
How hard are you going to drink?

665
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,150
It's the weekend; come on.

666
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:28,980
 Jang Ho Woo. 

667
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:33,840
 If you're going up against Han Je Gyun, you need to see this. 

668
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:42,540
   

669
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,000
Accountant Han Seong Jo, where are you?

670
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,100
There's a warehouse all the way in this backcountry.

671
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,780
Because you can leave no trace of bad inventory where nobody is around.

672
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,950
It's almost routine for the fire station.

673
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:20,680
They take their time to come when you call them.

674
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,850
And they even wait for you.

675
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:01,220
When it comes to bad inventory to leave behind,

676
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,750
does V.P. Han always get rid of it like this?

677
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,090
It's nearly done.

678
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,720
"Nearly"?

679
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,350
Is something else left?

680
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,510
Only burn the warehouse.

681
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,310
Leave this behind.

682
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,310
The order was...

683
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:29,290
I'll take care of it so do as I say.

684
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,390
 If, in any case, 

685
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:50,070
 Shim Hyung Woo decides to have any other ideas... 

686
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:07,960
 Understood, Sir. 

687
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,370
Mr. Yang.

688
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,070
Hold on.

689
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,610
Director.

690
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:33,150
Director Shim Hyung Woo! Director Shim Hyung Woo!

691
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,610
Jang Ho Woo!

692
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:38,260
Here! Hurry!

693
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:43,110
 Jang Ho Woo! Here! 

694
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,090
Here!

695
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:49,950
Jang Ho Woo! Jang Ho Woo!

696
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,620
Hey, you b*stard!

697
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,940
What's going on here?

698
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,800
Mr. Yang!

699
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,870
Help Yang Jae Hwan first.

700
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,960
What is this? What about Shim Hyung Woo?

701
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,930
He's inside the warehouse.

702
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:37,120


703
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:47,510
♫  The endless time swaying in the gentle breeze  ♫

704
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:52,750
♫  It cannot be forgotten; you need to stand up  ♫

705
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:57,500
♫  Balancing for the final moment  ♫

706
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:02,580
♫  In order to delay the tension  ♫

707
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,030
   

708
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,090
 The people from Taeil Scholarship Association. Don't you know? 

709
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,960
 Also called the "Knights of Han Je Gyun." 

710
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,720
 What kind of work are you envisioning? 

711
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,430
 Someone searched Shim Hyung Woo's office. 

712
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,430
 So this is a record of Han Je Gyun's wrongs. 

713
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:21,560
 What proof do you have that it was me? 

714
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:24,900
 I told you before. I like an interesting story. 

715
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,030
 The Jang In Ho of Haebit Construction from way back when? 

716
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,160
 Get out! 

717
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,280
 Ahjussi? 

718
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,340
 Will you be able to handle it? 

719
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:43,250
♫  I will call out in the midst of it for all to see  ♫

720
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,900
♫  In the moment I desired  ♫
