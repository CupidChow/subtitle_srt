(Episode 4)

4
00:00:19,346 --> 00:00:20,645
Why did you do that?

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:25,986
What?

6
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,986
About Haebit Construction.

7
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:41,766
Why did you make the decision...

8
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:44,806
to liquidate the company?

9
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:51,545
One's life isn't a joke.

10
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:54,915
How could you?

11
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:01,716
Why are you asking me about that?

12
00:01:01,956 --> 00:01:03,986
Because the person who wanted to ask is dead.

13
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,024
Don't lie about it...

14
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,656
being a sound decision based on financial statements.

15
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:10,796
We know it wasn't.

16
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:12,495
What?

17
00:01:12,496 --> 00:01:15,134
If the company closed because of irreparable financial problems...

18
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:16,565
as the world was told,

(Outside Auditor Report)

20
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:19,265
just like any other project,

21
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:22,106
the related reports would be in the filing room.

22
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:25,475
Because you wouldn't have to fear...

23
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:28,576
who saw the contents.

(Haebit Construction Workout Liquidation Valuation, 2017)

25
00:01:32,317 --> 00:01:33,615
But they weren't.

26
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:37,585
As if they never existed.

27
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:42,596
I'd checked every day since the day I joined Taeil.

28
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:45,895
Every single day, without fail.

29
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:50,736
That was one of the reasons I chose Taeil over any other firm.

30
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:54,106
To see for myself...

31
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:58,606
the report that made Haebit Construction shut down.

32
00:01:59,046 --> 00:02:00,145
What if you saw it?

33
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:03,546
What would it change when it was done and dusted?

34
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:05,516
The future.

35
00:02:06,145 --> 00:02:08,786
The future of the people who shut down Haebit Construction.

36
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:12,356
I won't let them live in peace...

37
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:16,495
as if nothing happened until now.

38
00:02:22,895 --> 00:02:24,636
Do you believe that's possible?

39
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,636
It's not impossible.

40
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,845
When you first saw me at Haebit's construction site,

41
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:40,815
did you imagine we'd be here having this conversation?

42
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:44,926
It's time to give me an answer.

00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,606
Where is it now?

46
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:08,245
You paid more than you had planned to,

47
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:11,215
but you prevented your brother from getting into your accounts.

48
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:13,745
Consider that your prize.

49
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:16,516
Accountant Sim Hyung Woo.

50
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:19,926
Why didn't you stop me earlier?

51
00:03:21,226 --> 00:03:23,395
- Pardon? - Aren't you...

52
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:25,266
the expert?

53
00:03:26,025 --> 00:03:27,166
You saw me...

54
00:03:27,296 --> 00:03:30,064
put down that preposterous amount,

55
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:31,834
and you just watched?

56
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:33,605
You were so insistent on...

57
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:37,236
I paid for your services. You should've made it worthwhile.

58
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,645
You call yourself an accountant?

59
00:03:40,446 --> 00:03:43,315
Don't you consider that negligence and dereliction of duty?

60
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:46,416
You laughed?

61
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:50,516
Did you just laugh at the pathetic sight...

62
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:52,654
of a chairman shrinking away...

63
00:03:52,655 --> 00:03:55,495
in fear of his younger brother?

64
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:57,865
Would I dare, sir?

65
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:02,635
Accept a drink from me and let it go.

66
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:04,095
You idiot!

67
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:09,735
Do you think you're my equal...

68
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:11,905
because I sit and converse with you?

69
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:14,105
I'm Lee Chan Ju!

70
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:16,515
I was born to be Sang Ah Group's chairman!

71
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:19,514
Have you forgotten your place just because...

72
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:21,786
you have a smarter brain than me?

73
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,425
I'd love to see if your clever brain contains...

74
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:27,856
something other than ink and numbers.

75
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:31,065
Shall I split open your skull and see for you?

76
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:33,896
Paying the price for killing a dog that did its job...

77
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,635
is no big deal to me!

78
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,935
Is your accounting firm the only one in the country?

79
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,275
I know a truckload of accounting firm CEOs...

80
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:44,304
who'd rush over mid-pee with their underwear...

81
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:46,505
around their ankles if I called.

82
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:50,216
A whisper from me is enough to end your life.

83
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:54,185
I refuse to work with Taeil as long as you're there.

84
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:55,985
What choice do they have?

85
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,726
They'll have to fire you.

86
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:00,926
We're partners? What a joke.

87
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:03,426
Your career's over.

88
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:05,426
No.

89
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:07,695
Help me, sir.

90
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:10,635
If you let this go,

91
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:12,935
I'll never let you down again.

92
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,036
I didn't do my duty as an accountant today.

93
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:20,146
I apologize for that sincerely.

94
00:05:21,575 --> 00:05:24,546
Hey. Sim Hyung Woo.

95
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:29,586
Do a better job, okay?

96
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,885
What an idiot.

97
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:33,825
Gosh.

98
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,236
Because the person who wanted to ask is dead.

99
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:25,245
(Police)

100
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:52,135
Ji Soo, no.

101
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,106
Don't look.

102
00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:05,146
Dad!

103
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:00,536
You're awake.

104
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:02,705
Yes.

105
00:08:07,276 --> 00:08:08,375
Are you okay?

106
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:09,944
What's up?

107
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:11,546
I should ask you that.

108
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:13,416
I came by because you didn't answer your phone.

109
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,185
You'd been okay for a while.

110
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,255
Is something wrong?

111
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:21,856
I just need to rest.

112
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:25,025
I'm worried you'll relapse.

113
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:27,565
You're on meds for a panic disorder so you wouldn't have had a drink.

114
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,396
Have you not been sleeping?

115
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:33,335
Because of the bad loan deal?

116
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:37,435
- Yes. - That's really it?

117
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,575
Aren't you acting out of character because you hired Jang Ho Woo?

118
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:46,286
I must change how I act if I'm to change my life.

119
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:48,756
You're really unwell now.

120
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:53,055
I can go now that I saw you're alive.

121
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,896
See you at work tomorrow.

122
00:08:56,055 --> 00:08:57,325
Stay here.

123
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,325
Don't see me out or come to work.

124
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:10,636
It's time to give me an answer.

125
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:13,045
Han Seung Jo's report...

126
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:15,715
on Haebit Construction's liquidation decision.

127
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:17,575
Where is it now?

128
00:09:30,256 --> 00:09:32,665
An accounting firm thinks from the creditors' perspective...

129
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:35,036
and decides whether to keep the company...

130
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,835
that owes money open or shut it down.

131
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,735
Simply put, they weigh out...

132
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:44,845
which is more profitable, to let the goose live

133
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:47,844
for the eggs it'll lay in the future,

134
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:50,646
or to kill it now...

135
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:52,416
and sell the feathers and meat.

136
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:55,354
Choosing to keep the goose alive...

137
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:58,185
and collect the eggs is going concern value.

138
00:09:59,085 --> 00:10:01,824
Killing the goose to sell its feathers and meat...

139
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:03,156
is liquidation value.

140
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:06,496
If the liquidation value is higher,

141
00:10:07,095 --> 00:10:08,366
the goose dies,

142
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:10,396
and the company shuts down.

143
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,366
But if the going concern value is higher,

144
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:16,305
the goose lives, and so does the company.

145
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:21,146
In other words, the company's future depends on the accounting firm.

146
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:28,315
It would've been more profitable to keep Haebit going.

147
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,386
So why did Taeil Accounting...

148
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,725
cut the goose open?

149
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:36,955
Why did Han Seung Jo...

150
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,296
write up such a report?

151
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:54,746
You did...

152
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:56,876
very well yesterday.

153
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,315
I didn't do anything.

154
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:01,955
Mr. Han did all the work.

155
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:06,585
You must've heard the talk that's going around.

156
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,996
Don't take it to heart.

157
00:11:11,496 --> 00:11:12,695
Oh, dear.

158
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:15,235
I shouldn't have said that.

159
00:11:18,205 --> 00:11:21,604
People are saying you joined a table that someone else had set...

160
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,205
and took the credit in order to become a partner.

161
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:28,646
I spoke to them harshly,

162
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:31,445
so you don't have to worry.

163
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:34,955
You can sit.

164
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:41,126
You know,

165
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,526
for your father's sake,

166
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:49,065
I should make you a partner.

167
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:52,705
Shouldn't I?

168
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:54,975
Thank you, sir,

169
00:11:58,006 --> 00:12:00,006
but the credit for the bad loan deal...

171

Should I remain a director forever?

Didn't you take the day off?

181
00:13:03,805 --> 00:13:06,345
I was at Jisan Bank for an implementation check.

182
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:07,876
An implementation check?

183

You're managing a company workout?

184

- Soma Tech. - Oh, right.

185

Jisan's their creditor, right?

What would it change when it was done and dusted?

196

The future.

197

The future of the people who shut down Haebit Construction.

Sang Ah Construction put up Korea's first modular building.

Companies overseas are developing modularization technology,

205
00:15:03,156 --> 00:15:05,964
and it made its first appearance in Korea today.

206
00:15:05,965 --> 00:15:08,796
- They pulled it off. - Reporter Lee has the story.

207
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:11,805
Mr. Jang dreamed of building that thing.

208
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:15,475
I still think Ji Soo should've gotten married then.

209
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:17,006
She was so stubborn.

210
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:20,104
Her boyfriend pleaded with her to marry him,

211
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:23,175
but she insisted on waiting until his parents accepted her,

212
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:24,875
and then Mr. Jang died.

213
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:25,944
And she disappeared.

216
00:15:33,555 --> 00:15:36,594
Ji Soo isn't your granddaughter.

217
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:37,724
I am.

218

All over the place.

222
00:16:01,815 --> 00:16:03,786
Why are they making such a fuss tonight?

223
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,724
It's the last day of the year,

224
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:08,055
so they have to wrap it up today.

to sell them.

333
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:55,975

That's true, but...

335

While we sell Soma Tech,

338
00:26:14,426 --> 00:26:16,035
you can put the blames on us.

"This is what Taeil Accounting said."

340
00:26:18,636 --> 00:26:20,105
They said you should sell it.

341
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:21,906
Who would complain about that?

342
00:26:24,576 --> 00:26:27,646
I can give you more than enough excuses.

343
00:26:31,316 --> 00:26:34,115
It's our job to check if Soma Tech is...

344
00:26:34,116 --> 00:26:37,416
keeping up with the promises when they were on a workout.

345
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:40,925
Please don't forget this company's future...

346
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:42,426
relies on us.

347
00:27:09,955 --> 00:27:12,184
Soma Tech's cash flow.

348
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:14,025
For the cash flow,

349
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,994
Manager Yang Jae Hwan should take care of it.

350
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:17,325
Yes, I'm on it.

351
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:18,856
For profitability review,

352
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:20,896
Ms. Jin Yeon A should be in charge.

353
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:22,765
And Ms. Jang Ho Woo.

354
00:27:24,136 --> 00:27:26,565
The other companies might have belittled the price...

355
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:29,235
for Soma Tech is on a workout.

356
00:27:29,376 --> 00:27:31,176
Keep that in mind when you check.

357
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,944
Perhaps, they were forced...

358
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:35,876
due to the sales.

359
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:37,846
I'll check for dumping.

360
00:27:38,015 --> 00:27:39,015
Okay.

361
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:42,116
Next is the expected amount of debt.

362
00:27:51,426 --> 00:27:53,326
I asked Han Seung Jo to do...

363
00:27:54,326 --> 00:27:56,666
Soma Tech's implementation check because...

364
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:58,136
I know.

365
00:27:58,795 --> 00:28:01,535
He demanded it in return for selling bad loans.

366
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:05,376
What am I going to tell him about this case?

367
00:28:06,745 --> 00:28:08,705
If he finds out later that I left him...

368
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,176
for you,

369
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:13,515
he won't forgive me.

370
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:16,086
You should blame the president of the bank.

371
00:28:17,386 --> 00:28:18,586
The high-ups are...

372
00:28:19,185 --> 00:28:21,755
meant to provide your customers excuses.

373
00:28:34,765 --> 00:28:35,806

00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:39,545
Here's your pay. Good luck.

376
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:59,366
The 3D construction creates less waste...

377
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:02,096
and reduces time and cost.

378
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:04,464
At first, I began to provide shelters...

379
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:07,306
in the slum or areas with disaster damages.

380
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:09,475
But that's only possible with money.

381
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:12,235
So I decided to patent it first.

382
00:29:12,435 --> 00:29:15,105
How's your patent different...

383
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:16,445
from other 3D construction technologies?

384
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:19,645
What matters the most...

385
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:21,886
when building with a 3D printer is durability.

386
00:29:21,985 --> 00:29:24,886
Not any nozzle can squeeze...

387
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,785
this 3D concrete invented for durability.

388
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:30,926
We invented the nozzle that can squeeze any concrete...

389
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:32,995
The price is lower,

390
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:37,396
but it's just as durable. That's our biggest strength.

391
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:39,935
And the construction doesn't take long.

392
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:43,705
It's eco-friendly as it reduces the construction waste.

393
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:47,505
If you consider the safety on site,

394
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:51,445
it's a futuristic technology that can kill 3 birds with 1 stone.

395
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:55,346
You must've gone through a lot.

396
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:58,886
Although I'm struggling now,

397
00:29:59,285 --> 00:30:02,225
I'm proud of my technology.

398
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,725
Aren't you going to work?

399
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:09,695
You need to stop looking at me at work.

400
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:13,366
What?

401
00:30:13,935 --> 00:30:15,906
Wait. Me?

402
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:19,576
I know what it's like to have a crush at work.

403
00:30:19,646 --> 00:30:21,945
Still, you need to focus on your job at work.

404
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:25,146
Wait.

405
00:30:29,455 --> 00:30:30,785
See?

406
00:30:31,185 --> 00:30:33,285
You're not listening to me because you're busy watching me.

407
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:39,126
Who was your crush?

408
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:43,195

411
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:52,235
let alone get a boyfriend.

412
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:55,406
At the time, Han Seung Jo was the only hot guy at work.

413
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:58,044
I bet everyone in the company...

414
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:00,245

415
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,916

Unless you have other opinions,

421
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:50,135
let's settle that Soma Tech...

422
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,596
has a high business value.

423
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,935

It's the employee number.

440
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:40,244
The barcode is there to record who copied and printed this paper...

in the company server.

It's part of an accounting company's internal control.

444

In case the internal document gets leaked and causes trouble,

Even if you're not a partner,

458
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:29,726
a barcode doesn't get printed if the partner approved.

But that rarely happens to prevent any trouble.

460

Why do you think so?

466
00:35:08,226 --> 00:35:10,635
This one has the barcode...

467
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:12,906
of the person who wrote and printed the report.

468
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:15,806
Whereas this doesn't.

469
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:18,576
Either the person who wrote and printed it was a partner...

470
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:22,246
or it was approved by a partner.

471
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:25,375
It also means these two reports aren't the same.

472
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:28,414
It could be the same report printed by different people.

473
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:29,585
No.

474
00:35:30,386 --> 00:35:33,556
There's a bigger difference than the presence of the barcode.

475
00:35:36,355 --> 00:35:37,895
The purpose of the report.

476
00:35:39,496 --> 00:35:41,125
They have completely different impressions.

477
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:45,194
This one says Haebit Construction is limited,

478
00:35:45,195 --> 00:35:47,605
yet has enough potential to grow.

479
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:51,535
Whereas this one says Haebit Construction has potential,

480
00:35:51,536 --> 00:35:53,406
yet the limit is evident.

481
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,782
They translated the same fact in different ways.

482
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,045
If I'm right,

483
00:36:01,746 --> 00:36:05,186
the conclusions of these reports were the opposite.

484
00:36:06,226 --> 00:36:07,355
So...

485
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,025
Haebit Construction should close.

486
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:14,266
Yet,

487
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,436
they should not close.

488
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:22,335
In the end, Haebit Construction was concluded to be closed.

489
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:27,075
The report that says not to close was written first,

490
00:36:27,076 --> 00:36:28,906
then for an unknown reason,

491
00:36:29,945 --> 00:36:32,815
it was switched to the report that says they must close.

492
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:35,085
That sounds more reasonable.

00:37:35,476 --> 00:37:36,915
(Vice President Han Je Kyun)

506
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:04,105
I concluded that Soma Tech be sold...

507
00:38:04,735 --> 00:38:07,444
due to their low workout grade.

508
00:38:07,445 --> 00:38:09,545
Says who? I'm in charge of this project.

509
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:11,676
My report says otherwise.

510
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:15,645
Who's selling Soma Tech and closing it down?

511
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:18,415
You don't need to write the report again.

512
00:38:18,855 --> 00:38:21,056
I have a backup.

513
00:38:21,956 --> 00:38:23,024
Father.

514
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:26,295
Leave it. It was going to go under anyway.

515
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:30,195
We're only advancing the date. What's wrong with that?

516
00:38:31,165 --> 00:38:33,266
Do you really not know?

517
00:38:35,806 --> 00:38:37,806
It's exactly like what happened then.

518
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:49,315
What is this?

519
00:38:50,186 --> 00:38:53,156
I wrote that Haebit Construction's going concern value was high.

520
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:55,326
Liquidation?

521
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,025
Why did you switch my report?

522
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:00,624
I only corrected...

523
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,395
your wrong answer.

524
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:04,366
What?

525
00:39:07,206 --> 00:39:09,465
Our job isn't to find optimization,

526
00:39:09,976 --> 00:39:11,906
but satisfaction.

527
00:39:13,505 --> 00:39:15,045
How many times do I need to tell you?

528
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:18,176
The correct answer is not the good answer...

529
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:22,386
for Haebit Construction but the good answer for our client.

530
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:25,214
It's already over.

531
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:27,685
Acting like this won't change anything.

532
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:30,456
I sent that company to you with my own hands.

533
00:39:30,695 --> 00:39:32,795
Because you're a better accountant than I am.

534
00:39:32,855 --> 00:39:35,024
I sent it to you with trust.

535
00:39:35,025 --> 00:39:37,964
Taking advantage of that company for your greed wasn't enough?

536
00:39:37,965 --> 00:39:39,735
You had to switch my report?

537
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:43,064
Especially when I was away for Mom's funeral?

538
00:39:43,065 --> 00:39:45,076
She's your wife before she's my mom.

539
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:48,476
Don't you feel bad for Mom?

540
00:39:49,406 --> 00:39:51,746
Your mom would've understood.

541
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:54,246
It's all for your good.

542
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,656
Besides,

543
00:39:57,056 --> 00:39:58,516
now that this has happened,

544
00:40:00,085 --> 00:40:01,656
you might as well wrap it up yourself.

545
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:05,524
Unless you want to see Ji Soo struggling with the debt...

546
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:07,725
her father left for her for the rest of her life.

547
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:08,926
Father!

548
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:16,306
Even if you leave this house and try something else,

549
00:40:20,775 --> 00:40:22,045
the result will be the same.

550
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:27,746
You know that I'm more than capable...

551
00:40:28,715 --> 00:40:30,186
of doing it.

552
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:38,855
And...

553
00:40:40,426 --> 00:40:41,625
your anger.

554
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:45,295
It's powerless.

555
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:51,005
Your anger that can't do anything.

556
00:40:53,346 --> 00:40:54,605
That is...

557
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:57,545
a mere opinion.

558
00:40:59,815 --> 00:41:01,616
Don't act like a child.

559
00:41:18,235 --> 00:41:21,335
Are you going to sell Soma Tech off abroad like Haebit Construction?

560
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:25,206
How many more do you have to sell until you're satisfied?

561
00:41:25,806 --> 00:41:27,175
Sell off?

562
00:41:27,176 --> 00:41:28,805
If we merge and acquire an overseas company,

563
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:30,375
it's a global investment,

564
00:41:31,145 --> 00:41:32,944
and if we sell a domestic company abroad,

565
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:34,745
it makes us traitors?

566
00:41:34,746 --> 00:41:36,415
There is something a human should...

567
00:41:37,485 --> 00:41:39,686
and shouldn't do.

568
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:45,295
Here you are,

569
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,496
an accountant...

570
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,065
who fell in love with cheap romance.

571
00:41:52,295 --> 00:41:55,334
I don't even have the slightest respect for you.

572
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:56,935
A dream to respect you?

573
00:41:56,936 --> 00:41:59,835
I don't need...

574
00:42:00,746 --> 00:42:03,075
your cheap respect.

575
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,845
You know that more than anyone.

576
00:42:04,846 --> 00:42:06,016
Right.

577
00:42:06,585 --> 00:42:09,746
You need a loyal dog, not a son.

578
00:42:09,846 --> 00:42:10,985
Like Sim Hyung Woo.

579
00:42:11,056 --> 00:42:12,914
Stop making a scene.

580
00:42:12,915 --> 00:42:14,625
Give Hyung Woo all the data.

581
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:18,624
It was he, who suggested to sell Soma Tech to HK Private Equity.

582
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:19,855
And...

583
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:23,735
listen to what the grown-up says, for goodness' sake.

584
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:25,096
The grown-up?

585
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:29,735
Where's the grown-up here?

586
00:42:41,886 --> 00:42:44,655
Jisan Bank rejected to extend Soma Tech's loan.

587
00:42:44,656 --> 00:42:45,855
They also restricted transactions.

588
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:48,584
They said it was suggested by us. I haven't found who...

589
00:42:48,585 --> 00:42:49,855
I know who it is.

590
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:51,996
What?

591
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:57,895
Where are you?

592
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:14,286
What are you doing? Get off.

593
00:43:14,485 --> 00:43:16,186
You haven't answered my question yet.

594
00:43:16,545 --> 00:43:18,854
No matter how busy you are, you'd have time to talk in the car.

595
00:43:18,855 --> 00:43:19,985
Get...

596
00:43:32,866 --> 00:43:34,366
Where are you going?

597
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:36,676
Slow down!

598
00:43:36,735 --> 00:43:39,306
Say one more word, and I'll throw you out.

599
00:43:48,746 --> 00:43:49,945
Sim Hyung Woo!

600
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:08,136
And you call yourself a human?

601
00:44:08,366 --> 00:44:09,835
Wasn't Haebit Construction enough?

602
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:12,235
What are you trying to sell Soma Tech for?

603
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:14,505
Haebit Construction?

604
00:44:16,145 --> 00:44:17,846
Taeil Accounting partner.

605
00:44:18,176 --> 00:44:19,616
That's what I'm trying to become.

606
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:21,715
I don't even expect you to have a conscience.

607
00:44:22,346 --> 00:44:25,485
Do you not even have the basic principles and pride...

608
00:44:25,755 --> 00:44:27,025
as an accountant?

609
00:44:27,755 --> 00:44:30,754
I thought I saw you at your lowest when you switched out...

610
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:32,226
my Haebit Construction report.

611
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,226
I must have underestimated you.

612
00:44:35,596 --> 00:44:37,535
You can go much lower.

613
00:44:37,536 --> 00:44:39,496
What did you just say? Haebit Construction?

614
00:44:39,965 --> 00:44:43,636
Are you saying Director Sim switched out your report?

615
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:45,375
You disgust me.

616
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:47,645
Don't act like a victim with that innocent face.

617
00:44:48,505 --> 00:44:50,116
I'm the real victim.

618
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:53,545
- What did you say? - I'm human too.

619
00:44:53,686 --> 00:44:56,145
Do you think I wanted to switch out your report...

620
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:58,515
during your mother's funeral?

621
00:44:58,516 --> 00:45:01,556
You still followed that order. How can you call yourself human?

622
00:45:02,286 --> 00:45:04,556
Grab anyone on the street and ask them.

623
00:45:04,656 --> 00:45:07,665
How many of them do you think can deny an order from a superior?

624
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:09,665
There aren't any.

625
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:12,535
You're the only person at Taeil Accounting...

626
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:14,335
who can refuse an order...

627
00:45:14,906 --> 00:45:17,335
from VP Han Je Kyun.

628
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:20,544
Am I still the offender and not the victim?

629
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:21,945
Don't speak nonsense.

630
00:45:22,275 --> 00:45:24,045
There were many ways not to do that.

631
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:26,616
An average person only has two choices.

632
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:29,415
Do it or get out. Attack or be attacked.

633
00:45:30,786 --> 00:45:34,186
To you, I must just seem like a guy obsessed with becoming partner.

634
00:45:34,855 --> 00:45:37,625
You're right. I'm obsessed. I've gone crazy.

635
00:45:38,326 --> 00:45:39,555
As long as I can become partner,

636
00:45:39,556 --> 00:45:41,565
I can switch out hundreds of reports.

637
00:45:42,525 --> 00:45:43,695
Soma Tech?

638
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,294
I could even become an organ trafficker...

639
00:45:46,295 --> 00:45:47,706
and sell its heart and liver!

640
00:45:48,936 --> 00:45:49,936
Why?

641
00:45:51,176 --> 00:45:53,945
Because I'm tired of getting blood on my hands.

642
00:45:54,406 --> 00:45:56,945
I don't want to live like this anymore!

643
00:45:57,076 --> 00:45:58,445
Do you think you'll stop living like this...

644
00:45:59,246 --> 00:46:00,545
once you become partner?

645
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:04,386
Once someone crosses a line, they can never go back.

646
00:46:05,085 --> 00:46:06,085
Especially for someone...

647
00:46:06,086 --> 00:46:07,826
who has been rewarded for crossing that line.

648
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:11,556
People like you and my father can never stop.

649
00:46:11,656 --> 00:46:13,056
That's why I'm going to stop you...

650
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:15,064
from becoming partner.

651
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:16,125
You jerk!

652
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:25,875
You also think I can do it, right?

653
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:29,144
Seeing you react like this is giving me energy.

654
00:46:29,145 --> 00:46:30,515
You were born on third base.

655
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:32,145
You can come home just by stealing a base.

656
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:35,185
What's wrong with me trying my best?

657
00:46:35,186 --> 00:46:36,815
Your best decision is...

658
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:41,085
creating the worst situations for others.

659
00:46:42,786 --> 00:46:44,596
That woman you would die for...

660
00:46:45,726 --> 00:46:47,195
If you ever...

661
00:46:48,326 --> 00:46:50,995
bring that up again, I'll kill you.

662
00:46:50,996 --> 00:46:53,665
Forget Haebit Construction. You couldn't even save your woman.

663
00:46:54,806 --> 00:46:56,806
I'm excited to see what you can do.

664
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:00,906
Don't be excited, you punk.

665
00:47:01,076 --> 00:47:03,915
I'll exceed your expectations, even without you acting like this.

666
00:47:04,315 --> 00:47:05,346
Got it?

667
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:25,595
You were against Haebit Construction closing down,

668
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:27,165
but during your mother's funeral,

669
00:47:28,536 --> 00:47:31,536
Sim Hyung Woo switched out your report under VP Han's orders.

670
00:47:32,406 --> 00:47:33,406
Is that correct?

671
00:47:33,407 --> 00:47:35,076
You heard everything. Why are you asking me again?

672
00:47:38,045 --> 00:47:39,616
You think it's fun to play with me?

673
00:47:40,415 --> 00:47:42,314
I was being angry at the wrong person.

674
00:47:42,315 --> 00:47:44,016
What were you thinking while watching me do so?

675
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:48,525
I never once thought I wasn't partly to blame.

676
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,695
It happened while I was gone,

677
00:47:52,056 --> 00:47:53,965
and it's true that I didn't take responsibility until the end.

678
00:47:54,795 --> 00:47:56,826
You weren't being angry at the wrong person.

679
00:47:57,096 --> 00:47:58,395
You found the right person.

680
00:48:08,346 --> 00:48:09,406
Hey, Jang Ho Woo.

681
00:48:11,516 --> 00:48:12,715
Do you drink?

682
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:32,596
Is this your first time drinking wine?

683
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:35,505
It's nice.

684
00:48:48,545 --> 00:48:49,585
Gosh.

685
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:57,326
You seem drunk.

686
00:48:58,426 --> 00:48:59,556
I'm not drunk.

687
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:01,826
Gosh. But it's...

688
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:03,835
kind of interesting.

689
00:49:04,936 --> 00:49:07,036
I always drink alone at home.

690
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:08,866
Why are you alone?

691
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:12,005
I think you're a nine,

692
00:49:13,306 --> 00:49:15,875
no, almost a nine and a half.

693
00:49:17,545 --> 00:49:20,346
Hey, Jang Ho Woo. You've really grown up.

694
00:49:21,186 --> 00:49:22,815
Also, what makes you think...

695
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:25,855
I'm a nine and a half?

696
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:29,726
I have a good job, a nice body,

697
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:32,096
and it's kind of embarrassing to say this myself,

698
00:49:33,156 --> 00:49:34,625
but also a handsome face.

699
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:38,366
You should...

700
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:44,235
wipe that handsome mouth of yours.

701
00:49:44,436 --> 00:49:47,575
This arrogant punk. You should wipe it for me.

702
00:49:47,576 --> 00:49:51,545
Is it okay to just throw me a tissue? I'm your senior.

703
00:49:55,715 --> 00:49:57,556
No matter how nicely I walk,

704
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,016
I get mud splashed on me.

705
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:04,656
Did a car pass by you while you were walking?

706
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:09,266
That's how my life always was.

707
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,636
Even after running until I'm out of breath,

708
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,766
I'm still standing on top of an endless mud field.

709
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:22,076
People like you don't know.

710
00:50:23,505 --> 00:50:26,415
I guess you might have seen it on TV.

711
00:51:41,426 --> 00:51:44,656
The Federal Reserve raises key interest rates on Wednesday.

712
00:51:44,855 --> 00:51:47,895
From the original rate of 0 percent to 0.15 percent...

713
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:51,596
to a new range of 0.4 percent to 0.15 percent.

714
00:51:52,096 --> 00:51:53,936
The move was widely expected.

715
00:51:54,105 --> 00:51:56,834
However, the slow increase in the interest rate...

716
00:51:56,835 --> 00:52:00,375
will affect millions of investors, home buyers, and savers.

717
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:08,616
This is the original report I wrote.

718
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,185
(Workout Going Concern, by Advisory Division 3 Han Seung Jo)

719
00:52:15,186 --> 00:52:16,286
Before,

720
00:52:16,656 --> 00:52:18,795
I said your fury had no power.

721
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:21,096
I was actually saying that to myself.

722
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:24,065
My father said that to me,

723
00:52:24,795 --> 00:52:26,096
and I couldn't deny it.

724
00:52:27,766 --> 00:52:31,105
Right then, I saw you, and you looked just like me.

725
00:52:32,076 --> 00:52:35,005
You were just being angry without knowing what to do.

726
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,246
You think being old makes you a grown-up?

727
00:52:38,346 --> 00:52:41,045
You make money by stabbing others in the back...

728
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:42,746
and call that success.

729
00:52:43,686 --> 00:52:44,786
You're scum.

730
00:52:45,616 --> 00:52:47,226
Why do you care so much about money?

731
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:51,156
Then I coincidentally saw you again at the new hire interviews.

732
00:52:51,326 --> 00:52:52,496
Yes. This way, please.

733
00:52:58,735 --> 00:53:01,406
(Job application form)

734
00:53:01,505 --> 00:53:03,636
(Job application form, Name, Jang Ho Woo)

735
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:09,645
(Jungwoon High School, Dropped out, Received GED)

736
00:53:16,315 --> 00:53:18,556
Tell them it was a personal hire by Senior Manager Han Seung Jo.

737
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:23,855
Seeing you again after you became an accountant...

738
00:53:24,956 --> 00:53:26,456
made me feel so pathetic.

739
00:53:27,295 --> 00:53:28,624
I wasn't brave enough...

740
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,266
to give up Taeil or bring my father down.

741
00:53:32,665 --> 00:53:35,065
I felt a bit indecisive.

742
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:36,565
So why were you...

743
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:39,875
so interested in me during this whole time?

744
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:43,045
I wasn't interested.

745
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,275
Let's say I was being careful.

746
00:53:46,246 --> 00:53:49,415
We may have different objectives, but we have the same goal.

747
00:53:50,016 --> 00:53:52,715
Different objectives but the same goal?

748
00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:54,656
You and I...

749
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:57,456
may have different starts, but we want the same result.

750
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:00,965
We want to make VP Han Je Kyun,

751
00:54:01,926 --> 00:54:04,335
Sim Hyung Woo, and those protected by them,

752
00:54:04,565 --> 00:54:07,505
pay for their wrongdoings.

753
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:09,035
Something like that.

754
00:54:09,036 --> 00:54:11,835
But still. VP Han Je Kyun is your father.

755
00:54:12,036 --> 00:54:13,406
My father...

756
00:54:13,976 --> 00:54:15,945
has taken more from me than he has given me.

757
00:54:17,176 --> 00:54:20,076
Don't trust anyone. Only trust deals.

758
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:22,215
This is a type of deal too.

759
00:54:22,545 --> 00:54:24,456
It's not about trusting each other.

760
00:54:24,616 --> 00:54:27,215
This is a strategic alliance to achieve our own goals.

761
00:54:29,826 --> 00:54:32,326
Are you saying we should sign an MOU or something?

762
00:54:33,096 --> 00:54:34,326
An MOU sounds nice.

763
00:54:37,165 --> 00:54:38,496
Let me ask you one thing.

764
00:54:39,665 --> 00:54:41,604
What will you gain from figuring out...

765
00:54:41,605 --> 00:54:43,105
the story behind Haebit Construction's liquidation?

766
00:54:43,335 --> 00:54:45,335
Are you going to report it to the world?

767
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:47,906
What use is that?

768
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:51,246
Everyone knows this is how the world is.

769
00:54:51,775 --> 00:54:52,775
Then what for?

770
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:55,786
I made a promise...

771
00:54:56,645 --> 00:54:57,915
to pay them back.

772
00:54:58,255 --> 00:54:59,255
Pay them back?

773
00:55:02,025 --> 00:55:04,525
Are you saying you're planning to bring down this company?

774
00:55:05,755 --> 00:55:07,156
That's just the principal.

775
00:55:07,226 --> 00:55:08,525
I need to get interests too.

776
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:12,036
I'm still thinking every day...

777
00:55:12,366 --> 00:55:13,996
on what the interest rate will be.

778
00:55:17,436 --> 00:55:18,476
So...

779
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:20,375
what should we do now?

780
00:55:21,145 --> 00:55:22,346
We need to stop...

781
00:55:23,545 --> 00:55:25,375
the same thing from happening again.

782
00:55:29,016 --> 00:55:30,116
(Plan to develop patented nozzle for 3D printing construction)

783
00:55:49,136 --> 00:55:51,036
What did you just say? Haebit Construction?

784
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,635
Are you saying...

785
00:55:52,636 --> 00:55:54,806
Director Sim switched out your report?

786
00:56:06,215 --> 00:56:07,456
Look into Jang Ho Woo.

787
00:56:08,485 --> 00:56:10,755
Look into his background, family, friends, and everything else.

788
00:56:12,096 --> 00:56:14,165
Especially his relationship with Haebit Construction.

789
00:56:17,695 --> 00:56:20,965
(Extremely delicious restaurant, Takeout, Delivery)

790
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:31,414
They sent in accountants and spent money to save Soma Tech.

791
00:56:31,415 --> 00:56:33,976
Why are they trying to bring down Soma Tech now?

792
00:56:34,715 --> 00:56:36,686
With my logic, I really can't understand.

793
00:56:37,415 --> 00:56:38,786
The premise is wrong.

794
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:43,855
Let's say the workout saves Soma Tech.

795
00:56:43,926 --> 00:56:45,055
Who would benefit?

796
00:56:45,056 --> 00:56:47,194
Of course it'd be Soma Tech...

797
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,625
It's Jisan Bank.

798
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,694
The fact that Soma Tech is worth saving...

799
00:56:51,695 --> 00:56:53,064
means someone who wants Soma Tech...

800
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:55,936
may appear someday as long as Soma Tech is kept alive.

801
00:56:56,165 --> 00:56:57,675
If things work out,

802
00:56:57,676 --> 00:56:59,576
they could sell it to Jisan Bank.

803
00:57:00,505 --> 00:57:03,544
Then they could have just sold it when Soma Tech first fell...

804
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,846
into Jisan Bank's hands.

805
00:57:07,076 --> 00:57:08,214
Between...

806
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:09,616
fish to be used for spicy fish stew...

807
00:57:10,085 --> 00:57:11,215
and a live fish,

808
00:57:11,415 --> 00:57:13,116
which do you think can be sold for a higher price?

809
00:57:16,656 --> 00:57:18,955
Just because a fish is swimming there,

810
00:57:18,956 --> 00:57:20,996
you can't think that place is the ocean.

811
00:57:21,065 --> 00:57:22,665
To someone,

812
00:57:22,996 --> 00:57:25,234
that place could become a raw fish restaurant aquarium,

813
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:27,235
where they can grab fish whenever they want to eat some.

814
00:58:05,036 --> 00:58:07,976
They were so close that they were mistaken as real father and son.

815
00:58:08,476 --> 00:58:10,245
Jang Ho Woo was the one who witnessed...

816
00:58:10,246 --> 00:58:12,516
Mr. Jang's death and first called the police.

817
00:58:13,076 --> 00:58:14,415
Then he became an accountant...

818
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:17,144
and entered Taeil Accounting,

819
00:58:17,145 --> 00:58:18,855
the firm that decided on Haebit Construction's liquidation.

820
00:58:22,956 --> 00:58:24,025
Good work.

821
00:58:48,545 --> 00:58:49,645
You punk.

822
00:58:49,715 --> 00:58:51,415
With what intentions did you crawl in here?

823
00:58:51,956 --> 00:58:53,255
What are you trying to do?

824
00:58:55,686 --> 00:58:56,826
Why?

825
00:58:57,656 --> 00:59:00,355
Are you finally feeling guilty about switching out the report?

826
00:59:01,426 --> 00:59:02,826
Are you scared I'm going to get revenge?

827
00:59:05,895 --> 00:59:07,605
Why would I be scared of you?

828
00:59:08,536 --> 00:59:10,206
More importantly, I did nothing wrong.

829
00:59:13,206 --> 00:59:14,346
Listen carefully.

830
00:59:14,545 --> 00:59:16,144
There were no errors...

831
00:59:16,145 --> 00:59:17,576
in the Haebit Construction report I wrote.

832
00:59:18,045 --> 00:59:20,045
As an accountant, it was completely reasonable...

833
00:59:20,215 --> 00:59:22,715
to decide on the liquidation in that situation.

834
00:59:23,485 --> 00:59:25,156
There's nothing for me to feel bad about.

835
00:59:26,415 --> 00:59:28,255
So don't test me with your little tricks.

836
00:59:29,286 --> 00:59:30,786
I won't give you a pass for being cute,

837
00:59:31,326 --> 00:59:32,695
unlike Han Seung Jo.

838
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:37,665
Isn't the way you're acting now...

839
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:42,036
proof that your conscience isn't clear?

840
00:59:45,306 --> 00:59:46,874
If you really did nothing wrong,

841
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,875
who I am and what I'll do from now...

842
00:59:50,945 --> 00:59:52,545
shouldn't matter to you at all.

843
00:59:57,815 --> 00:59:59,815
Do you think you'll be able to do everything you plan?

844
01:00:01,186 --> 01:00:03,326
Do you think everything will work out in the end...

845
01:00:04,456 --> 01:00:06,295
with a bit of trial and error?

846
01:00:07,556 --> 01:00:08,826
Don't be delusional.

847
01:00:09,266 --> 01:00:10,895
You're not like Han Seung Jo either.

848
01:00:11,436 --> 01:00:13,834
Only guys like Han Seung Jo, with something to fall back on,

849
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:15,835
can call failures experiences.

850
01:00:16,136 --> 01:00:18,335
A guy with nothing, like you,

851
01:00:18,775 --> 01:00:21,076
can be destroyed with one failure.

852
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:24,045
Do you think people live quietly because they're fools?

853
01:00:24,645 --> 01:00:25,915
Or because they're not brave enough?

854
01:00:28,016 --> 01:00:29,215
Not at all.

855
01:00:29,985 --> 01:00:31,456
It's because they don't get second chances.

856
01:00:33,415 --> 01:00:34,755
If you've understood what I'm saying,

857
01:00:34,886 --> 01:00:37,056
just live quietly and repay your grandparents,

858
01:00:37,656 --> 01:00:40,656
who took you in and raised you even though you weren't related.

859
01:00:42,926 --> 01:00:44,195
Stop getting in the way.

860
01:00:58,116 --> 01:01:00,315
Call HK Private Equity immediately.

861
01:01:38,755 --> 01:01:40,016
Don't forget...

862
01:01:40,786 --> 01:01:42,826
that the bad things happening to you...

863
01:01:43,355 --> 01:01:45,926
aren't anyone's fault no matter what they are.

864
01:01:47,226 --> 01:01:49,926
It's hard to survive in this place...

865
01:01:50,266 --> 01:01:52,596
if you don't protect your self-esteem on your own.

866
01:01:54,565 --> 01:01:56,536
Everything is the same for me even after I get off of work.

867
01:01:57,366 --> 01:01:59,375
At work, it's hard to survive.

868
01:01:59,576 --> 01:02:01,976
At home, it's hard to even live.

869
01:02:05,945 --> 01:02:07,215
So unless you messed up at work...

870
01:02:07,346 --> 01:02:09,386
because you were crazy about some girl,

871
01:02:09,686 --> 01:02:11,755
just drink this and shake it off.

872
01:02:27,565 --> 01:02:30,835
Someone from HK Private Equity will be joining the meeting today?

873
01:02:31,235 --> 01:02:32,875
Yes, Joyce Jang will be joining.

874
01:02:33,136 --> 01:02:35,044
I arranged for that because I thought...

875
01:02:35,045 --> 01:02:38,016
we could wrap things up faster with everyone in one place.

876
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:40,415
There's no need to have two meetings.

877
01:02:41,315 --> 01:02:42,584
Isn't Joyce Jang the woman who is known for being ruthless...

878
01:02:42,585 --> 01:02:46,656
on days she wears her sword-shaped brooch?

879
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:48,155
That is her,

880
01:02:48,156 --> 01:02:50,354
but I'm sure it's just an exaggerated rumour...

881
01:02:50,355 --> 01:02:52,395
that stems from her exceptionally fast promotion.

882
01:02:53,326 --> 01:02:56,326
What do you think the meaning of that sword-shaped brooch is?

883
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,036
Who do you think first spread that rumour?

884
01:03:02,266 --> 01:03:03,665
She must have done so herself.

885
01:03:04,605 --> 01:03:06,774
That way, she can observe...

886
01:03:06,775 --> 01:03:08,605
how the other party behaves...

887
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:12,375
when they see her wearing the sword-shaped brooch.

888
01:03:15,315 --> 01:03:18,656
She'll be a tough person for you to go up against.

889
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,726
Are you ready, Jang Ho Woo?

890
01:03:31,195 --> 01:03:32,436
I've been ready since I was born.

891
01:04:58,656 --> 01:04:59,915
Ji Soo.

892
01:05:07,456 --> 01:05:09,065
I'm Joyce...

893
01:05:09,295 --> 01:05:10,525
from HK Private Equity.

894
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:52,806
(Numbers)

895
01:05:52,875 --> 01:05:54,944
You could've called me and let me know you were fine.

896
01:05:54,945 --> 01:05:57,044
You didn't already forget what you did...

897
01:05:57,045 --> 01:05:58,345
to my dad and his company, right?

898
01:05:58,346 --> 01:06:01,175
I believe forcing Soma Tech, a company with a high possibility...

899
01:06:01,176 --> 01:06:02,714
of surviving on its own, into a workout is wrong.

900
01:06:02,715 --> 01:06:04,544
Are you wanting compliments and not money?

901
01:06:04,545 --> 01:06:06,555
If I had known she was so bold,

902
01:06:06,556 --> 01:06:09,325
she would've been in a much better state by now.

903
01:06:09,326 --> 01:06:10,524
Don't mess with her.

904
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:11,995
If there's something you want,

905
01:06:11,996 --> 01:06:13,055
you need to change too.

906
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:16,225
You could force Soma Tech into a workout with your own hands.

907
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:17,365
If you were going to be like this,

908
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:18,435
you shouldn't have acted like you were all that.

909
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:20,635
Dealing a company a strong blow is not even an issue.

910
01:06:20,636 --> 01:06:22,265
Watch how I open a door...

911
01:06:22,266 --> 01:06:23,765
that you can't open.

912
01:06:23,766 --> 01:06:24,936
Mr. Jang!

913
01:06:25,706 --> 01:06:26,875
Mr. Jang!
