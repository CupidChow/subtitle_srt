1
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:45,160


2
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,837
Noona Ji Soo...

3
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:09,267
I'm Joyce from HK (Hong Kong) Private Equity Fund.

4
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:21,127
We'll start the meeting.

5
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:42,817
   

6
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:44,947
As we disclosed in the report... 
    

7
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:47,930
the future demand for 3D-printed buildings (built by robot arm using blueprint)

8
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,070
is expected to be great because of their cost and convenience.

9
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,787
Even if only 10% of new homes are built with this technology per year,

10
00:01:56,787 --> 00:02:02,137
Soma Tech will have more than enough ability to pay back its loans to Jisan Bank.

11
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:06,397
Thus, I don't think it's valid to assist in reviving Soma Tech

12
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:09,507
when it could most likely stand on its own.

13
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:11,877
- Accountant Jang Ho Woo. 
 - Yes.

14
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:15,847
An accounting firm's job isn't to judge right from wrong.

15
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:20,397
We only discuss whether it's beneficial to our client or not.

16
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:21,947
According to this report,

17
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:25,277
additional buy-in of capital is needed at each manufacturing stage.

18
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:27,057
In short, they're just saying

19
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:31,237
they'll make and sell more products if they can borrow more money.

20
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:33,117
Our client, Jisan Bank,

21
00:02:33,117 --> 00:02:36,577
has no interest in investing more money into Soma Tech.

22
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:40,207
Did you forget we're sitting here since they couldn't even repay...

23
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:42,107
what they were lent so far?

24
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,607
Is that all?

25
00:02:48,217 --> 00:02:49,917
Thank you for your report.

26
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,927
There's a potential buyer...

27
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:57,007
but your report has no specific details on the price and quantity of goods to be sold.

28
00:02:57,007 --> 00:03:02,797
If it's a crime to implicitly mass produce models where you try to run on someone else's money...

29
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:05,137
then this is almost the same as murder.

30
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:10,447
The cost varies according to the output.

31
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:13,167
But there's no reasonable theory about that.

32
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:17,127
Are you asking to be saved without even a plan about the cash flow...

33
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:22,327
without even telling us how much cash will be used for this business to work?

34
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,017
Even if Soma Tech's goods get sold out...

35
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:29,037
saying you'll take care of cash flow with the commission,

36
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:35,627
what if the other party says they'll pay with a check, not cash?

37
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,307
Will you ask the bank for help again?

38
00:03:43,377 --> 00:03:46,207
Asking to be saved is your habit.

39
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,177
Whether to save or kill...

40
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:54,017
although there's no way for a blind racehorse, who is most sightless,

41
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:56,397
to understand thoughts of the deep pocket (banker),

42
00:03:56,397 --> 00:04:00,057
who is making bets based on the overall race.

43
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:04,737
Isn't it common sense to at least present a clear reason...

44
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:10,357
why we should bother to help Soma Tech, with its naïve owner...

45
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:13,027
who cares only about technology, nothing else,

46
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:20,297
instead of choosing from many other candidates?

47
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,697
Groundbreaking technology?

48
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:30,417
Are you looking for a compliment...

49
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,257
instead of money?

50
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:44,367
 Please help Haebit Construction just once. I beg of you. 

51
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,117
 I know you hate me... 

52
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,827
 but please hear my plea. 

53
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:52,267
 Tell your father this. 

54
00:04:52,897 --> 00:04:56,077
 That decision was appropriate. 

55
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:02,117
 V.P. Han... 

56
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:04,057
 V.P. Han... 

57
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:06,907
 V.P. Han Je Gyun! 

58
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:19,087
It seems HK Private Equity Fund can acquire Soma Tech without much problem.

59
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,417
We'll take it since we bit into it.

60
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:24,257
Don't you agree, V.P. Han?

61
00:05:27,867 --> 00:05:29,667
Noona Ji Soo...

62
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,357
"Ji Soo"?

63
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:43,407
What do you think you're doing?

64
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:45,537
Let go of me.

65
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,667
I can understand why you wouldn't want to see me, but...

66
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:18,187
you could have called at least once to say you were okay.

67
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:19,837
Do you know how worried I was?

68
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,627
I don't need your worries anymore.

69
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:28,497
Did you already forget what you did to my dad and the company?

70
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:33,897
- Ji Soo, back then– 
 - The Jang Ji Soo from back then is gone,

71
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:36,077
though you likely know that already.

72
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:01,817
- Noona... 
 - Why are you here?

73
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:05,337
What happened? Why were you hiding all this time?

74
00:07:08,577 --> 00:07:11,657
Later. I have nothing to say right now.

75
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:28,467
Is HK Private Equity Fund's Joyce the daughter of CEO Jang In Ho of Haebit Construction?

76
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:32,927
She probably came to kill and snatch Soma Tech

77
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,977
with her own hands since it resembles

78
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:40,767
the Haebit Construction case.

79
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:46,097
If Joyce finds out that I swapped out Haebit Construction's report,

80
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:47,757
what will happen?

81
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:52,237
You're worried about yourself right now...

82
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:56,507
when the entire plan might fail?

83
00:08:07,547 --> 00:08:09,597
Noona Ji Soo...

84
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:12,627
always used to come to my grandma's restaurant...

85
00:08:12,627 --> 00:08:15,687
with Ahjussi, CEO Jang.

86
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:20,477
To me, CEO Jang was more or less my father.

87
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:27,087
Though I had no lineage, I still had a big family.

88
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:34,307
She disappeared without a trace and reappears like this?

89
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:37,127
When did you realize she and I know each other?

90
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:40,437
I saw the picture on the day we drank wine.

91
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:43,247
You're not...

92
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:46,457
going to leave Noona like that, right?

93
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,027
 Ji Soo, one second, please. 

94
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:21,677
Just ignore it.

95
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,487
 Ji Soo, please open the door for a second. 

96
00:09:31,127 --> 00:09:35,087
I didn't think you'd be standing outside the door, at least.

97
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:38,527
What are you here for?

98
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:43,967
- She changed a lot. 
 - Don't mess with her.

99
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,897
I really won't hold back this time.

100
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:51,367
Watch how I open the door you can't seem to open.

101
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,487
V.P. Han Je Gyun is here.

102
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:09,607
You should also change

103
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,987
if there's something you want.

104
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,757
It's a piece of advice as your father.

105
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:28,757
She was nowhere to be found when we looked so hard.

106
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:31,157
So why did she appear...

107
00:10:31,157 --> 00:10:33,287
like that and at this point?

108
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,847
 What other reason could I possibly have? 

109
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:39,760
Of course, I came to work.

110
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,467
If you're doing this due to what happened with CEO Jang of Haebit Construction and...

111
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:46,667
what happened between Accountant Han and me,

112
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm disappointed.

113
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:52,187
Just like what you did to me before...

114
00:10:52,187 --> 00:10:55,077
I'm only here for business as well.

115
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:57,697
For you to come from none other than

116
00:10:58,227 --> 00:11:01,267
HK Private Equity Fund...

117
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:06,327
I didn't know you had a knack for surprising others.

118
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:13,137
I heard you majored in English.

119
00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:19,397
It's not people who work in private equity funds, it's the money.

120
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:26,007
A mere fly is getting on my nerves now.

121
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:36,270
You must be busy.

122
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,587
Thank you for seeing me.

123
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:46,947
Please treat me the same way you treat other clients.

124
00:11:49,987 --> 00:11:51,737
Certainly.

125
00:11:53,717 --> 00:11:57,517
Politely and respectfully.

126
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:11,777
Well, it's nothing hard.

127
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,977
 Isn't it common sense to at least present a clear reason... 

128
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:43,647
 why we should bother to help Soma Tech, with its naïve owner... 

129
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,267
 who cares only about technology, nothing else. 

130
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:52,347
 Groundbreaking technology? Asking to be saved is your habit. 

131
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:24,147
Hey, if you tormented us this long, come on and spill it!

132
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:27,417
- Did you get fired? 
 - Hey, be honest with us.

133
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,497
Did you beat someone up?

134
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:31,067
Just speak!

135
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:35,417
- Gosh, isn't that expression such an eyesore? 
 - Totally.

136
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,337
If you guys...

137
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:42,700
happen to meet Noona Ji Soo,

138
00:13:43,337 --> 00:13:45,867
what will you say?

139
00:13:46,787 --> 00:13:48,387
Noona...

140
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:51,617
you became prettier.

141
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:56,227
I'll say... Grandma's food got a little more tasty.

142
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:57,977
Gosh, this guy is so frustrating.

143
00:13:57,977 --> 00:14:01,257
I wanted to tell her I had become an accountant...

144
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:07,317
and brag about working at a gigantic accounting firm.

145
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:12,947
And I had a job...

146
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:17,147
I was supposed to do with Noona.

147
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,107
Do it.

148
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:22,610
You can just do it. What's the matter? Just do it.

149
00:14:23,657 --> 00:14:25,407
You fool.

150
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,567
It's okay.

151
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:30,867
All will get better.

152
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:35,327
Do you have to do everything you want to do?

153
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:38,247
Hey...

154
00:14:39,957 --> 00:14:42,887
Seriously...

155
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:02,217
 Even people in our accounting firm's Hong Kong branch know of Joyce Jang. 

156
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,567
 She started by running delivery errands... 

157
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:08,527
 and rose to Level C (Chief) in just a few years. 

158
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:16,307
 Is there really any need for all of this? 

159
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:44,387
 It... it's Ricardo. 

160
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:48,787
 Please. Those are the only three left in this world. 

161
00:16:03,387 --> 00:16:05,517
 What the heck are you doing? 

162
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,567
 There is only one now. 

163
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,257
 And I can ask whatever I want. 

164
00:16:10,257 --> 00:16:14,547
 How hell-bent must she have lived, seeing how she accomplished the impossible? 

165
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:17,847
 By the way, is something wrong at the Seoul HQ? 

166
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:21,437
 People are asking about Joyce a lot more than usual today. 

167
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,107
What?

168
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:36,307
There. I think that's it.

169
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:53,297
Please stop messing with Ji Soo.

170
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:58,340
Had I known she'd be that magnanimous back then,

171
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:03,307
she'd be much better off now.

172
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:07,197
To me, that sounds like you're saying Ji Soo is unfit

173
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:10,037
to be my wife, but Joyce qualifies.

174
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:15,187
If a person changed...

175
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:19,727
you should treat them that much differently.

176
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:45,197
I kept looking for you, not knowing you were here.

177
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:48,957
- You looked for me? 
 - Yes, I have a question.

178
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:51,767
You were looking for a mentor, not me.

179
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,630
What is your question?

180
00:17:54,637 --> 00:17:57,777
Why is HK Private Equity Fund trying to send Soma Tech

181
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,127
into the bankruptcy court instead of doing M and A?

182
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:05,187
It's inconvenient and sure to take longer for them to acquire Soma Tech.

183
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:07,247
You don't know what you're talking about.

184
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:11,347
Biting into a hot potato will burn your mouth.

185
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:13,297
What's an M and A?

186
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:16,957
It means you will take on all liabilities your acquired company had.

187
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:20,447
If a debtor who wasn't even on the books appeared out of nowhere

188
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:23,587
and demands their money back from that company,

189
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:26,087
things become real problematic.

190
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:28,187
Should litigation ensue, it's an even bigger problem.

191
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,980
Moreover, if they have unpaid taxes...

192
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:35,487
They'll get the fury for taking someone else's company...

193
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:37,987
but they can't break even.

194
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:39,597
However...

195
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:42,487
if this company goes in bankruptcy court just once...

196
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,467
All traffic (trade) gets organized at once.

197
00:18:46,147 --> 00:18:47,367
Why does the bankruptcy court matter?

198
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:51,037
Because they sincerely want this company to get back up.

199
00:18:51,037 --> 00:18:53,987
They'll reset all of the company's mistakes

200
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:58,217
so the company can give it one last try.

201
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:01,950
But someone is using such kindness

202
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,997
like an over-the-counter service, right?

203
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:07,077
Just like using a laundromat.

204
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:11,847
   

205
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:19,407
   

206
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:28,277
 That's why some people even strategically want to send a company into bankruptcy court. 

207
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:30,647
 Since all companies have a loan or two... 

208
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:35,397
 they just need to lobby a bank to make the company shake. 

209
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:39,357
 They wait in silence and devour the company... 

210
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:42,917
the moment it falls down.

211
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:55,357
Yes, CEO.

212
00:19:55,357 --> 00:19:58,327
 Accountant Jang, there's trouble! 

213
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,077
They said prepping the "ingredients" is done.

214
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:22,097
We just need to "cook" now so let's ease our belts and drink.

215
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,077
Thank you, Hyungnim.

216
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:30,347
Just like you said, Hyung Woo, things will be troublesome if Joyce changes her mind and decides otherwise.

217
00:20:30,347 --> 00:20:36,327
If we end up needing another client, it's reassuring to have the groundwork done.

218
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,347
- Did you hear how Jisan Bank put a hold on Soma Tech's negative checking account? 
 - Really?

219
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,097
He said money for payroll stopped there.

220
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:54,477
If he fails to pay his employees, they qualify for bankruptcy, right?

221
00:20:54,477 --> 00:20:59,477
Doesn't that mean Soma Tech may get sold elsewhere, even if Noona Ji Soo changes her mind?

222
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,270
Will we keep watching just like this?

223
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:09,547
The only way to save Soma Tech right now is an additional source of capital.

224
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:11,887
But where will we get that much money?

225
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:16,660
The market probably heard that Jisan Bank cut ties with Soma Tech already.

226
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,997
You need to accept what you must.

227
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:21,377
Our solution might not be the answer.

228
00:21:21,377 --> 00:21:23,037
The numbers are saying so.

229
00:21:23,037 --> 00:21:25,437
Those numbers, every time.

230
00:21:25,437 --> 00:21:28,827
Do you still think the numbers are the truth and represent everything?

231
00:21:28,827 --> 00:21:31,747
Why did you make them get advance deposits then?

232
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:35,457
We need to do all we can, even if we may lose.

233
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:41,407
I can just tell without having to physically see how you gave up on Haebit Construction.

234
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:45,687
- What did you say? 
 - If you were going to do this, you shouldn't have acted arrogant.

235
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,507
It's not the answer?

236
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:57,107
You need to get rid of a problem, not adapt to it!

237
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,520
- Jang Ho Woo... 
 - I can't believe I expected anything.

238
00:22:01,227 --> 00:22:03,447
I'm the crazy one.

239
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,227
CEO... CEO, please calm down.

240
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,697
Just hear me out, okay?

241
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:36,107
I'm going to burn down Jisan Bank and also kill myself in there!

242
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:39,697
Get out of my way!

243
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,777
They say life hits you when things are about to improve.

244
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:52,537
Why don't you tell me since you're smart, Accountant Jang?

245
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,047
Was I wrong?

246
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:58,897
Was it my mistake?

247
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,057
I can understand your unease due to Joyce Jang,

248
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:20,067
but your worries won't happen.

249
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,507
So you can rest assured.

250
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:38,177
 HK Private Equity left Joyce in charge of the Soma Tech purchase because she's in Korea. 

251
00:23:38,177 --> 00:23:41,997
 Taeil Accounting Firm is in luck because Joyce happens to be our top manager. 

252
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:45,060
What we're expecting and hoping for with this purchase

253
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,590
is a win-win result for both our firms.

254
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:53,117
 If she had an ulterior motive, she would have taken action already. 

255
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:55,717
Would she have stayed still like this?

256
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,627
For now, we should also linger and watch.

257
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:12,977
 Taeil Accounting Firm will think that you were assigned to their account through pure coincidence 

258
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:15,507
 while handling restructuring. 

259
00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:18,547
It's not a lie, just in a different sequence.

260
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:21,217
Still, thank you.

261
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:27,207
 Joyce, we're not interested in anything else as long as you get good results for us. 

262
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:28,857
 But hurry back. 

263
00:24:28,857 --> 00:24:31,417
 Don't forget you have your man here waiting. 

264
00:24:31,417 --> 00:24:32,857
 All right? 

265
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,797
Okay then.

266
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,027
I said I've nothing to tell you.

267
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,477
I have something to give you, Noona.

268
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,357
Do you know why tigers die at hunters' hands?

269
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,777
It's because of their skin.

270
00:25:01,777 --> 00:25:03,547
Hurry and give me what you need to and leave.

271
00:25:03,547 --> 00:25:06,827
You're still as impatient as ever, Jang Ji Soo.

272
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:11,437
I pondered why HK Private Equity Fund would want Soma Tech.

273
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:14,467
What they really wanted was...

274
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:17,500
Soma Tech's technology, not Soma Tech itself.

275
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:24,137
Just like how a hunter wants a tiger's skin, not the tiger's life.

276
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:27,967
   

277
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,267
This nozzle can let you finish a building's exterior walls in just a few hours.

278
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:39,777
If I just press this enter key, it'll get distributed globally right away as an open source...

279
00:25:39,777 --> 00:25:41,927
for free.

280
00:25:41,927 --> 00:25:43,847
What's the meaning of this?

281
00:25:43,847 --> 00:25:45,737
Are you saying you'll self-destruct or something?

282
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:50,567
The tiger says it'll take off its skin voluntarily since it wants to live.

283
00:25:51,707 --> 00:25:57,617
There's no reason to go after Soma Tech if it doesn't have its patented technology.

284
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,427
If you want the technology, change your mind.

285
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:07,867
Instead of forcing takeover by sending it to bankruptcy court, just be an investor.

286
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,817
And you're able to do that, Noona.

287
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,087
- I don't want to. 
 - What?

288
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:26,650
If you distribute this blueprint for free on the internet,

289
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:32,440
Soma Tech will become an unnecessary shell, as you said.

290
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,177
- Why then? 
 - It's troublesome to create precedents.

291
00:26:37,177 --> 00:26:41,397
If rumors spread about Soma Tech surviving by threatening to blow itself up,

292
00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:43,877
everyone will use that tactic, right?

293
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:50,897
Wouldn't it be easier to get rid of Soma Tech's idea than to take care of all that ruckus?

294
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,907
Why are you going this far?

295
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:58,557
What made you come out of nowhere?

296
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,607
Is it due to guilt?

297
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:06,737
Is it because your father died due to your lover?

298
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,517
"Guilt"?

299
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:13,917
Someone else should be feeling it, not me.

300
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:16,447
Ahjussi didn't die because of your fault.

301
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:18,247
It's not Accountant Han Seung Jo's fault, either.

302
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:21,927
Are you siding with Han Seung Jo now you're an accountant, too?

303
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,977
I'm not siding with him.

304
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,097
It's a fact.

305
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,197
   

306
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:21,027
Oh, yes. Have you reviewed the document I sent you?

307
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,707
Oh, that part is...

308
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:28,137
 I can provide an additional explanation on that matter. 

309
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,217
 Yes. 

310
00:28:40,587 --> 00:28:42,817
   

311
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:57,477
CEO!

312
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,877
CEO, are you here?

313
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,537
CEO!

314
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,467
CEO!

315
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,097
 Ahjussi! 

316
00:29:27,097 --> 00:29:28,867
 Ahjussi! 

317
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,907
I-Is anyone there?

318
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:33,147
Is no one here?

319
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,607
Ahjussi... Ah-Ahjussi, please!

320
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:40,667
Someone please help!

321
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,840
Ahjussi...

322
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,157
Ahjussi!

323
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:58,157
   

324
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:26,237
Did you see the actual report that Accountant Han Seung Jo wrote?

325
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:29,747
Don't expect things to change just because of a report.

326
00:30:29,747 --> 00:30:31,497
Nothing will happen.

327
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:36,347
Why won't things change? Your heart will change.

328
00:30:36,347 --> 00:30:39,507
If you think about it, Accountant Han Seung Jo is also a victim.

329
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:42,597
While Accountant Han Seung Jo's mother passed away,

330
00:30:42,597 --> 00:30:44,927
V.P. Han Je Gyun gave the order

331
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:50,797
to swap Haebit Construction's report without Accountant Han Seung Jo knowing.

332
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:56,847
Jisan Bank pretended not to know and stayed silent.

333
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:03,167
The Accountant Han Seung Jo I've seen since entering Taeil Accounting

334
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:05,547
seemed like you, too, Noona.

335
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,007
It doesn't matter.

336
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:13,657
It will all be over once Soma Tech is revived (dissolve then restore).

337
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:19,787
Soma Tech's CEO just overcame a major scare.

338
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:23,597
He would die if found too late.

339
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:28,107
I guess that CEO also revealed how weak he is.

340
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:31,627
Not only weak, but he is also irresponsible.

341
00:31:31,627 --> 00:31:34,697
No. You're wrong.

342
00:31:34,697 --> 00:31:37,617
It's not what you think.

343
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:42,027
His illness grew worse from overworking.

344
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:45,897
He didn't run away;

345
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:49,357
he stayed and fought to the end.

346
00:31:54,227 --> 00:31:56,637
It was likely the same for Ahjussi.

347
00:32:14,277 --> 00:32:16,307
You know quite the noona.

348
00:32:16,307 --> 00:32:19,817
To think you're related to Manager Joyce of HK Private Equity Fund.

349
00:32:19,817 --> 00:32:25,137
I acted all high and mighty to her, but I have no way to save Soma Tech.

350
00:32:25,137 --> 00:32:26,637
It sucks.

351
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:29,297
We are accountants, not situation-fixers.

352
00:32:29,297 --> 00:32:31,987
How could we find a solution every single time?

353
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:37,597
Can't anyone lend money with their technology as collateral,

354
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:40,917
like at a pawn shop for a watch?

355
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:46,457
Pawn shop...

356
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:53,477
Why didn't I think of that?

357
00:32:56,637 --> 00:32:59,027
Pawn shop... Pawn shop...

358
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:01,297
Why are you being like that? What's up?

359
00:33:02,477 --> 00:33:04,837
- I think I figured it out, thanks to you. 
 - What?

360
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:06,177
Me?

361
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,277
Thank you so much.

362
00:33:20,287 --> 00:33:24,657
   

363
00:33:28,737 --> 00:33:33,847
Once we file the revival application, Soma Tech will be over as well.

364
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,707
Here you are.

365
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,317
No.

366
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:42,227
It will be reborn as HK Private Equity Fund.

367
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,987
This is just the start.

368
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:46,927
Right.

369
00:33:46,927 --> 00:33:49,697
Is that how that works?

370
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:53,717
 While Accountant Han Seung Jo's mother passed away, 

371
00:33:53,717 --> 00:33:58,767
 V.P. Han Je Gyun gave the order to swap Haebit Construction's report. 

372
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:03,477
 Jisan Bank pretended not to know and stayed silent. 

373
00:34:13,477 --> 00:34:15,807
I told you not to call me.

374
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,707
What kind of nonsense is that?

375
00:34:20,617 --> 00:34:24,787
What do you mean, Soma Tech made a lump sum repayment?

376
00:34:25,427 --> 00:34:29,327
Where would a company facing bankruptcy get that much money to repay it?

377
00:34:35,757 --> 00:34:37,417
   

378
00:34:42,507 --> 00:34:44,657
I'm from Taeil Accounting.

379
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:48,267
Someone already came by from Taeil Accounting.

380
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:51,537
- Pardon? 
 -  Aren't you here for Soma Tech's funds problem?

381
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:55,007
I am, but how did you know?

382
00:34:55,007 --> 00:35:00,077
That case was approved so that person took the money and related documents with him just now.

383
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:04,327
I mean, who would come here from Taeil Accounting aside from me?

384
00:35:14,317 --> 00:35:17,457
The debt that Soma Tech needs to repay Jisan Bank was

385
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:23,137
fully repaid at 3:40 p.m.

386
00:35:29,857 --> 00:35:32,067
   

387
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,497
   

388
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:46,680
Here.

389
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:49,367
This is the collateral agreement as well.

390
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,397
   

391
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,660
   

392
00:36:11,987 --> 00:36:13,597
What?

393
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:15,857
- How is this possible? 
 - That means

394
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:21,447
Jisan Bank has lost the right to revive Soma Tech,

395
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:27,037
and Taeil Accounting has lost the justification for selling Soma Tech.

396
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:32,037
V.P. Han Je Gyun.

397
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:35,377
Why don't you explain to me what's going on?

398
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:38,450
You're all accountants from the same Taeil Accounting.

399
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,870
So what is this?

400
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:45,997
How about you answer me, V.P. Han!

401
00:36:51,157 --> 00:36:53,777
No bank would have lent money to Soma Tech.

402
00:36:53,777 --> 00:36:57,877
Yes. I saw that you've worked really hard.

403
00:36:57,877 --> 00:37:01,477
How is it possible that not a single place would lend them money?

404
00:37:04,337 --> 00:37:07,007
Are you saying you got loan sharks involved?

405
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:10,517
We sold Soma Tech's patent.

406
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:19,917
 What do you mean, sell our patent? 

407
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:22,387
 I'm not saying to sell it permanently, but temporarily. 

408
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:27,610
 First get out of the financial crisis by paying off bank loans by selling the patent. 

409
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:33,727
 When you fall in the water, you need to let go of what's in your hand to float. 

410
00:37:33,727 --> 00:37:37,437
 You can buy the patent back when the company's situation improves. 

411
00:37:37,437 --> 00:37:39,947
 Until then, you can keep using Soma Tech's 

412
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:44,727
 patent technology by paying a small fee. 

413
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:49,607
 Although I may be somewhat naive, 

414
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:53,777
 I know nobody would do such a thing to benefit someone else. 

415
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:58,277
 There is. 

416
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:05,147
Have you ever seen anyone with funds do business

417
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:07,790
that is unprofitable to them?

418
00:38:08,757 --> 00:38:13,137
Even giving them first privilege to buy back the patent?

419
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:15,467
Who would make such a business agreement?

420
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:20,377
Since it's a national loss and a shame for Korean technology to be sold overseas

421
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:23,230
for fen (1 cent) on the yuan due to a scheme,

422
00:38:23,797 --> 00:38:26,867
the Korean Intellectual Property Office won't do nothing.

423
00:38:31,437 --> 00:38:33,527
"Korean Intellectual Property Office"?

424
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:36,157
Sale and lease back.

425
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:41,157
Usually, it refers to when one sells their real estate then pays to rent it.

426
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:46,907
But for Soma Tech, it's intellectual property and not land.

427
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,547
A master who knows only technology...

428
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:54,577
Did you say someone would shed tears of blood due to a naive owner?

429
00:38:54,577 --> 00:38:58,577
That won't happen to my clients, at the very least.

430
00:38:58,577 --> 00:39:01,277
Once is enough for such mistakes.

431
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,117
Ji Soo.

432
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:38,037
What happened in the past isn't erased just because you saved Soma Tech.

433
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:40,307
I know.

434
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,497
Let's just talk for a moment.

435
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:52,750
♫  Time flows only for me  ♫

436
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,400
I know that saying a few words like this

437
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:59,027
won't make me at ease for the rest of my life,

438
00:39:59,027 --> 00:40:04,487
but I hope this will ease your mind so please listen to me.

439
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:08,517
You endured the worst

440
00:40:08,517 --> 00:40:12,087
due to me, although you did nothing wrong.

441
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:15,347
Do you think this will make me feel any better?

442
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:17,177
I mean it.

443
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:22,817
I'm no longer interested in your sincerity.

444
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:25,487
All right.

445
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:30,747
Keep hating me like that. Please,

446
00:40:30,747 --> 00:40:32,587
hate me, not yourself.

447
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,490
♫  By my side every day  ♫

448
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,137
♫  Perhaps you're comforting me  ♫

449
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:45,367
You constantly lived piercing yourself

450
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:48,367
and not anyone else, with this.

451
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:51,917
- Why would you? 
 - I don't plan to drag this on for long.

452
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:54,057
I have someone waiting for me.

453
00:40:54,057 --> 00:40:58,727
♫  It's okay, Child  ♫

454
00:40:58,727 --> 00:41:03,967
♫  I will recognize you  ♫

455
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:08,547
They applied the real estate concept, "Sale and lease back," to intellectual property.

456
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:11,977
I wasn't able to think that far. I'm sorry.

457
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:14,807
What can I do?

458
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:17,397
My son is a capable guy.

459
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,677
Hello, V.P. Han Je Gyun.

460
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,947
   

461
00:41:24,947 --> 00:41:27,200
It's been a while.

462
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,757
I heard you were on medical leave,

463
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:34,747
but I couldn't visit you because I worried I might disturb your rest.

464
00:41:34,747 --> 00:41:37,607
I guess I was able to get back on my feet,

465
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:40,797
thanks to your consideration, V.P. Han.

466
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:42,417
But...

467
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,277
what brings you to the company?

468
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:48,867
I'm feeling much better now. Of course, I should return

469
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,837
to my original position.

470
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:57,267
I came by to scout before I came into work officially.

471
00:41:57,267 --> 00:42:00,477
But somehow, I don't see several of my people.

472
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,667
I heard Mr. Kang Hyun also suddenly resigned.

473
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,477
He's not the type to act so irresponsibly like that.

474
00:42:06,477 --> 00:42:08,427
By chance,

475
00:42:09,537 --> 00:42:12,117
do you know anything about it?

476
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,417
I don't know much...

477
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,077
Of course.

478
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:22,327
What would the deals department know about our audit department?

479
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:31,330
I will reestablish the order that was lost

480
00:42:32,097 --> 00:42:34,597
during my absence.

481
00:42:45,337 --> 00:42:48,957
Find out who V.P. Han's VIP clients are.

482
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:51,047
He cut off my "hand"

483
00:42:51,047 --> 00:42:54,847
so isn't it only right for me to respond by cutting off his "arm or leg"?

484
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,587
Yes, Ma'am.

485
00:43:10,887 --> 00:43:13,977
Isn't it one of the basic responsibilities of an accountant to organize

486
00:43:13,977 --> 00:43:18,917
and move relevant files to the storage room at the end of a case?

487
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:22,257
- Yes, that's right. 
 - So...

488
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:27,357
why am I the one doing this right now, not you, a new staff?

489
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:28,967
Okay.

490
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:30,857
I'll do it.

491
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:41,017
I heard you threatened Ji Soo to release the 3D technology for free.

492
00:43:41,017 --> 00:43:44,097
- Are you a thug? 
 - Gosh, a thug?

493
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:45,757
Aren't you speaking a bit too harshly?

494
00:43:45,757 --> 00:43:48,227
Who knew things would end up like this?

495
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,197
In any case, I'm glad we won.

496
00:43:51,197 --> 00:43:55,057
I found Noona, and Soma Tech doesn't need to go through a revival.

497
00:43:55,057 --> 00:43:57,347
- Don't get excited. 
 - Pardon?

498
00:43:57,347 --> 00:43:59,787
We may have overcome this hurdle now,

499
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:02,957
but later, you may end up selling Soma Tech by your own hand.

500
00:44:02,957 --> 00:44:05,347
Gosh, why curse it in such a way?

501
00:44:05,347 --> 00:44:07,617
Since that's the life of an accountant.

502
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:13,527
Why Soma Tech needed a financial workout in the first place was due to lax management.

503
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:18,637
Excessively borrowing funds for research without considering the company's financial situation started this mess.

504
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:23,307
But... there's no guarantee they won't do it again.

505
00:44:23,307 --> 00:44:25,767
Just as people don't change easily,

506
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:28,407
companies don't change easily, either.

507
00:44:29,427 --> 00:44:34,357
An accountant is not someone who saves people in need,

508
00:44:34,357 --> 00:44:39,297
but someone who makes people work properly where it should be profitable.

509
00:44:40,837 --> 00:44:46,407
I know best that an accountant doesn't bring justice.

510
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:50,347
- I'm back. 
 - I'll carry it.

511
00:44:50,347 --> 00:44:53,417
Get out of the way. You'll get hurt.

512
00:44:54,957 --> 00:44:58,637
I brought all of it at once, including Mr. Jae Hwan's and Ms. Hye Won's.

513
00:44:58,637 --> 00:44:59,907
You're really grateful to me, right?

514
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:02,047
I could have gone and brought them.

515
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:07,637
When I was new staff, I hated organizing the files cabinet after a case was over.

516
00:45:07,637 --> 00:45:10,397
We won't ever reopen it if no issues arise,

517
00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:13,187
and I wondered why we work so hard on it.

518
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:16,797
They said I must include even the scribbles written while working,

519
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:20,237
but that's easier said than done. Only the newest staff suffers.

520
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:22,167
So I made up my mind back then

521
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:25,987
not to make the new staff suffer.

522
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:32,877
But did the pawn shop thing go well?

523
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:35,567
Yes. Thanks to you, we won.

524
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,927
What is this about the pawn shop?

525
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:39,127
There's just something like that.

526
00:45:39,127 --> 00:45:41,827
A sunbae asks, and you respond, "There's just something like that"?

527
00:45:41,827 --> 00:45:43,850
So disrespectful.

528
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:50,957
O-Oh w-well, we had somewhat of a mutual assistance.

529
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,927
You're right, mutual help.

530
00:45:52,927 --> 00:45:55,857
Though someone was one step faster than us.

531
00:45:55,857 --> 00:45:58,117
What? Who? Who was it?

532
00:45:58,117 --> 00:46:01,037
There's just some guy like that.

533
00:46:05,427 --> 00:46:07,397
Give it to me. I'll do it.

534
00:46:39,107 --> 00:46:41,477
How's Grandma?

535
00:46:41,477 --> 00:46:43,307
How about you, Noona?

536
00:46:45,497 --> 00:46:48,477
To think you're at HK Private Equity Fund...

537
00:46:48,477 --> 00:46:50,767
There is a reason for it.

538
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:53,017
You don't need to know what it is.

539
00:46:54,037 --> 00:46:56,117
I must know.

540
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:02,307
Since the place that took Haebit Construction's patent where Ahjussi's life revolved

541
00:47:02,307 --> 00:47:04,277
was HK Private Equity Fund.

542
00:47:04,277 --> 00:47:06,077
Don't do anything.

543
00:47:06,077 --> 00:47:08,217
I'm fine.

544
00:47:10,357 --> 00:47:13,237
Who knows? I may be of use.

545
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:16,777
I'm an accountant, after all.

546
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:25,407
How could you do what I don't even know as an insider?

547
00:47:57,187 --> 00:47:59,377
   

548
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,807
   

549
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:06,717
 Are you staying? 

550
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:13,577
The person who sent the money to the private equity fund is

551
00:48:13,577 --> 00:48:15,387
AN?

552
00:48:18,267 --> 00:48:20,697
I will be in South Korea for the time being.

553
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:23,247
I have some things to see to as well.

554
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:44,157
 When can I escape this nightmare? 

555
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:50,387
Who leaked our plan?

556
00:49:51,497 --> 00:49:56,467
As planned, have all our people at Financial Supervisory Service put pressure on Jisan Bank.

557
00:49:56,467 --> 00:49:57,777
- Yes, Ma'am. 
 - Yes, Ma'am.

558
00:49:57,777 --> 00:50:01,037
If the audit department succeeds in getting the external audit for Jisan Bank like this,

559
00:50:01,037 --> 00:50:04,587
our deals department will have to let go of all business regarding Jisan Bank.

560
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:07,467
The current estimated annual sales loss would be 10 billion won ($8 million),

561
00:50:07,467 --> 00:50:10,587
but if we include Jisan Bank's insolvent (failed) assets,

562
00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:13,417
it'd be a loss of about 30 billion won a year.

563
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,280
Would you claim a share on someone else's table?

564
00:50:20,997 --> 00:50:23,067
Where did you learn such bad manners?

565
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:25,147
Who said we'd eat from your table?

566
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,787
We will set our own table.

567
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:31,517
If you overturn our table

568
00:50:31,517 --> 00:50:34,980
to set up your own, then that's the same thing, f...

569
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,290
"F"?

570
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,997
Hey, when did you enter this company?

571
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:41,797
When did you graduate, you b*stard?

572
00:50:41,797 --> 00:50:44,097
I think I have seniority over you.

573
00:50:44,097 --> 00:50:45,707
All right.

574
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:49,157
What if a fight breaks out like this?

575
00:50:49,157 --> 00:50:51,707
They're always fighting over money.

576
00:50:51,707 --> 00:50:54,347
Their performance-based pay is on the line so they can't help but be sensitive.

577
00:50:54,347 --> 00:50:56,137
"Performance-based pay"?

578
00:50:56,137 --> 00:50:58,897
Is a performance review on soon?

579
00:50:58,897 --> 00:51:00,897
The performance review needs to happen,

580
00:51:00,897 --> 00:51:03,687
then performance-based pay can be given based on the grade.

581
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:08,227
Performance review...

582
00:51:41,877 --> 00:51:44,117
That person is...

583
00:51:44,117 --> 00:51:46,717
She's the Vice President of the Audit Department.

584
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:48,667
I see.

585
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:54,057
Though you are busy, I brought you two together for a relationship check.

586
00:51:54,057 --> 00:51:57,287
It's not like there was anything problematic,

587
00:51:57,287 --> 00:52:02,297
and you of all people, know very well about the deals department's

588
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:04,877
relationship with Jisan Bank.

589
00:52:04,877 --> 00:52:08,547
So if you try to take Jisan Bank away from us,

590
00:52:08,547 --> 00:52:11,707
how am I supposed to interpret this?

591
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:13,227
What do you mean, take away?

592
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:16,027
We just followed the Financial Supervisory Service's recommendation

593
00:52:16,027 --> 00:52:18,830
to audit Jisan Banks accounting transparency

594
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:22,167
and do our business activity as we should.

595
00:52:24,117 --> 00:52:26,490
"Business activity"?

596
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:28,960
I don't think an accounting firm

597
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,230
fulfilling one of its primary functions of auditing

598
00:52:35,927 --> 00:52:38,920
is something to scoff at.

599
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:42,510
The auditing of Jisan Bank...

600
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:46,437
If you do that, how much will you earn?

601
00:52:46,437 --> 00:52:47,467
What did you say?

602
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:51,897
The deals department receives 30 billion won as a consulting fee from Jisan Bank annually,

603
00:52:51,897 --> 00:52:53,357
or 60 billion won for two years.

604
00:52:53,357 --> 00:52:58,667
I'm asking if you can bring in that kind of money as an auditing fee.

605
00:53:00,987 --> 00:53:03,587
Do you think that business

606
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:09,170
is a persimmon that ripens and falls...

607
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:12,537
by itself?

608
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:18,127
Rather you need to grab hold of the tree and shake it vigorously

609
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:22,500
in order to get maybe one or two

610
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,760
to fall in front of you.

611
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:28,257
Activity?

612
00:53:28,257 --> 00:53:29,537
V.P. Han Je Gyun–

613
00:53:29,537 --> 00:53:34,367
We amassed our 30 billion won annually like that so go ahead and try it.

614
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:39,857
It will be quite different from the accountant's dignity that you like so much.

615
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:59,187
This is the current sales ratio of Taeil Accounting for the past year:

616
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:06,347
The deals department brings 41% of Taeil Accounting total sales,

617
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:09,027
34% from the audit department,

618
00:54:09,027 --> 00:54:10,777
and the rest is the tax department.

619
00:54:10,777 --> 00:54:14,607
So if the audit department does external auditing for Jisan Bank,

620
00:54:14,607 --> 00:54:16,587
then the audit department's sales will grow a bit,

621
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:21,280
but you're saying the total sales of the accounting firm will decrease significantly,

622
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,947
and by 30 billion won at that.

623
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:34,907
You're saying we should prove a black cat catches mice better than a white cat.

624
00:54:34,907 --> 00:54:37,587
They will go for the tangible dividends before them,

625
00:54:37,587 --> 00:54:41,007
rather than the accounting transparency that doesn't interest them.

626
00:55:13,627 --> 00:55:15,687
It's not over yet

627
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:20,527
so the audit department will work harder to lessen the load on the deals department.

628
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:27,417
We are all part of the same family;

629
00:55:27,417 --> 00:55:30,437
what does it matter if some bring in more money than others?

630
00:55:31,447 --> 00:55:34,507
As long as we all live well together, it's good.

631
00:55:39,247 --> 00:55:42,107
If only people's hearts were all like that.

632
00:55:42,107 --> 00:55:47,027
Even when husband and wife both work, the higher earner has a louder voice.

633
00:56:21,647 --> 00:56:24,487
Why are you going to the tenth floor?

634
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:26,207
- The thing is... 
 - Oh.

635
00:56:27,497 --> 00:56:29,507
To see the firm's eye candy?

636
00:56:29,507 --> 00:56:32,747
- No! 
 - Mr. Han Seung Jo...

637
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:34,337
Isn't he working offsite today?

638
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:36,137
What kind of...

639
00:56:36,137 --> 00:56:39,357
What are you saying?

640
00:56:45,397 --> 00:56:47,307
I'll see you in the meeting room.

641
00:56:54,727 --> 00:56:59,067
- To see the eye candy of the firm... 
 - No!

642
00:57:01,537 --> 00:57:05,487
- Accountant Han Seung Jo... 
 - Dad!

643
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:07,347
I said no!

644
00:57:13,987 --> 00:57:17,047
A neat, flawless life...

645
00:57:17,047 --> 00:57:19,547
Her husband is an exchange professor.

646
00:57:19,547 --> 00:57:22,597
And is her son still in the U.S. for his doctorate?

647
00:57:22,597 --> 00:57:24,117
Yes.

648
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:33,477
President Jin Tae Soo of Jisan Bank?

649
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:46,187
   

650
00:57:56,017 --> 00:57:58,617
   

651
00:58:00,597 --> 00:58:01,967
   

652
00:58:01,967 --> 00:58:03,517
   

653
00:58:21,717 --> 00:58:23,087
   

654
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:27,507
   

655
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:45,180


656
00:58:55,287 --> 00:59:00,657
♫  Please tell me why, find out the truth you wanted  ♫

657
00:59:00,657 --> 00:59:05,847
♫  Find again the dreams that you've forgotten  ♫

658
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:10,527
♫  Focus your mind, see deep inside  ♫

659
00:59:10,527 --> 00:59:12,507
♫  I will call out in the midst  ♫

660
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:16,037
   

661
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:18,977
 Realistically, it will be difficult to find the funds' owners. 

662
00:59:18,977 --> 00:59:23,387
 I need to find out, starting with who these shy, rich men are. 

663
00:59:23,387 --> 00:59:25,207
 Even if I did what Joyce Jang told me to do? 

664
00:59:25,207 --> 00:59:28,287
 She told me to listen to her if I wanted to retain any of my money. 

665
00:59:28,287 --> 00:59:30,447
 It's not Ji Soo's fault. 

666
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:32,807
 I found this out for you. 
   

667
00:59:32,807 --> 00:59:36,207
  I mixed a request and a solicitation. 

668
00:59:36,207 --> 00:59:38,977
 Working at a company is like a theatrical play. 

669
00:59:38,977 --> 00:59:42,607
 But if you don't feed them, don't savage beasts hunt and eat even their trainers? 

670
00:59:42,607 --> 00:59:45,177
 Who do you think you are to ruin the contract? 

671
00:59:45,177 --> 00:59:47,137
 Mr. Ho Woo! What happened with this? 

672
00:59:47,137 --> 00:59:51,897
 I would like you to leave Taeil Accounting, Mr. Jang Ho Woo. 

673
00:59:53,327 --> 00:59:57,700
♫  I will show you from now on  ♫
