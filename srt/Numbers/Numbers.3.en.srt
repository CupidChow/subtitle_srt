Disclaimer of opinion.

You told me not to worry,

8
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,544
but this is the result you achieved?

9
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:20,774
From now on, Taeil will support...

10
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:25,215
the disclaimer of opinion as a whole.

11
00:00:26,614 --> 00:00:29,054
It's obvious it'll be publicly announced.

12
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:32,754
They can't make a correcting disclosure.

13
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:37,095
Accounting firms don't sell reports.

14
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:41,165
They sell their reputation...

15
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,234
for never being wrong in any situation.

16
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,003
If we say this year's disclaimer of opinion is correct,

17
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:50,205
they'll raise an issue with last year's unqualified opinion.

18
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:51,845
Are you saying we need to prove...

19
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:54,745
that the conflicting opinions from this year and last year...

20
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:56,915
are both correct?

21
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:59,044
It's a spear against a shield.

22
00:01:00,385 --> 00:01:04,085
Taeil must win at both.

will suffer from that?

(Taeil Accounting, Managing Director Shin Jun Ho)

37
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:07,514
Hey.

38
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:10,785
They're here.

39
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,325
- One moment, please. - What?

40
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:18,923
- What's going on? - Come with us.

41
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,724
Wait. Why are you taking my bag?

42
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,694
- What are you doing? - What's going on?

43
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:24,905
You at least need to tell us what's going on.

44
00:02:25,105 --> 00:02:26,233
- Give that back. - What?

45
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:27,364
Wait.

- Tell us what's going on. - Stop it.

48
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:37,785
my team will suffer a lot.

49
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:40,685
I know it's shameless of me, but please take care of them.

50
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:43,785
Why are you taking our laptops?

51
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,185
Mr. Han.

52
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:49,325
What would you do first after capturing enemies alive in war?

53
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:51,824
I would take their weapons.

54
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,095
This is also a battlefield.

55
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:56,065
Laptops that belong to new hires like yourself may be useless,

56
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:59,234
but accountants' laptops contain secrets of various corporations.

57
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:00,605
It's basically a bomb.

58
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:04,035
If it explodes when nobody expects it,

59
00:03:04,204 --> 00:03:06,244
it'll kill everyone, us and the enemy both.

60
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:08,744
Are they doing that because...

61
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:11,345
they're worried the accountants might sell company information?

62
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:13,544
People can do anything when they're backed into a corner.

63
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:16,355
It's easy to back someone into a corner here.

64
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:25,894
We found an issue in last year's report.

65
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,363
It was indeed our firm's mistake.

66
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:30,535
Accounting firms don't make mistakes.

67
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,804
Individual accountants may.

68
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:39,173
Why did VP An Seung Yeon...

69
00:03:39,174 --> 00:03:40,744
have to be on sick leave now?

70
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:44,514
What if we're left without any connections here?

71
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:47,484
I wish Mr. Kang had discussed this with us first.

72
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:50,714
If he had discussed it with us, would we have let him do that?

73
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,855
Nobody can save us except ourselves.

74
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:04,095
It's not a sin to issue a disclaimer of opinion.

75
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:08,334
Our firm won't make you take responsibility...

76
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:09,735
for this year's disclaimer of opinion.

77
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:14,005
However, what the firm is worried about right now...

78
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:15,315
is last year.

79
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:17,175
"Last year?"

80
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:20,885
Technically,

81
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:23,214
we looked at two similar sets of financial statements...

82
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,954
and gave an unqualified opinion for last year's statement.

83
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:29,055
But said we couldn't trust this company this year.

84
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,065
To make sure there are no issues,

85
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:34,534
we need to explain why we said last year's were okay.

86
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:36,534
I'm sure...

87
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,104
you were aware they couldn't release their film...

88
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:42,005
and what kind of situation they had with their merchandise...

89
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:45,375
when you said this company was doing well.

90
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:49,343
An accounting firm giving an unqualified opinion...

91
00:04:49,344 --> 00:04:50,414
isn't a simple matter.

92
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,884
You worked so hard to search through board meeting minutes...

93
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,425
and wrote the report.

94
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:01,654
You must be wondering why I'm saying such obvious things.

95
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:02,854
But please understand.

96
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,065
Board meeting minutes?

97
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:06,394
Yes.

98
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:08,964
Board meeting minutes.

99
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:13,104
I mean,

100
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:15,374
what can an accountant do...

101
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:16,904
when that's what the board decided?

102
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:19,403
I can understand why it felt most appropriate...

103
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,505
to give an unqualified opinion.

104
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,055
The fact that you referred to People's Entertainment's...

105
00:05:29,315 --> 00:05:31,385
board meeting minutes is written in last year's report, right?

106
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,925
I'm sure you also kept a copy of the board meeting minutes.

107
00:05:42,164 --> 00:05:44,235
There were no board meeting minutes.

108
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,935
Yes. I'm sure.

109
00:05:49,104 --> 00:05:50,104
So...

110
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:53,175
It's their fault for not sensing danger.

111
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,545
They should admit their mistake like Mr. Kang.

112
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:01,384
Or they should avoid responsibility by creating board meeting minutes...

113
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,985
that never existed...

114
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,625
to cover up their mistake.

115
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,524
They must pick one of the two.

116
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:12,894
Are you asking me to order them to commit forgery...

117
00:06:13,724 --> 00:06:15,964
and create fake board meeting minutes?

118
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,004
If things go wrong,

119
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,474
we might get in trouble for instigating forgery.

120
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:28,175
Hyung Woo.

121
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:30,214
Are you going to order them...

122
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:33,945
to create fake board meeting minutes?

123
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:37,454
I'm asking you...

124
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:39,925
if you're going to tell them that if we are sued,

125
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:43,425
they will take all the blame and that if they're scared,

126
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:47,964
they should prepare fake board meeting minutes while they can.

127
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:54,435
You won't, right?

128
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:58,045
Of course, I won't either.

129
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:06,514
There's no need to get blood on our hands.

130
00:07:07,784 --> 00:07:09,154
All we have to do...

131
00:07:10,284 --> 00:07:11,954
is set the scene for them.

132
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:15,825
Whatever they do in the scene we set for them...

133
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,894
is their choice...

134
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,865
and their responsibility. Don't you think?

(People's Entertainment 2021 Statutory Audit)

Go and keep a lookout.

137
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:33,474
Look carefully. Do you see the board meeting minutes?

138
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,544
Of course, they're not here. We've never seen them before.

139
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:36,945
I've never even seen them.

140
00:07:37,615 --> 00:07:38,945
What should we do now?

141
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:40,544
We need that...

142
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:42,714
for our decision from last year to make sense.

143
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:55,295
Why are you all looking at me?

144
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,865
You're in charge of our team now.

145
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:04,334
Gather around me.

146
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:11,984
- Who's in charge here? - Move!

147
00:08:11,985 --> 00:08:13,783
- I want to talk to someone. - Move!

148
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,513
- Bring out whoever's in charge! - Hey!

149
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:18,023
- Let us through. - Please!

150
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,854
- Move! - Let us through!

151
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:22,524
Darn it. Stop them!

153
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,145
Jang Ho Woo, come immediately.

154
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,114
Jang Ho Woo.

155
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,484
Why do you think those people are here?

156
00:08:54,454 --> 00:08:56,424
People's Entertainment is at risk of being de-listed...

157
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:57,864
because of the disclaimer of opinion.

158
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:00,624
Isn't that why they're here?

159
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:02,134
Is that so?

160
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,905
Then what about the major shareholders?

161
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:10,334
The losses they suffered must be bigger than anyone else's.

162
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,075
It's because the accountants go directly to them.

163
00:09:15,214 --> 00:09:17,815
They'll help come up with countermeasures and solutions.

164
00:09:19,915 --> 00:09:21,084
But what about those people?

165
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:27,525
An accountant's role and responsibility...

166
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,994
is not for people who work for their money.

167
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:34,195
It's for people whose money works for them.

168
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:36,765
It's an expensive product...

169
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:41,165
that's sold on a marble table, not on the streets like that.

170
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:47,204
Did you say you wanted to become a major talent for Taeil Accounting?

171
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:51,613
If so, don't waste your emotions on useless things...

172
00:09:51,614 --> 00:09:52,945
and pick the right stance.

173
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:54,954
Remember...

174
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:58,124
how you start here will decide your end.

175
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:18,074
(Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office)

176
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,275
- He's here! - He's here!

177
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:24,983
- As People's Entertainment's CEO... - Please answer a few questions.

178
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:27,144
- Innocent people are suffering... - Please tell us your thoughts.

179
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,554
Was Chairman Lee Chan Ju aware of this situation?

180
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:30,284
- Please tell us what happened. - What would you say to those...

181
00:10:30,285 --> 00:10:32,383
- What's going to happen next? - Tell us.

182
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:34,853
- Was it intentional or a mistake? - Please move.

183
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:36,924
- Hey! - You can't go in there, sir.

184
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:38,064
- Get out of the way. - You can't...

185
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:39,295
- VP Han Je Kyun! - go in there, sir.

186
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:40,825
You can't go in there!

187
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:42,464
- You can't... - Hey, Han Je Kyun!

188
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,334
How dare you stab me in the back?

189
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:47,204
How dare you give a disclaimer of opinion?

190
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,204
If my son gets arrested,

191
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,633
I'll make you pay.

192
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:51,973
All of you be ready.

193
00:10:51,974 --> 00:10:53,045
Got it?

194
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:55,045
I'll take responsibility.

195
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:58,844
I'll take responsibility...

196
00:10:58,915 --> 00:11:02,114
and stop things so your son doesn't get arrested.

197
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:14,025
Fake board meeting minutes?

198
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:17,935
Your son's embezzlement and negligence charges...

199
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:22,104
came from pushing for unreasonable business plans...

200
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,035
on his own.

201
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:25,774
That means,

202
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:28,445
as long as we prove the decision was made in a board meeting,

203
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:30,315
we can say it was simply a failed investment...

204
00:11:30,614 --> 00:11:33,285
rather than embezzlement and negligence.

205
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,555
So you're saying...

206
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:40,284
that he won't be arrested...

207
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:41,994
as long as we have board meeting minutes.

208
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:45,065
And that Taeil will prepare...

209
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:47,464
the fake board meeting minutes. Is that right?

210
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:50,665
That's correct.

211
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:03,174
It doesn't matter if it's an original or a copy.

212
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:05,014
Look for any piece of paper with the company's official seal...

213
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,414
and the words "board meeting minutes" on it.

214
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:07,545
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

215
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:11,624
There aren't any issues.

216
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:13,285
There are no issues.

217
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:20,195
I found something.

218
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:25,964
Gosh. What are all of you doing with your phones plugged in?

219
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:28,675
I can't think because my head is ringing!

220
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,334
- I found something. - Let me see.

221
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:37,614
How dare you come in here?

222
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:40,315
You ruined our company!

223
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:44,724
Why are you back here? What more do you have to ruin?

224
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:56,695
Whose fault is all of this?

225
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:00,233
If you hadn't played those foolish tricks...

226
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,075
to lie to us,

227
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:04,004
there wouldn't have been any issues!

228
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,873
None of us...

229
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:07,344
would've ended up like this. Do you know that?

230
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:08,945
Get out.

231
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:10,415
Get out.

232
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,185
Didn't you hear me? Get out!

233
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:15,454
This is still my company!

234
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:18,624
We need to live for you to live!

235
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:20,084
To be honest,

236
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:22,094
we're the only ones who can help you.

237
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:25,724
Banks will be asking you to repay your debt at any moment.

238
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:27,724
What are you going to do?

239
00:13:28,094 --> 00:13:30,464
I also feel like dying right now!

240
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:33,704
But you know...

241
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:36,305
that people don't die of embarrassment.

242
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,645
They die of something else.

243
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:49,055
The date they wired the payment...

244
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,084
- was March 16. - Okay. March 16.

245
00:13:52,155 --> 00:13:53,184
March 8.

246
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:54,854
There was also a board meeting on March 8.

247
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:57,253
Okay. Let's say they decided on the investment in that meeting.

248
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,695
- Yes, sir. - Next.

249
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,493
The next wire date was April 24.

250
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:01,695
April 24.

251
00:14:01,935 --> 00:14:02,935
Note that down.

252
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:10,333
They gathered all of the documents to be used in writing...

253
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:12,805
the fake board meeting minutes. They're writing it now.

254
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:16,645
Once they're done writing it, I'll deliver it to Sang Ah Group.

255
00:14:17,145 --> 00:14:18,515
And what about our plans?

256
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,953
Just because the M and A is off the table,

257
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,984
we can't just sit around doing nothing.

258
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:27,224
We need to make money our own way.

259
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:29,353
I'm already analyzing how we can profit...

260
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:31,195
from this case with People's Entertainment...

261
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:32,964
and calculating the rate of return for each scenario.

262
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:34,594
I'll give you a report tomorrow.

263
00:14:37,734 --> 00:14:39,004
Okay.

264
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,873
(The son of Sang Ah Group's chairman...)

265
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:49,213
(cleared of embezzlement and negligence charges)

266
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:50,843
(People's Entertainment Chairman Lee Bo Sung...)

267
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,484
(returns home after 2 hours of investigation.)

268
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,713
- Chairman Lee. - Please tell us what happened.

269
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:56,515
- Please answer some questions. - Were you cleared of all charges?

270
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,295
Don't you know what prohibited means?

271
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:06,665
I told you not to come up here.

272
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,333
No one is helping the minority shareholders...

273
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:12,364
of People's Entertainment who have done nothing wrong.

274
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:14,133
But so many people are helping him,

275
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:15,905
even though he's done so many bad things.

276
00:15:18,035 --> 00:15:19,244
It's unfair.

277
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:42,634
An accountant's role and responsibility...

278
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:45,435
is not for people who work for their money.

279
00:15:45,604 --> 00:15:48,305
It's for people whose money works for them.

280
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:50,734
It's an expensive product...

281
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,204
that's sold on a marble table,

282
00:15:53,305 --> 00:15:55,275
not on the streets like that.

283
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:01,685
You should go to work if you've eaten enough.

284
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:05,155
Why are you looking so serious from the morning?

285
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:08,155
I know.

286
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,525
You really are...

287
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:13,124
an accountant.

288
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:15,935
Why?

289
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:22,104
When I walk by customers and hear them talk,

290
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:25,145
the ones with the gloomy, frowning faces...

291
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,145
that are serious are all accountants.

292
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:32,214
Why did you open your restaurant here?

293
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:37,253
Yeo Jin kept nagging me to open it in her jurisdiction...

294
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:39,285
so that she wouldn't worry.

295
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:48,765
It's only been a few months since I opened this restaurant,

296
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:53,104
but it's already turning into a place for accountants.

297
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:55,774
This apparently used to be...

298
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:59,505
their clubhouse or something.

299
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:05,215
I'm worried about running into people from my firm here.

300
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:10,214
I don't want to tell them for the time being.

301
00:17:10,215 --> 00:17:12,154
Why do you need to tell them?

302
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:15,854
Whenever I see that arrogant professor,

303
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,764
I'm dying to tell him...

304
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,833
that my grandson is an accountant.

305
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,864
But I've held back until now.

306
00:17:31,334 --> 00:17:33,045
One gukbap, please.

307
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,344
Yes. Take a seat.

308
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:52,525
Ho Woo. What's wrong?

309
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:58,035
You just have to stand up straight, act like a customer, and walk out.

310
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:00,005
You foolish boy.

311
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:12,545
(The firm's handsome man)

312
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:18,755
I should change this.

313
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:20,455
There's a new handsome man now.

314
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:24,824
Hello?

315
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:25,995
Ms. Jin.

316
00:18:26,094 --> 00:18:27,325
Are you working on something lately?

317
00:18:28,434 --> 00:18:30,664
I was.

318
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,864
Until just now.

319
00:18:33,535 --> 00:18:34,705
A proposal?

320
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,035
It will only take a day.

321
00:18:39,045 --> 00:18:41,305
I was on my way home after working all night.

322
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:47,984
We're only doing the due diligence,

323
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:50,555
and the firm handling the sale will do the valuation.

324
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:54,654
That means they're only trusting us halfway, right?

325
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,235
So what is the total amount of receivables?

326
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:13,603
Jisan Bank has a total of 72.4 million dollars...

327
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:14,804
in receivables from People's Entertainment.

328
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:15,874
Also...

329
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:19,485
Jang Ho Woo.

330
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:22,114
Take a sit since you're here.

331
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:24,485
You too.

332
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:25,924
Yes, sir.

333
00:19:26,785 --> 00:19:27,824
(Jisan Bank's total receivables from People's Entertainment)

334
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,693
(Secured loans 38.2 million dollars, Corporate loans 27 million dollars,)

335
00:19:29,694 --> 00:19:30,954
(Working capital loans 7.2 million)

336
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,265
(Total: 72.4 million dollars)

337
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:35,433
With a disclaimer of opinion,

338
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:38,094
wouldn't Jisan Bank deny the extension of debt maturity...

339
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,005
and ask for immediate repayment?

340
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:41,975
Asking for a repayment?

341
00:19:42,874 --> 00:19:44,005
That's definitely possible.

342
00:19:44,174 --> 00:19:45,744
There's a low chance the company will survive for long...

343
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:47,404
after the disclaimer of opinion.

344
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:49,844
It would be meaningless to give them more time to repay their debt.

345
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:51,843
But with People's Entertainment's current financial situation,

346
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,884
it's impossible for them to repay their debts.

347
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:56,413
So I thought of bad loan...

348
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:59,555
Are you suggesting turning into bad loan and selling it?

349
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:01,154
Yes, sir.

350
00:20:01,155 --> 00:20:02,294
Okay. Sounds good.

351
00:20:02,295 --> 00:20:04,495
So the buyer or the seller?

352
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,124
What?

353
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:10,535
He's asking which side Taeil Accounting should take...

354
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:13,765
between the seller and buyer of the bad loan to get a higher fee.

355
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:17,305
I see. Well...

356
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:32,985
(Which side for a higher fee?)

357
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:35,854
Four hundred ninety...

358
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,035
Gosh.

359
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:53,344
Selling bonds is the best option,

360
00:20:53,505 --> 00:20:55,245
but Jisan Bank will object.

361
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:58,443
Because their shareholders...

362
00:20:58,444 --> 00:21:00,114
will complain they lost 70 million dollars.

363
00:21:00,844 --> 00:21:02,154
Why would they...

364
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:05,015
want to sell off the bonds?

365
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:08,795
The bank president will just stall...

366
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,124
until his term's over.

367
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,093
We need...

368
00:21:13,094 --> 00:21:15,864
Jisan Bank to cooperate if this is to work.

369
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,295
Yes.

370
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:23,275
There is a way.

371
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:24,674
Jang Ho Woo.

372
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:31,515
I know how we can persuade Jisan Bank.

373
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:38,754
(Jisan Bank)

374
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,025
Do you know the term "wag the dog?"

375
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,325
"Wag the dog?"

376
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:45,524
You move the tail...

377
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:48,694
if you need a dog to move when the head won't budge.

378
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,904
Let's call People's Entertainment's main creditor Jisan Bank...

379
00:21:58,205 --> 00:21:59,505
the dog's head.

380
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:01,544
The other banks who loaned...

381
00:22:01,545 --> 00:22:04,245
much less than Jisan to People's Entertainment,

382
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:06,515
we'll call them the dog's tail.

383
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:10,914
Right now, the head's pretending nothing's wrong to hide their loss,

384
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:12,854
and that's our problem.

385
00:22:13,985 --> 00:22:15,624
Instead of the head, we go for the tail,

386
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:17,755
the other banks that People's owes money to.

387
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:21,194
We just have to make them sell off People's bad loan.

388
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:28,104
The same company borrowed from them all.

389
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,205
The head says all is well,

390
00:22:31,834 --> 00:22:34,344
but the tail is barking about a huge problem.

391
00:22:34,745 --> 00:22:36,844
Naturally, people will notice.

392
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:40,184
And naturally, Jisan's shareholders will react...

393
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:44,555
and put pressure on the bank to do something.

394
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:49,755
Jisan will have no choice but to do as Taeil says and sell the bad loan.

395
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:53,325
Because the wagging tail...

396
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:56,364
made the head budge.

397
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:03,505
I thank you very much for your advice, Mr. Han,

398
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:06,704
but our Jisan Bank has decided to give it some time...

399
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:08,815
and see how things play out.

400
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:11,413
When individual clients...

401
00:23:11,414 --> 00:23:13,614
so much as miss a single interest payment,

402
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:16,814
you waste no time sending reminders...

403
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,554
and collecting on their debts.

404
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:22,325
But when it comes to one company that borrowed a huge sum,

405
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:26,164
you are so calm and merciful.

406
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,333
No wonder people say...

407
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:32,705
"it's best to steal big instead of something trivial."

408
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:37,505
They owe us, and we say it's fine.

409
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:39,144
So what's the problem?

410
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:43,745
The problem is with your bank, not with me.

411
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:47,715
What do you mean?

412
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,015
Just like your Jisan Bank,

413
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:56,025
Hanra Bank lent money to People's Entertainment.

414
00:23:57,154 --> 00:24:00,664
They just agreed to start the process of selling off...

415
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,334
the bad loan.

416
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:08,535
Sang Ah Group's chairman's son is involved in this mess,

417
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:13,144
so the media will have a field day.

418
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:15,545
If your shareholders...

419
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,414
were to ask what was going on,

420
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:20,844
do you have a good enough explanation ready?

421
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:27,325
What if they ask what you were "banking on" when you lent them...

422
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,624
so much money?

423
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:43,134
Let Taeil Accounting handle it for you.

424
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:47,344
We'll sort everything out.

425
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:12,264
Good morning.

426
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:13,434
- Hello. - Morning, sir.

427
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:17,805
Here's the announcement.

428
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,805
Our Taeil Accounting...

429
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:23,745
will handle Jisan Bank's bad loan.

430
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:26,084
Both purchase and sales.

431
00:25:29,015 --> 00:25:30,815
We'll handle it all.

432
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:54,343
I'll explain for the sake of our new recruits.

433
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,015
Our Sales Team will focus solely on selling.

434
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:59,745
We'll set a baseline, the bare minimum we must get.

435
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:02,884
That's the price we must get if we're to break even.

436
00:26:03,184 --> 00:26:05,653
You can't do business if you're selling something...

437
00:26:05,654 --> 00:26:07,384
without knowing the prime cost.

438
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:09,353
The prime cost we set is the minimum sales price.

439
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:12,724
Out of those who bid above it,

440
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:14,624
the one who bid the most...

441
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,495
wins the auction.

442
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:19,833
What if all the bids we get...

443
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:22,705
fall below the minimum sales price we calculated?

444
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:25,943
If that happens, everyone in this room...

445
00:26:25,944 --> 00:26:27,745
might have to resign.

446
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:30,744
That doesn't happen.

447
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:32,914
If one or two bids are like that, it's one or the other.

448
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:35,815
Their team has lost its touch, or they're not interested.

449
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:37,913
But no one would pay the hefty fee...

450
00:26:37,914 --> 00:26:40,785
just to place a bid if they weren't interested.

451
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:42,525
The cheaper we get it for,

452
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:45,354
the more our Buying Team makes, of course.

453
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:48,225
Barely exceeding the minimum sales price...

454
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:52,404
while outbidding our competitors by just one cent...

455
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:54,505
is the only way we'll win.

456
00:26:55,834 --> 00:26:59,245
Can we not ask Sales what the minimum sales price is?

457
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:02,174
Both teams are working under the same roof.

458
00:27:02,444 --> 00:27:05,413
I don't get why we should calculate the minimum sales price.

459
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:06,644
That's unacceptable.

460
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:10,285
There are strict laws against it to ensure a fair bid.

461
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:13,724
Unless you want to cause serious trouble,

462
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:17,094
I suggest you stay well away from Sales.

467
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:55,025
What do you mean you might not bid?

468
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:58,465
I did some thinking.

469
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:03,575
I was going to buy People's Entertainment...

470
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:07,374
to prevent my son from going away for embezzlement and negligence.

471
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:10,144
He got out, thanks to you two.

472
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,815
So now I'm wondering what's the point...

473
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:17,055
in buying the useless company?

474
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:22,224
I'm not saying I won't bid.

475
00:28:22,225 --> 00:28:25,295
I'm thinking about it, that's all.

476
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:34,134
Do you get what I mean?

477
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,944
I can't drink half as much as I used to.

478
00:28:43,674 --> 00:28:46,485
I'm off, Mr. Han.

479
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,854
Goodbye.

480
00:28:56,255 --> 00:28:57,623
I'd heard enough to know...

481
00:28:57,624 --> 00:29:00,765
he changed his tune as soon as he got out of trouble.

482
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:04,164
He agreed to hire us to consult him on the bid.

483
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,104
I'll draw up the contract as soon as possible.

484
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:09,334
We don't make much on consultations like that.

485
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,104
We work for the contingency fee.

486
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:15,944
Don't we?

487
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:21,545
To think we worked on him for so long,

488
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:24,985
not knowing that.

The consultation agreement form for Sang Ah Group.

490

Have the lawyer go over it and bring it back.

491

We have an in-house legal team.

494
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:05,894
We don't go to a law firm.

495
00:30:06,864 --> 00:30:07,924
I see.

496
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:19,545
Are you claustrophobic?

497
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:25,344
Then what's wrong?

498
00:30:25,815 --> 00:30:27,015
You look pale.

499
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:34,454
Do you think I'm a pervert?

500
00:30:34,455 --> 00:30:35,525
It's not that.

501
00:30:36,354 --> 00:30:38,995
I'm not to talk to anyone from Sales.

502
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:41,795
- What? - Well...

503
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:45,904
We're not allowed to discuss the minimum sales price.

504
00:30:46,864 --> 00:30:48,104
It could cause trouble.

505
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:53,775
How much is the Buying Team going to bid?

506
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:57,475
What's your bid?

507
00:30:58,975 --> 00:30:59,985
What?

508
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:01,515
You don't know, do you?

509
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:02,785
Well...

510
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:04,653
No.

511
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,224
I don't know the minimum sales price.

512
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:08,684
How would I know that?

513
00:31:09,424 --> 00:31:11,955
You must know something to share and cause trouble.

514
00:31:12,154 --> 00:31:13,924
Not just anyone is capable of causing trouble.

515
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:16,334
It takes people of a certain calibre.

516
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:19,235
So get over here before I turn nasty.

517
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:22,505
Darn it.

518
00:31:30,114 --> 00:31:31,844
You don't have to stand so close.

519
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:45,295
You dropped...

520
00:31:48,624 --> 00:31:50,495
(Lawyer Lee Chung Won)

521
00:31:58,305 --> 00:31:59,975
What? Is it weird...

522
00:32:00,604 --> 00:32:02,545
to see a lawyer at an accounting firm?

523
00:32:03,644 --> 00:32:05,045
No, sir.

524
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:19,393
Did you see...

525
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:21,565
a loose document on the floor?

526
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:22,834
No.

527
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:27,434
What do you mean you lost the title analysis paper?

528
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,065
I apologize.

529
00:32:29,604 --> 00:32:31,434
I'll look for it again.

530
00:32:31,505 --> 00:32:33,874
If the Buying Team figures out the minimum sales price,

531
00:32:34,374 --> 00:32:36,174
will you take responsibility?

532
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:46,024
What do you want?

533
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:47,454
What's a guy from the Buying Team standing outside...

534
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:48,555
the Sales' meeting room?

535
00:33:28,594 --> 00:33:30,593
- Where's the revised contract? - Oh, right.

536
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,235
It's...

537
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:33,403
Here you go.

538
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:34,535
I'll leave this with you.

539
00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:36,334
Wait. If we were...

540
00:33:37,404 --> 00:33:38,475
Well...

541
00:33:38,735 --> 00:33:41,545
If we were to hear anything from Sales, would it help us?

542
00:33:41,674 --> 00:33:42,774
Of course.

543
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:45,545
We can guess how they're calculating the minimum sales price.

544
00:33:45,674 --> 00:33:48,785
If we know that, we won half the battle.

545
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:50,455
Why? Do you know something?

546
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:54,725
No. I just asked.

547
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:56,025
Okay.

548
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:57,725
Handle that for me.

549
00:34:37,835 --> 00:34:41,104
I thought you'd do anything to appeal to Sim Hyung Woo.

550
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:43,475
- So why? - It's the power of principle.

551
00:34:43,634 --> 00:34:46,174
I won't do anything to kill others to save my skin.

552
00:34:47,404 --> 00:34:49,475
The real power is in making people act...

553
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:51,544
without having to give orders.

554
00:34:57,585 --> 00:34:59,984
The power to make people act without giving orders.

555
00:35:10,995 --> 00:35:12,165
What's this?

556
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,734
What's this doing here?

557
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:20,504
I think Jang Ho Woo left it earlier.

558
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,245
What on earth...

559
00:35:25,714 --> 00:35:27,015
In the elevator.

560
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:31,613
He should've told me if he had left it here.

561
00:35:31,614 --> 00:35:33,484
I went to so much trouble looking for it.

562
00:35:33,785 --> 00:35:36,294
Shouldn't you be...

563
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:38,254
thankful he returned it to you?

564
00:36:01,484 --> 00:36:02,745
Mr. Jang.

565
00:36:05,114 --> 00:36:06,424
The paper from earlier.

566
00:36:08,024 --> 00:36:09,825
Oh, that?

567
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:12,794
I didn't look at it.

568
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:14,124
What?

569
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:17,535
Aren't you worried I peeked at the estimated sale price?

570
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:19,805
It's not that.

571
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,564
I'm grateful.

572
00:36:21,904 --> 00:36:23,404
It was an important document.

573
00:36:25,404 --> 00:36:27,404
I wanted to leave it in your meeting room,

574
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:29,375
but I was too busy.

575
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:30,843
It's okay.

576
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:34,384
I was waiting for you to thank you.

577
00:36:34,645 --> 00:36:36,185
Giving it to me was enough.

578
00:36:39,384 --> 00:36:40,754
I'll treat you one day.

579
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,654
I know a good gukbap place.

580
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:45,355
Okay.

581
00:36:46,694 --> 00:36:47,924
See you tomorrow.

582
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:57,234
(Jisan Bank)

583
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,003
What do you mean by making a new package...

584
00:37:00,004 --> 00:37:01,904
to sell bad loans with People's Entertainment's?

585
00:37:02,404 --> 00:37:04,813
Problematic bad loans you're keeping hidden,

586
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:08,415
hoping no one will find out and penalize you until you resign.

587
00:37:09,214 --> 00:37:10,384
You have a few.

588
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,415
Don't be silly.

589
00:37:12,924 --> 00:37:14,455
There's no such thing.

590
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:16,955
When you sell People's bad loans,

591
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:18,325
discard those too.

592
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:23,094
Think about it.

593
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:24,794
Would that even be possible?

594
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,304
Taeil Accounting insisted...

595
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:29,904
we gave them the best products...

596
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:31,805
because we needed this deal to work out.

597
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:34,645
This won't go to Taeil Accounting.

598
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,645
I'll handle it for you.

599
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:38,544
At a great price.

600
00:37:42,245 --> 00:37:45,014
Whatever's in the package, the buyer is set and ready.

601
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,254
Don't worry about the deal falling through.

602
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:50,895
What's your condition?

603
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,825
Do business with me only from now on.

604
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:56,064
That means to Jisan Bank,

605
00:37:56,794 --> 00:37:58,335
I am Taeil Accounting.

606
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:07,245
You can't switch the product without a hint to us.

607
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,544
Who would buy trash like this?

608
00:38:10,145 --> 00:38:11,544
What do you expect me to do now?

609
00:38:17,314 --> 00:38:19,285
Are you out of your mind?

610
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:23,825
I'm heartbroken that Kang Hyun ruined the M and A.

611
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:25,154
How dare you...

612
00:38:25,424 --> 00:38:27,964
ruin the bad loan deal too?

613
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:29,864
It's not ruined, so don't worry.

614
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:33,264
Sang Ah Group's Chairman Lee will have no choice but to buy.

615
00:38:33,265 --> 00:38:36,734
Lee Chan Ju is not mad enough to buy trash.

616
00:38:36,805 --> 00:38:39,134
He might not want it, of course,

617
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:41,604
but he'll like it even less if anyone else were to buy it.

618
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,844
No, wait.

619
00:38:43,975 --> 00:38:45,814
He'd be more afraid.

620
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:49,915
Are you saying someone is threatening him with trash?

621
00:38:50,154 --> 00:38:51,313
The right to view accounts.

622
00:38:51,314 --> 00:38:53,225
What about the right to view...

623
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:01,064
The right to view the books?

624
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:04,164
Whoever buys the bad loans of People's Entertainment...

625
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:07,733
gains the right to view their financial statements...

626
00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:10,504
as well as any account, and they can do so at any time.

627
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:17,444
It's a Pandora's Box for Sang Ah Group's heir, Bo Sung.

628
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:20,884
Who do you think would want that the most?

629
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:24,254
Keep going.

630
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,555
Lee Chan Ju's younger brother, Lee Sung Ju.

631
00:39:30,094 --> 00:39:32,023
Despite being better than his older brother,

632
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:33,825
he was kicked out of Sang Ah Group.

633
00:39:35,194 --> 00:39:36,364
The unfortunate...

634
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:38,835
prince.

635
00:39:39,265 --> 00:39:40,733
If it hadn't been for his father,

636
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:43,274
he'd have become chairman long ago.

637
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:45,904
It's a shame on his part.

638
00:39:53,085 --> 00:39:54,844
Are you saying...

639
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:59,555
you'll participate in this deal as Lee Sung Ju's proxy?

640
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:03,555
Wouldn't there be a reason he amassed a fortune...

641
00:40:03,855 --> 00:40:06,464
at the expense of being called a loan shark?

642
00:40:07,694 --> 00:40:08,964
Perhaps...

643
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:12,464
he wants to regain what he has lost.

644
00:40:15,504 --> 00:40:18,975
I think the actual product of this bad loan deal...

645
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:22,274
is the right to view People's account books.

646
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:27,114
Don't you agree?

647
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:40,165
The right to view accounts?

648
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:41,894
If that had been such a great thing,

649
00:40:41,895 --> 00:40:43,994
you should've told me.

650
00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:46,233
The right to view accounts isn't a great thing.

651
00:40:46,234 --> 00:40:48,503
It's an ordinary right given to anyone...

652
00:40:48,504 --> 00:40:50,233
who owns a certain percentage of a company.

653
00:40:50,234 --> 00:40:53,304
Are you saying Sung Ju can turn this place...

654
00:40:53,305 --> 00:40:55,274
into a mess over something that ordinary?

655
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:57,744
Other than embezzlement or negligence,

656
00:40:57,745 --> 00:40:59,914
was your son up to...

657
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,014
anything else?

658
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:03,984
I'm losing my mind because I don't know.

659
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:06,484
He caused so much trouble all over the place.

660
00:41:10,455 --> 00:41:12,653
Sung Ju is annoyingly tenacious.

661
00:41:12,654 --> 00:41:15,694
You know how hard it was when we kicked him out.

662
00:41:15,794 --> 00:41:18,464
And to think he might get his hands on the accounts?

663
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:20,804
It'll be the death of me,

664
00:41:20,805 --> 00:41:22,404
Bo Sung, and everyone.

665
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:23,805
No, it can't happen.

666
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:25,674
It must be stopped at all costs.

667
00:41:31,714 --> 00:41:32,814
I'll buy it.

668
00:41:33,044 --> 00:41:35,414
Whether it's for 10 million or 100 million dollars, I'll buy it.

669
00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:38,714
Bring it right in front of me!

670
00:42:08,785 --> 00:42:10,555
Did you say to send Jang Ho Woo to your team?

671
00:42:10,884 --> 00:42:12,614
You heard me.

672
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:15,085
Tell him to be on time for the meeting tomorrow.

673
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:18,094
Is that all?

674
00:42:18,594 --> 00:42:20,394
I know he only graduated high school,

675
00:42:20,395 --> 00:42:22,225
but you still need to give me a reason.

676
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:24,894
You're not going to train him nor make use of him.

677
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,394
So why does it matter to you if I take him?

678
00:42:26,395 --> 00:42:27,805
He's just a graduate accountant.

679
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:32,805
I decide how we'll use him.

680
00:42:33,105 --> 00:42:34,444
I'm not going to say it twice.

681
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:36,105
Send him to me.

682
00:42:36,544 --> 00:42:38,174
Don't make anyone end up like you again.

683
00:42:49,254 --> 00:42:51,254
Why do you get to choose where I stay?

684
00:42:51,495 --> 00:42:54,193
Do I have to move and leave your team...

685
00:42:54,194 --> 00:42:56,194
upon your request?

686
00:42:56,395 --> 00:42:59,035
Do you not know what it means to be a salaryman?

687
00:42:59,864 --> 00:43:01,205
If you're trying to find out...

688
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:05,003
Director Sim Hyung Woo's bid price,

689
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:06,174
you should give up now.

690
00:43:07,205 --> 00:43:08,974
As an accountant,

691
00:43:08,975 --> 00:43:11,213
I'd never let that happen.

692
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,645
Or is it because you know nothing?

693
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:16,085
I'm leaving.

694
00:43:19,415 --> 00:43:21,124
I have an appointment with Gampyeong Corporation.

695
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:22,125
I don't have time to fool around with you.

696
00:43:22,126 --> 00:43:24,554
I was there for a reason.

697
00:43:24,555 --> 00:43:25,995
There's something I must do.

698
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:35,205
Why are you doing this to me?

699
00:43:35,805 --> 00:43:38,004
Why do you keep interrupting my plan?

700
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:41,875
If you stay there, you'll get hurt.

701
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:44,914
And you have no power...

702
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:46,714
or anyone who can help you get back on your feet.

703
00:43:47,745 --> 00:43:50,714
Once you fall down, your whole plan will go to waste.

704
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:00,265
What?

705
00:44:03,364 --> 00:44:04,535
What did he say?

706
00:44:05,064 --> 00:44:09,464
He said I had no power or anyone who could help me get back on my feet.

707
00:44:09,705 --> 00:44:10,804
How could he?

708
00:44:10,805 --> 00:44:14,074
Tell that lunatic that I'll give him a sound beating tomorrow.

709
00:44:14,075 --> 00:44:15,443
He dares to mess with Ho Woo?

710
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,974
I'll tell him to come here, and when he comes,

711
00:44:16,975 --> 00:44:19,244
I'll throw an uppercut on the count of two...

712
00:44:19,245 --> 00:44:20,285
Hey.

713
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:22,415
- Stay quiet. - Sorry.

714
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:25,514
I'll do it.

715
00:44:25,515 --> 00:44:28,125
I'll quit my job if I have to tomorrow.

716
00:44:28,924 --> 00:44:31,855
I'll smash that jerk's head.

717
00:44:32,024 --> 00:44:34,165
I'm serious.

718
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:41,805
"If you stay there, you'll get hurt."

719
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:44,904
It felt weird when he said that.

720
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:47,503
So? Did you find that romantic?

721
00:44:47,504 --> 00:44:48,544
Enough.

722
00:44:51,475 --> 00:44:52,475
Well,

723
00:44:52,944 --> 00:44:56,145
I could feel his sincerity.

724
00:44:57,455 --> 00:45:00,124
You shouldn't feel a man's sincerity that easily.

725
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,725
Seriously, you guys!

726
00:45:02,654 --> 00:45:05,554
How come you're never helpful to me ever?

727
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:08,225
Didn't I say this was the night of the plan?

728
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,233
Do you have the confidentiality agreement ready?

729
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:13,435
Yes, here it is.

730
00:45:17,435 --> 00:45:18,633
What about the financing plan report?

731
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,805
It'll be ready as soon as we receive the loan confirmation.

732
00:45:21,575 --> 00:45:23,745
Even at the lowest price,

733
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:26,043
the final price would be over 50.

734
00:45:26,044 --> 00:45:27,214
The bid price should be...

735
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:33,523
(Bidding Price, 58 million dollars)

736
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:36,325
(Bidding Price, 60.1 million dollars)

737
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:38,754
Have you confirmed the evaluation report on Banbo Assets?

738
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:40,564
Yes, I've confirmed it.

739
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:47,705
(Investor's Perspective)

740
00:45:48,035 --> 00:45:49,904
What do you think? I think it looks good.

741
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,044
Sure. Let's go with it.

742
00:45:56,714 --> 00:45:58,774
- Jang Ho Woo. - Yes?

743
00:46:10,924 --> 00:46:12,394
Did you leave the bidding price blank?

744
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:14,423
Yes, you said you'd write it when we got there.

745
00:46:14,424 --> 00:46:16,764
Don't forget all kinds of things happen on the day of bidding.

746
00:46:16,765 --> 00:46:17,935
Pull yourself together.

747
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:19,634
Yes.

748
00:46:31,814 --> 00:46:33,174
I said to pull yourself together.

749
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:44,995
Get ready.

750
00:47:10,785 --> 00:47:11,785
Darn it.

751
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:17,855
It looks like someone's here to greet us.

752
00:47:22,765 --> 00:47:23,765
How much time do we have left?

753
00:47:24,864 --> 00:47:25,864
About 40 minutes.

754
00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:26,495
Watch out.

755
00:48:51,884 --> 00:48:53,254
Are you okay?

756
00:48:53,384 --> 00:48:55,055
I'm okay.

757
00:48:56,085 --> 00:48:57,225
So is the proposal.

758
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:04,134
I guess there was one more car following us.

759
00:49:05,134 --> 00:49:07,605
It's the same model.

760
00:49:18,075 --> 00:49:19,714
Come out. Now!

761
00:49:22,015 --> 00:49:23,614
Who sent you? Answer me.

762
00:49:24,355 --> 00:49:25,814
I asked you a question!

763
00:49:26,415 --> 00:49:27,484
Was it Director Han?

764
00:49:27,955 --> 00:49:29,184
Answer me.

765
00:49:29,185 --> 00:49:30,954
- Answer me now... - Calm down.

766
00:49:30,955 --> 00:49:33,125
- Mr. Han. - Unhand me!

767
00:49:33,225 --> 00:49:34,395
Calm down, will you?

768
00:49:35,725 --> 00:49:37,165
Who sent you?

769
00:49:39,294 --> 00:49:41,204
He hit me first.

770
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:42,435
Stay right there.

771
00:49:45,475 --> 00:49:47,403
Jang Ho Woo, we have no time to waste here.

772
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:49,705
Head to Jisan Bank with the proposal first.

773
00:49:49,774 --> 00:49:51,575
You know we have to submit it on time.

774
00:49:51,745 --> 00:49:52,944
- Yes. - Hurry up.

775
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,464
What's wrong?

776
00:50:15,134 --> 00:50:16,134
What is it?

777
00:50:21,444 --> 00:50:22,805
The proposal is gone.

778
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:36,584
(J Bank NPL Bidding Proposal Submission)

779
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:37,625
What?

780
00:50:38,395 --> 00:50:39,995
The price isn't written?

781
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:44,535
Okay. Well done.

782
00:50:45,765 --> 00:50:46,794
All right.

783
00:50:47,564 --> 00:50:48,964
Let's hand it in now.

784
00:50:50,734 --> 00:50:51,734
What about them?

785
00:50:51,835 --> 00:50:53,305
I took care of it.

786
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:55,075
Come on. Let's hand it in.

787
00:50:55,544 --> 00:50:57,515
The bidding will end soon.

788
00:51:00,785 --> 00:51:01,785
Come on.

789
00:51:02,714 --> 00:51:03,884
Wait.

790
00:51:12,555 --> 00:51:16,194
Here is SA Investment's bidding proposal.

791
00:51:18,364 --> 00:51:20,093
(SA Investment)

792
00:51:20,094 --> 00:51:21,105
(Jang Ho Woo of Taeil Accounting)

793
00:51:26,435 --> 00:51:27,774
That is impossible.

794
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:36,214
(The proposal)

795
00:51:39,314 --> 00:51:40,855
(Jang Ho Woo)

796
00:51:57,435 --> 00:52:01,145
Police don't have the authority to block the road like this!

797
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:03,043
We've got a report.

798
00:52:03,044 --> 00:52:04,244
If you don't cooperate,

799
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:07,415
you'll be punished according to Article Five of the Traffic Law.

800
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:15,825
The report on the fallen object is settled.

801
00:52:16,225 --> 00:52:17,254
"A fallen object?"

802
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:18,955
What fallen object in this jurisdiction?

803
00:52:19,154 --> 00:52:20,224
Who are you?

804
00:52:20,225 --> 00:52:22,964
I was told jurisdiction does not matter when it comes to prevention.

805
00:52:25,835 --> 00:52:27,234
Hello.

806
00:52:30,504 --> 00:52:32,835
There is no one named Jang Ho Woo here.

807
00:52:33,274 --> 00:52:34,375
He'll be here soon.

808
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:35,575
I'm here!

809
00:52:37,674 --> 00:52:38,774
I am...

810
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:40,984
Jang Ho Woo.

811
00:52:41,785 --> 00:52:42,944
Here you are.

812
00:52:59,535 --> 00:53:00,664
Can you...

813
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:02,605
give us five minutes to discuss something?

814
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:13,074
Even this current price is ten million dollars higher...

815
00:53:13,075 --> 00:53:15,285
than the 60.1 million dollars I first suggested.

816
00:53:15,384 --> 00:53:17,043
If you raise the price,

817
00:53:17,044 --> 00:53:19,084
you're paying way more...

818
00:53:19,085 --> 00:53:21,125
than what you paid for People's Entertainment.

819
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:22,383
I know that.

820
00:53:22,384 --> 00:53:23,824
I know that too.

821
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:27,564
But when I think about Lee Sung Ju taking the log...

822
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:29,463
What if things go south with Bo Sung?

823
00:53:29,464 --> 00:53:31,035
What's the point of all this money?

824
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:35,265
Ninety million dollars. Write 90 million to be safe.

825
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:36,464
Chairman Lee.

826
00:53:36,605 --> 00:53:38,233
The current price is more than enough.

827
00:53:38,234 --> 00:53:40,173
You already have a high chance of winning the bid.

828
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:41,903
I'm not looking for a high chance.

829
00:53:41,904 --> 00:53:43,805
I need confidence.

830
00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:45,774
Write it.

831
00:53:49,915 --> 00:53:51,085
Here.

832
00:53:53,714 --> 00:53:54,725
(Bidding Proposal)

833
00:53:57,594 --> 00:53:59,694
(Bidding Price, 90.1 million dollars)

834
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,794
(Bidding Price, 90.1 million dollars)

835
00:54:04,964 --> 00:54:06,064
Darn it.

836
00:54:07,634 --> 00:54:10,435
Do you think he'd listen to you?

837
00:54:12,105 --> 00:54:14,245
If he wants to rave, let him.

838
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:18,844
The more Chairman Lee pays,

839
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:21,484
the more we'll get paid.

840
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:24,814
We have nothing to lose.

841
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,154
Don't you think?

842
00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:44,003
We'll now announce the minimum sales price...

843
00:54:44,004 --> 00:54:46,605
and the bidding prices.

844
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:50,814
The minimum sales price...

845
00:54:51,015 --> 00:54:52,874
is 54.6 million dollars.

846
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:55,584
- What happened? - Bids above 54.6 million...

847
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:56,813
- will win the bidding. - You said all kinds of things...

848
00:54:56,814 --> 00:54:57,915
happened on the day of the bidding.

849
00:54:58,314 --> 00:54:59,415
That's what.

850
00:55:02,685 --> 00:55:04,125
First Investment Trusts...

851
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:06,794
bids 54.9 million dollars.

852
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:12,364
Sang Ah Group Holdings bids 90.1 million dollars.

853
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:19,004
(Jisan Bank Non-performing Loan Sales Auction)

854
00:55:19,975 --> 00:55:21,104
Lastly,

855
00:55:21,105 --> 00:55:23,004
SA Investment.

856
00:55:25,674 --> 00:55:27,444
Thirty-three million dollars.

857
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,665
I hereby announce People's Entertainment's...

858
00:55:41,694 --> 00:55:44,935
eight non-performing loans are auctioned to Sang Ah Group Holdings.

859
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:55,774
(Jisan Bank Non-performing Loan Sales Auction)

860
00:56:02,844 --> 00:56:04,914
This is Han Seung Jo of Taeil Accounting.

861
00:56:04,915 --> 00:56:06,055
Chairman Lee Sung Ju.

862
00:56:06,884 --> 00:56:08,024
Someone just told me...

863
00:56:08,225 --> 00:56:11,254
that real power was making others move on their own...

864
00:56:11,355 --> 00:56:14,424
even without using their power.

865
00:56:14,725 --> 00:56:16,793
I think the only person who can make Chairman Lee Chan Ju move...

866
00:56:16,794 --> 00:56:18,835
just with imagination and fear is...

867
00:56:20,265 --> 00:56:22,064
you, Chairman Lee Sung Ju.

868
00:56:24,435 --> 00:56:26,435
So? You want to borrow my name?

869
00:56:27,475 --> 00:56:28,575
Yes.

870
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:31,415
Lee Chan Ju of SA Investment.

871
00:56:32,044 --> 00:56:33,314
I need that name.

872
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:39,714
Sounds good to me.

873
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,855
Just put it back to where it was after using it.

874
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:46,694
Everything goes back to where they were before.

875
00:56:47,254 --> 00:56:48,423
Thank you.

876
00:56:48,424 --> 00:56:51,134
I'm not interested in the entertainment business at all,

877
00:56:51,794 --> 00:56:53,464
but this is intriguing.

878
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:55,165
Especially...

879
00:56:55,734 --> 00:56:58,535
the owner's risk of spending company funds...

880
00:57:00,004 --> 00:57:01,774
for his personal reasons.

881
00:57:06,915 --> 00:57:08,145
I hope you win.

882
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:12,185
I'll win by losing.

883
00:57:19,294 --> 00:57:21,725
When he said 90.1 million dollars, I almost screamed.

884
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:34,605
Congratulations on winning the bid.

885
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:39,515
You would've still won with 60 million dollars.

886
00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:41,684
It must be because you're rich.

887
00:57:41,685 --> 00:57:42,915
Your bid was extreme.

888
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,154
I'm impressed.

889
00:58:09,205 --> 00:58:11,515
Take advantage of your opponent's weakness.

890
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:15,984
Well done.

891
00:58:16,915 --> 00:58:18,185
It was a good choice.

892
00:58:20,314 --> 00:58:23,024
My opponent will soon be you, Father.

893
00:58:25,395 --> 00:58:27,055
Oh, no.

894
00:58:28,524 --> 00:58:29,725
No way.

895
00:58:31,765 --> 00:58:33,694
No matter what you say today,

896
00:58:34,935 --> 00:58:38,274
it will not ruin my day.

897
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,273
Both as your father...

898
00:58:41,274 --> 00:58:44,245
and as the vice president of Taeil Accounting,

899
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:48,745
I'm satisfied.

900
00:58:54,654 --> 00:58:55,754
Right?

901
00:59:06,765 --> 00:59:08,064
Mr. Han.

902
00:59:11,634 --> 00:59:14,474
Is there an accountant from Taeil Accounting here?

903
00:59:14,475 --> 00:59:15,903
Yes, right here.

904
00:59:15,904 --> 00:59:19,774
You get your job done just perfectly.

905
00:59:20,915 --> 00:59:23,114
That's what he's known for.

906
00:59:23,515 --> 00:59:26,015
He points out...

907
00:59:26,185 --> 00:59:27,725
to the bottom line.

908
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,454
That's why everyone likes him.

909
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:33,325
I've already seen that in the case of Haebit Construction.

910
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:34,764
To be honest,

911
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:37,764
there were a lot of discussions...

912
00:59:37,765 --> 00:59:39,765
on whether we should make Haebit Construction close or not.

913
00:59:39,995 --> 00:59:43,834
Mr. Han Seung Jo, standing right here, concluded...

914
00:59:43,835 --> 00:59:45,504
that they should be closed.

915
00:59:45,805 --> 00:59:48,844
So we pushed to liquidation right away.

916
00:59:52,544 --> 00:59:53,544
Watch...

917
00:59:53,545 --> 00:59:55,544
what this piece of paper written by an accounting firm...

918
00:59:56,245 --> 00:59:57,984
can do from here on.

919
01:00:17,504 --> 01:00:19,174
- I'll get going. - Yes.

920
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:25,075
Shall we get going?

921
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,314
Why did you do that?

922
01:00:35,785 --> 01:00:36,884
What?

923
01:00:43,464 --> 01:00:44,765
About Haebit Construction.

924
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:55,145
Why did you make the decision...

925
01:00:55,404 --> 01:00:57,274
to liquidate the company?

926
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,844
One's life isn't a joke.

927
01:01:05,055 --> 01:01:06,285
How could you?

928
01:01:44,955 --> 01:01:46,924
(Numbers)

929
01:01:47,424 --> 01:01:49,994
The report on Haebit Construction liquidation decision.

930
01:01:49,995 --> 01:01:51,164
Where is it now?

931
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,863
Han Seung Jo will be in charge of this project,

932
01:01:53,864 --> 01:01:55,563
and I should be a backup manager.

933
01:01:55,564 --> 01:01:56,764
Where's the rest?

934
01:01:56,765 --> 01:01:59,273
Do you want to see it? Then work on my team.

935
01:01:59,274 --> 01:02:00,903
It's not about trusting each other.

936
01:02:00,904 --> 01:02:03,443
This is a strategic alliance to achieve our own goals.

937
01:02:03,444 --> 01:02:05,213
Because selling it will bring more money...

938
01:02:05,214 --> 01:02:06,244
than keeping it alive.

939
01:02:06,245 --> 01:02:07,543
You think it's fun to play with me?

940
01:02:07,544 --> 01:02:10,745
Did you get something in return for liquidation?

941
01:02:10,785 --> 01:02:13,254
How much more do I have to sell to make you happy?

942
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,684
Your best decision is...

943
01:02:14,685 --> 01:02:17,355
creating the worst decision for others.

944
01:02:17,455 --> 01:02:19,725
I won't let you live in peace...

945
01:02:19,995 --> 01:02:22,794
as if nothing happened until now.
