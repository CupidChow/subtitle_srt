1
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,240
   

2
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:44,130


3
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,680
Should you be drinking when you don't feel well?

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,400
Oh, I feel fine. This is just something I took out while cleaning.

5
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,270
Is it okay if I stay here for a while?

6
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,080
Of course, you are welcome to...

7
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,830
- Just for a while? 
 - Yes.

8
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,580
Until I finish those bottles of wine over there.

9
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,320
I thought you might be struggling a lot and have a tough time.

10
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,060
I'm here to protect you.

11
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,190
Whatever it took, even from a distance,

12
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,610
I wanted to be the one to protect you.

13
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,480
"From a distance"?

14
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,250
From a distance...

15
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,590
Even my dad can protect me from a distance.

16
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,400
I wish I could have gone with you.

17
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,640
I know you're also working late, Ms. Yeon Ah.

18
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,100
It's not a hard inspection so I'll come help you if I finish early.

19
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,240
Okay, got it.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,400
   

21
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,030
Even for a paper company...

22
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,300
   

23
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,190
Oh, hey...

24
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,420
A-Are you okay?

25
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,390
W-Wait, Ahjussi!

26
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,450
Ahjussi!

27
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,080
H-Hello!

28
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,500
Is anyone there?

29
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,950
A-Ahjussi! Please wake up! Ahjussi!

30
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,750
Ahjussi!

31
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,270
   

32
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,280
Investigators.

33
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,560
   

34
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,570
- Guardian! 
 - That's me!

35
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,780
So that man is Yoon Moo Il...

36
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,170
What happened to my father?

37
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,180
The situation is extreme so please fill the consent form first.

38
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,600
 As you've ordered, I'll take care of it on time. 

39
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,560
And also...

40
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,680
Any other orders?

41
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,150
Later. I will talk to you about it again.

42
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,360
- Good work. 
 -  Okay. 

43
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,040
Thank you.

44
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,430
At the moment, the patient...

45
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,580
is unconscious.

46
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,710
We'll keep an eye on the progress.

47
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,910
This isn't the first time.

48
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,650
He's been suffering from depression for a long time.

49
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,370
Ever since the collapse accident where you lost your parents,

50
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,770
he's been suffering from guilt.

51
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,520
"From guilt"?

52
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,800
My father visits this memorial park sometimes. 
    

53
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,000
I thought you might be seeking this.

54
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,830
All this time,

55
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,600
I couldn't let my guard down.

56
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,890
Thank you...

57
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,790
for saving my father.

58
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,230
   

59
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,820
 Honey! No! 

60
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,720
   

61
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,780
 I ran out alone in the darkness. 

62
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,050
 I ran endlessly toward the only ray of light. 

63
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:56,250
 I had a family. 

64
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,840
 Thanks to these people, the road was opening up to wherever it leads. 

65
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,570
   

66
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,560
Congratulations on becoming the partner accountant of Taeil Accounting.

67
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,070
Well, the other partners have already agreed so you just need to sign.

68
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:36,550
You came up with a surprise solution like a bank consortium,

69
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,870
but I guess you didn't even anticipate this.

70
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,330
But I still haven't...

71
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,130
I'm putting you in charge since you are well qualified.

72
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,660
I also want to prevent other accounting firms taking you away.

73
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,210
From now on, Jisan Bank

74
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,260
will listen and follow whatever Han Seung Jo says.

75
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,060
And the reputation of saving a bank from crisis

76
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,820
will always be the brand of Accountant Han Seung Jo.

77
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,540
Aigoo. Well.

78
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,720
Hello.

79
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,010
I am very glad that the bank is quickly back to business as usual.

80
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,750
It's all thanks to you, Accountant Han Seung Jo.

81
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,940
If it wasn't for the bank consortium that you formed,

82
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,710
it would have been impossible.

83
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,990
- You flatter me. 
 - I am only saying reality.

84
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,140
Oh, I also heard some good news,

85
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,110
that you're becoming a partner.

86
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,160
Congratulations.

87
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,090
Thank you.

88
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,880
Also, I heard from my daughter

89
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,840
about a very popular visual (good looks) in Taeil.

90
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,170
Gosh, I'm not...

91
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,420
From what I saw a few days ago,

92
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,350
he sure is quite the looker.

93
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,320
Hello, Mr. President.

94
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,390
Aigoo. We meet again.

95
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,880
I guess it wasn't me.

96
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,630
When you came to Jisan Bank last time,

97
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:29,110
what was it that you said, Accountant Jang Ho Woo?

98
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,500
To prepare for something like a bank run,

99
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,800
I suggested making an offer to increase receivable loan programs

100
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,480
and the limit from Hanguk Bank (Central Bank of Korea).

101
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,180
Oh, I see.

102
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,120
Do you mind if I ask why?

103
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,170
If you sell your bonds at a bargain price, cash will circulate right away,

104
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,090
but it would ultimately be a loss for the bank.

105
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:59,160
Instead, I thought if the government lends enough funds with bonds as collateral,

106
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,730
it would serve to protect the bond price

107
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:05,600
and minimize the loss to the bank.

108
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,930
I understand.

109
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,920
Now that I've left Taeil,

110
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,490
let's move to another position.

111
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,660
Yes, understood. I will take care of it promptly.

112
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,810
First, move into the banking arena and slowly increase his presence.

113
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,080
It's not a bad idea.

114
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,570
I heard the team members there all turned against the accountant in charge.

115
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,820
- How come? 
 - If it's early mornings or weekends,

116
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,410
he would ask, "Accountant, can you turn on your laptop?"

117
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,570
 I also worked while on vacation last year. 

118
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,220
 Gosh. That's really the worst. 

119
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,720
 Gosh... 

120
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,980
Are you okay or pretending to be fine?

121
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,690
What do you mean?

122
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,640
No matter how defeated you feel since your goal vanished overnight,

123
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,690
don't you think I'd notice you were spaced out the last few days?

124
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,140
I heard you went to visit your parents.

125
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,040
Yes, I have.

126
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,990
Are you okay, Director Han?

127
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,080
I'm not fine, but not bad.

128
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,830
Maybe it's because he's still my father.

129
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,780
I guess I'm doing better than you are.

130
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,210
I've finished all I came to do.

131
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,390
Then work, you punk. You must earn your keep. Haven't you an assignment?

132
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,560
No, I do.

133
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,930
Don't mock me. How dare you leave when a senior's talking to you?

134
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,520
You need to do as you're told!

135
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,220
Did you meet just to act like this?

136
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,420
- What do you mean by "like this"? 
 - Sure, sure.

137
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,020
Oh, yes. Did you see Jang Ho Woo returned?

138
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,460
Return? Didn't he go on a business trip?

139
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,240
"Business trip"? I heard he was absent without leave.

140
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,770
What? Wow...

141
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,490
Not only does an accountant die, the Deals Department is so dysfunctional.

142
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:20,850
So why did Jang Ho Woo do that?

143
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,330
It's obvious.

144
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,100
He likely left for being mistreated as just a high-school grad.

145
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,910
So why did he come back?

146
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,420
 Where else could he go? What could high school graduates do anyway? 

147
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,850
Running errands... The money voucher–

148
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,660
What if he is a high school grad?

149
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,650
He's better and works harder than you guys.

150
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,910
Pain!

151
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,820
You never bothered to work, and now you're complaining...

152
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,310
Work on improving yourselves, not badmouthing others.

153
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,730
- Get going. 
 - Yes.

154
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,310
Let's go.

155
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,130
Anyway, that audit team...

156
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,580
- What's up? 
 - It's nothing.

157
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,730
Yes, I brought it.

158
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,810
Goodness...

159
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,310
I put in lots of care making this. So enjoy.

160
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,350
Yes, thank you for the meal.

161
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,840
- Aigoo. 
 - This is so tasty.

162
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,450
Don't be tense. Relax and eat.

163
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,740
Relax today.

164
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,760
How will you two live going forward? Where will you be living together?

165
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,340
How many children will you have? Such questions...

166
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,220
Don't think about any of that while you're eating.

167
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,000
Gosh, eat comfortably.

168
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,220
Yes, sorry about that.

169
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,030
Aigoo, it slid down the wrong pipe.

170
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,490
How does it feel now it's all resolved? Are you relieved?

171
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,820
I thought I would be.

172
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,100
But I still don't know.

173
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,500
I'm not sure what I need to do moving forward.

174
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,750
Let's ponder it together,

175
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,010
very slowly.

176
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,090
What?

177
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,780
Geez, you scared me. What the heck?

178
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,500
Look, Ho Woo.

179
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,400
Yes?

180
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,710
What exactly am I seeing right now?

181
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,410
What about it? She looks nice, very pretty.

182
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:20,150
In official terms, you call that "excessive packaging" or "false advertising," right?

183
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,180
Hey.

184
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,810
Go ahead, admit your own crimes and reach a friendly agreement with the poor blind date–

185
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,930
You get over here.

186
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,620
You think your blind date would want to see that kind of–

187
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,920
Hey, you think you'd go on a date–

188
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,710
Jang Ho Woo! Listen to how he talks to me!

189
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,210
Yeo Jin.

190
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:57,750
With Ho Woo... it's as if we've been joined at the hip and lived together under one roof.

191
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,340
I am aware.

192
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,440
Mr. Ho Woo asked me to help pick out a gift a woman would like.

193
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,500
I heard it then.

194
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,450
But you know...

195
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,360
Yes?

196
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,990
Ho Woo and I are really close so how come...

197
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,770
you're not jealous?

198
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,350
Jealous...

199
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,720
Never mind.

200
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,570
The reason I asked to meet today

201
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,130
is to ask why you, who has everything,

202
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,280
like Ho Woo...

203
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:42,890
Since I have a bank-president father, do you think I have more in my possession or have lost more?

204
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,080
Some things I've never even had.

205
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,340
If you will say things you've never had

206
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,220
are true friends or something like that–

207
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,760
Since you've always had those friends by your side,

208
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,260
isn't that why you can say that?

209
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,830
Yeo Jin.

210
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,050
Your life without those two friends...

211
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,170
Have you ever considered it? Even once?

212
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,060
 Hey, you a**holes! 

213
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,530
 Ho Woo... 

214
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,770
 Hey, will you make me go to the police station again? 
   

215
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,050
 That hurts. 

216
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,230
No one has everything in life.

217
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,890
There is no easy life either.

218
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,840
Was there no proposal?

219
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,690
- Hasn't he even asked you out? 
 - Right.

220
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,030
- So you don't know when you started dating? 
 - Yes.

221
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,180
Gosh, this stupid idiot.

222
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,680
- Why are you dating him? 
 - Was he always like this since young?

223
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,260
Well...

224
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,460
I guess he was.

225
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,260
So he's never been in a relationship before?

226
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,060
That was a secret...

227
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,110
Aigoo.

228
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,320
Although the sentence came out longer than anticipated, we agreed not to appeal.

229
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,010
If suspension of enforcement or special pardon is granted during an appeal,

230
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,720
it would be difficult to set a date for various reasons.

231
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,870
So not even chaebols go for that.

232
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,600
How about the data?

233
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,410
Here you go.

234
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,940
   

235
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,700
How about the people participating in the bid?

236
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,950
These are possible candidates.

237
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,310
   

238
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,900
Let's proceed.

239
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,020
Got it.

240
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,100
I know better about improving investment efficiency.

241
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,700
If you serve here a short while, it makes you appear as paying for the charges.

242
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,560
You won't have to bother about the same charges ever again.

243
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,540
An urgent issue arose, and I must discuss it with you.

244
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,510
There is a name lender whom I couldn't contact for the past few days.

245
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,910
   

246
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,810
 You can't even call it managing: 

247
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:16,850
 My dad just turns on and off the lights once or twice a day. 

248
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,270
 As you may know, he's no different than a doorman for a name-only company. 

249
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,090
Hi, Yeo Jin. The man who attempted suicide...

250
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,740
How's the police investigation going?

251
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,840
Yes.

252
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,200
Starting from outside activities that can be seen as economic actions?

253
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,930
It's a paper company that requested an inspection. 
    

254
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,370
   

255
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,620
Let's close the case on the unconscious man who attempted suicide.

256
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,050
- All right. 
 - No special remarks, right?

257
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,220
- No, nothing. 
 - Okay.

258
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,770
Yes?

259
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,490
What did you say?

260
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,930
The name of the CEO is Yoon Moo Il?

261
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,780
   

262
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,310
Hello, Prosecutor Min Soo Hyun.

263
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,820
Come in.

264
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,710
What's this?

265
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,670
It's Jaehan Holding's info I received from Prosecutor Min Soo Hyun. 
    

266
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,480
- Yoon Moo Il is the CEO. 
 - "Jaehan Holdings."

267
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,190
It's the paper company I visited,

268
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,200
a trading company that imports foreign goods and sells them in Korea.

269
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,400
The way they run their business is a bit odd.

270
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,690
While sending payment for the goods abroad without fail, there are no imported items.

271
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,930
Isn't that strange?

272
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,580
- And? 
 - The documents are perfect:

273
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,490
an operating profit earned by selling goods

274
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,110
and a warehouse cost for storing imported goods.

275
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,940
But you still say it's an odd transaction?

276
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,000
- A hundred percent. 
 - What's your reason?

277
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,860
When a loaded ship arrives,

278
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,050
you need workers to unpack every box inside the container

279
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,340
as you unload the container.

280
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,720
That unloading fee is missing.

281
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,190
If you bring in workers in weather like this,

282
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,650
you would have to pay quite a price.

283
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,140
How do you know all this?

284
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,060
I should know as a Hamba (construction site restaurant) grandson.

285
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,090
A restaurant is there too.

286
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,320
They've twisted it 2-3 times to make it seem a normal business

287
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,850
and created an irregular cash-withdrawal pattern.

288
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,690
It took a lot of work to plan it to this extent.

289
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,320
Are you curious who it might be?

290
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,300
It must be my father if it's done to this extent.

291
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,100
You're right.

292
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,180
It's Han Je Gyun's borrowed-name account.

293
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,480
Prosecutor.

294
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,170
- This is the data from Financial Intelligence Unit, right? 
 - Yes, it is.

295
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,930
   

296
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,290
How did no one realize that such a large amount of money went overseas?

297
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:22,380
Since there was no problem with the promised payments,

298
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,310
everyone would have thought it was a normal transaction.

299
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,680
I guess...

300
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,510
I've heard that they send slush funds overseas in that way.

301
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,810
I wonder if this is simply slush funds siphoned abroad.

302
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,330
 Next, we have some unfortunate news. 

303
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,860
 Harbor City Bank, which mainly dealt with initial loans 

304
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,260
 for promising startups to enter the global market, 

305
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,140
 has gone bankrupt due to a bank run. 
   

306
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,920
"Bankrupt due to a bank run"?

307
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,960
   

308
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,770
Why the long face?

309
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,640
It's an overseas bank. Take a look.

310
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,470
   

311
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,560
I'm not the only one who's got the hunch, right?

312
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,100
No.

313
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,320
   

314
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,770
   

315
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,980
Good work. Congratulations on being pardoned.

316
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,670
It's a report on HK Private Equity Fund entering Korea. 
    

317
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,530
I see, and the results?

318
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,940
I am taking action now.

319
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,440
Let's go.

320
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,060
Has V.P. Han Je Gyun been pardoned?

321
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,650
- What a letdown. 
 - I know, right?

322
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,460
Gathering every bit of evidence nearly killed everyone here.

323
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,210
I knew he wasn't any ordinary man,

324
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,190
but isn't he more like a phoenix (mythical bird)?

325
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,850
There were more than enough allegations.

326
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:23,060
Let's say he could get away with all other charges, but how could he

327
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,070
be acquitted from allegations of murder?

328
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,440
 I've never given orders before. 

329
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,190
 All I've done was give appropriate opinions. 

330
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,050
 If you can't believe that, why don't you reread the texts I've sent you? 

331
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,640
 V.P. Han Je Gyun always used a method. 

332
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,310
He never made direct orders.

333
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,970
He set the stage in that way

334
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,830
and until he had it his way,

335
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,710
he pressured the opponent.

336
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,620
In order for it to be ineffective as evidence,

337
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,850
Han Je Gyun calculated meticulously from the start

338
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,390
so they can't prove the allegations.

339
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,120
Starting from Sangha's bad construction

340
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,950
to the slush funds, warehouse fire, and the murder solicitation,

341
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,120
he could drive them all

342
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,940
by excessive loyalty of the people under him.

343
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,440
And he was saying crap like "noblesse oblige"?

344
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,250
Wow, I'm getting goosebumps.

345
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,630
Going to jail actually allowed him to get an exemption.

346
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,130
"An exemption"?

347
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,590
A crime once punished cannot be held liable again.

348
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,760
So going to jail just for that little while reset all his crimes?

349
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,730
He didn't even appeal...

350
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,550
I knew something was odd.

351
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,300
It's not as if he'd changed.

352
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,280
So he wasn't admitting his mistakes and repenting.

353
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,620
I think he knew

354
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,230
that he would be released

355
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,330
from the beginning.

356
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,240
I see.

357
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,480
Thank you very much for your consideration.

358
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,310
Of course, it was all thanks to you.

359
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,260
All right, I will talk to you again next time we meet.

360
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,050
So the work on Jaehan Holdings

361
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,470
- was taken care of? 
 - Yes.

362
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,620
Though the name lender, who disappeared for some time, attempted suicide,

363
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,690
it's been confirmed that it's not life-threatening.

364
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,040
Who said I was interested in that kind of crap?

365
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,430
I'm discussing the borrowed-name account.

366
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,710
As long as the numbers add up,

367
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,340
nothing else really matters.

368
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,570
I got it.

369
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,430
I will keep that in mind.

370
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:07,430
A while ago, a large scale of foreign currency was moved overseas.

371
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,010
I had asked Ms. Yeon Ah to look out just in case.

372
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,630
The money that was moved–

373
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,010
It must have been the bank acquisition funds.

374
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,920
For a bank to go bankrupt due to a bank run

375
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,840
is uncommon, right?

376
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,430
A bank run caused by management's incompetence and ethics is not common either.

377
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,130
This would mean that Han Je Gyun is behind all this.

378
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,880
If he did it once, he won't stop twice.

379
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,340
Check the current time then deposit

380
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,180
the contract down payment.

381
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,200
What are you trying to do right now?

382
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,700
I just wondered...

383
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,760
if you'd serve as a right-hand man for one who isn't a current Taeil V.P.

384
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,210
but who's been to jail.

385
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,210
I don't think I have a reason to answer that.

386
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,440
While you were away, Joyce Jang has left

387
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,760
and the rate of return for HK Private Equity Fund is as shown.

388
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,620
Besides that, the significant market change

389
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,430
is the bank consortium that Accountant Han Seung Jo has formed.

390
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,640
It receives quite a favorable evaluation,

391
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,840
but the stability of banks that have joined the consortium and those that have not

392
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,130
shows a big difference.

393
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,030
Among banks that were excluded from the bank federation,

394
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,860
I guess I'll have to pick the next target.

395
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,660
I was thinking maybe Hosu Bank?

396
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,800
Yes, understood.

397
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,050
Did you hear V.P. Han Je Gyun will enter the bidding for the purchase of Hosu Bank?

398
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,080
I did.

399
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,640
It's not even up for sale yet...

400
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,040
It will be a challenge to face him if we dare.

401
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,190
Why he bought the overseas bank was for this reason.

402
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:47,430
He will buy domestic banks through foreign banks.

403
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,460
Pardon?

404
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,740
Since a bank can buy a bank fairly easily.

405
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,500
So that's why he bought Harbor City Bank...

406
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,520
Then doesn't he have another chance at

407
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,080
the Major Shareholder Qualification Review that failed?

408
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,950
   

409
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,680
We'll have to wait and see.

410
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,290
It appears V.P. Han Je Gyun...

411
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,530
wasn't just sitting still in prison.

412
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,620
Yes.

413
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,000
Let's talk in person.

414
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,910
- What is it? 
 - Follow me.

415
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,660
What is it?

416
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,230
V.P. Han Je Gyun will wait until Hosu Bank is in jeopardy.

417
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:45,450
He will seek how to influence the masses while checking the bank's non-performing loan ratio.

418
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,660
What must we do in a situation like this?

419
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,010
You should join the bank consortium.

420
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,660
It will be difficult for Hosu Bank to withstand it on its own.

421
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,340
It's a system that can protect each other

422
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,670
so it's good to join it.

423
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,700
Since you're working with Hosu Bank, 
    

424
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,180
can you find out one more thing for me? 
    

425
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,470
- What is it? 
 - A checking account.

426
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,850
It seems there's a borrowed-name account in this bank as well.

427
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,920
Is there a borrowed-name account here as well?

428
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,060
Yes.

429
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,930
Han Je Gyun's paper company and borrowed-name account

430
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,780
were all under Yoon Moo Il.

431
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,330
What borrowed-name account?

432
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:31,320
You must be hearing this for the first time.

433
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,200
If it's my dad's account, I handle it all with online banking so there's no way.

434
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,170
It's a security account,

435
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,130
also known as a stealth account,

436
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,940
just like a stealth jet that isn't picked up by enemy radar.

437
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,990
 You can't check it through the Internet or mobile banking, 

438
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:53,240
 and it can only be found by personally visiting the bank safe, applying, and inquiring. 

439
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,780
 Even the taxes are taken care of by them. 

440
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,030
 So of course, you wouldn't know about it. 

441
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,670
If the account holder is in a coma, will the account be frozen?

442
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:12,420
Whatever the state of the account holder, he has to go to the bank himself to retrieve the account.

443
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,390
The account holder must be declared dead for the funds to pass on as inheritance.

444
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,310
Then the funds in the borrowed-name account can't be touched by anyone?

445
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,370
That's right.

446
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,660
There's probably a 911 record.

447
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,210
Since the police were dispatched, an accident report would have also been filed.

448
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:31,850
Since also medical records say he is in a coma, naturally–

449
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,760
The bank account must be suspended as well.

450
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,080
It must be quite a headache for V.P. Han Je Gyun.

451
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,010
I understand what you're saying.

452
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,890
The funds are frozen?

453
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,640
I'm sorry.

454
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,920
It's fine. There is always a way.

455
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,680
Don't worry about it, and just prepare... for the bid.

456
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,390
Yes.

457
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,140
You may leave.

458
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,750
Okay.

459
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,660
So is this how it's going to be?

460
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,440
- It's been a while. 
 - Yes.

461
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,430
Here.

462
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,020
What is this?

463
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,250
I heard you were contacting banks starting with Hosu Bank.

464
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,640
These are documents demonstrating

465
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,250
our desire to apply for membership to the bank consortium,

466
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,500
and necessary documents for the application.

467
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,520
We should join, even if it's a bit late. 
    

468
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,970
Other banks have finished their preparations or are in the process

469
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,560
so we've rushed to get it done as well.

470
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,450
   

471
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,830
It's already in the process.

472
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:08,600
They think that we contacted them first.

473
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,360
The other places are the same.

474
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,200
Who could it be if it was not you or me?

475
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,790
I called, and it wasn't Ji Soo, either.

476
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,200
We managed to buy some time and could relax a little.

477
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,480
But I'm curious who it was.

478
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,960
Who persuaded the small and medium-sized banks to join the consortium?

479
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,810
No one else besides us would do this, predicting my father's actions.

480
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,850
Still, the fact other people besides us...

481
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:37,650
In any case, this is a good thing for the banks,

482
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,880
but he's not someone to defeat so easily.

483
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,980
   

484
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:01,230
Are you sure V.P. Han Je Gyun is entering the bidding for the purchase of Booheung Securities?

485
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,720
I'm sure.

486
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,550
How much time do we have left before the bidding?

487
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,810
Fifty minutes.

488
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,350
It's good that we found out the bidding time is today.

489
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,420
V.P. Han Je Gyun wouldn't be one to give up

490
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,760
just because the banks have joined the consortium.

491
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,390
But still...

492
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,290
I couldn't foresee him targeting a securities company (buy and sell stocks).

493
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,140
What are you doing right now?

494
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,060
Are you really trying to take this all the way?

495
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,910
I came so we don't take this all the way.

496
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,070
While V.P. Han Je Gyun was in prison,

497
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:57,090
this setup work was for the foreign bank to enter the domestic market,

498
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,750
and the projects for future pursuit.

499
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,710
First, take these. There's no time to idle like this.

500
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,370
   

501
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,110
Why are you suddenly doing this now?

502
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,960
We must stop the bidding that's coming up right now

503
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,590
in order to stop V.P. Han Je Gyun.

504
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,070
   

505
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,430
Here is the financial plan from Mr. Woo Sang Hyun.

506
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,450
   

507
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,030
   

508
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,270
   

509
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,140
"Financing plan"?

510
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,490
Every major financial holding company in our country has a stock company (ownership shares).

511
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,310
It's just a matter of which one he obtains first since he wants both stock firms and banks.

512
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,860
So V.P. Han Je Gyun is trying to obtain both, starting with the stock firm, I see.

513
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:23,680
But even if he wants a stock firm, he wouldn't have spare funds since he just failed in buying Jisan Bank.

514
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,460
You know, not many people in this country can resolve

515
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,270
the issue of special bonds.

516
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,780
Not only that, he can change the relationships between people with money.

517
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,600
He's been busier in prison than when he was outside.

518
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,760
He had much more contact with people in the banks as well.

519
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,090
Still, thanks to you smuggling away the financing plan,

520
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,030
I suppose his plan to purchase a stock firm will fail now.

521
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,610
Don't let your guard down.

522
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:51,340
He likely ran simulations in his mind daily while in prison

523
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,520
and made every sort of preparation.

524
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,980
He knows he can take over this country if he can own banks

525
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,710
so he won't ever stop

526
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,870
until banks are in his hands.

527
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,430
   

528
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,440
You should be able to prove his borrowed-name accounts with that.

529
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,350
We can't stop V.P. Han Je Gyun completely,

530
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,770
but it should cripple him for now.

531
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,630
This is the end of what I can do.

532
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,600
But will you be okay?

533
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,330
The repercussions will be very severe.

534
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,340
I started this as a result of

535
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,440
Director Shim Hyung Woo's death.

536
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,000
I expected...

537
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,690
that level of effect from the start.

538
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,240
That is why you went to V.P. Han Je Gyun's side...

539
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,220
Since he's a formidable foe,

540
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,550
I needed to seize the perfect opportunity.

541
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,060
In order to gain V.P. Han Je Gyun's trust,

542
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,140
I had no choice but to become his man.

543
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,810
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

544
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,870
 Then what will happen to that guy, Yoon Moo Il? 

545
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,050
 He will suffer heavy damages, starting with his taxes. 

546
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,560
First, we'll need to repair his financial damages.

547
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,710
To help him be safe once he wakes up,

548
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,710
we'll need to provide his personal protection.

549
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,310
- How will you manage all that? 
  - Don't you think everything has a way? 

550
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:33,700
First, he'll have to report himself for the "trust" (hold title for another).

551
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,740
Oh, right, there was that.

552
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,380
He will likely face a heavy gift tax, but that money wasn't Yoon Moo Il's anyway.

553
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,570
What is that?

554
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,940
A report of illegal concealed assets.

555
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,160
Money like this should be handed over

556
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,750
to the government by law.

557
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,080
 He destroyed it by what? 

558
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,270
What did I tell you?

559
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,170
He became an accountant because things worked out for him.  If things were a bit different–

560
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,410
If things were a bit different, what?

561
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:45,280
If things were a bit different, you would have been in and out of here for bad crimes.

562
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,980
You've become a human being thanks to me.

563
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,240
Me?

564
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,510
That's right.

565
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,760
You should be grateful, Man.

566
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,090
I'll call you later.

567
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,280
All the documents that he's gathered have disappeared.

568
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,710
And he cannot use any money in his borrowed-name accounts now.

569
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,620
♫  I still hope you're coming  ♫

570
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,590
♫  I still hope you'll come back home  ♫

571
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,780
This is Han Je Gyun.

572
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,220
 Eat and sleep well even when I'm not here. 

573
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,490
 Don't forget to take care of your blood sugar. 

574
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,630
 I'll be back soon. 

575
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,610
   

576
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,960
   
   

577
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,910
   

578
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:01,700
   

579
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,120
   

580
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,020
New Staff, please follow me in two lines.

581
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,500
You know an accounting firm is divided into three departments.

582
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,650
The tax department handles tax-related issues between the corporation and its owners.

583
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,970
The audit department handles audits and accounting transparency for the corporation.

584
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:22,670
And this office space 3 is for the deals department.

585
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,630
- We'll move to the meeting room now. 
 - Gosh, time flies.

586
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,920
To think Mr. Jang Ho Woo is the associate in charge of new staff.

587
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,190
Here is the conference room where you will work on the project you are assigned.

588
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:38,730
And here is the copying room.

589
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,690
You will be coming to the copying room quite often.

590
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,950
And this is the file storage room.

591
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,990
Here, you can open various types of files, and when your case is completed,

592
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,350
you will place them in a file cabinet, as you can see.

593
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:58,940
And here is Office 3 for the deals department managers.

594
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:05,580
All the other business-related work aside from the tax and auditing are considered part of our deals department.

595
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,870
It handles everything from corporate workouts to M and A, the sale of assets,

596
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,110
corporate investments, and even providing financial advice.

597
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,370
Have you participated in any, Sir?

598
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,400
Well, in a few.

599
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,090
Are you from Hanguk University? Or from Myeongin University?

600
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,030
Pardon?

601
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,590
Do you want to go to the new staff orientation together, happening later in the auditorium?

602
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,750
I'm not a new staff. I'm a manager.

603
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,410
Then shall we move to the next location?

604
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:13,640
♫  The time flows only for me  ♫

605
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:21,580
♫  You have stopped moving all alone  ♫

606
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:29,440
♫  The words "I miss you" float in the air  ♫

607
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:35,030
♫  And come to me like a miracle  ♫

608
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:44,530
♫  I imagine sometimes  ♫

609
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:52,520
♫  I wonder what you look like now  ♫

610
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,610
♫  Perhaps...  ♫

611
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,810
 There's no reason to make our child unhappy as well. 

612
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,430
 If he was a bit older, maybe. 

613
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,450
 I told him that Daddy loves Joseph a lot, 

614
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,050
 but he was too busy. 

615
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:14,390
♫  Let's meet again  ♫

616
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,290
 So I bought a lot of presents to make up for it. 

617
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,290
♫  I'll hug you  ♫

618
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,320
Why were you so busy, Dad?

619
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,170
I know. Why was I so busy? I'm sorry.

620
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:40,190
♫  Since we will be together; we'll be together forever  ♫

621
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,090
♫  Remember you  ♫

622
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:45,230
   

623
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,620
How long will you make your dad come to work by himself?

624
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,710
Did you act like an old fogey? And so the others don't play with you?

625
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,150
That's not what I'm saying!

626
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,850
I'm asking how long you will stay at Taeil.

627
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:02,230
I see. I wondered what you mean.

628
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,980
Your dad isn't like his old self anymore.

629
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,850
I want someone I can trust next to me and–

630
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:11,840
I don't want to.

631
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,210
What?

632
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,710
Well, I'm not really interested in banks.

633
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,590
What's wrong with banks?

634
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:23,990
If you want me to tell you all the reasons I don't like banks, you couldn't go home today.

635
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,540
Shall I say it?

636
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,250
So you're saying you'll stay at Taeil?

637
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,210
For that guy who's supposed to be the visual of the accounting firm?

638
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:38,620
What are you saying? Dating is dating, and work is work.

639
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,910
Dad, I think I'll go into venture capital (private investor).

640
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,690
It will be fun to start new work and give others opportunities.

641
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,870
I think it would feel good to know my knowledge

642
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:53,900
isn't being used defensively but to help the world.

643
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,140
Well, it's also profitable and that's good too.

644
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,910
So...

645
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,370
I forbid you to mention a blind date again.

646
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,020
I'm leaving.

647
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,150
About that blind date...

648
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:13,850
I don't think you need to go on it.

649
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,120
That guy who's the visual of the accounting firm,

650
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,670
the one who visited me last time with you,

651
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,580
well... he seemed quite decent.

652
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,140
Do you mean it?

653
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,780
What part? What about him seemed decent?

654
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,230
Well, first, his visuals are decent enough.

655
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,770
His looks aren't decent; he's handsome!

656
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:41,420
And?

657
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,910
Noona Ji Soo should be coming soon.

658
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,480
If it's Unnie Ji Soo's son, is he my nephew?

659
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,700
Hey. Who says he's your nephew?

660
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,380
He probably will hate to call you Aunt.

661
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,310
Gosh! So gross.

662
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,960
Hee Sam.

663
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,780
When did you have the time to file a patent while you were running your business?

664
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:05,920
Aigoo, gosh.

665
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,250
He's smart.

666
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,810
Aigoo, he's smart.

667
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:16,510
It's just the start of my bucket list. I've still got a long way to go.

668
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,220
   

669
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,080
Mr. Ho Woo.

670
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:56,380
Were you reading a report?

671
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,060
But why didn't you turn the lights on?

672
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,140
   

673
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:06,130
Are you... starting again?

674
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,610
Who turned on the lights here?

675
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,070
 Yes, there are no issues here. 

676
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,170
   

677
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:56,020
Ms. Son Hye Won. Current business sales, management status, executives, staff...

678
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,880
and bookkeeping, did you organize everything?

679
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,220
Telling me to do this and that...

680
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,420
Do you think that I'm still your staff?

681
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:07,470
We are now partners.

682
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,620
Okay, did I say otherwise?

683
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,560
Now your eyes are better,

684
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:16,360
make some nice coffee while I use the bathroom.

685
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,970
Mr. Partner.

686
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,480
Yes.

687
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,250
- What am I to do with you? 
 - What the...

688
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,050
- I tested myself just in case... 
 - Why are you hitting me?

689
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,750
You're not a husband. You're an enemy!

690
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,820
- Geez! It's your fault! 
 - Tell me why you're hitting me!

691
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,040
What do we do now? 
    

692
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,480
   

693
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,970
- My close friend! 
 - Gosh, what is this?

694
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,100
I've led a diligent life.

695
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,610
Give it to me.

696
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,980
Yes, you should put it there.

697
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,280
Right here. Does it look okay?

698
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,950
- Move it slightly this way. 
 - Is it placed right?

699
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:08,960
Okay, one moment.

700
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,580
Can you do it?

701
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,450
Be careful.

702
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,240
Hey, right there.

703
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,780
Gosh, do it properly!

704
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,810
Hey, it seems something is in the wall.

705
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,310
It's not going in.

706
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,450
   

707
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:29,560
I should just do it myself.

708
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,820
   

709
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,600
 My desire to become an accountant 

710
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,490
 actually started from the power of this piece of paper written by some accountant. 

711
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:50,520
Gosh, why are you so weak? Should I do it?

712
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,100
You know of a place like this?

713
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,790
Does this place even take company cards?

714
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,370
What does it matter? You will pay anyway.

715
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,580
- Is that so? 
 - Welcome.

716
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,610
Please sit down. I'll set up your table now.

717
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,440
Okay.

718
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,350
Everything is finished.

719
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,200
Now, you should relax a bit.

720
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,700
What do you mean, finished?

721
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,700
Things like this never end.

722
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,400
Only the players change.

723
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,190
It would be a relief if only the players changed.

724
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,880
More likely, they'll become even more ruthless and precise.

725
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,780
Even if they do, people like us are in this field.

726
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,480
We can just stop them again.

727
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,960
Gosh, I'm sick of it.

728
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,100
You think we can do anything else at this point?

729
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,460
But although it's rough, isn't it exciting?

730
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,360
Do you even know what excitement is, Hyung?

731
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,510
You're just a no-fun ahjussi who looks at only numbers.

732
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,440
I even thought of changing jobs because I was sick of numbers...

733
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:50,730
- You felt your study efforts would go to waste, right? 
 - No.

734
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:54,260
I found I liked numbers best out of the things I hated.

735
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,410
Sunbae. That's why I can't give up this job.

736
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,770
Excuse me, this is the service that Ho Woo asked me to give you.

737
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,600
You can just get the payment for this from Jang Ho Woo.

738
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,860
Ho Woo asked me to serve you lots of extra food on the house.

739
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,620
- Please enjoy the food. 
 -  Thank you. 

740
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,090
   

741
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:14,770
   

742
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,440
It's hot.

743
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,120
Thanks.

744
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,790
But you just come to me whenever you need something.

745
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:46,130
Am I the only Venture Capitalist you know in South Korea?

746
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:51,390
Since Jang Ji Soo is best at the job and most fair of ones I know.

747
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:54,710
You're looking for companies with the technical ability

748
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,240
and potential like Haebit Construction, 
    

749
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,570
but they have a weak management base.

750
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:02,240
So such a venture company has difficulty receiving financial institutions' support.

751
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,230
They fit exactly that description.

752
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,260
For Mujin Milk, you're not just any venture capitalist.

753
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,880
You would literally be an angel investor.

754
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,850
   

755
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:10,130

760

761
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:45,130

762
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:39,810
Did you hear about V.P. Han Je Gyun establishing real estate investment trusts?

763
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:41,520
Yes, I just heard.

764
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,390
I'll check to see if he meets the conditions for approval of the establishment.

765
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,010
 I'll also check how much capital he has. 

766
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,260
That way, we'll know what we should work on first.

767
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,500
Yes.

768
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,030
- Oh, Accountant Han. 
  - What is it? 

769
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:58,130
I guess they pay new staff even if they don't come to work over there?

770
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:00,690
Gosh, look at this rude b*stard.

771
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,720
I left Taeil for this. Who will stop me from taking a day off?

772
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:06,560
You worry about retaining your own salary.

773
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,200
 I heard you're being promoted rapidly. 

774
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,390
I'm going to become a CEO here.

775
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,780
Where else would a high-school grad go?

776
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:15,150
Aigoo, well... Go ahead, Mister.

777
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,960
Anyway, see you later.

778
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,730
I'll see you there.

779
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:25,390
He just doesn't give an inch.

780
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:33,790


781

01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,820
♫  See deep inside  ♫

♫  I will call out in the midst of it for all to see  ♫
