00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:41,432
This is yours, right?

5
00:00:43,132 --> 00:00:44,202
Yes.

7
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:55,181
It's your favorite seaweed soup, Mr. Kim.

8
00:00:56,482 --> 00:00:59,181
Have a warm bowl of this soup to fill you up,

9
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:01,951
so you can go back to working hard.

10
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,051
Thank you.

11
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:05,821
You aren't having much meat today.

12
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,160
Don't you like meat?

13
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,691
- I'm on a diet. - My goodness.

14
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,402
That isn't spicy.

15
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:14,362
My dad can't eat spicy food, either.

16
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:18,142
Whenever you're here,

17
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,842
you say, "three fried eggs, please."

18
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:23,271
I...

19
00:01:26,642 --> 00:01:29,652
I truly dislike spicy food.

20
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:34,081
Even though you're an adult?

21
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:35,252
That's right.

22
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:37,792
Adults are the same too.

23
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:40,521
I still don't like spicy food...

24
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:42,592
and am still afraid of many things.

25
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,732
You're an adult with many problems.

26
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:51,301
I can eat spicy food...

27
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,142
and am not afraid of anything.

28
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,471
Don't worry about anything.

29
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,811
I don't know.

30
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:03,382
How many times do I have to check for you to believe me?

31
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:06,251
I have no information on the kid,

32
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:07,952
but since you're my friend,

33
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:10,351
I went through all the missing child reports for kids around his age,

34
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:12,191
searched hospital records,

35
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,930
and even questioned everyone around the construction site.

36
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:16,632
Nothing came up at all.

37
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,631
(Trustworthy police, safe country)

38
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:23,672
From now on,

39
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,702
you can live with me at my home.

40
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:31,211
With you and Ji Soo?

41
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:33,211
Also,

42
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:35,681
we'll never come back here.

43
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:41,452
Then won't you meet your police friend?

44
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:42,922
No.

45
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,491
Did you fight with him?

46
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:46,892
Yes.

47
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,632
You don't play with friends after a fight, either.

48
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:54,531
(Ten years later)

49
00:03:00,602 --> 00:03:01,811
You jerks.

50
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,581
Get over here.

51
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:21,322
You're dead meat.

52
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:26,901
What's this?

53
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:33,041
I'm sorry. I'll take him home.

(Haeam Patrol Division)

55
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:39,311
I told you not to be intimidated by others, not to beat them up.

56
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,751
They started it first.

57
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:44,981
He's right. They started it.

58
00:03:44,982 --> 00:03:46,520
That's right. Ho Woo didn't do anything wrong.

59
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:47,822
See?

60
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:50,091
Forget it. Let's go eat.

61
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:52,591
Look at him getting away so easily...

62
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,831
when he doesn't even have any parents.

63
00:03:55,762 --> 00:03:58,300
Even dogs can sniff out strays.

64
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:00,561
- This is unbelievable. - I know.

65
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:03,771
Wait a minute.

66
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:06,702
They're just kids.

67
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:08,212
Mr. Jang.

68
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:13,181
Mr. Jang is so fast, isn't he?

69
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:16,282
I'm exhausted.

70
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,951
Mr. Jang has so much energy.

71
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:22,292
If we ever end up at the police station again,

72
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:24,821
let's call my grandma instead of Mr. Jang.

73
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:27,061
This happens every time and it's tiring.

74
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:30,390
We might've been beaten to death.

75
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:32,061
That could've been better.

76
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:38,402
Where does Mr. Jang get all that energy?

77
00:04:38,941 --> 00:04:40,971
Whenever someone calls Ho Woo an orphan,

78
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:43,042
he goes berserk like that.

79
00:04:43,712 --> 00:04:46,282
That's how a parent feels.

80
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:53,621
It's okay.

81
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:55,691
I don't have any memories to miss them.

82
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,051
Do you still...

83
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,191
not remember anything but your name?

84
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,592
Not even your parents' names?

85
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:07,200
That's why Mr. Jang took him to the police station several times,

86
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:08,832
but returned without finding anything.

87
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,301
Mr. Jang looked everywhere,

88
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:14,912
but there weren't any accidents reported...

89
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,011
the day he found me at the construction site.

90
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:20,011
Nor were there any missing child reports.

91
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,782
Does that mean someone abandoned their child or what?

92
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:25,352
That can't be possible.

93
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,820
You idiot.

94
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,051
- Are you serious? - I didn't mean that.

95
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,092
- That hurts. - Use your brain.

96
00:05:36,832 --> 00:05:38,631
I'm here for the inspection,

97
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:41,131
but what should we do?

98
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:43,272
Should we purchase some steel?

99
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:44,971
What does it say in the supervision report?

100
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:46,171
(Supervision report, A report by the supervisor...)

101
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:47,471
(indicating whether the construction is going as planned)

102
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,240
There has been some progress in the construction,

103
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,081
but it says in the clause that it's allowed...

104
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,711
if the progress is within 5 to 10 percent.

105
00:05:53,712 --> 00:05:56,010
We have to know how to determine that 5 to 10 percent.

106
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:57,451
- Let me see that. - Of course.

107
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:01,321
I think it's determined by the outer wall construction.

108
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:03,592
Let's eat first.

109
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,561
Have a nice day.

110
00:06:07,022 --> 00:06:09,491
Ho Woo.

111
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:10,691
Coming.

112
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:14,501
All right.

113
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:18,542
Welcome.

114
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:23,141
We should go somewhere nice when we can use the company card.

115
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:24,941
Many construction sites have good food.

116
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:26,741
You're right.

117
00:06:27,241 --> 00:06:30,051
Accountants would do a good job of rating restaurants like Michelin.

118
00:06:30,311 --> 00:06:33,282
We get treated often and go everywhere,

119
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:34,852
so we know all the good restaurants.

120
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:36,550
I noticed yesterday...

121
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:39,061
that something seems off about Haebit Construction.

122
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:40,162
Oh, that?

123
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:42,890
It's rare for the numbers to add up from the start.

124
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:44,561
Sometimes the numbers are rounded off.

125
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:47,201
We can ignore it if it isn't a big amount,

126
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:49,031
but you have to find out where the difference comes from.

127
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:50,732
We can't start an investigation without that.

128
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:53,201
Just copy and paste in the values.

129
00:06:57,311 --> 00:07:00,511
I wish we could do that and ignore the investigation.

130
00:07:06,222 --> 00:07:07,781
Cooking oil.

131
00:07:07,782 --> 00:07:09,991
How can the conclusion of the report change?

132
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,522
If the conclusion changes...

133
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:18,560
The project manager didn't mention anything.

134
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:20,000
He doesn't know anything.

135
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:21,972
If he doesn't, then who...

136
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,471
Is that why you told us to just paste in the values?

137
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:28,810
If the conclusion changes,

138
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:31,011
why make her do all that work when we won't need it?

139
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,241
Cover up the small things.

140
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:35,811
If we cook this right,

141
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:39,021
no one will be able to point out anything specific.

142
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:41,522
It's like they're talking in codes.

143
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,191
They're working so hard to build something...

144
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:45,792
that will be torn down.

145
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:50,991
Someone will trip over this.

146
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:53,861
Move this pallet, Mr. Kim.

147
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:55,431
- Okay. - Mr. Jang.

148
00:07:58,371 --> 00:07:59,741
There were accountants here.

149
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:01,772
They come every quarter.

150
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:04,440
But this time, they were saying...

151
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:05,482
Look.

152
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:08,311
Are you studying to become a police officer like you wanted to?

153
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:11,250
If you go around fighting all the time,

154
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:13,921
you'll die alone or of fatigue.

155
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:15,690
(Steel storage yard)

156
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:18,022
And you should wear a hard hat.

157
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:21,391
Mr. Jang.

158
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:28,501
The cold air is getting in and the residents...

159
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:30,572
I haven't seen Yeo Jin today.

160
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:33,572
I didn't, either.

161
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:36,141
She's so busy...

162
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,380
- preparing for the police exam. - Right.

163
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:40,311
Haebit Construction, which had been known...

164
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,250
for its patent on modular construction,

165
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,812
has been decided to be liquidated.

166
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:47,051
Taeil, the accounting firm acting as the creditor for Haebit,

167
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:49,321
mentioned slow domestic demand...

168
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,021
as the main reason.

169
00:08:51,222 --> 00:08:52,692
Let's hear from reporter No Gi Tae.

170
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:56,390
With the development of a patented technology...

171
00:08:56,391 --> 00:08:59,130
that reduces the time and cost of construction,

172
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:00,760
Haebit Construction won a Minister's award...

173
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:02,831
that is only awarded to breakthrough technology.

174
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:04,832
It has been a month since discussion about their recovery started.

175
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:07,140
However, they were not able to overcome the capital shortage,

176
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:08,971
and the liquidation of the company has been decided.

177
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:11,442
What is he talking about?

178
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:14,711
No wonder...

179
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:17,812
the construction workers were saying something weird yesterday.

180
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,521
Is that what they were talking about?

181
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:23,322
Then our cafeteria...

182
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:27,722
Don't worry. I'll find out what's happening.

183
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:34,232
- Get out. - Get out.

184

- get out. - Get out.

186
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:43,842
We demand an investigation into the bankruptcy of Haebit.

187
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:49,182
Why you...

188
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:50,681
You jerk.

189
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:53,082
- Get out. - Get out.

190
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:46,342
Stop.

191
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,221
Even if you beat everyone here up,

192
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:05,822
it's over for Haebit Construction.

197
00:11:25,442 --> 00:11:27,312
Haebit Construction is now bankrupt.

198
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,582
So stop causing trouble and leave.

199
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:32,982
Who says so?

200
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:36,222
Then what about the cafeteria and everyone here?

201
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,791
Who cares about that piece of paper?

202

We are the lifeline of companies.

If we want,

206
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:51,531
we can easily get rid of a company or let it survive.

207
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:53,802
We have the power to give or take away its life.

208

00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:58,502
I'm sure it must've shown he didn't go to university at the interview.

340
00:22:58,572 --> 00:22:59,741
- We will soon... - How did he pass?

341
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:01,041
- Jun Soo. - begin the training session...

342
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,611
for the new staff.

343
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:04,511
- See you. - See you.

344
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:06,242
- Please take your seats. - High school graduate?

345
00:23:11,012 --> 00:23:12,252
- Hello. - Hi.

346
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:16,221
Did you hear a high school graduate was hired this year?

347
00:23:17,092 --> 00:23:18,092
Excuse me?

348
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,321
- Yes. - Seriously?

349
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:23,362
I'm the only one that didn't know.

350
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:27,461
A high school graduate won't be able to survive here.

351
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:29,332
From the work to creating teams,

352
00:23:29,602 --> 00:23:31,701
and how to deal with clients,

353
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:34,371
everything is taught by seniors at our universities.

354
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:37,042
Didn't you hear that a high school graduate was hired...

355
00:23:37,342 --> 00:23:39,641
by a senior from your university?

356
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:41,711
No, I didn't.

357
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,252
Then was it a high school senior?

358
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:46,621
I didn't go to university.

359
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:49,522
I also took a GED for high school,

360
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:51,691
so I have no seniors.

361
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:54,092
I see.

362
00:23:55,022 --> 00:23:56,092
You are...

363
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:59,362
the high school graduate accountant.

364
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:01,131
You should've told me.

365
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:03,731
Let me introduce...

366
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:06,501
Vice President Han Je Kyun of Taeil Accounting.

367

(Core Talent of Korea's Best Taeil Accounting)

369
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:26,792
You aren't anything like the vice president, Seung Jo.

370
00:24:27,221 --> 00:24:29,731
It can't be easy for father and son to be so different.

371
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:32,762
I warmly congratulate you...

372
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:35,731
for becoming part of Taeil,

373
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:38,572
Korea's best and biggest accounting firm.

374
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,571
This year, we wanted to especially emphasize...

375
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:46,941
the ethics of an accountant...

376
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:49,581
and play our part in social responsibility,

377
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:52,151
so we hired you through a blind test...

378
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,950
in order to seek change.

379
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:54,981
(Hanguk University Graduates Room, The high school graduate is in D15.)

380
00:24:55,082 --> 00:24:58,322
Changes can make you uncomfortable in the beginning,

381
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:00,891
but we should focus...

382
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:03,391
on the synergy these changes can bring us.

383
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:05,532
Using this change as a stepping stone,

384
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:07,831
Taeil will create opportunities.

385
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:10,532
You will be the center of this history.

386
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:12,801
Do you believe this?

387
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,501
- What is it? - Look.

388
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:16,042
You will grow into the best in Korea.

389
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:18,341
The biggest number of companies in Korea...

390
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:20,282
- Is this true? - Look at this.

391
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:24,812
Excuse me.

392
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:27,852
Please be quiet.

393
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:29,992
- How is this possible? - I don't know.

394
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:37,931
It's about the high school graduate.

395
00:25:38,562 --> 00:25:41,431
He's just like an ugly duckling.

396
00:25:42,161 --> 00:25:43,171
I feel so bad for him.

397
00:25:44,302 --> 00:25:47,842
As the best in our field, Taeil Accounting...

398
00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:50,441
often becomes the target...

399
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:52,671
of other accounting firms in Korea.

400
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,582
I hope you consider it an honor and mutiny...

401
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:59,052
that lives up to Taeil's reputation and enjoy it.

Let's go. We don't want to be late.

406
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,151
Isn't he one of the new accountants?

407
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:39,592
But he doesn't have any files.

408

That's good.

423

Another task won't make a big difference.

424

Seriously?

425
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:31,072
Excuse me.

426
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:33,782

That's what I was asking.

430

No, I can handle it.

Does he think all accountants are the same?

434
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:08,881
He wants to work so bad.

435
00:28:09,112 --> 00:28:12,081
You can take him when you're in charge.

436
00:28:12,082 --> 00:28:13,082
Wait a second.

437
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,051
How could you be so cruel?

438
00:28:16,052 --> 00:28:18,621
Then why are you being so hard on me?

439
00:28:18,852 --> 00:28:19,891

Two years...

459
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:25,322
seems long enough for him to have gotten close...

to the employees there.

461

That's right.

462
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:29,991
I've told the people at People's Entertainment...

463
00:29:29,992 --> 00:29:31,931
to be meticulously prepared for the audit,

464
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:34,362
but it won't seem weird at all for them to get either...

465
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:36,901
an adverse audit opinion or a disclaimer of opinion.

466
00:29:37,072 --> 00:29:39,331
It is up to the accountant in charge of deciding...

whether to turn a blind eye or raise an issue.

and here to select new staff?

Why are all the projects named after animals?

496
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:42,522
Can't you use the real names instead of fake ones?

497

- The stock prices would... - Go crazy.

That's why even accountants in the same firm...

502

can't know or ask about other teams' projects.

00:32:03,352 --> 00:32:05,451
Thank you. I was truly curious.

505
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:08,181
Can I ask you if I have other questions?

506
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:09,522
What?

507
00:32:10,052 --> 00:32:12,492
You said you're in charge of the new employees.

508
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:15,621
Yes, that's true.

509
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,461
Thank you.

510
00:32:26,742 --> 00:32:28,471
I shouldn't have said yes, right?

511
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:35,481
First, the tax department.

512
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:37,880
They deal with not only the corporate tax and income tax,

513
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:40,852
but also transfer tax, inheritance tax, and property tax.

514
00:32:40,951 --> 00:32:43,822
They handle tax issues between companies and executive families.

515
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:47,322
The second department in accounting is auditing.

516
00:32:47,562 --> 00:32:50,960
As you know, they're in charge of auditing and the companies'...

517
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:52,131
accounting-related issues.

518
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:56,002
Lastly, the advisory department.

519
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:59,331
The advisory department is in charge of everything else in business...

520
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:01,171
except tax and auditing.

521
00:33:02,201 --> 00:33:04,571
From corporate workout, mergers and acquisitions,

522
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:07,581
sale of assets, and financial advisory,

523
00:33:07,582 --> 00:33:10,481
they handle what you have seen on the news.

524
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:13,082
Watch carefully.

525
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:19,022
That man is...

526
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:20,992
definitely somewhere in this department.

527
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:25,431
As the work requires advanced expertise and skills,

528
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,301
a new hire isn't likely to be assigned to a big project...

529
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:29,461
of an advisory team.

530
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,631
Let's move on.

531
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:11,671
Senior Manager Han Seung Jo?

532
00:34:13,112 --> 00:34:16,282
How does he feel to have the firm's vice president as the father?

533
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:19,451
He must be happy to be successful and to come from a rich family.

534
00:34:19,452 --> 00:34:21,920
Wouldn't it be like playing cards with all joker cards?

535
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,351
Is that why he's rude?

536
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,992
Our vice president could be considered as the Joker.

537
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,391
It was his idea to blindly select new hires this year.

538
00:34:29,392 --> 00:34:31,631
He also hired a hearing-impaired barista at the firm's cafe.

539
00:34:32,762 --> 00:34:34,802
"Noblesse oblige." He's amazing.

540
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:37,871
If I had a father like him, I'd be smiling all the time.

541
00:34:37,872 --> 00:34:40,472
Not only that, but I'd also eat with him...

542
00:34:40,702 --> 00:34:42,802
- and go to the sauna with him. - Eat this.

543
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,341
Thank you.

544
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:46,342
You should have asked me first...

545
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:52,612
Hello.

546
00:35:05,262 --> 00:35:07,600
Certainly, all public announcements published...

547
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:09,500
by accounting firms are important.

548
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:12,802
However, the most important one is the audit report.

549
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:16,710
Our audit reports influence not only the company...

550
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:18,841
but also the shareholders.

551
00:35:18,842 --> 00:35:22,381
More than anything else, they require extra care.

552
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:34,592
Profits and losses look good, but they don't have enough cash flow.

553
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,032
You scum.

554
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:43,671
Stand straight!

555
00:35:44,972 --> 00:35:48,471
How dare you handle it like that?

556
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:49,841
Dad, I can explain...

557
00:35:49,842 --> 00:35:52,871
As the major shareholder, even if Bo Sung tries...

558
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:55,281
to shove money into it,

559
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:57,751
you should have been firm and stopped him.

560
00:35:58,182 --> 00:36:02,421
Are you sure that you covered up the mess he created in the books?

561
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:06,891
Yes, I did as you told me.

562
00:36:06,892 --> 00:36:11,092
If it gets revealed, you will be responsible for it all, got it?

563
00:36:11,892 --> 00:36:13,191
Darn it.

564
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:19,001
Goodness.

565
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:27,012
I am sure...

566
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:31,682
that Bo Sung's intention was good.

567
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:35,350
After having a meeting with China, when an article...

568
00:36:35,351 --> 00:36:38,721
about my duty-free business was published, the stock price soared.

569
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:40,092
You punk!

570
00:36:40,722 --> 00:36:43,060
That place where you wanted to open up your business,

571
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:44,661
the branch office reassessment went haywire,

572
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,231
so they're about to go bankrupt.

573
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:49,601
If you want to start something, you should know the details.

574
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:51,572
There's no authenticity in your lies.

575
00:36:52,372 --> 00:36:55,371
You're amazing. Now, you look like a real chairman.

576
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:57,072
Why you...

577
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:01,210
The prosecutors could be after us for embezzlement and malfeasance.

578
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,242
You'd better come to your senses.

579
00:37:06,412 --> 00:37:08,251
We are here for you...

580
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:14,021
to prevent such a thing.

581
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:19,091
Generally, embezzlement and malfeasance occur...

582
00:37:19,092 --> 00:37:21,661
when shareholders lose their money.

583
00:37:21,662 --> 00:37:24,431
In other words, if we make them gain money instead,

584
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:25,972
the problem will disappear right away.

585
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:29,142
What if Sangha Group takes over People's Entertainment?

586
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:32,142
Then the problem will be yours.

587
00:37:32,742 --> 00:37:36,142
Sangha Group would be taking over a company at the risk of delisting.

588
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:38,580
What else can I do?

589
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:40,452
Should I let my son get arrested?

590
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:42,951
First, do everything you can so that People's Entertainment...

591
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:46,092
gets an unqualified opinion...

592
00:37:47,722 --> 00:37:49,162
from this year's audit.

593
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:54,001
Once you stabilize the company's financials with recapitalization,

594
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:57,131
you may take over the company.

595
00:37:57,631 --> 00:37:59,701
As long as you follow this order and do it on time,

596
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:02,472
both you and your son will be safe.

597
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:07,881
What if People's Entertainment doesn't get an unqualified opinion?

598
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:09,112
It will be a fiasco.

599
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:14,182
We will take care of it...

600
00:38:14,682 --> 00:38:16,351
with the accounting firm.

601
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:23,362
Gosh, I knew that you would handle it.

602
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:27,662
Three years ago, when they conducted a surprise slush fund investigation,

603
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:31,331
what he pulled off was unbelievable.

604
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:36,372
Gosh.

605
00:38:40,182 --> 00:38:42,080
Like father, like son,

606
00:38:42,081 --> 00:38:44,581
they aren't much different from one another.

607
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:47,621
It's unfortunate for Sangha Group,

608
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:49,881
but it's good news for our accounting firm.

609
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:52,051
As a result, the pitch was a piece of cake.

610
00:38:52,052 --> 00:38:53,350
(Pitch: a presentation of services to clients to get a project)

611
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:54,361
That is true.

612
00:38:54,362 --> 00:38:56,831
We got a mergers and acquisitions case without intending to.

613
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:04,801
An incompetent CEO is...

614
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:07,242
the most competent client for an accounting firm.

615
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:47,981
They definitely deserve an unqualified opinion.

616
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:51,850
There's no serious error for a disclaimer of opinion.

617
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,421
If we disclaim our opinion, and they get delisted,

618
00:39:54,481 --> 00:39:57,592
the shareholders will protest and sue us.

619
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,850
The consequences will be serious.

620
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:02,991
If we take the easy way out to satisfy everyone...

621
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:05,331
when they deserve a disclaimer of opinion,

622
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:07,801
the worst consequence would be when a problem rises.

623
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:09,661
If we give an unqualified opinion, and the firm gets in trouble,

624
00:40:09,662 --> 00:40:10,770
how will you handle that?

625
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:13,701
Aren't you going overboard with something that hasn't happened?

626
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:16,541
Besides, who wants a disclaimer of opinion?

627
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,940
Neither People's Entertainment, their shareholders,

628
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:21,881
their lending banks, nor creditors want that.

629
00:40:22,012 --> 00:40:24,210
This disclaimer of opinion is for whom?

630
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:27,721
Aren't public accountants supposed to work for the public?

631
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:29,350
If something looks doubtful,

632
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:32,191
isn't it only right to give them a disclaimer of opinion?

633
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:35,921
It requires prudence.

634
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:39,032
An accounting firm's disclaimer of opinion can result...

635
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,401
in delisting of the company.

636
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:46,831
In other words, the fate of everyone with interest in the company...

637
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:50,101
depends on the accounting firm's decision.

638
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:54,711
Haebit Construction is now bankrupt.

639
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:56,612
Mr. Jang?

640
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,881
Mr. Jang.

641
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:02,052
Mr. Jang!

642
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:15,561
That will be all for today.

643
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:17,131
Thank you for listening.

644
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:18,572
- Thank you. - Thank you.

645
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:33,751
He will think it over,

646
00:41:34,182 --> 00:41:37,392
but Mr. Kang is unlikely to give a disclaimer of opinion.

647
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:39,691
It may be called a disclaimer of opinion,

648
00:41:40,592 --> 00:41:42,722
but it's the same as a death sentence.

649
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:48,501
He has known CEO Koo for several years.

650
00:41:49,702 --> 00:41:51,171
It won't be easy to betray him.

651
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:53,001
It will not be easy.

652
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,901
However, it must be done.

653
00:41:58,972 --> 00:42:01,282
I will take care of it without causing problems.

654
00:42:07,182 --> 00:42:08,282
I'll call you back.

655
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:14,162
You must be busy.

656
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:17,092
Just like any other busy season.

657
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:21,302
You once said...

658
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:24,401
that doing the best may not be for the best.

659
00:42:25,472 --> 00:42:26,831
Do you remember?

660
00:42:28,472 --> 00:42:29,901
When I was a new staff member,

661
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:33,211
I could have reviewed a sample,

662
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:36,142
but I insisted on reviewing the entire account.

663
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:39,081
I almost stopped you from finishing the report.

664
00:42:39,811 --> 00:42:41,881
It's what you told me back then.

665
00:42:43,151 --> 00:42:44,921
He may be doing his best,

666
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:47,892
but it may not be the best for everyone.

667
00:42:49,822 --> 00:42:52,231
It came to my mind today all of a sudden.

668
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:56,731
There was an obvious answer that everyone agreed with,

669
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:59,671
but why did I insist on it...

670
00:43:00,131 --> 00:43:02,072
thinking that it was my conviction?

671
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:09,581
Are you saying there's something...

672
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:11,512
I'm not allowed to try my best?

673
00:43:12,981 --> 00:43:15,581
It seemed like you had something to tell me...

674
00:43:15,822 --> 00:43:17,492
by bringing up past stories you don't even like.

675
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:22,221
I get that you want to say...

676
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:25,532
the answer people say is okay is also the best for everyone.

677
00:43:26,162 --> 00:43:28,001
But who's included in the "people" in this case?

678
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:30,702
And who is "everyone?"

679
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:16,782
The documents I mentioned aren't here.

680
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:20,750
I asked you about them days ago. Why are they still not here?

681
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:22,981
I'm not able to do any work because of this.

682
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:24,651
Hurry up and bring it to me now.

683
00:44:25,322 --> 00:44:29,322
I mentioned this to you ages ago. How come they're still not here?

684
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:30,762
Bring them over right now.

685
00:44:33,731 --> 00:44:35,032
Senior Associate Park.

686
00:44:35,802 --> 00:44:38,271
- What is it? - Is there anything I can help with?

687
00:44:39,501 --> 00:44:41,342
I'm fine. Just go do your job.

688
00:44:41,572 --> 00:44:42,601
My job.

689
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:45,912
I have nothing to do. That's why I'm asking for work.

690
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,251
I'm currently not involved in any projects,

691
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:54,182
so I was thinking I'd help with whatever you're doing.

692
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:56,381
It's Teacher.

693
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:59,091
- Pardon? - Regardless of rank,

694
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:02,461
that's the official term that accountants call each other here.

695
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,231
Oh, right. Teacher.

696
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:10,162
Teacher Jang Ho Woo. You don't have any work?

697
00:45:11,432 --> 00:45:12,471
That's right.

698
00:45:12,472 --> 00:45:14,072
Have you ever seen results without cause?

699
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:16,670
Haven't you thought that there must be a reason...

700
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,411
why no one needs you on their team?

701
00:45:18,412 --> 00:45:19,670
What could that reason be?

702
00:45:19,671 --> 00:45:22,081
I couldn't figure it out, no matter how much I tried, Teacher.

703
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:23,512
You must've misunderstood me.

704
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:25,611
We may call each other Teacher here,

705
00:45:25,612 --> 00:45:27,581
but I didn't mean I'd teach you anything.

706
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:31,622
Is it because I didn't go to college?

707
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:34,560
I may not have a college degree, but I passed the accountant exam.

708
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:36,892
And I went through the proper process to join this firm.

709
00:45:37,061 --> 00:45:39,630
Why is it suddenly a problem that I didn't go to college?

710
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:40,831
Do you think that's the reason?

711
00:45:41,731 --> 00:45:44,101
If you think that's it, then you must be right.

712
00:45:48,072 --> 00:45:49,441
Do you still have more to say?

713
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:51,472
I don't have anything to say, but I do have a lot to do.

714
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,591
Send it to me for review once you're done.

715
00:46:11,592 --> 00:46:12,631
Yes, sir.

716
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:53,631
What will you do if you meet him looking like this?

717
00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:14,092
Wasn't there anyone who told you that you shouldn't come up here?

718
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:39,012
Didn't you run away from the office?

719
00:47:40,052 --> 00:47:41,521
It seems like you went to the restroom.

720
00:47:48,162 --> 00:47:49,461
Unfortunately,

721
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:53,762
your anger doesn't have any power to it.

722
00:47:57,372 --> 00:47:59,500
Do you really believe people won't work with you...

723
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,041
and bully you because you didn't go to college?

724
00:48:01,771 --> 00:48:03,170
"We don't want an accountant without a college diploma..."

725
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,572
"and muddying the waters."

726
00:48:05,612 --> 00:48:07,242
- Isn't that it? - You're wrong.

727
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:09,380
Whether you only went to high school or middle school,

728
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:10,711
none of the accountants here...

729
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:12,552
care at all.

730
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:16,421
Who cares when your paycheck isn't coming out of my pocket?

731
00:48:17,751 --> 00:48:19,750
- Then why... - Regardless of your education,

732
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:22,060
you joined my team...

733
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:23,921
and you're affecting my income?

734
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:25,791
Now, that's a different story.

735
00:48:27,432 --> 00:48:28,600
Is this about money?

736
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:30,162
This is about whether you can prove...

737
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:33,071
that you can pull your own weight...

738
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:34,441
as a team member.

739
00:48:36,171 --> 00:48:37,202
Prove it?

740
00:48:38,142 --> 00:48:39,342
Time Report.

741
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:41,981
You would've heard of it during the New Staff Orientation.

742
00:48:43,012 --> 00:48:45,150
It's a Profitability Evaluation to go over...

743
00:48:45,151 --> 00:48:48,181
how many accountants were on this case, spent how much time,

744
00:48:48,182 --> 00:48:49,421
and made how much money in profit.

745
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,822
(Notice, Time Code Approval)

746
00:48:58,191 --> 00:48:59,631
How many did we get assigned?

747
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:00,901
Six.

748
00:49:01,202 --> 00:49:03,532
Oh, with six staff, we should be able to work with ease.

749
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:06,501
Wait, why don't you look relieved?

750
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:10,071
We're working with six people. I'm worried we might spend...

751
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,441
all that time and not make enough profit.

752
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:13,972
It's better to take five guys who are trustworthy.

753
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:16,742
It might be more physically tiring, but we'd feel a lot more at ease.

754
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:19,350
You're right. If one of them messes up,

755
00:49:19,351 --> 00:49:21,722
the whole team has to pay the price.

756
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:24,190
One time, a new staff did...

757
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:26,392
such a thorough job of messing things up.

758
00:49:26,822 --> 00:49:29,892
He practically dug a grave to bury the entire team in.

759
00:49:30,162 --> 00:49:32,791
The size of the grave was like a royal tomb.

760
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:37,000
This could mean getting passed over for raises, bonuses, and promotions,

761
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:40,372
and you might end up with an incapable teammate for a whole year.

762
00:49:40,631 --> 00:49:42,441
Of course, you can't make such decisions lightly.

763
00:49:43,372 --> 00:49:44,811
But what? School relations and educational background?

764
00:49:45,572 --> 00:49:46,642
Do you think it's that easy?

765
00:49:46,941 --> 00:49:49,381
If it were you, would it be that simple?

766
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:51,682
Then why don't you just say it outright like,

767
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:53,781
"This is this, and that's that?"

768
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,322
This place isn't a school.

769
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:57,621
You might have a duty to learn,

770
00:49:57,622 --> 00:49:59,622
but we don't have a duty to teach you.

771
00:50:00,592 --> 00:50:03,091
And even if someone teaches you, it's for one's own benefit.

772
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:04,461
It's not for your sake.

773
00:50:05,092 --> 00:50:07,831
Besides, risk analyses, valuations, and expected earnings...

774
00:50:09,432 --> 00:50:11,601
Shouldn't you be familiar with these terms if you're an accountant?

775
00:50:12,932 --> 00:50:15,071
You are a clear risk that you didn't go to college,

776
00:50:15,072 --> 00:50:16,641
your capability is unknown,

777
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:18,211
and your teamwork hasn't been experienced by anyone before.

778
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:20,412
Naturally, the expected earnings become unclear.

779
00:50:21,282 --> 00:50:22,580
You would've figured it out soon...

780
00:50:22,581 --> 00:50:24,251
if you had thought about it like an accountant.

781
00:50:25,452 --> 00:50:26,811
Did you not see it because you were anxious?

782
00:50:30,081 --> 00:50:31,520
Why were you in such a rush to get here...

783
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:32,952
that you even skipped college?

784
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,791
What on earth do you want to do here?

785
00:50:40,092 --> 00:50:41,101
Forget it.

786
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:43,331
I'm not curious. I don't need to know.

787
00:50:47,702 --> 00:50:49,441
Go downstairs unless you're going to smoke.

788
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:53,572
Even if I were in charge,

789
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:56,311
I wouldn't choose you to be on my team.

790
00:51:36,782 --> 00:51:37,952
Hello?

791
00:51:38,521 --> 00:51:39,791
There you go.

792
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:41,092
What's this?

793
00:51:41,093 --> 00:51:44,291
It's my special kimchi jjigae.

794
00:51:44,932 --> 00:51:46,290
Shall we try it?

795
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:49,362
I even bought meat to cook this kimchi jjigae for you guys.

796
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:53,972
Okay. Let's drink.

797
00:52:02,682 --> 00:52:04,141
How is it? Isn't it good?

798
00:52:04,142 --> 00:52:05,580
- It's salty. - I want a refund.

799
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,411
- This is salty? - Add some more water.

800
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:08,850
If this is salty, you guys are...

801
00:52:08,851 --> 00:52:10,351
- It's salty. - This is salty?

802
00:52:14,492 --> 00:52:15,762
The liquor tastes sweet today.

803
00:52:16,262 --> 00:52:17,631
My life is so bitter.

804
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:20,162
Gosh, whether it's a police officer on probationary employment...

805
00:52:20,662 --> 00:52:22,061
or an accountant in training...

806
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:25,331
Do you have to put it that way?

807
00:52:25,831 --> 00:52:28,702
There are only the best of the best at an accounting firm.

808
00:52:29,671 --> 00:52:32,512
And I'm just trying to find a space among them.

809
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:36,182
That's my job every single day.

810
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:37,782
Why?

811
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:40,681
I only have a high school diploma.

812
00:52:40,682 --> 00:52:43,622
Sure. I know how that feels.

813
00:52:44,251 --> 00:52:46,750
No matter how I look at it, Ho Woo should've gone...

814
00:52:46,751 --> 00:52:49,190
to college before becoming an accountant.

815
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:50,191
Still.

816
00:52:50,521 --> 00:52:52,891
It's better than having to deal with drunks for the past few months.

817
00:52:52,892 --> 00:52:55,000
And it's better than having loans piled up,

818
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:57,702
but not having customers, making me work part-time during the day.

819
00:52:58,601 --> 00:53:02,342
Besides, you have a friend like me by your side.

820
00:53:02,941 --> 00:53:03,972
Who are you?

821
00:53:04,142 --> 00:53:05,742
Hey. You tell me.

822
00:53:06,072 --> 00:53:08,612
When life is at its worst and you feel so down,

823
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:11,211
who do you think of?

824
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:14,921
I think of 911 responders.

825
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:18,651
Right, 911.

826
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:20,191
It's not you.

827
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:22,722
Seriously, 911... Hey, come here.

828
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:27,032
- You should sleep. - Okay.

829
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:04,901
Did the bank give us this certificate?

830
00:54:05,271 --> 00:54:06,830
- Here you go. - You can't send it like this.

831
00:54:06,831 --> 00:54:09,271
Request it again after you include the financial statement.

832
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:10,572
Yes, sir.

833
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,412
(Data, Get external data)

834
00:54:23,351 --> 00:54:25,190
This is about whether you can prove...

835
00:54:25,191 --> 00:54:27,420
that you can pull your own weight...

836
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:29,021
as a team member.

837
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:31,362
Prove it?

838
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:46,271
I wasn't trapped.

839
00:54:48,782 --> 00:54:50,711
I was just sitting still.

840
00:55:23,081 --> 00:55:24,242
(Shred and recycle)

841
00:55:41,802 --> 00:55:42,831
Teacher.

842
00:55:43,862 --> 00:55:46,271
If it's okay with you, would you like me to copy those for you?

843
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:48,940
There's quite a lot.

844
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:49,941
It's fine.

845
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:54,211
- Thank you. - Of course.

846
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,051
Are you not done copying the Iron Project material?

847
00:56:02,052 --> 00:56:03,322
I'm almost done.

848
00:56:04,452 --> 00:56:07,021
- Bring them to the meeting room. - All right.

849
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:31,751
Excuse me. This time, can you send an email instead of making copies?

850
00:56:32,182 --> 00:56:33,851
Yes, I can.

851
00:56:40,552 --> 00:56:41,722
Hey, so...

852
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:45,630
I need to receive a fax, write comments on it,

853
00:56:45,631 --> 00:56:47,231
and send it to another team.

854
00:56:48,061 --> 00:56:49,731
Could you receive the fax for me?

855
00:56:50,061 --> 00:56:51,101
Of course.

856
00:56:51,162 --> 00:56:54,131
But it's coming from the UK. Because of the time difference,

857
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:56,441
it won't get here until early morning.

858
00:56:57,202 --> 00:56:58,872
Yes, sir. I understand.

859
00:56:59,311 --> 00:57:00,612
Will you really be okay?

860
00:57:03,342 --> 00:57:06,451
What comment should I write on it once I receive the fax?

861
00:57:06,452 --> 00:57:08,322
I'll organize that and send it to you.

862
00:57:08,581 --> 00:57:09,682
Yes, sir.

863
00:57:22,362 --> 00:57:23,862
Who's setting up the meeting room?

864
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:25,731
Pushover Jang is doing it now.

865
00:57:25,932 --> 00:57:28,471
Then at 3pm, my team will borrow him.

866
00:57:28,472 --> 00:57:31,000
You have to be sure to send him back by 4pm.

867
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:32,311
I need him to go to the bookbinding room.

868
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:36,142
Pushover Jang?

869
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:02,171
Is this the best you can do besides get angry?

870
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:05,441
Do you even know what people are calling you?

871
00:58:07,412 --> 00:58:09,782
Pushover Jang.

872
00:58:12,412 --> 00:58:14,282
I think that's what they're calling me.

873
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:15,980
How can you be smiling?

874
00:58:15,981 --> 00:58:19,021
I'm no longer invisible, at least.

875
00:58:20,092 --> 00:58:23,262
Even if I'm a pushover, I'm someone they can see.

876
00:58:27,392 --> 00:58:30,231
I've been looking for you. What are you doing there?

877
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:32,972
What's this?

878
00:58:35,142 --> 00:58:36,171
Sorry, sir.

879
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:44,041
I'm someone people even look for when I'm not around.

880
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:47,081
Compared to being invisible,

881
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:49,452
it's huge progress.

882
00:58:50,122 --> 00:58:52,822
Why are you trying so hard to stay here?

883
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:55,262
It doesn't have to be this place necessarily.

884
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:57,662
- If you go somewhere else... - It has to be this place.

885
00:58:58,691 --> 00:58:59,862
So why is that?

886
00:59:00,592 --> 00:59:04,262
I want to become the nucleus of Taeil Accounting.

887
00:59:04,872 --> 00:59:05,901
Nucleus?

888
00:59:06,802 --> 00:59:08,871
Do you mean something like the core manpower or something?

889
00:59:08,872 --> 00:59:10,941
Oh, core manpower.

890
00:59:12,012 --> 00:59:13,512
That should come first, I guess.

891
00:59:14,572 --> 00:59:15,612
What are you saying?

892
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,782
Then let me ask you one thing too.

893
00:59:20,282 --> 00:59:21,381
Last time,

894
00:59:23,282 --> 00:59:24,952
why did you do that to me?

895
00:59:28,162 --> 00:59:29,561
What do you mean by last time?

896
00:59:31,222 --> 00:59:32,461
On the rooftop.

897
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:36,202
Why did you teach me...

898
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:38,131
what I was doing wrong?

899
00:59:38,532 --> 00:59:39,971
Even if you taught me something,

900
00:59:39,972 --> 00:59:42,072
it wouldn't be for my own sake.

901
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:44,771
You said it was for the benefit of the person who taught me.

902
00:59:45,412 --> 00:59:47,311
What benefit did you get out of it?

903
00:59:48,581 --> 00:59:51,581
What do you, Accountant Han Seung Jo,

904
00:59:53,351 --> 00:59:54,751
get out of teaching me?

905
01:00:16,771 --> 01:00:18,872
You go to the rooftop every chance you get.

906
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:22,311
You seem to be so comfortable at work.

907
01:00:23,742 --> 01:00:26,182
No way. I'm in the same building as you.

908
01:00:27,811 --> 01:00:29,981
Do you think people are considerate of you...

909
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:32,992
because you did well?

910
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:36,691
They're not being considerate. It's more like they're excluding me.

911
01:00:37,061 --> 01:00:39,862
And I know that's all thanks to you, Dad.

912
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:43,001
And once you take the Chairman's office as you wish,

913
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:44,731
it'll only get worse.

914
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:47,601
So?

915
01:00:48,572 --> 01:00:50,302
Did you feel so lonely at work...

916
01:00:50,671 --> 01:00:53,412
that you hired an accountant with only a high school diploma?

917
01:00:54,941 --> 01:00:56,981
Where would you use such a thing?

918
01:00:57,581 --> 01:01:00,581
How dare he come here with nothing but a high school diploma?

919
01:01:01,622 --> 01:01:04,182
The punk who dared to apply here...

920
01:01:04,351 --> 01:01:06,251
and the punk who went ahead and hired him...

921
01:01:07,592 --> 01:01:11,322
That thing will be fired soon, and that's final.

922
01:01:14,791 --> 01:01:17,901
You might end up getting caught and showing your true colors.

923
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:22,540
People can't even imagine what you're capable of doing...

924
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:24,142
out of greed.

925
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,472
But isn't it so fascinating?

926
01:01:27,012 --> 01:01:30,282
They don't even know that you're two-faced.

927
01:01:30,881 --> 01:01:33,081
And yet, they call you the Joker.

928
01:01:40,191 --> 01:01:42,461
- Han Seung Jo. - So you should watch out.

929
01:01:43,061 --> 01:01:46,092
It's not even enough that you used your son as a chess piece.

930
01:01:46,532 --> 01:01:50,662
You even gave up being human to get to where you are now.

931
01:01:52,072 --> 01:01:54,302
I could ruin everything for you.

932
01:02:02,412 --> 01:02:06,581
Don't touch anyone from now on.

933
01:02:32,112 --> 01:02:33,311
Jang Ho Woo.

934
01:02:33,512 --> 01:02:37,041
Let me answer the question you asked me earlier.

935
01:02:38,851 --> 01:02:40,081
What do I get out of it?

936
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:42,481
A wild card.

937
01:02:43,182 --> 01:02:46,492
A card that's nothing but can also become anything at the same time.

938
01:02:47,092 --> 01:02:50,592
No one can predict what it is, so even in an obvious fight,

939
01:02:50,862 --> 01:02:52,961
you can use this card to shake up the whole game.

940
01:02:53,961 --> 01:02:57,001
Like a joker in a stack of playing cards?

941
01:02:57,131 --> 01:02:59,371
I can't tell what you have on the inside from looking at you.

942
01:02:59,372 --> 01:03:01,072
You're just like a joker too.

943
01:03:02,271 --> 01:03:06,012
Figures. There are two jokers in a stack of cards.

944
01:03:10,012 --> 01:03:11,952
So, Jang Ho Woo...

945
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,052
You should join my team.

946
01:03:51,182 --> 01:03:52,591
(Numbers)

947
01:03:52,592 --> 01:03:53,621
Without an inquiry letter,

948
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:55,690
the audit report and everything will be ruined!

949
01:03:55,691 --> 01:03:56,892
I'll do it.

950
01:03:57,122 --> 01:03:59,560
Do you think Jang Ho Woo will be able to get the inquiry letter?

951
01:03:59,561 --> 01:04:01,362
We won't get it even if an accountant's grandpa goes himself.

952
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:03,001
Oh, my gosh!

953
01:04:03,002 --> 01:04:04,900
Didn't you hear me say to take a number and wait?

954
01:04:04,901 --> 01:04:06,730
How dare you try to cut in line?

955
01:04:06,731 --> 01:04:09,841
I'm not some strange guy. I'm an accountant.

956
01:04:09,842 --> 01:04:11,241
Let's plant a guy.

957
01:04:11,242 --> 01:04:14,170
Think of it like installing a security camera.

958
01:04:14,171 --> 01:04:16,210
You want to work under Sim Hyung Woo?

959
01:04:16,211 --> 01:04:18,480
Unless you want to get in trouble, get out of there right now.

960
01:04:18,481 --> 01:04:20,850
If that happens, 41 million dollars isn't the issue.

961
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:22,020
The stock prices will go through the roof.

962
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:23,051
What happened?

963
01:04:23,052 --> 01:04:25,190
There weren't any particular issues within the audit team.

964
01:04:25,191 --> 01:04:26,191
Did you just turn me down...

965
01:04:26,192 --> 01:04:28,150
when you can't even tell apart friends from enemies?

966
01:04:28,151 --> 01:04:30,262
It seems like friends and enemies aren't decided by people...

967
01:04:31,222 --> 01:04:32,992
but by timing.
