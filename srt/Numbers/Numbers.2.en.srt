3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,329
Jang Ho Woo. Let me answer the question...

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,770
you asked me earlier.

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,540
What do I get out of it?

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,910
A wild card.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,910
A card that's nothing but can also become anything at the same time.

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,549
No one can predict what it is,

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,450
so even in an obvious fight,

10
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,450
you can use this card to shake up the whole game.

11
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,050
Like a Joker in a stack of playing cards?

12
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,418
I can't tell what you have on the inside from looking at you.

13
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:44,929
You're just like a Joker too.

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,260
Figures. There are two Jokers in a stack of cards.

15
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,099
So, Jang Ho Woo...

16
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,529
You should join my team.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,980
No, thanks.

18
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,399
Our café sells some great coffee.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,130
The employees approve as well.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,629
Even the people...

21
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,869
who opposed your idea...

22
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,400
to hire hearing-impaired baristas have come around.

23
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:32,639
I looked forward to being a president's secretary...

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,079
when Ms. An got promoted.

25
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:36,939
What a shame.

26
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,950
She has a cardiovascular issue.

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,680
It can't be helped that she'll quit for health reasons.

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,290
She can't hear.

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,260
Oh, right.

30
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,230
They can talk freely without having to...

31
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,900
worry about people overhearing.

32
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,329
That's it.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,000
People's Entertainment's audit...

34
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,899
must be reaching its end.

35
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,970
I believe they just have to...

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,609
collect the confirmation.

37
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,869
From the banks' perspective,

38
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:11,910
those confirmations would be a nuisance.

39
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,678
It's none of their business,

40
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:17,820
and it's extra work for them that they don't get paid for.

41
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,820
I'll keep an eye on them.

42
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:25,230
If you're to become president,

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,989
Audit's VP An Seung Yeon...

44
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,160
is the person you must beat.

45
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,168
- If you look at... - An Seung Yeon...

46
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:34,399
is not an issue.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,540
I think something more pressing than my becoming...

48
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:40,070
Taeil's president is about to happen.

49
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,709
By the way,

50
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,309
on the team that's auditing People's Entertainment.

51
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,679

52
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,980
You never know what'll happen.

53
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:54,350
Think of it like installing a security camera.

54
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,989
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,500
Why did you say no?

56
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:06,130
In case I make you do copies?

57
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,600
I won't, so don't worry.

58
00:03:08,899 --> 00:03:11,269
It's a refusal, not a concern.

59
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,809
It's only natural for any Taeil newbie...

60
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,780
to want to join my team.

61
00:03:19,149 --> 00:03:20,149

63

of being Han Je Kyun's son,

65

teamwork that I don't need to experience to know,

66
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:30,919
which all leads to uncertain expected earnings.

67
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,889
As an experienced accountant,

68
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,560
you must know.

69
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:39,730
If that's all, I'd like to be excused.

00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,749
The CEO of Haebit Construction died...

336
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,449
due to his sense of guilt,

337
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,090
caused by his incompetence.

338
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,900
Why aren't you feeling guilty...

339
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:53,930
when he and I can feel it?

340
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,769
Have you ever seen a predator feeling guilty...

341
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,910
about biting off the neck of its prey?

342
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,049
You don't see them as people.

343
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,479
The strong prey upon the weak.

344
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,289
It's the survival of the fittest.

345
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:19,019
It's the law of the jungle, Son.

346
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,728
About this project,

347
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:25,029
you should ask Sim Hyung Woo, your hunting dog.

348
00:21:25,969 --> 00:21:28,229
He would go and fetch if you tell him to.

349
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:58,360
I don't think you have time for this.

350
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:00,629
Having no time isn't a problem here.

351
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,870
It's having no cigarettes. Do you have one?

352
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:04,640
I thought you quit for your son.

353
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,410
- What's the problem? - Lighter.

354
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,179
I forgot to bring the lighter.

355
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,110
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

356
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,680
And do you think I'm in such a mood?

357
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,590
What's there to worry about when your father is the vice president?

358
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:23,390
I really feel like punching you.

359
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,059
I guess he's the problem.

360
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,299
I better quit this job as an accountant.

361
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,600
That's a good idea.

362
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,330
You don't have to hear all this gibberish.

363
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
What? Did Sim Hyung Woo say something again?

364
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,440
He wants me to add a new staff...

365
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:43,940
to People's Entertainment's audit team.

366
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,450
When the audit is about to be over? Like who?

367
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,809
Jang Ho Woo.

368
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,279
The high school graduate CPA you picked.

369
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,479
Jang Ho Woo?

370
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:54,849
Did he agree to join the team?

371
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,288
He has no choice as a newbie.

372
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,120
He just does what he is told to.

373
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,539
Jang Ho Woo, come to my office.

374
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,208
Do you know what you have to do...

375
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:47,769
in the audit team for People's Entertainment?

376
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,079
Mr. Woo Sang Hyun told me...

377
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,880
what I need to do is to do nothing.

378
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:56,019
That I need to be as transparent as air...

379
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,420
and report the result to you.

380
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,390
Sang Hyun also recommended you for the job.

381
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,160
How do you know him?

382
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:07,259
I helped him a couple of times with small things.

383
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,029
He wouldn't recommend you for that.

384
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,229
If something goes wrong, he'll be responsible too.

385
00:24:12,459 --> 00:24:13,700
In addition to the financial institution confirmation,

386
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:16,269
you do others' jobs as if they are yours.

387
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,969
So that they will become my job sometimes.

388
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,038
My goal is to become a core talent...

389
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,239
of Taeil Accounting.

390
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,279
Just like you.

391
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:31,150
Regarding Jang Ho Woo,

392
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,449
I'll look into what is going on.

393
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,590
Just follow Sim Hyung Woo's lead for now...

394
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,019
in order to be safe.

395
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:40,029
And stop calling a spade a spade.

396
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:41,959
If I could have done that,

397
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,798
would I have Sim Hyung Woo, the new staff I trained...

398
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,059
as my boss now?

399
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:50,799
- Goodness. - What? Are you leaving?

400
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,808
If I were to finish the audit report,

401
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:54,809
I want to finish it on time.

402
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,580
What a passionate accountant.

403
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,279
Thank you.

404
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,180
I just sniffed it, but it makes me feel much better.

405
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,350
I could keep the promise to my son.

406
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:06,819
See you.

407
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,610
(The company's understanding of the business)

408
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,109
Hey. In my next life,

409
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,509
I wish I could be smart like you.

410
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,008
Then what do you want to do?

411
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:38,519
I'll develop what I've imagined.

412
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,150
- And get patents. - You can do that now.

413
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:43,360
It's too late.

414
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:46,359
There are so many smart people in this world.

415
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,130
How can I develop and get patents before they do?

416
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,699
I mean when I think of something in my head,

417
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,599
it comes into existence before I know it.

418
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,930
Goodness.

419
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,639
I guess manual labour...

420
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,309
is the only way for me to make money.

421
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,708
Because you only think about it.

422
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,880
You have to get your hands on it first.

423
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,919
Forget it.

424
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,548
I will continue to live like this...

425
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,090
until I die quietly one day.

426
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:20,160
How ominous! Knock on the woods.

427
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,899
Good morning.

428
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
- Good morning. - Hello.

429
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,818
Get the numbers,

430
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:52,120
- and check up to decimal points. - Okay.

431
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:00,430
Excuse me.

432
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,299
Can I take a look at the financial statements?

433
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:04,900
Sure.

434
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:06,709
We've read it several times already.

435
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:08,069

Hi.

441
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,370
It says the inventory assets are 42 million dollars.

442
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:39,609
Is it usual for an entertainment company to have that much?

443
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,140
It isn't.

444
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,940
But it's because of the two movies the company has invested in...

445
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,779
and merchandise for their artists.

446
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,910
- Movies and merchandise? - Yes.

447
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,180
- Merchandise? - You know.

448
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:53,090
Fans buy mugs, photo books, and light sticks...

449
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,818
with their star's face on them.

450

- That's the merchandise. - I see.

451
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,389
They've finished shooting the films.

452
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,758
But due to COVID-19 and competitors' films on the lineup,

453
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,200
they are trying to find the right release date.

454
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,899
Anyhow, they are the movies they spent money on...

455
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,399
and goods to sell.

456
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,769
So they are the company's inventory assets.

457
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,670
Why did you ask?

458
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,309
Well.

- What for? - What do you think?

471
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,950
It's because it's his first field.

472
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:02,620
That's what he'd do.

"Nothing" and "Game Changer."

485
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,880
They had previews last year and the year before.

486
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,989
Both films had previews, but they weren't released.

487

It's strange that there's no article about the previews.

00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:12,319
Inventory assets...

502
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:24,600
(Products: Movie Production 1, 2, Goods)

503
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,869
(People's Entertainment Inventory Assets, end of 2021)

504
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:34,350
(People's Entertainment Inventory Assets, end of 2022)

505
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,650
Excuse me for a bit.

506
00:30:44,459 --> 00:30:46,660
You'll work for Sim Hyung Woo?

507
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:49,759
Did you think about it first?

508
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:52,799
Do you even know who he is?

509
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,630
- I do. - You do?

510
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,069
You rejected my offer before figuring out friend from foe?

511
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,708
That sounds like you're saying you're a friend...

512
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:06,340
and Mr. Sim's a foe, which I find incredulous.

513
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:09,549
I won't go into detail, but don't work for Sim.

514
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,819
Get out of there unless you want to get in trouble.

515
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,430
Friend and foe.

516
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:27,170
Do you have to differentiate them?

517
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:32,269
I think it's timing and not people...

518
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:34,309
that decides who becomes what.

519
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,170
What?

520
00:31:36,171 --> 00:31:38,380
If you're against my timing, you're a foe,

521
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,950
and if you benefit my timing, you're a friend.

522
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:47,048
So you're telling me Sim Hyung Woo is your friend right now,

523
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:48,120
and you don't want me to get in the way?

524
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,390
Okay.

525
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,600
Hey, you.

526
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,109
Why won't you hide anything around me?

527
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,979
When you do around others.

528
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,049
Why do you become so brutally honest?

529
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,749
Do you think nothing of me?

530
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,950
Or do you trust me?

531
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,799
Mr. Kang.

532
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,199
What's wrong with an entertainment company...

533
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,199
including its movies and goods in inventory assets?

534
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,169
We're not the only ones to do it.

535
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,039
Why were you unable to release the movies?

536
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,709
We will soon. There are too many competitors.

537
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:51,548
We'll sell it abroad and...

538
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:53,288
Maybe you can't release them.

539
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:54,719
And they won't sell.

540
00:32:55,749 --> 00:32:57,159
- What? - An entertainment company...

541
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,619
can include its movies and goods in inventory assets.

542
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,889
There's no problem at all under ordinary circumstances.

543
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:06,059
But People's Entertainment's movies and goods that you call inventory...

544
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,700
aren't actual assets.

545
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:12,100
It's a trick to cover up your losses!

546
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,279
Mr. Jang.

547
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:22,308
They told the press they'd sell it abroad first,

548
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:23,979
but they didn't actually do so.

549
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,919
The prospective buyer saw the final cut...

550
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,350
and withdrew the offer to purchase.

551
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,819
There are zero buyers?

552
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:31,889
When they spent so much to make it?

553
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,989
Just because they put 30 million dollars into it...

554
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,559
doesn't mean the movie's worth that much.

555
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,700
I think there were problems in the planning stage.

556
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:42,700
What about celebrity goods?

557
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:47,170
A large percentage of them belong to singers who don't perform.

558
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,708
Since their contract with People's still stands,

559
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,910
it's not wrong to call their goods inventory,

560
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,680
but it's very unlikely they'll sell.

561
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,978
What's your proof?

562
00:33:56,979 --> 00:34:00,088
The easy option is to review the singer's general income tax.

563
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:03,120
Which we can't as it goes against the Personal Information Act.

564
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,390
Right.

565
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,730
So I reviewed the withholding tax that the company reported.

566
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,830
That information's public.

567
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,730
Not bad.

568
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:14,930
And?

569
00:34:16,669 --> 00:34:18,100
There's no record of payment.

570
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,339
The singer earned nothing,

571
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,480
so the company paid them nothing?

572
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,310
They didn't pay any tax either.

573
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,649
A singer's tax is proportionate to their popularity.

574
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,219
In other words, they're products with no buyers...

575
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:38,060
and no profitability.

576
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,629
People's Entertainment is all but dead.

577
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,929
I was going to tell you.

578
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,100
When?

579
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,339
After we published the final report?

580
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,210
You won't...

581
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:59,080
put this in your final audit report, will you?

582
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,049
- You won't, will you? - I will if I must.

583
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,379
That's my duty.

584
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,549
Sir.

585
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:11,359
What are you doing?

586
00:35:11,919 --> 00:35:13,759
If you help us out this once,

587
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,028
my People's Entertainment can soar right back up.

588
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:20,100
I, Koo Jun Tak, got this far based on trust.

589
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:24,269
I just need one big break, and once I get that,

590
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,540
I'll repay everything without taking a cent for myself.

591
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,739
We have an opening to breathe.

592
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,879
- "An opening to breathe?" - Yes.

593
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,779
Sang Ah Group...

594
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:42,620
wants to merge with my People's Entertainment.

595
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:45,688
Once that happens, 42 million dollars becomes nothing.

596
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:46,830
Our shares will skyrocket.

597
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:51,160
You'll merge with Sang Ah Group?

598
00:35:51,629 --> 00:35:52,629
Yes.

599
00:35:54,469 --> 00:35:57,798
Why are you so interested in the audit department?

600
00:35:57,799 --> 00:35:58,799
Not me.

601
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:03,140
One of my clients bought People's Entertainment shares.

602
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:09,148
We're in this mess because of...

603
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:11,480
Sang Ah Group's chairman's son.

604
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,988
He doesn't own much in person, but if you include...

605
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:18,290
all the borrowed name accounts, he's the major shareholder.

606
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:26,258
If I could have my way,

607
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:27,899
I'd drop out of the merger altogether.

608
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,270
But I can't.

609
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,238
I must play along to make a living.

610
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:34,469
I can't go out on my own, can I?

611
00:36:34,669 --> 00:36:35,739
Mr. Kang.

612
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,879
I won't do anything like this again.

613
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,450
I really am so remorseful.

614
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,020
If you're remorseful,

615
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:50,859
it's time to be responsible.

616
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,230
This year, I can't give you an unqualified opinion.

617
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:01,000
Mr. Kang!

618
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,430
(VP Han Je Kyun)

619
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,310
Hello, CEO Koo.

620
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,480
Kang Hyun knows everything.

621
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,589
Kang Hyun knows what?

622
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:25,559
That Lee Chan Ju's son caused us a loss.

623
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,689
That we covered it up,

624
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,359
and we're going to merge with Sang Ah Group.

625
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,230
If he says we failed the audit,

626
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,439
we'll all die.

627
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:15,910
What happened today within the People's audit team?

628
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:18,640
Did Kang Hyun meet with anyone else?

629
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:22,109
No, nothing unusual happened within the audit team.

630
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,480
And Mr. Kang didn't meet with anyone else.

631
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:29,850
He left at around three and hasn't returned yet.

632
00:38:30,259 --> 00:38:33,589
I'll check where he is right now.

633
00:38:33,859 --> 00:38:35,560
Don't. I found him.

634
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,210
I'm honoured you asked to see me.

635
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,580
But then, you need People's to get an unqualified opinion...

636
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,850
if you're to broker their merger with Sang Ah Group.

637
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:00,890
If you get that, you know...

638
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:02,890
what to put in the report.

639
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
No.

640
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:09,359
If I didn't know, then maybe, but I can't hide what I know now.

641
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,430
What I'm saying.

642
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,299
Does it sound like a request?

643
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:20,069
Is it a threat?

644
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,739
There's no reason for it not to be.

645
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:26,409
I can't believe we're having this conversation...

646
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:30,649
about saving the hide of a good-for-nothing heir.

647
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:37,089
What should an accountant care for other than their client?

648
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:39,660
The public.

649
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,960
An accountant's audit report is as good as public property.

650
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:49,330
You take home quite a high pay.

651
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,640
Where do you think it's coming from?

652
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,379
The strangers around you whom you don't know?

653
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:58,980
No.

654
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,680
The roughneck rich boy you mentioned.

655
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:06,019
A client like him is giving us money...

656
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,689
to make a living.

657
00:40:09,149 --> 00:40:10,588
Even a dog...

658
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:13,318
doesn't bite its owner.

659
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:14,389
Sir.

660
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,730
Stop it already...

661
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,560
with your petty hero play.

662
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:28,169
Following the principles and common sense is playing a hero?

663
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,009
Why is that?

664
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:34,179
You think nonsense from lectures on accountants' ethics...

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,609
I think he'll turn into somebody.

833
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,609
Teach him well.

834
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,410
You know the ugly duckling grows up into a swan, right?

835
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,120
The ugly duckling, my foot.

836
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,020
Right now, he's just ugly.

837
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:38,160
You seem to quite like him. I'm sure you'll raise him well.

838
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
I'm going.

839
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,689
A disclaimer of opinion.

840
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:21,000
You told me not to worry, but this is the result you achieved?

841
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:27,370
You caused this situation because you couldn't handle one person.

842
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,569
Sorry, sir.

843
00:55:29,169 --> 00:55:31,238
I'll take care of it right away.

844
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:32,239
Take care of it?

845
00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:37,710
Do you not know what kind of place the review room is?

846
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,949
Are you saying we should foolishly edit...

847
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:43,419
a report that has been submitted to the review room?

848
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,460
From now on, Taeil will support...

849
00:55:53,899 --> 00:55:57,029
the disclaimer of opinion as a whole.

850
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,040
It's obvious it'll be publicly announced.

851
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,879
They can't make a correcting disclosure.

852
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:12,520
Accounting firms don't sell reports.

853
00:56:13,549 --> 00:56:16,290
They sell their reputation...

854
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:20,290
for never being wrong in any situation.

855
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:23,559
Then Chairman Lee...

856
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,729
Chairman Lee's son isn't the problem right now.

857
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,460
We have an emergency.

858
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:31,270
If it's a disclaimer of opinion this year,

859
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,738
wouldn't there be an issue with the unqualified opinion...

860
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:35,068
from last year as last year's statements...

861
00:56:35,069 --> 00:56:36,169
were similar to this year's?

862
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:41,649
The shareholders of People's Entertainment may file a suit.

863
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:45,849
If we say this year's disclaimer of opinion is correct,

864
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,890
they'll raise an issue with last year's unqualified opinion.

865
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:52,689
Are you saying we need to prove...

866
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,759
that the conflicting opinions from this year and last year...

867
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,160
are both correct?

868
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,529
It's a spear against a shield.

869
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:05,640
Taeil must win at both.

870
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,739
So...

871
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,439
there's something you need to do from now on.

872
00:57:17,049 --> 00:57:19,379
A disclaimer? What were you thinking?

873
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:21,278
You were supposed to monitor them.

874
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:23,419
What were you doing while Kang Hyun did those things?

875
00:57:23,689 --> 00:57:26,619
There was nothing suspicious until his report to the review room.

876
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,790
Are you joking?

877
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:37,069
You can learn quite a lot...

878
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:39,169
while standing in front of the copy machine all day.

879
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:43,710
A fool that makes copies and shreds documents for others all day.

880
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:46,338
An accountant with no connections, no support,

881
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:47,980
and only a high school diploma.

882
00:57:48,649 --> 00:57:49,809
No one cares about someone like that.

883
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:50,850
(General status of the company, financial status of the company)

884
00:57:51,379 --> 00:57:53,919
Thanks to that, it feels like all of Taeil Accounting's documents...

885
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:56,689
are being reported to me...

886
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:59,390
while I stand in front of the copy machine.

887
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,660
(Advisory department)

888
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,099
(Han Seung Jo, decision to liquidate Haebit Construction)

889
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,910
(Sim Hyung Woo, works for to VP Han Je Kyun)

890
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:19,180
I can see what Taeil Accounting is doing now,

891
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,649
what it will do from now on,

892
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,009
who the person...

893
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,619
controlling Taeil Accounting is,

894
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:28,749
(Advisory Department VP, Han Je Kyun)

895
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,319
and the fastest way...

896
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,520
to get to that person.

897
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,930
(Advisory Department VP, Han Je Kyun)

898
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,559
(Numbers)

899
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,329
How dare you give a disclaimer of opinion?

900
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:20,039
Who do you think will get hurt when things go wrong?

901
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,099
There's a way.

902
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,838
Taeil Accounting will handle the bad debt, disposal,

903
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:26,079
purchase, and sale.

904
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,949
I thought you were doing anything to get on Sim Hyung Woo's good side.

905
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:31,378
Will it give out team an advantage to get the sales team's information?

906
00:59:31,379 --> 00:59:32,979
If the purchasing team hears of the minimum selling price,

907
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:33,980
will you take responsibility?

908
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:35,588
Send Jang Ho Woo to your team?

909
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:37,548
Why do you keep getting involved in my plans?

910
00:59:37,549 --> 00:59:39,688
Who do you think wants that ledger the most?

911
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:42,059
There's no need to get blood on our hands.

912
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,129
You might get hurt if you stay there.
