1
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:39,170


2
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,950
- Mr. Ho Woo! 
 - Well, the thing is...

3
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,260
I...

4
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,100
What's this?

5
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,060
Well...

6
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,950
do you normally not have any boundaries with other people?

7
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,990
People could get distracted at times.

8
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,240
Who cares, right?

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,660
Is it something that embarrassing?

10
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,990
I've never done anything to be embarrassed about.

11
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,950
Then include me too.

12
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,040
I don't usually meddle in other people's work, but

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,880
I also don't want new staff to struggle.

14
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,480
Shall we...

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,010
do it properly this time?

16
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,750
Cooperation.

17
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,650
Do you even know what this is?

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,210
I have an inkling of what it is.

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,970
There are things that are important

20
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,080
to a person's life, such as wealth, fame, power, and love.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,890
There are many things.

22
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,030
You're not the type to chase after power or fame, Mr. Ho Woo,

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,360
but money...

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,370
you are having other thoughts because of money, right?

25
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,770
Maybe it's because of his educational background...

26
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,670
You can't understand the way Jang Ho Woo acts, right?

27
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,200
You know how those who lack a proper education think they're so great. 
    

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,580
That's what I mean.

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,900
Does he think the company is a place for self-actualization?

30
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,150
Who does he think he is to mess up a deal?

31
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,110
In an age where even the chairman would be called a kkondae (old fogey) for self-actualization...

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,390
What a hero.

33
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,050
Don't you think he'll get fired?

34
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,980
We'll have to wait and see about that.

35
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,070
Even if that is true,

36
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,080
you talk about someone else's business too easily.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,730
I didn't say this easily.

38
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,040
My heart is beating so fast right now.

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,510
No.

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,600
It looks easy for you.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,920
Me?

42
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,610
I only did this because you seemed to be having a hard time, Mr. Ho Woo.

43
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,550
Does it really look easy for me?

44
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,060
Yes.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,830
I don't know exactly why you're so serious like this.

46
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,980
All I can do is take a guess.

47
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,450
But...

48
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,740
even if you may be going through a hard time, you shouldn't

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,090
trivialize someone else's sincerity.

50
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,730
I wasn't trivializing it.

51
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,200
This is why I say a blind (anonymous) hire is useless.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,220
What's the point of giving him a chance?

53
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,110
He does whatever he wants, thinking he is so talented.

54
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,650
I don't think they'll hire any more high school graduates due to Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

55
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,460
Of course not. Common sense is part of intelligence.

56
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,210
Getting good scores on the exam isn't everything.

57
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,440
I know.

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,140
I wonder if he has any friends.

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,760
Even if he does, they're probably all high school graduates like him.

60
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,570
They probably all live full of themselves.

61
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,810
Why do you look down on high school graduates?

62
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,990
- Ms. Yeon Ah? 
 - I asked why you look down on high school graduates.

63
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,100
I mean, tell him what he's doing wrong.

64
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,580
Is it right for educated people like you to discriminate by education level and stereotypes?

65
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,100
I mean, why would you get involved, Ms. Yeon Ah?

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,160
My father is a high school graduate, too.

67
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,300
I just got a bit upset.

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,230
Sorry.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,140
In any case, Mr. Ho Woo being a high school graduate isn't a problem.

70
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,540
He's capable and has convictions.

71
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,510
But yes... well...

72
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,930
even from what I can see, he does seem a bit timid.

73
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,580
And he does seem a bit narrow-minded...

74
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,310
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,320
What was that?

76
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,180
Isn't this V.P. Han Je Gyun?

77
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,690
To think I'll see you here...

78
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,070
How long has it been?

79
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,490
Have you been well, Chairman Lee Seong Joo?

80
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,150
I've been well, thanks to you, V.P. Han.

81
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,880
But what brings you here?

82
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,030
He's here for an appreciation banquet hosted by the Taeil Scholarship Association.

83
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,170
By Taeil Scholarship Association,

84
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,640
I assume you mean those you've supported for the past 20 years.

85
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,540
To those in the Taeil Scholarship Association, you would be

86
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,070
someone they should be grateful to for the rest of their lives.

87
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,100
Well, then take care of your business

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,610
and get home safely.

89
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,460
I'll come by to see you soon.

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,810
I have something to discuss with you.

91
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,930
I have something for which I need your discernment and insight, V.P. Han.

92
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,890
I'll contact you and visit you at Taeil Accounting.

93
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,500
   

94
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,470
   

95
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,300
   

96
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,320
 So what is it that you want from me? 

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,640
 You must want something from me, to be doing this. 

98
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,810
 Please let me pass the confirmation hearing 

99
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,400
 for the chairman of the Financial Services Commission. 

100
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
 With your position on the State Affairs Committee, 

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,040
 I think that should be possible for you. 

102
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,460
 "Financial Services"? 

103
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,810
 If you would just do that for me, 

104
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,450
 I will find a reporter who will publish only what you want. 

105
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,280
 "A bipartisan (two parties) agreement between the ruling and opposition parties" 

106
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,130
 "that puts life stability first." 

107
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,500
 Don't you like the title? 

108
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,410
   

109
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,750
Here's the file you asked for.

110
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,200
Why do you think the patent grants were all under the children's names?

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,330
If one wants to pass on their wealth to their children, they would need to pay taxes.

112
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,570
So they set it up so the children could make the money themselves.

113
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,500
It's not teaching them how to fish.

114
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,990
But rather, they are giving them a fish farm full of fish.

115
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,990
People without parents would be so sad.

116
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,610
They believe that's their right.

117
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,730
If they have patents...

118
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,030
They would have a way

119
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,430
without paying a won in taxes.

120
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,030
What are they trying to do after gathering people like this?

121
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,850
Are you crazy?

122
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,100
I should be the one to say that!

123
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,900
You're Project Manager of Deals, yet you go to the airport and break up the deal?

124
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,480
Do you think this is right?

125
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,680
Tell me properly why you did that.

126
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,930
   

127
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,880
They're nothing but a shell.

128
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,800
How could I make a deal like that? So embarrassing.

129
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,180
Good for you.

130
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,430
You're so smart.

131
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,520
Thanks to Han Seung Jo and Jang Ho Woo, the future of our Taeil Accounting is bright.

132
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,080
Which one is how you really feel?

133
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,730
- Your words or your facial expression? 
 - Both.

134
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,090
A deep consideration and compromise between professional honor and human greed.

135
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,170
Can't you tell?

136
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,980
I don't want to know.

137
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,610
Since this bus has already passed,

138
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,050
Jang Ho Woo is quite the character.

139
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,670
You know.

140
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,680
Only those like us who have gained some experience think to doubt the financial statement numbers,

141
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,880
examine more and check the sales.

142
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,700
Did we even imagine doing such things as a new staff?

143
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,690
The financial statements were our religion and the truth.

144
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,440
But Jang Ho Woo doesn't get scared.

145
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,270
How is he able to be like that?

146
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,530
He doesn't believe the numbers to start.

147
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,900
An accountant doesn't believe the numbers?

148
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,130
Then what does he believe?

149
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,570
Hey... what is that facial expression?

150
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,070
What are you up to this time?

151
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,640
I like presents,

152
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,450
but I was a bit surprised because it was unexpected.

153
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,500
So could you explain it to me?

154
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,300
Wouldn't the deal need to fall through in order for you

155
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,940
to take the external audit of Jisan Bank?

156
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,500
Even if it's not right this instant.

157
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,330
What would that mean for you?

158
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,730
I also suffered losses.

159
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,460
"Losses"?

160
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,400
From our accounting firm?

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,960
Yes.

162
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,300
You will soon learn about it, too...

164
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,280
V.P. An.

165
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,520
You're saying that person is also a problem for me.

166
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,320
Right?

167
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,660
Probably.

168
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,880
   

169
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,970
All right.

170
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,380
Then what's next?

171
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,290
The sales deal is over now.

172
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,210
I'm thinking of gathering more people,

173
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,390
like someone else is doing.

174
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,110
This is Deals Department 309.

175
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,960
Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

176
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,490
   

177
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,960
I heard you went all the way to the airport

178
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,900
to tell Chairman Lee Chan Joo not to buy Cake Bean.

179
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,560
Let's hear your reasons.

180
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,290
Not your thoughts right now,

181
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,030
but your thoughts at that moment.

182
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,500
You probably didn't do that with no conviction.

183
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,160
Right before the contract agreement,

184
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,880
I found out about how the head office of Cake Bean manipulated sales by force.

185
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,690
I determined this would be a decisive factor impacting cash flow.

186
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,870
So?

187
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,090
I thought if Sangah Group found out later that we pushed forward with the deal, despite internal defects,

188
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,910
greater losses and risks would be involved

189
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,590
than to lose this current contract.

190
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:32,510
So that's why

191
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,440
you stopped this contract deal.

192
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
Okay.

193
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,120
Okay. We'll have it like that on the written apology.

194
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,170
All right, then how about you tell me now the real reason

195
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,090
for messing with me?

196
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,360
You told me to sell Cake Bean to Sangah Group,

197
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,270
but you told Chairman Lee Chan Joo not to buy it.

198
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:07,040
If you didn't think to sabotage both Chairman Lee Chan Joo and me from the start and divide us,

199
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,220
it would mean you were just toying with us.

200
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,960
This is the last time I let you off easy  because I like your talents.

201
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,250
If you naively overstep your bounds again without fear,

202
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:28,350
I will teach you how cruel a person, who loses

203
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,800
his equanimity and rationality, can become.

204
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,270
Are you threatening me?

205
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,630
Let's say it's a forewarning.

206
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,970
 Yes, V.P. Han? 

207
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,210
Please remove Mr. Jang Ho Woo from major tasks

208
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,260
starting from his current assignment immediately.

209
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,300
 Yes, Sir. 

210
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,450
   

211
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,330
I thought he would get fired, but our V.P. really held himself back.

212
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,060
Is it because he didn't have a legit reason to fire him?

213
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,860
Why do you think company records employees clock in and out?

214
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,790
Being tardy or leaving early isn't a big deal.

215
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,270
It's all so they can use it against you to fire you in the future.

216
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,810
There should be a reason why he's only going this far...

217
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,370
What are you guys doing?

218
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,140
Could I ask you something before I tell you?

219
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,370
Why me?

220
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,310
You could have asked for other things for lending me your name.

221
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:05,920
So why would you ask that while telling me you will retake Sangah Group?

222
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,920
I heard you weren't on good terms with V.P. Han Je Gyun.

223
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,350
I think that explains everything.

224
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,820
The enemy of my enemy is my ally.

225
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,540
He toyed with a large corporation's head and an accounting firm's V.P.

226
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,130
If we use him well...

227
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,390
What should we do about Chairman Lee Chan Joo?

228
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,730
He probably lost faith in us through this ordeal.

229
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,700
We should give Chairman Lee Chan Joo something he needs.

230
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:15,350
It appears there was an oversight with regards to the Cake Bean deal.

231
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,360
I will make sure to oversee things carefully in the future

232
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,330
so mistakes like this don't happen again.

233
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,290
We're sorry, Chairman.

234
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,230
Well...

235
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,070
all right.

236
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,610
What are you doing? Come inside.

237
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,700
Honestly, I would be lying if I said I wasn't upset.

238
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,030
Since you've apologized this way, V.P. Han,

239
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,910
and more importantly, thanks to this accountant running all the way to the airport,

240
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,320
I have no ill sentiment against Taeil Accounting.

241
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,420
I met him in front of here.

242
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,950
It was so nice to see him, and I was so grateful.

243
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,130
V.P. Han, you know him, too, right?

244
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,680
Our accountant, Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

245
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,400
Of course, I do.

246
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,780
He's a great asset to our Deals Department

247
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,350
so I have high expectations

248
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,130
for Mr. Jang Ho Woo as well.

249
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,560
All I did was fulfill the calling and duties of an accountant

250
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,790
that you've often emphasized, V.P. Han.

251
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,320
Now that I think about it,

252
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,650
I think you two resemble each other.

253
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,970
Succession of management rights?

254
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,160
The stock prices are at their lowest right now,

255
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,800
and it is great timing for a succession.

256
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,850
We should also take into account Bo Sung's age.

257
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,330
I mean, that's true,

258
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,950
but the atmosphere these days are just...

259
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:28,130
The bad rumors swirling about Sangah Group can be taken advantage of.

260
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,160
Take advantage of it?

261
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,550
I will explain the details separately in my office in private.

262
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,120
No more being opportunistic.

263
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,230
Make sure to keep in mind what I've told you.

264
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,410
Hey, Lee Seong Joo.

265
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,390
Why are you here?

266
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,540
Well, then I'll await your call.

267
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,130
You rude b*stard! You don't even respond when your older brother asks you a question!

268
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,390
You would ignore me like that?

269
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,740
Gosh, goodness.

270
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,020
Investment is putting it nicely.

271
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,070
It's basically just lending money for interest!

272
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,940
Is Taeil Accounting doing any sort of background checks?

273
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,520
How could they let a loan shark like him in here?

274
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,080
Chairman.

275
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,070
What do you mean, loan shark?

276
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,090
I think in terms of corruption,

277
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,990
I'm nothing compared to you.

278
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,740
What did you say, B*stard?

279
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,190
This b*stard, I'll just...

280
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,630
You're done for, Man!

281
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,690
You should know my relationship with Chairman Lee Seong Joo better than anyone.

282
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,530
I do.

283
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:29,120
As soon as you placed Lee Chan Joo as Chairman, you had Lee Seong Joo kicked out of his position.

284
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,270
Was it Sangah Mill? The flour factory.

285
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:39,660
Demoting someone, who graduated abroad with a business management degree, to run a flour factory...

286
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,250
that was going a bit too far.

287
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,350
If you know that so well...

288
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,430
He who hires and doesn't pay is the problem, not those who pay workers.

289
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,930
That's what you've always said, Father.

290
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,490
This rude b*stard! He didn't even respond when I asked him a question!

291
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,410
Yes.

292
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,320
How would I know?

293
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,590
Does he still not understand that the Heavens choose the firstborn by birth?

294
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,110
Should I just get rid of him, or what?

295
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,280
Why won't I be able to? Of course, I can.

296
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,160
You're saying these things without even thinking.

297
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,470
- Get rid of me? 
 - What the heck? Let go of me!

298
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,810
I was going to run Sangah Group due to an incompetent firstborn.

299
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,550
But you used Han Je Gyun to push me out to a flour factory just as I'd take control!

300
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,470
So how are you any good as the firstborn?

301
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:52,100
Lee Chan Joo. You're only respected outside as a chaebol family firstborn.

302
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,700
What do you know to do by yourself?

303
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,710
Don't you see your son, who is exactly the same as you, only obtaining his bachelor's degree

304
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,700
thanks to his parents and wasting his family's wealth?

305
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,320
F*** you, you b*stard!

306
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,380
I should have just killed you then.

307
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,980
You little...

308
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,880
Since Han Je Gyun took it all away from me,

309
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,160
Accountant Han Je Gyun will also return what's rightfully mine,

310
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,290
not an incompetent one like you.

311
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,710
That son of a b*tch...

312
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,750
I won't let you get away with this.

313
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,900
Where did he go?

314
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,070
Hey, where's my car?

315
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,550
I asked you where my car is, you f***ing b*stard!

316
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,110
Hang up!

317
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,780
You're dead today, you son of a b*tch!

318
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,280
Gosh, that b*stard.

319
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,970
I won't let you get away with this.

320
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,400
Step on it.

321
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,090
I told you not to stop, and step on it!

322
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,750
Gosh, you son of a b*tch!

323
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,890
   

324
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,020
Hey, you punk.

325
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,010
Is this what you should be doing right now?

326
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,650
Getting into fights.

327
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,380
What am I supposed to do when they hit me first?

328
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,610
 I told you to stand up for yourself, not beat them up! 

329
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,100
 They started it with Yeo Jin and Hee Sam! 

330
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,300
So how many times did you hit them?

331
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,640
Just once.

332
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,000
- How many times did you get hit? 
 - I got hit once, too.

333
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,060
You should have hit him more.

334
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,170
Yesterday's enemy can become your friend today.

335
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,920
Whatever you guys do, we'll gain anyway

336
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,860
and hold many cards.

337
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,130
Goodness.

338
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,940
A day will come when you'll get in big trouble due to your temper.

339
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,330
Why don't you just curse me?

340
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,440
Why not a shaman ritual while you're at it?

341
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,850
Hey, you think I did that to Jang Ho Woo for myself?

342
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,800
It's because you were so worried about the performance review–

343
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,270
Are you so good at knowing how I feel?

344
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,490
Then I wonder why you did nothing when Mother-in-law was being mean to me.

345
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,990
Are you a selective idiot?

346
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,440
Why would you bring that up again?

347
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,530
I still feel it's unfair that she thinks only her son is an accountant

348
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,360
and endures struggles by himself.

349
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,440
Just wait until I get promoted.

350
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,620
I will move out.

351
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,970
You said we shouldn't leave work in opposite directions since people think we live together.

352
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,480
Oh, Ha Eun. Let's go with Mommy.

353
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,620
Careful.

354
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,880
Come here, my baby.

355
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,950
You got scared?

356
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,270
   

357
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,580
Acute methanol poisoning?

358
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,070
Yes.

359
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,770
Why would I have something like that?

360
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,930
What about treatment?

361
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,670
I can recover if I do surgery, right?

362
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,200
Right?

363
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,900
I won't go blind or something like that, right?

364
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,950
I'm sorry.

365
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,890
   

366
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,310
   

367
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,700
   

368
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,720
   

369
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:43,140
   

370
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,300
Wait.

371
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,120
   
   

372
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:49,750
 Chairman Lee Chan Joo of Sangah Group crashed his car into the car of Chairman Lee Seong Joo of SA Investment, 

373
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,580
 and the police investigated the incident. 

374
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,830
 Chairman Lee Seong Joo is the second son of the Sangah Group family, 

375
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:00,720
 and it was revealed that he and Chairman Lee Chan Joo fought often over the inheritance. 

376
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,820
 Here is Reporter Ha Ji Min. 

377
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,070
Is this what you call a "War of Brothers"?

378
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,210
 They haven't announced their official position on the matter yet. 

379
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,650
 Currently, Chairman Lee Chan Joo is... 

380
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,450
You surprise me every time I see you ever since I came to Korea.

381
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,250
Are you close enough with Chairman Lee Chan Joo that you'd visit him in hospital?

382
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,450
He's my client.

383
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,920
But you're a mere new staff.

384
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,840
What about you then?

385
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,170
It's also because he's my client.

386
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,990
Tell me the reason next time we meet.

387
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,260
   

388
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,240
   

389
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,950
I came  just to leave this here.

390
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,710
- Don't drink too much now. 
 - Wait, no.

391
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,650
What are you stopping me for?

392
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,900
Why would I stay here where the youngsters are partying?

393
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,530
Yeo Jin should be here any minute now.

394
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,840
- Hurry and put this on. 
 - No–

395
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,400
- There. 
 - Aigoo, this brat.

396
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,510
- How pretty. 
 - Aigoo, what is this?

397
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,830
   

398
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,810
Do you know how wicked a false alarm is?

399
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,880
What a fool. You have no idea it's your birthday tomorrow.

400
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,540
But look at how short-tempered you are.

401
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,460
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.

402
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,640
So how could she know anything about tomorrow?

403
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,050
Grandma...

404
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,520
- Congrats. 
 - Hey, congrats!

405
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,120
All right. Let's go.

406
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,690
Aigoo, she's so happy.

407
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,680
Do you like it?

408
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,230
Yes.

409
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,280
I like it a lot.

410
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,390
When did you have time to get these?

411
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,960
They're very expensive.

412
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,910
I got advice from Ms. Yeon Ah.

413
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,910
Did Ms. Yeon Ah also choose this for you?

414
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,760
   

415
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:48,000
I knew something was going on between you two.

416
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,120
No, she said to give this to Grandma.

417
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,930
What is it?

418
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,430
Wow, hey, this is awesome.

419
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,380
You already have enough supplements.

420
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,170
What good will managing blood sugar levels do for you?

421
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,510
- Please have this. 
 - I need it, too!

422
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,460
Hey, I-I...

423
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,310
I'm not in a great condition lately.

424
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,960
Always scolding me about food...

425
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,100
   

426
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,210
-  Mr. Ho Woo!   
 - Yes.

427
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,670
   

428
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,740
   

429
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,900
What's the meaning of this?

430
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,060
That's what I want to ask.

431
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,090
How did you know I needed all those books and files?

432
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,900
I guess I was being needlessly nosy again.

433
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,320
Also, sorry for looking easy again.

434
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,160
Why are you doing this to me, seriously?

435
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,430
I want to help you.

436
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,210
Do I need a reason?

437
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,200
V.P. Han Je Gyun is being too harsh.

438
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,900
I thought better of him.

439
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,410
What did you think of him?

440
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,280
"Noblesse oblige (noble duty),"

441
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,650
every accountant's role model.

442
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,340
Help yourself. It will get soggy.

443
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,180
When you met Chairman Lee Chan Joo, why didn't you ask who's managing HK Private Equity Fund?

444
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,810
You should have just taken a blind shot.

445
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,370
I did.

446
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:29,480
You did?

447
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,710
 Just stay right behind me. 

448
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,950
 If he has a sense of conscience, V.P. Han shouldn't be able to say anything to me. 

449
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,520
 Let's go. 

450
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,750
 Could I ask you for one more favor? 

451
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:42,830
 What is it? 

452
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:46,090
 Who is A.N., the actual manager of 

453
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,210
 HK Private Equity Fund? 

454
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,940
 Why are you curious about that? 

455
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,590
 Because it's an important matter for me. 

456
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,730
 It's not like you're going to make me money. 

457
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,110
 Why ask who the manager is? 

458
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,430
 Just ask me to sell the country instead. 

459
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,650
 Even I don't know what my money is doing and where. 

460
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:05,340
 If Chairman Lee Chan Joo said that... 

461
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,790
it means the money is transferred at the company level.

462
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,210
It also means the fund manager has actual power, not the deep pocket (wealthy).

463
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,470
The person you called A.N. before?

464
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,720
I thought I was almost there.

465
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,950
You still found out something, thanks to Chairman Lee.

466
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:29,240
And V.P. Han can't harass you anymore because he has to be wary of Chairman Lee.

467
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,410
That's true.

468
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,920
For now, let's dig into Sangah Group's data.

469
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,570
If we look at how the money got put into the fund,

470
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,610
we'll also be able to find a clue about HK Private Equity Fund's manager.

471
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,050
Okay.

472
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,910
   (Property, plant, and equipment: physical assets) 

473
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,780
Oh, I got that.

474
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,420
   

475
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,300
Couldn't it have been out of loans from companies abroad?

476
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,580
"Loans"?

477
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,830
I found Sangah Group's subsidiaries frequently trade among themselves,

478
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,040
like paying off a credit card with another.

479
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,850
It is possible, but loans are money that leaves a mark in the books.

480
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,700
So they're hard to be dispensed freely.

481
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,620
They also need to show they have that money during each year's audit.

482
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,570
Be it slush funds or whatever else, I'm sure they sent it overseas.

483
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,300
So let's first check money sent overseas from Sangah Group in the last ten years

484
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,250
that didn't get returned yet.

485
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,660
For a sum large enough to move a private equity fund across borders,

486
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,310
they can't help but leave a trace in the books.

487
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:48,930
We can save time if we prioritize companies with many fixed assets or foreign stock purchases.

488
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:54,400
Look into big purchases: foreign real estate, stocks, airplanes, or ships.

489
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,920
Yes.

490
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,780
   

491
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,520
   
   

492
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,680
   
   

493
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,730
What's up? Did you find something?

494
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,190
   
   

495
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,370
Accountant Han...

496
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,680
Let's first check the bond distribution status of Sangah Group.

497
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,110
We need to first see who has enough to develop a plan to buy their stock.

498
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,520
In the report, I'll include who holds each bond.

499
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,340
What got you all worked up now?

500
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,460
Are you collecting Sangah Group's bonds?

501
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,850
Just leave if you plan to give me another pointless lecture.

502
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,890
There's something you must see.

503
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,690
What's so weird about a shipping company buying a ship?

504
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,970
The process.

505
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,390
"The process"?

506
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,170
Even if we forget they didn't buy during their ordinary ship replacement period,

507
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,010
they especially registered only this ship in Hong Kong.

508
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,440
Sangah Shipping's other ships are all registered in Korea.

509
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,800
People do that to cut costs sometimes.

510
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,510
Long before they purchased that ship,

511
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,400
Sangah Shipping has been using it.

512
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,610
What do you mean?

513
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,530
They were actually using the ship they supposedly bought on a monthly rent basis.

514
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,130
Just like a rental car or a lease.

515
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,810
But one day, they suddenly bought the rental car, no...

516
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,120
- they bought the ship? 
 - Yes.

517
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,290
Saying they can be trusted since the registration was done abroad.

518
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:18,150
Though the ship is still floating around and what can be seen hasn't changed at all,

519
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:22,630
more than 200 billion won was sent to Hong Kong for the purchase of the ship.

520
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,310
So you're saying that money is...

521
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,180
the slush fund Chairman Lee sent to Sangah Group?

522
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:32,310
It's impossible without the case manager's silent agreement and approval.

523
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:35,360
It could also be she acted like one body with A.N.

524
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,530
A.N.?

525
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,530
The person who manages HK Private Equity Fund's capital.

526
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,630
But I don't know his full name.

527
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,330
Who's the case manager?

528
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,650
It's V.P. An Seung Yeon.

529
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,600
I was in for nothing.

530
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,310
- Why? 
 - It's probably an actual purchase,

531
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,220
not a slush fund.

532
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,220
How can you be sure?

533
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,760
There's no reason.

534
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,720
The reason V.P. An would help Sangah Group form its slush fund,

535
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,510
you have only circumstantial evidence.

536
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,160
Moreover, it's HK Private Equity Fund.

537
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,030
She'd never do that.

538
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,440
You also didn't know V.P. Han Je Gyun would do that to Haebit Construction...

539
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,360
causing Ahjussi to pass away like that.

540
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,200
What did you say?

541
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,940
You have no idea what kind of person An Seung Yeon really is.

542
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,300
What do you know anyway?

543
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:37,870
I know the ship's price is the same amount written on the cash receipt Noona Ji Soo saw in HK Private Equity Fund.

544
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,140
What?

545
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,980
Do you know the saying,

546
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,800
"Profit beats conviction"?

547
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,120
Whom do you think is really the one in the dark?

548
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,910
Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

549
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,140
In France,

550
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,950
this darkness where you can only make out the silhouette,

551
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:28,740
is called the hour between dog and wolf, I heard.

552
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,040
Because it's vague whether what's coming toward me is

553
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,010
the dog I'm raising or the wolf chasing me.

554
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,790
Which one are you,

555
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:42,180
Mr. Jang Ho Woo?

556
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,910
Looks like I'm not the dog.

557
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,370
Is it because of Sangah Shipping?

558
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,760
 It's probably an actual purchase, not a slush fund. 

559
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,170
 How can you be sure? 

560
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,440
 There's no reason. 

561
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,220
 The reason V.P. An would help Sangah Group form its slush fund, 

562
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,960
 you have only circumstantial evidence. 

563
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,260
 Moreover, it's HK Private Equity Fund. 

564
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,840
 She'd never do that. I know her. 

565
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,360
 You have no idea what kind of person An Seung Yeon really is. 

566
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,800
Just a while back, Sangah Shipping had another expense again,

567
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,830
apparently for insurance expenses.

568
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,090
It might be disappointing,

569
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:28,080
but Sangah Shipping made a normal ship purchase and no such thing as a slush fund was found.

570
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,750
For the two years I've been the auditor, there were no problems.

571
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,300
I've no interest in whether you made a mistake or not,

572
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,320
nor does it matter.

573
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,940
Why is it that you're obsessed with Sangah Group's slush fund?

574
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,910
That's how I'll be able to approach...

575
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,120
the actual manager of HK Private Equity Fund.

576
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,310
After that?

577
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,920
Since that's where all misfortune and ill fate began...

578
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,170
I'll bite and tear it apart.

579
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,210
   

580
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,400
I looked into it, but documents such as arrival and departure were flawless.

581
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,860
We can see it in person if it's stationed at a dock.

582
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,100
But it feels like this is a ghost ship.

583
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,790
You said it's hard to see even at docks since it crosses borders.

584
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,480
We need to prove the ship purchase was fake to show

585
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,480
the money used for the purchase was for the slush fund.

586
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,450
That's how we can catch the private equity fund manager.

587
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,930
Mr. Jang Ho Woo, you're not too busy right now, are you?

588
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,610
I'm quite sure V.P. Han told you to take a break.

589
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,320
O-Oh, yes. That's right.

590
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,040
Well, then come outside with us for a minute.

591
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,830
It's because the job will end quicker with more people.

592
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,630
What's the job?

593
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,650
Do you want to come as well, Ms. Yeon Ah?

594
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,460
Let's all take a breather!

595
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,800
"A breather"?

596
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,980
I should have known when they asked if the company had any padded jackets.

597
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,830
All right.

598
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,510
Our new staff somehow ended up together.

599
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,370
A perfect chance to get to know each other.

600
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:28,860
You can introduce yourselves.

601
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,680
What's all that?

602
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,840
Collaterals.

603
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,700
A savings bank loaned 12 billion won with fishery products as their collateral.

604
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,720
It seems the fishermen colluded and gave overlapping items as collateral.

605
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,920
They also lied about having them in a freezer when they didn't have them.

606
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,300
And to file a damages suit based on faulty collateral, we must find out

607
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,020
the extent of damage and detailed value of remaining collateral.

608
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,430
Wait. Does that mean you want us to investigate all those items individually?

609
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:53,750
Yes, that's right.

610
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:56,520
That's why we brought all of you.

611
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,040
Well, Ms. Jin Yeon Ah, I leave our new staff in your hands.

612
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,610
Gosh, it's freezing. Let's go.

613
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,830
Wait, aren't you two doing it with us?

614
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:09,130
Mr. Woo Sang Hyun and I need to go to the savings bank.

615
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,280
I'll call you later.

616
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,520
Good luck.

617
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,260
Ms. Si Young. Mr. Woo Sang Hyun!

618
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,060
My head was all jumbled up.

619
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,390
So this is actually for the better.

620
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,160
Are you telling me to believe that?

621
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,580
It was clearly here until you printed the list of inventory to hand over to the bank,

622
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,460
but you moved them to another warehouse this morning?

623
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,760
Wait.

624
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,840
If it's a warehouse in Ohsung...

625
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,170
don't we have to go more than 200 km from here?

626
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:50,250
It's already so late.

627
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,780
You're messing with the wrong person.

628
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,220
Did you expect us to just accept whatever story you throw at us?

629
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,820
You're wrong!

630
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,120
Let's go, everyone.

631
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,190
Let's go to that warehouse and see if they're there or not.

632
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,780
Ms. Yeon Ah, one second, please.

633
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,170
Gosh, let's see. 
    

634
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:12,360
You moved this much to another warehouse?

635
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:19,190
A 3.5 ton refrigerated truck loads about 320 to 350 boxes.

636
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,830
You must have called at least 10 trucks for this list.

637
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,350
Your payment receipts for the transport.

638
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,010
What?

639
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,120
Let me see the payment receipts for transport.

640
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,230
Oh, the thing is, well...

641
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:40,490
Wait, didn't the freight company give you a receipt for your payment?

642
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,570
Those guys need to get the flame from the National Tax Service to wake up.

643
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:47,240
You know reporting tax evasion comes with rewards, right?

644
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,560
N-No! Wait a second.

645
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,210
Hold on.

646
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,430
All right.

647
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,400
Female and male crabs are all mixed up here.

648
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,760
Those two differ a lot in price.

649
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,670
On the list, you used the high price, which is that of a ripe female crab. 
    

650
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,680
Do they differ in price?

651
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,440
I'm not sure. I don't know, either.

652
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,830
The yield is different too.

653
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:29,950
You mixed in jumbo and large crabs when they differ in price like this

654
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:32,040
and used the jumbo crabs' prices.

655
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,600
What are jumbo and large crabs?

656
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,690
You think I'd know?

657
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,520
What do you say?

658
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,720
Should we have the accountants check the inventory in the other warehouse

659
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,990
while I check the prices of all the items in these boxes?

660
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,010
- Or else... 
 - N-No, no.

661
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,880
It was my mistake.

662
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,700
Your car's not one of the fastest ones today.

663
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,130
We're on our way to work so what's the hurry?

664
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,540
You were awesome earlier.

665
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,170
We would have wasted so much time if not for you.

666
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,870
How do you know all that stuff?

667
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,460
It's hard for a restaurant owner's grandson not to know all that.

668
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,600
Still, I didn't think you'd catch false inventory by the lack of payment receipt for shipping.

669
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,290
Moving assets and people require money.

670
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:31,970
True. They say affairs are caught using toll expenses.

671
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,470
CFS charges? (Container Freight Station loading)

672
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:41,090
Even when you buy a ship and arrive at a dock,

673
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:42,840
you'd have to pay CFS charges, right?

674
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,620
That's probably the case.

675
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,170
Please pull over.

676
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,250
Thank you.

677
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:58,120
Mr. Ho Woo!

678
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:29,520
Mr. Jang Ho Woo, what kind of rude–

679
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,400
I thought my explanation was sufficient for you to understand.

680
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,740
   

681
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,890
What is this?

682
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:40,870
If Sangah Shipping really purchased a ship in Hong Kong as you said,

683
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:43,850
they had to report it

684
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,940
as imported goods to the customs.

685
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,910
But you didn't do so, V.P. An,

686
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,170
since there was no need...

687
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,880
or a means to do so.

688
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,370
Which is because

689
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:02,020
that ship wasn't purchased but borrowed

690
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:05,500
from the very start.

691
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,750
- Mr. Jang Ho Woo... 
 - The 200 billion won slush fund

692
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,820
you sent to HK Private Equity Fund, didn't you?

693
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,800
- I... 
 - A.N.!

694
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,550
Will you...

695
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:23,670
Will you still deny the fact that you're HK Private Equity Fund's...

696
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,860
fund manager?

697
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,430
Sure.

698
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:33,930
The ship...

699
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,940
It's true that it wasn't purchased.

700
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,170
It's also true that I formed...

701
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,000
a 200 billion won slush fund.

702
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:48,520
However, I'm not the person you're seeking.

703
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:54,360
If I was,  how would you explain the recent transfer of funds out of Sangah Shipping?

704
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,170
I no longer have any relation to Sangah.

705
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:03,640
- Then why did the 200 billion won...
 - That is...

706
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,380
You said an accountant also takes responsibility for the process, not just the result!

707
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,700
What's the meaning of all this?

708
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,390
I said I'll come down to you.

709
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,140
Mr. Jang Ho Woo, let's discuss the rest later–

710
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,870
   

711
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,620
   

712
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,590
 Why isn't she coming? 

713
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,980
   

714
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,130
Hey, what's the matter?

715
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,080
 I'll... 

716
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,980
 bring you the evidence. 

717
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,340
You two can...

718
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,370
talk about the rest.

719
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:15,950
It seems, we'll have to watch today's performance on a different date, right?

720
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:19,150
So who is it? This person called A.N.

721
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,980
I've got nothing to tell you,

722
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,900
Han Seung Jo.

723
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:43,040
 However, I'm not the person you're seeking. 

724
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,240
 If I was, how would you explain the recent transfer of funds out of Sangah Shipping? 

725
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,660
 I no longer have any relation to Sangah. 

726
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:06,040
The best end to a stressful day is a can of beer.

727
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,710
How did you get this in here?

728
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,230
Hurry and drink it.

729
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,130
Come on.

730
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,530
Are you allowed to leave these at work?

731
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:25,930
Isn't it against the rules?

732
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:29,220
I'll gladly get fired if I get caught. It's their loss.

733
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,120
It's like a first aid kit.

734
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,840
Some days you need bandages, and

735
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,410
there are days when you need to let go.

736
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,610
Each symptom calls for a different treatment.

737
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,430
Many other things are in my locker besides this.

738
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:50,220
What about when you want to just drop everything because you're overwhelmed?

739
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,650
When it feels you're walking in circles.

740
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:45,230
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

741
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,370
No.

742
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,690
This is an old case.

743
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:00,320
   

744
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,140
   

745
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,030
 Refer to the contents of this document... 

746
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:13,680
 and find out who has each patent type owned by HK Private Equity Fund. 

747
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,370
   

748
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:25,900
   

749
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,430
   

750
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,020
   

751
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,970
By MRG,

752
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:43,310
the government will guarantee a minimum revenue for private investors,

753
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:46,330
when they're constructing stuff like roads and railroads?

754
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,680
Yes, since they're doing the government's work for them.

755
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,020
They're allowed to collect tolls, and the rest is covered with tax money.

756
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,940
And the lower the percentage,

757
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,320
the better it is for our client.

758
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,050
Of course, since our client is the government.

759
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,780
That's how the tolls will be cheaper for people,

760
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,320
and there will be less burden on taxes.

761
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,250
Why? Is something wrong?

762
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,880
   

763
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,130
Why is the arrow going up, not down?

764
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,130
That's weird.

765
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,290
 Just like what you said... 

766
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,560
 if I really was AN, 

767
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,890
 wouldn't I have developed a long-lasting, secretive income system, using the immense power 

768
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:41,860
 of Taeil Accounting, instead of purchasing a ship? 

769
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,550
 Ever so strangely, people are able to 

770
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,680
 take on losses 

771
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,010
 if they're cut into many small parts. 

772
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,220
I don't know which fund it is, but they must have collected big tax money.

773
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,900
It's a 30-year contract so they're probably still collecting.

774
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,540
Gosh, this is infuriating.

775
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:10,110
Who the heck made such a horrendous mistake?

776
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:12,530
It wasn't a mistake,

777
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,880
since the private investor must be HK Private Equity Fund.

778
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,550
How did you know that?

779
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,600
   

780
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,810
Blue.

781
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:53,870
 Yes. 

782
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,190
 Because we're hit with recession and higher interest rates, 

783
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:02,130
 there will be tons of businesses in financial crisis 

784
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:04,470
 for sale in the market. 

785
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:11,480
 It wasn't A.N. 

786
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,430
 It was Han. 

787
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:18,510
 Should HK Private Equity Fund ever miss a great opportunity 

788
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:21,360
 like this one? 

789
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:26,480
Han Je Gyun.

790
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:44,490
   

791
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,190
   

792
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:07,110


793
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:14,220
♫  Please tell me why, find out the truth you wanted  ♫

794
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:19,460
♫  Find again the dreams that you've forgotten  ♫

795
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:24,210
♫  Focus your mind, see deep inside  ♫

796
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:30,060
♫  I will call out in the midst of it for all to see  ♫

797
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,830
   

798
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:37,260
 Now both need to risk everything to stop Han Je Gyun. 

799
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,790
 Is Han Seung Jo helping as well? 

800
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:41,130
 Don't let them know that we know. 

801
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,890
 I believe you owe me something, A.N. 

802
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:45,210
 Are you threatening me? 

803
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:47,120
 You should stop now. I'll stop him this time. 

804
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,580
 I believe Accountant Han Seung Jo is different. 

805
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,840
 You know there's something between the two. 

806
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,010
 I will consider this as my payment for using your name. 

807
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,260
