1
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,387
   

2
00:00:34,737 --> 00:00:36,527
 Is anyone home? 

3
00:00:38,427 --> 00:00:40,727
Are you here, Mr. Yoon Moo Il?

4
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,190


5
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:51,597
Who is it?

6
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:03,957
You knew how to speak?

7
00:01:06,547 --> 00:01:10,097
W-Wait, hold on a second. Let's talk just for a second!

8
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,677
Is Mr. Yoon Moo Il inside, by chance?

9
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:16,877
 Excuse me. Excuse me. 

10
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:25,897
 Why are you looking for my father? 

11
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:31,137
I wanted to hear from the survivor of the Sangah Construction building collapse,

12
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:34,367
about the construction site 20 years ago.

13
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:38,057
Due to that collapse, my father has a disability,

14
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:42,477
and he still can't speak well from the trauma.

15
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:47,217
Moreover, my father doesn't recall anything about the collapse.

16
00:01:47,747 --> 00:01:50,037
I'm sorry, but we can't help you.

17
00:01:51,557 --> 00:01:52,817
I see.

18
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:54,837
That's too bad.

19
00:01:56,597 --> 00:02:01,127
By the way, how did you get to work in Taeil's company café?

20
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,377
Why did I pretend to be deaf?

21
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:07,117
 If Vice President An Seung Yeon resigns soon, then what happens to us? 

22
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:09,407
 I want all the data on Han Je Gyun. 

23
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:13,727
 No one was wary of my father, who became deaf. 

24
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:16,407
 So I used that to my advantage. 

25
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:21,377
 My real job is to deliver to V.P. Han Je Gyun the information I collect secretly 

26
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:23,827
 at the café. 

27
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:28,277
Because it could be money or power, depending how and on whom he uses info.

28
00:02:28,277 --> 00:02:32,877
That was the company café's purpose from the start, which Han Je Gyun created.

29
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:36,797
And I was able to graduate, thanks to Taeil Scholarship Association.

30
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,757
 This is the sight at Jisan Bank this morning. 

31
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:46,507
 A crowd gathered starting when it opened at 9 a.m. 

32
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:50,937
 Most of the crowd were elderly, who don't go to work in the morning, 

33
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:56,217
 but after lunch, quite a lot of young people in their twenties and thirties. 

34
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,437
 I'm Reporter Lee So Eun reporting. 
   

35
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:03,407
Three days?

36
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:08,037
In three days, we won't have money to give to people who come to withdraw their funds?

37
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:11,027
Three days is the maximum estimate.

38
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:17,027
Why don't we set a limit on how much they can withdraw, such as three or five million won?

39
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:19,677
That's like advertising that we've run out of money!

40
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:23,437
It's because we might have to send customers back empty-handed.

41
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:27,927
I was sure it was calming down.

42
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:30,997
Shouldn't we sell our treasury bills at least?

43
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:35,597
That's our most liquid investment.

44
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:43,587
Yes, Ms. Yeon Ah.

45
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:45,987
 Where are you right now? 

46
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:49,637
Is something wrong? Why do you sound like that?

47
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:52,787
Our BIS ratio fell below 8%.

48
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:55,167
We're now subject to auction.

49
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:58,317
What do we do now?

50
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:01,597
Both my dad and I...

51
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:04,357
   

52
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:10,027
Dropping the BIS ratio by using a bank run...

53
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,477
What a strategy.

54
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:14,187
If Han Je Gyun takes over Jisan Bank...

55
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,337
restructuring will be his first order.

56
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:21,857
It's also a matter of time before Han Je Gyun does as he pleases with the national economy.

57
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:26,517
Do you think my dad didn't know things would turn out like this?

58
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:31,627
He's worked with V.P. Han Je Gyun for so long.

59
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,767
I told you this before, right?

60
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:39,587
There are people who actually raised me.

61
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:40,737
Yes.

62
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:43,817
CEO Jang In Ho of Haebit Construction was one of them.

63
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:46,027
"Haebit Construction"?

64
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:49,577
The company that was liquidated and closed down?

65
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,937
Yes.

66
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:57,817
That was my first task when I came to Taeil Accounting.

67
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:00,037
I remember as it was my first bid.

68
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:03,587
But he was the one who raised you?

69
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:07,187
He was more or less a father to me.

70
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:10,717
But he passed away,

71
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:12,967
due to Han Je Gyun.

72
00:05:14,987 --> 00:05:18,757
He was greedy for Haebit Construction's patent...

73
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:22,057
which is why he did that to the company.

74
00:05:23,147 --> 00:05:28,477
Thus, you were so resolved to find HK Private Equity Fund's manager, right?

75
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:32,137
That was my reason for becoming an accountant

76
00:05:32,137 --> 00:05:34,287
and getting into Taeil Accounting.

77
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:38,557
I can't just sit and watch Han Je Gyun

78
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:41,147
devour Jisan Bank whole,

79
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:44,787
just as much as you can't.

80
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,307
Did you two have a fight?

81
00:05:58,307 --> 00:06:00,487
That's nonsense.

82
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:04,207
Don't you see all those soju bottles?

83
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:07,317
I'm sure there's something.

84
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,937
Ms. Yeon Ah.

85
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,237
Ms. Yeon Ah, are you okay?

86
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:20,527
She's hopeless.

87
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:23,637
- I'd get beat up if I asked Yeo Jin again, right? 
 - Yes.

88
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:29,077
Yeo Jin said she will lock you up if you do that one more time.

89
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:40,667
If they dump the treasury bills for a cheap price,

90
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,447
their situation will only worsen.

91
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:49,527
Has President Jin Tae Soo lost his touch (skill)?

92
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:51,907
Well, that must be

93
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:57,507
how desperate Jisan Bank's situation has become, right?

94
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,607
What a problem.

95
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:05,417
What's the Financial Services Commission's perspective on

96
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:08,027
the recent bank run at Jisan Bank?

97
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,707
It's not just Jisan Bank's problem alone.

98
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:15,177
If a chain reaction drags in other banks as well,

99
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:21,527
a second IMF (International Monetary Fund) incident is imminent.

100
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:28,527
It's not like we can recklessly pour in public funds.

101
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:33,637
This thing called a breakthrough...

102
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:39,477
you can only get it by thinking outside the box, right?

103
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:48,727
There's a certain private equity fund looking for investment opportunities.

104
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:55,067
If you're interested,

105
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:00,037
I'll tell you more in detail next time,

106
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:04,267
and we can put it on the board. What do you think?

107
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,467
Well, we'd be thankful.

108
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:28,147
What's this?

109
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:39,697
Do you have time to be drunk like that?

110
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:47,037
Makes me not want to thank her for letting me sleep over.

111
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:54,547
I heard about Haebit Construction from Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

112
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,907
About what happened and...

113
00:08:56,907 --> 00:09:01,247
what Han Je Gyun did to your father.

114
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:05,937
Please help me so V.P. Han Je Gyun can't

115
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:08,677
take over Jisan Bank.

116
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:11,357
Both as HK Private Equity Fund's rep in Korea and

117
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:14,227
as the daughter of Haebit Construction's CEO Jang In Ho,

118
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:17,267
you've got plenty of reasons to stop Han Je Gyun.

119
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,737
Five years ago, when Haebit Construction was struggling,

120
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:28,617
what did President Jin Tae Soo do?

121
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,907
Wasn't he a bystander?

122
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,547
What would you do if you were me?

123
00:09:38,657 --> 00:09:41,357
What President Jin Tae Soo needs right now

124
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:45,807
isn't a lovely daughter but a trustworthy

125
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,357
and competent accountant.

126
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,327
If you want to resolve this matter,

127
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:00,347
President Jin Tae Soo must decide first.

128
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:04,477
Because he needs to let the world know that their first steps were wrong to begin with.

129
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:10,657
Right now, I don't think my dad is the same person I knew.

130
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:15,507
If a private equity fund and an accountant make a deal,

131
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,927
nothing is impossible in this world.

132
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:23,957
When the person with money is on the same side as the person with a cause,

133
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,227
who could beat that?

134
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:28,867
That's why...

135
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:34,327
we have a job to do.

136
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,627
I'm sure they're anxious.

137
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:42,047
Stuff like this rarely happens, even once in a lifetime.

138
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,207
If people go to Jisan Bank to withdraw their money, will the bank have money to give them?

139
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:49,667
How can Jisan Bank not have money?

140
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:53,067
It's not like all banks have tons of cash in their vaults.

141
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,157
They make a living out of net interest profit.

142
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:59,937
So they need to invest here and there to pay their employees and the interest on deposits.

143
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:01,337
That's what I'm saying.

144
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:06,237
For now, worrying won't solve a thing. Let's figure out what we can do from our end.

145
00:11:06,237 --> 00:11:07,227
"What we can do"?

146
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:13,407
It's true I'm worried about Ms. Jin Yeon Ah. But honestly, a private equity fund acquiring a bank is nonsense.

147
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,517
It's obvious what will happen.

148
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:19,497
A healthy company might go bankrupt overnight.

149
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:22,837
Serial bankruptcy of subcontracting companies and resulting unemployment.

150
00:11:22,837 --> 00:11:25,957
Some major companies will be bought out by overseas holders, too.

151
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:30,357
It's not like money has nationality, but it'll still leave a bitter taste.

152
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,367
Will the list of loans from Jisan Bank become the book of life and death?

153
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,677
We need to stop that from happening.

154
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:39,717
First, let's first check the bank's detailed sales process.

155
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:44,427
Then we can plan how to stop him and at what stage of the process.

156
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:40,897
Do you take care of your own garden?

157
00:12:41,757 --> 00:12:44,737
It shows when the owner doesn't maintain them personally.

158
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:48,667
There is much to do, even if your garden is the size of your palm.

159
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,207
You need to pull the weeds

160
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:53,827
and kill the pests.

161
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:58,807
I met you last time, Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

162
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:03,577
And you're also a junior from our accounting firm?

163
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:06,217
I'm Senior Associate, Jin Yeon Ah, Chairman.

164
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,297
It's nice to meet you.

165
00:13:08,297 --> 00:13:09,527
And this lady is?

166
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:15,107
I'm sorry for the late introduction. I'm Joyce Jang from HK Private Equity Fund.

167
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:22,267
I came here today as I must tell you about V.P. Han Je Gyun.

168
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:29,107
What's the reason HK Private Equity Fund came to visit me along with accountants

169
00:13:29,107 --> 00:13:32,077
from our accounting firm?

170
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:36,677
V.P. Han Je Gyun has violated the prohibition of holding concurrent positions

171
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:40,887
and is working as HK Private Equity Fund's manager.

172
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,457
Is that really true?

173
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:47,757
And you two are also aware of this?

174
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:51,707
Circumstantial evidence shows he used insider info of the firm in the private equity fund.

175
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:55,997
Some can be proven as well. And if this is leaked to the public...

176
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:57,607
That can't happen.

177
00:13:57,607 --> 00:14:01,927
Compared to what will happen soon, this is a trivial matter.

178
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:04,407
Because it's a national crisis.

179
00:14:05,837 --> 00:14:08,567
What's that about now?

180
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:20,267
 I already knew that Mr. Ho Woo entered Taeil Accounting with a motive. 

181
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:23,727
I only had a vague inkling there must be a reason.

182
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,557
But I had no idea  of such a thing...

183
00:14:25,557 --> 00:14:32,277
You must also have realized what it means for Jang Ho Woo to protect Jisan Bank from V.P. Han Je Gyun, right?

184
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:35,007
And for you as well, Director Han Seung Jo.

185
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:49,547
We agreed to focus on Jisan Bank outside of work hours.

186
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:52,477
So pull yourself together, too, Ms. Jin Yeon Ah.

187
00:14:52,477 --> 00:14:54,447
Thank you.

188
00:14:54,447 --> 00:15:00,477
Right now, the most certain fundamental solution to protect Jisan Bank is to secure deposits.

189
00:15:00,477 --> 00:15:02,767
Money doesn't rain from the sky.

190
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:06,407
Where will we find such a large amount of money as a secure deposit?

191
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:08,257
From other banks.

192
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:11,457
Sorry?

193
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:15,637
People won't keep the money they withdrew from Jisan Bank at home.

194
00:15:15,637 --> 00:15:18,467
So that money went into other banks.

195
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:21,357
That's why other banks are quiet even during a bank run.

196
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:25,167
Because Jisan Bank's misfortune is their prime time.

197
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,367
That means if we just bring that money back...

198
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:32,747
Will other banks willingly hand money over?

199
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:35,137
We'll make them open their hands.

200
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,417
Han Seung Jo.

201
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:40,397
I get what you're saying, and I think it's quite a decent idea–

202
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,257
It won't be easy, of course.

203
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:47,527
Since the core issue of our offer is telling them to give up the instant reward and share future risks.

204
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:49,427
We can't help it anyway.

205
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:53,877
If this is the only way to rescue Jisan Bank, we'll have to try.

206
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:57,257
All right. Let's move now then.

207
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:58,557
Hi, President Jin. 
    

208
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:03,237
I'm Son Hye Won from Taeil Accounting, who was on the TF (Task Force) with you for three days last time.

209
00:16:03,237 --> 00:16:06,067
Have you had time to view information I sent?

210
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,987
Then is anyone else available?

211
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:11,167
Yes! I'll be there right now.

212
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:15,997
If you listen to me carefully, you'll see it's not against Citizens Bank's deposit policy.

213
00:16:15,997 --> 00:16:19,180
Let's all do a risk hedge (prevent) together.

214
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,260
   

215
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,717
To explain one more time...

216
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,597
   

217
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:30,087
Why would Taeil Accounting's accountant want to see me?

218
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:33,847
I heard you used to be quite close to Accountant Shim Hyung Woo,

219
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:37,377
the first recipient of the Taeil Scholarship Association, which you're part of.

220
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:41,447
Why discuss someone who passed away due to a tragic accident?

221
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:46,217
I don't know what you're trying to do, but I advise you against it.

222
00:16:46,217 --> 00:16:49,887
Hyung Woo doesn't deserve to be treated this way.

223
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:52,217
I will never forgive you.

224
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:57,987
What if Accountant Shim Hyung Woo was killed, not in an accident?

225
00:16:57,987 --> 00:16:59,247
What are you saying?

226
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:04,687
What if it was actually clearly a murder, not an unlucky accident?

227
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:07,587
- You wouldn't forgive that, either, would you? 
 - Do you have proof?

228
00:17:07,587 --> 00:17:12,437
When Accountant Shim Hyung Woo died, I was also at the scene with him.

229
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:17,587
I'm the survivor and the proof itself.

230
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:21,467
   

231
00:17:21,467 --> 00:17:23,357
When will you finish?

232
00:17:23,357 --> 00:17:25,527
I'm still hours away.

233
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,127
Gosh, why?

234
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:30,337
Stop talking. Your hyungnim is quite busy finishing this all.

235
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:34,197
You don't drink or eat with us these days. What's wrong?

236
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:36,717
- Must you go this far? 
 - What do you mean?

237
00:17:36,717 --> 00:17:41,697
I mean, you just need to let the Korean press know. Why bother with the foreign press?

238
00:17:41,697 --> 00:17:46,517
Because you never know. I need somewhere out of Han Je Gyun's reach.

239
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,327
Someone needs to let the world know.

240
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,777
   

241
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:54,197
Okay. The English one is sent now.

242
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:56,487
You can make him do the Chinese one so we can eat sooner.

243
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,597
- What? 
 - Aigoo.

244
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:00,827
I just need to write this in Chinese?

245
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:02,747
Yes, that's right, but...

246
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,517
Move over.

247
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,647
What do you think he did when you studied to be an accountant?

248
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:11,107
He couldn't even watch TV in the living room. And he has the brains.

249
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:14,277
I'm sure he can read and write quite fluently.

250
00:18:14,277 --> 00:18:16,127
You know Japanese, too, right?

251
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,677
Of course (in Japanese).

252
00:18:17,677 --> 00:18:20,287
See? He knows all of them.

253
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,587
   

254
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:26,837
   

255
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:32,127
Who is this fellow?

256
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:35,437
I'm Jang Ho Woo from Taeil Accounting.

257
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:41,347
It's because you wouldn't listen to me no matter what I said.

258
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:48,017
You need to realize what Han Je Gyun tries to do to you and your bank,

259
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:54,637
more than the fact that he's HK Private Equity Fund's manager.

260
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:56,507
What do you mean?

261
00:18:56,507 --> 00:18:59,637
Han Je Gyun wants Jisan Bank.

262
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:04,617
Starting from forcing you to take a P2P online lender with so much debt

263
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:07,167
and everything to the bank run. 
    

264
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:12,047
Because Han Je Gyun was preparing for a long time, we likely can't escape the crisis itself.

265
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:13,717
However...

266
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:17,007
there's still a way.

267
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:15,227
   

268
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:23,267
I'll see you shortly on the conference call for advice on the purchase.

269
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:25,687
Yes. Good job.

270
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:28,537
Vice President?

271
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:36,857
Accountants Han Seung Joo and Jang Ho Woo seem to be behaving out of the ordinary.

272
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:41,437
Okay.

273
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:55,667
 Jang Ho Woo's recent actions... not making any moves. 

274
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:24,357
Since Jisan Bank's case is irrelevant to the bank's fundamentals,

275
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:29,077
I think it's better to plead for a higher limit on the eligible collateral (funds).

276
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:33,617
I'll review it and find a similar case abroad.

277
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,677
   

278
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:29,507
   

279
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:41,957
Mr. Ho Woo.

280
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:44,137
Yes, Ms. Si Young?

281
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:47,107
It's a direct order from V.P. Han Je Gyun.

282
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:51,007
   

283
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:54,567
I got it just now as well. 
    

284
00:22:56,147 --> 00:23:00,657
He's more or less firing me, right?

285
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:07,037
Don't worry about it. Important matters like HR take at least a month before going into effect.

286
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:08,947
So let's think of a way during that time.

287
00:23:08,947 --> 00:23:12,477
It's okay. I saw this coming.

288
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:16,457
For now, I'll wrap up what I was working on first.

289
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:22,017
So?

290
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:25,247
Did you all find a way to rescue Jisan Bank?

291
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:34,027
As soon as he qualifies to be a major shareholder, V.P. Han Je Gyun will take over Jisan Bank, right?

292
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:38,407
Father will pass an ethical screening process to see if his morals

293
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,217
are good enough to own a bank?

294
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:42,467
Because...

295
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:45,527
banks are that important to people.

296
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:49,277
Couldn't we still have some hope?

297
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:54,387
Even if HK Private Equity Fund secured more than 50% of Jisan Bank's shares...

298
00:23:54,387 --> 00:23:58,577
once the Financial Services Commission sees how unethical they are...

299
00:23:58,577 --> 00:24:01,987
It's better not to trust the Financial Services Commission.

300
00:24:02,437 --> 00:24:05,417
It's more or less owned by Han Je Gyun.

301
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:13,427
- Thank you. 
 - Eat a lot, all right?

302
00:24:16,597 --> 00:24:18,907
There, let's have a shot.

303
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:27,557
Since two out of the nine Financial Services Commission members were...

304
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:30,237
recommended by the chairman of the commission,

305
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:35,837
if you get on the chairman's good side, three people are on your side.

306
00:24:35,837 --> 00:24:40,477
And once you secure just two more, it'll pass by majority vote.

307
00:24:40,477 --> 00:24:46,757
From choosing candidates for chairman to passing the confirmation hearing,

308
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:49,137
it was all done by your father.

309
00:24:53,597 --> 00:24:57,307
I didn't know he had put in this much effort.

310
00:24:57,307 --> 00:25:00,187
When selling and buying banks...

311
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:03,987
the final approval comes from FSC (Financial Services Commission).

312
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:07,387
So he probably needed a puppet of his own.

313
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:11,397
I should have found a solution quickly.

314
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,877
That's my job.

315
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:18,127
I have a plan.

316
00:25:37,917 --> 00:25:39,667
What's this? Where do you think I'm going?

317
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:44,117
You're going to the Major Shareholder Qualification Review at FSC because you're worried about Noona.

318
00:25:44,117 --> 00:25:45,447
I feel the same as you.

319
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:47,197
Me, too.

320
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:21,387
As ordered, I've secured all of the commissioners.

321
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:37,947
   
   

322
00:26:57,107 --> 00:27:02,017
Wait, wasn't the review supposed to take place here?

323
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:04,877
Did the location or the time change?

324
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:07,097
Didn't you get any notice?

325
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:13,447
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

326
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:15,997
What's going on?

327
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:24,907
- Yes, Hyung. 
 - Today's Qualification Review got canceled.

328
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:28,457
- It was postponed indefinitely out of nowhere. 
 - "Postponed indefinitely"?

329
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:31,337
 Do you know something? I've never seen this happen before. 

330
00:27:31,337 --> 00:27:33,377
Hang up for now.

331
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:36,187
Postponement of review?

332
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,967
Without even contacting me, the person to be reviewed...

333
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,957
What's the meaning of this?

334
00:27:40,957 --> 00:27:45,427
I can't contact anyone related to the review... not even the secretaries.

335
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:49,977
I think he canceled it intentionally to stop you from attending the review.

336
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:52,437
He got ahead of us again.

337
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:07,827
If they postpone the review indefinitely, isn't it also a bad situation for V.P. Han Je Gyun?

338
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:10,407
The bank's ownership isn't getting transferred.

339
00:28:10,407 --> 00:28:15,387
He already has more than 50% of the shares so he can probably act as the owner even now if he wants to,

340
00:28:15,387 --> 00:28:16,987
although it'd be temporary.

341
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:21,287
It'll be difficult to just wait for the review since there are processes.

342
00:28:21,287 --> 00:28:23,787
Whom are you worrying about now?

343
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:26,267
He must be waiting for the perfect timing.

344
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:29,467
The perfect timing for V.P. Han Je Gyun?

345
00:28:30,407 --> 00:28:32,817
It's not now, but it works later.

346
00:28:32,817 --> 00:28:37,067
If the conditions aren't changing, it must mean the people are changing.

347
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:39,207
For example...

348
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:43,827
the person who's supposed to be reviewed.

349
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:45,297
Joyce Jang?

350
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:47,857
   
   

351
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:52,027
 V.P. Han Je Gyun is only stalling for time until the next review, 

352
00:28:52,027 --> 00:28:58,017
the time to select a new Korean rep who will obey in place of Joyce Jang.

353
00:29:06,737 --> 00:29:10,907
Did you tell Noona the real reason V.P. Han Je Gyun

354
00:29:10,907 --> 00:29:12,947
postponed the review?

355
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:16,417
I plan to tell her today in person.

356
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:19,207
I'm sure she will prepare in her own way.

357
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:21,177
It'd be too infuriating as things are.

358
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,577
Don't be infuriated.

359
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:31,367
Time is what Han Je Gyun needs the most right now.

360
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:34,827
Don't give Han Je Gyun the time he needs.

361
00:29:34,827 --> 00:29:36,127
Time...

362
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:38,057
For example...

363
00:29:38,057 --> 00:29:41,307
an unexpected Major Shareholder Qualification Review.

364
00:29:42,377 --> 00:29:44,887
But will that be possible?

365
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,857
This is Jang Ho Woo.

366
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:04,327
Now, then I'll see you at the next gathering.

367
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:29,967
   

368
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:32,037
   

369
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:39,457
   

370
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:48,407
What kind of rude stunt are you pulling?

371
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:51,547
The real thing is about to begin now.

372
00:30:51,547 --> 00:30:54,637
Must you raise your voice already?

373
00:30:55,647 --> 00:31:01,167
Because HK Private Equity Fund's industrial capital is more than 25% of its entire capital,

374
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:06,017
it can't own Jisan Bank per current banking laws, as you all know.

375
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:08,427
Although the 25% quota was met

376
00:31:08,427 --> 00:31:12,427
by the date of document submission by selling some assets,

377
00:31:12,427 --> 00:31:16,497
it's also only a temporary trick, as you all should know.

378
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:22,237
And I'm sure you all know this proceeded with HK Private Equity Fund

379
00:31:22,237 --> 00:31:25,657
as the buyer from the start without

380
00:31:25,657 --> 00:31:28,287
any competitive bidding or due diligence,

381
00:31:28,287 --> 00:31:30,267
which are common practices.

382
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:35,707
Even if you don't do this, we were going to pass HK Private Equity Fund

383
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:39,150
as a majority shareholder in tomorrow's review–

384
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,830
No.

385
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,687
It's the opposite.

386
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:46,637
"The opposite"?

387
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,030
   

388
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:07,057
What's going on? What happened? It didn't go well?

389
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,537
Of course not.

390
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,997
You probably know Jisan Bank already.

391
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:27,227
These are Citizen's Bank.

392
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:34,587
I think all the banks that need to show up are here.

393
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:49,747
It's pretty much a done deal that HK Private Equity Fund has taken over Jisan Bank.

394
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:54,007
So why did you bring us here? What's the point?

395
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:55,817
That is true. However,

396
00:32:55,817 --> 00:33:01,397
if HK Private Equity Fund takes over Jisan Bank, then who will be next?

397
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,157
Best Bank?

398
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:05,307
Hansol?

399
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:09,217
I suppose it could be Citizen's Bank or Doosan Bank as well.

400
00:33:09,217 --> 00:33:11,467
It's just a matter of time and order.

401
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:14,837
All the banks here will have to face that danger.

402
00:33:14,837 --> 00:33:20,887
All the private equity funds around the world have seen Jisan Bank go down.

403
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:30,157
I was nearing the end of my term as president then

404
00:33:30,157 --> 00:33:33,917
and was forced to acquire a P2P online lender,

405
00:33:33,917 --> 00:33:38,927
which led to this current situation with Jisan Bank.

406
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:44,137
The one responsible for all that took place in the past year

407
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:48,957
and schemed to take over Jisan Bank is HK Private Equity Fund,

408
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:52,507
who intentionally approached us for that purpose.

409
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:58,637
All of this resulted from my greed and lack of caution.

410
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:02,067
Please tell us who is behind this!

411
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:03,517
Can you tell us more?

412
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:05,117
Who is behind this?

413
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:07,247
Please tell us!

414
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:15,267
   
   

415
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:29,277
We will now start the majority shareholder qualification review for the sale of Jisan Bank.

416
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:37,197
The Korean representative of HK Private Equity Fund.

417
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:39,617
Yes.

418
00:34:39,617 --> 00:34:44,357
You have not been imprisoned in the last year

419
00:34:45,437 --> 00:34:49,487
and even after Jisan Bank is sold,

420
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:52,947
you plan to run it following national laws, correct?

421
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:54,767
Yes.

422
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:59,587
And of course, you will pay taxes responsibly, right?

423
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:01,737
Yes, that is correct.

424
00:35:03,197 --> 00:35:05,207
V.P. Han!

425
00:35:05,207 --> 00:35:07,577
What's the matter?

426
00:35:08,237 --> 00:35:12,237
The Major Shareholder Qualification Review is taking place right now.

427
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:16,297
Say that again.

428
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:20,837
Major Shareholder Qualification Review is taking place right now.

429
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:27,717
Finally, if you have anything to say, please do so.

430
00:35:27,717 --> 00:35:30,947
The rumors on the streets about HK Private Equity Fund

431
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:34,547
using illegally obtained information through lobbying

432
00:35:34,547 --> 00:35:38,267
to buy and sell companies as they wish,

433
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:41,047
the rumors of them being a corporate hunter...

434
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:44,857
Those rumors are true.

435
00:35:49,267 --> 00:35:51,897
We have done so up to now,

436
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:56,097
and even after we purchase Jisan Bank,

437
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:58,597
we plan to continue.

438
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,707
 The opposite? 

439
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:07,557
 Please ensure that HK Private Equity Fund won't pass the review 

440
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:10,287
 by deciding based on the law and principles 

441
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:12,947
 so HK Private Equity Fund cannot 

442
00:36:13,477 --> 00:36:15,747
 acquire Jisan Bank. 

443
00:36:18,607 --> 00:36:20,967
 That is my threat. 

444
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:32,367
In conclusion, the result of HK Private Equity Fund's

445
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:36,897
Jisan Bank Major Shareholder Qualification Review is...

446
00:36:40,837 --> 00:36:42,240
ineligible.

447
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,280
I declare they have failed to pass.

448
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:16,107
If you act like this,

449
00:37:16,107 --> 00:37:18,117
it will be hard for us both.

450
00:37:18,117 --> 00:37:21,397
You think I came this far without taking that into account?

451
00:37:21,397 --> 00:37:26,027
All I need to do is go through another Major Shareholder Qualification Review.

452
00:37:26,027 --> 00:37:31,947
No matter how you try to interfere, Jisan Bank will be in my hands after all.

453
00:37:31,947 --> 00:37:34,177
No, you're wrong.

454
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:37,877
There won't be another Major Shareholder Qualification Review.

455
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:41,267
Jisan Bank's BIS ratio has stabilized at 8.4%

456
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:44,647
so it will no longer be sold. 
    

457
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:51,217
V.P. Han Je Gyun, it means you can never have Jisan Bank. 
    

458
00:37:51,217 --> 00:37:53,147
   

459
00:37:58,107 --> 00:38:00,477
 A bank run is a psychological matter. 

460
00:38:00,477 --> 00:38:04,717
 It's a fight against the fear and anxiety spreading like wildfire from fake news. 

461
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:08,157
 Thus, it's most vital to suppress in its early stages, 

462
00:38:08,157 --> 00:38:11,527
 and apart from boosting public trust, it really has no solution. 

463
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:14,037
 Do you know what the people are like these days? 

464
00:38:14,037 --> 00:38:17,047
 You think they'll trust you just because you tell them? 

465
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:22,347
 Well, then I think we should show them in a tangible way. 

466
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:32,927
 One risk but five solutions. 
   

467
00:38:32,927 --> 00:38:36,477
 A coalition of five commercial banks... 

468
00:38:36,477 --> 00:38:38,667
 I propose to you a consortium. 

469
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,567
   

470
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:49,577
 If a bank run takes place at any of the five banks, the other four banks will provide that bank with spare funds. 

471
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,957
 So you're telling us to create accounts at other banks? 

472
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,007
 Yes, that's right. 

473
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:58,227
 In order to withstand a bank run, which shakes the basic pillars of a bank, 

474
00:38:58,227 --> 00:39:02,907
 unconditional and immediate cash support is necessary. 

475
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:06,607
 If we give a bank just a bit of time to protect their BIS ratio, 

476
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:11,187
 if we just help a state-owned enterprise not be sold for coins and survive, 

477
00:39:11,847 --> 00:39:15,917
 something so ridiculous as a century-old bank 

478
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:19,467
 shutting down in just three days won't ever happen. 

479
00:39:25,977 --> 00:39:31,737
Can you explain to me why I must forgive you no matter what just because you're my son?

480
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,787
You will have to sell all the stocks you hold.

481
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:37,927
The Financial Services Commission will likely order to dispose of your shares,

482
00:39:37,927 --> 00:39:41,737
but for you, V.P. Han Je Gyun, who can't have the bank,

483
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:45,147
those stocks are useless pieces of paper.

484
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:16,737
You've gone through a lot, Dad.

485
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:19,927
I'm sure it wasn't easy for you to gather the courage.

486
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:24,187
Your father is ashamed to face you, my daughter.

487
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:27,127
Why would you say that?

488
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:32,947
I think the bank situation was resolved well.

489
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:34,607
Yes.

490
00:40:41,457 --> 00:40:45,507
I think things are resolved now.

491
00:41:04,397 --> 00:41:06,207
 Thank you, Chairman. 

492
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:09,277
Thanks to you, the review went well.

493
00:41:09,277 --> 00:41:11,747
 Good work. 

494
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:19,087
You did well.

495
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:32,147
 Can you get a feel for what Han Je Gyun is like now? 

496
00:41:32,147 --> 00:41:36,407
 I also realized there is something only you can do, Chairman. 

497
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,367
 Let's get started right away. 

498
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:39,937
 Yes. 

499
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,727
 You want a Major Shareholder Qualification Review to be held? 

500
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,327
This is something my grandson bought me.

501
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,977
Try one.

502
00:42:03,977 --> 00:42:06,037
Supposedly, it's good for you.

503
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:07,887
Well, I...

504
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,157
Aigoo, geez.

505
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:12,827
Oh, yes.

506
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:29,577
It so happened that I was worried about my blood sugar levels

507
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:32,607
so thank you for sharing something so valuable with me.

508
00:42:32,607 --> 00:42:37,697
But... are you really a professor?

509
00:42:37,697 --> 00:42:39,407
Pardon?

510
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:40,457
   

511
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:44,317
 Thank you for the food. 

512
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:52,647
Ms. Cheon Ja. Do you see that accountant with big eyes?

513
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,237
They all look pretty to you, right?

514
00:42:56,237 --> 00:42:59,267
Yes. That's right.

515
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:02,287
Come on. Try looking again.

516
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:07,287
You see that accountant with long hair, big eyes, and pinkish clothes...

517
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:11,637
She is the accountant Ho Woo likes!

518
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,797
My Ho Woo likes someone?

519
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:26,097
Actually, she's my grandmother.

520
00:43:26,097 --> 00:43:28,657
Oh, I see.

521
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,267
Ho Woo said he likes and respects you a lot,

522
00:43:33,267 --> 00:43:37,187
and to serve you lots of extra food!

523
00:43:37,187 --> 00:43:39,307
Me? Suddenly?

524
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:42,437
Please eat up.

525
00:43:42,437 --> 00:43:43,557
- Okay. 
 - Yes.

526
00:43:43,557 --> 00:43:45,817
Thank you.

527
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,177
What is it?

528
00:43:49,177 --> 00:43:52,957
Why did you stop in the middle of talking?

529
00:43:52,957 --> 00:43:55,197
So?

530
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:59,057
Ho Woo even brought her to "Africa" several times.

531
00:43:59,057 --> 00:44:02,757
Ho Woo's eyes were so full of affection,

532
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:05,027
the way he looked at Yeon Ah!

533
00:44:05,027 --> 00:44:08,817
The name of the person Ho Woo likes is Yeon Ah?

534
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,327
Pink?

535
00:44:16,327 --> 00:44:18,247
G-Grandmother...

536
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:19,507
Long hair?

537
00:44:19,507 --> 00:44:21,880
G-Grandmother!

538
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:25,697
We should celebrate!

539
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,387
You, too?

540
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,447
I mean, well...

541
00:44:36,447 --> 00:44:38,537
Thanks for the food!

542
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:45,467
How's the business feasibility study that we were working on?

543
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:49,397
Well, since most of the costs were variable costs and almost no fixed costs,

544
00:44:49,397 --> 00:44:52,867
it's not hard to estimate the cost, but it's a bit difficult to estimate sales.

545
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:54,977
Then how about separating P and Q (price, quantity)?

546
00:44:54,977 --> 00:44:57,707
Also, check ads for tourist attractions nearby.

547
00:44:57,707 --> 00:45:00,757
We are in the middle of checking, and we've done a preliminary check.

548
00:45:00,757 --> 00:45:03,817
We've requested cooperation with the tax department for the tax part.

549
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:05,307
Great work.

550
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:08,667
So who's out in the field for the on-site inspection?

551
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,357
Coming here makes me think of you, Director.

552
00:45:12,357 --> 00:45:14,057
 Why would you think of me? 

553
00:45:14,057 --> 00:45:18,237
Don't say nonsense and just take care of the person next to you.

554
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:20,057
I was just worrying about you.

555
00:45:20,057 --> 00:45:23,267
I'm worried if you're working properly, Director.

556
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:25,867
Worry about yourself and just enjoy your time out there.

557
00:45:25,867 --> 00:45:27,657
You got that?

558
00:45:27,657 --> 00:45:29,237
Yes.

559
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,097
Wouldn't there be something unique, like a corporate tax reduction for agricultural corporations?

560
00:45:36,097 --> 00:45:37,577
Yes, it's possible.

561
00:45:37,577 --> 00:45:39,887
I think we should check that part too.

562
00:45:39,887 --> 00:45:41,117
Also–

563
00:45:41,117 --> 00:45:44,887
Mr. Ho Woo, do you want to take a selfie?

564
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:46,947
We're here for an on-site inspection...

565
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:48,587
Why do you keep playing hard to get?

566
00:45:48,587 --> 00:45:50,217
Let's just take a photo.

567
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:52,117
Oh, okay.

568
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:54,887
All right. V!

569
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:57,107
- "V"? 
 - Yes, V.

570
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,697
You should smile.

571
00:46:00,697 --> 00:46:03,067
I haven't taken many selfies before.

572
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:05,097
One, two, three!

573
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,347
Ms. Yeon Ah is so lucky.

574
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,987
It's only an on-site inspection by name.

575
00:46:08,987 --> 00:46:11,307
It's pretty much like going on a picnic.

576
00:46:11,307 --> 00:46:14,017
- Are you jealous? 
 - Should we have offered to go?

577
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:16,587
It's not too late for you to go right now.

578
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:17,567
Pardon?

579
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:21,430
I'll give you the company card so go and eat tasty food, too.

580
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,547
Really?

581
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:26,367
You two didn't get to rest on the weekend as we were pursuing the bank consortium for Jisan Bank.

582
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,557
Take this chance to have fun.

583
00:46:27,557 --> 00:46:31,517
Then you should come with us, Director. You've worked the hardest.

584
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:34,697
Yes, come with us.

585
00:46:34,697 --> 00:46:36,547
Do I look like I would go to such a place?

586
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:38,557
I hate stuff like that.

587
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,060
- What are you writing down? 
 - You surprised me!

588
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:56,037
Looking at this will give you the answer? 
    

589
00:46:56,037 --> 00:46:58,767
You need to experience it for yourself.

590
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:01,977
What are you guys doing in two rows? Follow me.

591
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,437
I thought you'd only say you'll come and not show up, but you're actually here.

592
00:47:11,437 --> 00:47:13,117
Yes.

593
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,007
What? What are you looking at?

594
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:20,697
What the heck?

595
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,337
Ms. Yeon Ah, look at that.

596
00:47:33,337 --> 00:47:35,637
It's so pretty.

597
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,087
Why turn yourself in?

598
00:47:40,087 --> 00:47:45,537
If in the future, we want to prove that HK Private Equity Fund

599
00:47:45,537 --> 00:47:48,517
clearly has no right to buy Jisan Bank,

600
00:47:48,517 --> 00:47:52,357
there's no other way unless I undergo a prosecution investigation.

601
00:47:52,357 --> 00:47:53,727
But still...

602
00:47:53,727 --> 00:48:00,277
Since I hold some responsibility for HK Private Equity Fund's illegal acts,

603
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,527
I've been thinking ever since I came to Korea

604
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:06,917
of taking responsibility together.

605
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,327
Now, it's Han Seung Jo's turn to wait for me.

606
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,927
What are we having for dinner later?

607
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,077
When did those two get so close?

608
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:33,767
Ji Soo says she will turn herself over to the prosecution.

609
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,067
Noona said that?

610
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,907
Since that's the only way to make V.P. Han Je Gyun take responsibility for his crimes.

611
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,857
That sounds like Jang Ji Soo.

612
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:54,867
Honestly, I also have something to tell you, Accountant Han.

613
00:49:01,327 --> 00:49:04,147
It doesn't seem something that requires my permission.

614
00:49:08,397 --> 00:49:11,477
   

615
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,667
How much did he complicate and twist this?

616
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,657
It will show up only if you follow the money, not the person.

617
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,757
I'd be grateful if you could help me prove it,

618
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,257
but will you be okay, Accountant Han?

619
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:42,287
He's still your father.

620
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,037
It's because he's my father.

621
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:51,807
Hello. You are Reporter Bae Soo Yeon of Fact Check, right?

622
00:49:51,807 --> 00:49:53,147
Yes.

623
00:49:53,147 --> 00:49:56,527
I was the one who reported the tabloid company.

624
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,497
My name is Jang Ho Woo.

625
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,877
♫  I will show you from now on  ♫

626
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:09,237
♫  Please tell me why, find out the truth you wanted  ♫

627
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:14,467
♫  Find again the dreams that you've forgotten  ♫

628
00:50:14,467 --> 00:50:19,167
♫  Focus your mind, see deep inside  ♫

629
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:22,427
♫  I will call out in the midst of it for all to see  ♫

630
00:50:22,427 --> 00:50:23,697
   

631
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,347
Han Je Gyun didn't send me.

632
00:50:28,347 --> 00:50:32,027
I'm a family member of CEO Jang In Ho

633
00:50:32,027 --> 00:50:35,367
of Haebit Construction, whose autopsy results you manipulated.

634
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:43,257
   

635
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:50,887
I wanted to find out what went wrong so I became an accountant.

636
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:54,907
And I ended up all the way here.

637
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:04,377
This is the last chance for you to fix what you did wrong.

638
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,707
   

639
00:51:11,707 --> 00:51:15,247
♫  Find again the dreams that you've forgotten  ♫

640
00:51:15,247 --> 00:51:16,917
   

641
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:19,837
♫  Focus your mind, see deep inside  ♫

642
00:51:19,837 --> 00:51:22,457
Seeing how you recognize what this is right away,

643
00:51:22,457 --> 00:51:28,467
it was you who told the foreign press what Han Je Gyun did.

644
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,187
Here...

645
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,167
Thanks to what you did, 
   

646
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:37,977
this is an email from global forums asking for

647
00:51:37,977 --> 00:51:41,017
Taeil's public position and a solution.

648
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:43,427
Without appropriate followup measures,

649
00:51:43,427 --> 00:51:48,617
it appears they threaten to take away our membership rights.

650
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,847
If you want to maintain Taeil's brand value,

651
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:57,697
you must listen to what they're asking.

652
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:03,617
I can't just sit back when I know exactly what Han Je Gyun will do to our country

653
00:52:03,617 --> 00:52:06,047
if he takes over the bank.

654
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:09,807
As a Taeil accountant,

655
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:13,937
I must stop that.

656
00:52:19,277 --> 00:52:22,437
What is it that you do exactly?

657
00:52:22,437 --> 00:52:26,177
I work as a barista at the company café

658
00:52:26,177 --> 00:52:28,827
in Taeil Accounting.

659
00:52:28,827 --> 00:52:32,277
Actually, I am not deaf or mute.

660
00:52:32,277 --> 00:52:35,637
Why I ended up working at Taeil Accounting's company café,

661
00:52:35,637 --> 00:52:39,097
that only accepts deaf employees,

662
00:52:39,097 --> 00:52:41,757
is because of V.P. Han Je Gyun,

663
00:52:41,757 --> 00:52:44,687
who wants company information.

664
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:55,137
How did you plan for a reporter from Taeil Scholarship Association to interview the barista?

665
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:59,987
They were both hurt and used by V.P. Han Je Gyun

666
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:03,927
so I thought they'd understand each other's feelings.

667
00:53:04,897 --> 00:53:07,427
   

668
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:12,387
♫  I still hope you're coming  ♫

669
00:53:15,847 --> 00:53:20,327
♫  I still hope you come back home  ♫

670
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:26,947
   

671
00:53:26,947 --> 00:53:29,767
This is the evidence that proves V.P. Han Je Gyun

672
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:34,757
used and spread fake news and tabloids to initiate a bank run.

673
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:38,367
Apart from the private organization, Taeil Scholarship Association,

674
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:40,767
he also used a private company to spread them.

675
00:53:40,767 --> 00:53:44,377
He used a paper company to make the payment.

676
00:53:44,377 --> 00:53:46,577
"A paper company"?

677
00:53:46,577 --> 00:53:49,237
Han Je Gyun has that?

678
00:53:51,497 --> 00:53:55,877
The reason I gathered all of you partners in a rush

679
00:53:55,877 --> 00:54:00,547
is due to the scandal between V.P. Han Je Gyun and Jisan Bank.

680
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:04,097
We'll need to come to an agreement on where we stand on this.

681
00:54:04,097 --> 00:54:07,037
Then I assume you all agree,

682
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:11,017
and I recommend that we dismiss V.P. Han Je Gyun

683
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:12,927
as the Deals Department Director.

684
00:54:13,767 --> 00:54:17,767
Dismissal of a director is a special matter at a shareholders' meeting

685
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:22,997
so at least 75% of the directors need to agree in order to take a vote.

686
00:54:22,997 --> 00:54:25,467
Instead of setting another date,

687
00:54:25,467 --> 00:54:28,337
let's decide here and now.

688
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:34,587
   

689
00:55:01,427 --> 00:55:04,807
   

690
00:55:04,807 --> 00:55:06,667
   

691
00:55:18,127 --> 00:55:20,647
 Did Han Je Gyun use patents to offer bribes 

692
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:25,727
to people in politics, the media, and financial institutions

693
00:55:25,727 --> 00:55:28,837
in order to acquire Jisan Bank?

694
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:30,267
Yes.

695
00:55:30,267 --> 00:55:32,907
I personally delivered them myself.

696
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,167
I have a detailed record of

697
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,687
what I delivered to whom.

698
00:55:39,687 --> 00:55:41,457
Though you've turned yourself in,

699
00:55:41,457 --> 00:55:45,817
you do know that you may also be punished for this, right?

700
00:55:45,817 --> 00:55:47,357
Yes.

701
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:50,707
I know.

702
00:55:50,707 --> 00:55:55,557
You're saying you were almost killed with Accountant Shim Hyung Woo by arson.

703
00:55:55,557 --> 00:55:57,107
Yes.

704
00:55:57,837 --> 00:56:00,217
By this man in this picture?

705
00:56:05,077 --> 00:56:06,537
Yes.

706
00:56:06,537 --> 00:56:09,827
- And all of this– 
 - All of this

707
00:56:10,917 --> 00:56:13,647
was V.P. Han Je Gyun's doing.

708
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:20,667
Did you hear about V.P. Han Je Gyun?

709
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:23,177
Maybe we got eavesdropped on at the café.

710
00:56:23,177 --> 00:56:25,727
Breach of duty and trust? Are you serious?

711
00:56:25,727 --> 00:56:26,687
I know.

712
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:30,877
I mean, how could our company V.P. do this?

713
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:42,800
   

714
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,587
   

715
00:56:44,587 --> 00:56:45,897
   

716
00:56:45,897 --> 00:56:47,507
   

717
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:56,447
People's Ent's ledger manipulation, creating a slush fund at Haebit Construction,

718
00:56:56,447 --> 00:57:00,567
breach of duty, violating the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act,

719
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:02,897
accounting fraud...

720
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,807
If you're indicted on just these charges,

721
00:57:04,807 --> 00:57:08,117
you couldn't see the outside world for a while.

722
00:57:08,117 --> 00:57:10,607
But you seem quite at ease.

723
00:57:12,357 --> 00:57:14,507
Is that so?

724
00:57:19,297 --> 00:57:22,897
How many of these will you be...

725
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,607
able to prove?

726
00:57:26,307 --> 00:57:28,317
You're right.

727
00:57:28,317 --> 00:57:33,257
It wasn't easy to face off against an accountant with 30 years of experience.

728
00:57:33,257 --> 00:57:35,427
Thanks to you, I underwent much trouble.

729
00:57:35,427 --> 00:57:39,277
So I got someone's help.

730
00:57:39,277 --> 00:57:40,947
   

731
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:47,307
Taeil's Accountant Han Seung Jo,

732
00:57:47,307 --> 00:57:50,247
who happens to be your son, Han Je Gyun.

733
00:57:56,287 --> 00:57:58,147
   

734
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:09,247
   (Property, plant, and equipment: physical assets) 

735
00:58:16,977 --> 00:58:20,667
For turning yourself in, preventing a major financial crime of a bank being illegally acquired,

736
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:22,437
and for cooperating with the investigation,

737
00:58:22,437 --> 00:58:24,537
you were given a suspension of indictment,

738
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:29,287
but please be aware that additional investigations may occur anytime.

739
00:58:49,957 --> 00:58:53,537
Ms. Hye Won, how is our smart speaker evaluation case?

740
00:58:53,537 --> 00:58:57,337
It's before the activation of the market. Some difficulties arise with estimates.

741
00:58:57,337 --> 00:59:01,277
For future market forecasts in foreign academic journals,

742
00:59:01,277 --> 00:59:07,197
why don't we use the market size from there and assume the market share will stay consistent?

743
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:09,727
I think that's a good idea.

744
00:59:09,727 --> 00:59:12,427
Then shall we wrap it up like this?

745
00:59:14,557 --> 00:59:16,027
Oh, right. Mr. Ho Woo,

746
00:59:16,027 --> 00:59:20,837
I think a man came to see you in the lobby earlier.

747
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:22,647
Me?

748
00:59:27,037 --> 00:59:29,467
 If you weren't sick now, would that be normal? 

749
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:31,737
 If it were me, my mind and body wouldn't be fine. 

750
00:59:31,737 --> 00:59:35,817
My body is fine. It's just I've got a lot on my mind.

751
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:39,547
Okay. Hang up for now.

752
00:59:47,457 --> 00:59:49,317
Who is it?

753
00:59:50,897 --> 00:59:52,877
Who is it?

754
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:13,337
Should you be drinking when you don't feel well?

755
01:00:13,337 --> 01:00:14,887
Oh, I feel fine.

756
01:00:14,887 --> 01:00:17,927
This is just something I took out while cleaning.

757
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,167
 We find him guilty of not only trying to illegally buy a bank, 

758
01:00:27,167 --> 01:00:30,547
 but also using his social position and accounting skill 

759
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:34,007
 to throw the national economy into chaos. 

760
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:37,897
 Based on the law for aggravated punishment of specific economic crimes, 

761
01:00:37,897 --> 01:00:42,787
 Defendant Han Je Gyun shall be sentenced to 10 years in prison. 

762
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:55,180


763
01:01:59,337 --> 01:02:03,487
   

764
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,467
 I thought you might be seeking this. 

765
01:02:05,467 --> 01:02:07,747
 Are you okay or pretending to be fine? 

766
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:10,097
 Now that I've left Taeil, 

767
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:11,707
 let's move to another position. 

768
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:13,307
 It's Jaehan Holding's info I received... 

769
01:02:13,307 --> 01:02:17,507
 I wonder if this is simply slush funds siphoned abroad. 

770
01:02:17,507 --> 01:02:18,657
 I'm not the only one who's got the hunch, right? 

771
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:21,527
 You're right. It's Han Je Gyun's borrowed-name account. 

772
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:22,607
 Congratulations on being pardoned. 

773
01:02:22,607 --> 01:02:24,327
 Did it reset all his crimes? 

774
01:02:24,327 --> 01:02:28,457
 A crime once punished cannot be held liable again. 
   

775
01:02:28,457 --> 01:02:30,737
 Was Jaehan Holdings taken care of? 

776
01:02:30,737 --> 01:02:33,937
 An urgent issue arose, and I must discuss it with you. 

777
01:02:33,937 --> 01:02:38,607
 It appears V.P. Han Je Gyun wasn't just sitting still in prison. 

778
01:02:38,607 --> 01:02:42,900
♫  It's time for me to show my strength; you just see  ♫
