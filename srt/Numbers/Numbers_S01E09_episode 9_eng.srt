1
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:39,180


2
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,797
Director Shim Hyung Woo!

3
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:45,667
- Director Shim Hyung Woo! 
 - Jang Ho Woo!

4
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:48,317
Here! Hurry!

5
00:00:50,107 --> 00:00:53,707
Here! Jang Ho Woo!

6
00:01:04,137 --> 00:01:06,527
Hey, you b*stard!

7
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,767
Mr. Yang!

8
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,887
Help Yang Jae Hwan first.

9
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:50,307
What is this? What about Shim Hyung Woo?

10
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:52,207
He's inside the warehouse.

11
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:21,987
   

12
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:33,977
 We found him. 

13
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,590
   

14
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,447
How does this make any sense, Sunbae?

15
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:56,877
I've seen all sorts of things while working at Taeil for 10 years

16
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:59,537
so I thought nothing would surprise me now.

17
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:01,917
How could a person die?

18
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:05,847
Hey, Han Seung Jo. Say something.

19
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:08,997
How can someone die like this?

20
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,567
And what about you, Mr. Jang Ho Woo?

21
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:15,067
You know something, right?

22
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,777
- Why aren't you saying anything? 
 - Sung Min...

23
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:20,147
You saw him a few days ago, too, Sunbae.

24
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:23,437
Something was definitely up with Shim Hyung Woo!

25
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,467
I should have forced him to tell me then

26
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,197
and stopped him...

27
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,467
I'm sorry.

28
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,647
Why is it for you to be sorry about?

29
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:38,037
But...

30
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,717
think about it.

31
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:42,807
You guys could have died on the site.

32
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:46,987
All the accountants here could be

33
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:51,357
over there instead of Shim Hyung Woo.

34
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,927
Still many accountants don't care that a colleague died

35
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:02,687
because they're so focused on their own performance.

36
00:05:03,237 --> 00:05:06,267
See how many colleagues didn't even show up.

37
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,897
No matter how much we try to find out,

38
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:11,447
it will be buried away quickly.

39
00:05:13,537 --> 00:05:17,007
Ms. Hye Won, you should go to Mr. Jae Hwan now.

40
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:19,557
He's probably in the hospital by himself.

41
00:05:19,557 --> 00:05:22,227
I'll go in a bit.

42
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:24,817
I just feel so sorry.

43
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:27,307
No, you should go right now.

44
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:30,037
I'll walk you to the front.

45
00:05:32,687 --> 00:05:35,247
- Hello. 
 - Great work.

46
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:38,500
- You guys are going through a lot. 
 - Thank you.

47
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,790
   
   

48
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,047
It appears V.P. Han Je Gyun is coming.

49
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,577
It's about time.

50
00:05:49,577 --> 00:05:52,957
- And he even brought his minions with him. 
 - Pardon?

51
00:05:52,957 --> 00:05:56,407
The people from Taeil Scholarship Association. Don't you know?

52
00:05:56,407 --> 00:05:59,307
Quite a few accountants in our firm are from there.

53
00:05:59,307 --> 00:06:01,577
Some are in Financial Services Commission, Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the media.

54
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,737
Taeil Accounting paid for their scholarships.

55
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:07,227
It's funny how they're only loyal to V.P. Han Je Gyun.

56
00:06:07,227 --> 00:06:10,937
Who... is that?

57
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:06,267
 Here! 

58
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:11,597
What's wrong?

59
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,787
Are you okay?

60
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,407
 Only burn the warehouse. 

61
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,147
 Leave this behind. 

62
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:34,077
 - The order was... 
 - I'll take care of it so do as I say. 

63
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,550
   

64
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:27,597
 There wasn't anything special, but we got the laptop. 

65
00:08:28,297 --> 00:08:29,637
Okay.

66
00:08:29,637 --> 00:08:31,757
   

67
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:34,867
   

68
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:45,627
 Well, I'm sorry about what happened during the Special Shareholders Meeting. 

69
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:49,517
If you wait for the right time as the second major shareholder

70
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,450
of Sangah Group, I will–

71
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,680
 If it was undercover, maybe. 

72
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:56,857
But it's too boring to wait without doing anything.

73
00:08:56,857 --> 00:09:00,867
What are you planning?

74
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:02,617
A plan?

75
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:06,157
Will a plan be needed for the idiotic father and son,

76
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:08,787
Lee Chan Joo and Lee Bo Sung?

77
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:21,947
 The customer is not answering the phone. You'll be connected to voicemail. 

78
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:24,367
Is he really busy?

79
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,950
   
   

80
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:35,337
Is it a date?

81
00:09:35,337 --> 00:09:37,137
Unfortunately, not yet.

82
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:39,617
Who is it?

83
00:09:39,617 --> 00:09:41,977
You should tell me now and confess.

84
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:44,337
Not yet, I'll tell you later.

85
00:09:44,337 --> 00:09:46,117
Aigoo, goodness.

86
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:49,727
What I know for sure is he's very capable and righteous.

87
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:51,177
What?

88
00:09:51,177 --> 00:09:53,557
"R-Righteous"?

89
00:09:56,307 --> 00:10:01,337
Isn't being good at his work enough? He also has to be righteous?

90
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:05,447
Wow, my daughter, you've got high standards.

91
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:08,707
By chance, is he the love

92
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:12,197
that involved that request before?

93
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:13,747
Yes.

94
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:17,937
I like this one.

95
00:10:17,937 --> 00:10:19,947
Isn't this one too tacky?

96
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:22,757
This looks a lot more righteous.

97
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:24,207
Come on, Dad.

98
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:28,217
It wouldn't be good if you're righteous but look tacky.

99
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:31,967
Well, then how about you just give up on righteousness?

100
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,807
Geez.

101
00:10:37,277 --> 00:10:39,007
Hey, Jang Ho Woo.

102
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:41,297
I realize you're not feeling well, but get up for a sec.

103
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,757
What time is it?

104
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:46,897
You're dating, right?

105
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:52,047
   

106
00:10:53,797 --> 00:10:56,647
"Ho Woo, can I see you before you come into work?"

107
00:10:56,647 --> 00:10:58,457
"I have something I want to ask you."

108
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:00,497
"I just miss you!"

109
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:02,777
What is this? When did you guys start?

110
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:05,567
   

111
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:08,017
   
   

112
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:19,467
The losses of this online loan company are significant.

113
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,207
It's like a time bomb.

114
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:23,207
I was told you don't need to worry about those companies.

115
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:26,257
He said Taeil Accounting will take care of that.

116
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:35,497
 HK Private Equity Fund's Han Je Gyun 

117
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:39,487
 is commissioning Taeil Accounting's Han Je Gyun, I see... 

118
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,987
 What is he trying to do with this? 

119
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:48,147
When I came in today,

120
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:53,147
I saw that the vibe of the firm is definitely different.

121
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:57,677
I'm sorry about what happened with Accountant Shim Hyung Woo.

122
00:11:57,677 --> 00:12:02,877
Oh, yes. I think it's a shame as well.

123
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:15,887
   

124
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:23,827
This is a P2P online loan company

125
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,407
that HK Private Equity Fund is selling.

126
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:32,637
I thought that Jisan Bank would be the best business partner to sell it to.

127
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:35,707
Thank you for your kind words,

128
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:42,237
but will Jisan Bank need an online loan company?

129
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:45,337
I don't know about that.

130
00:12:45,337 --> 00:12:49,547
Well, won't you need it, President Jin?

131
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:55,667
Your term is coming to a close soon

132
00:12:55,667 --> 00:13:01,557
so another major accomplishment would make it easier for you to extend your presidency.

133
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:05,917
There's no better accomplishment than raising the stock prices.

134
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:07,547
"Stock prices."

135
00:13:07,547 --> 00:13:12,137
Even if the business profits stay the same, if you own an IT company,

136
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:16,277
you can promote your bank as the next generation of financial technology,

137
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:20,517
have a higher performance, and your stock prices will quickly rise.

138
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:25,437
Why don't you wrap up and take home this good opportunity?

139
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:32,477
Do an M and A of an online loan company

140
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:35,970
and raise the bank's stock price...

141
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,367
Has our Taeil Accounting ever let you down?

142
00:14:29,297 --> 00:14:31,217
Ms. Yeon Ah.

143
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:33,227
Mr. Ho Woo.

144
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,220
Well...

145
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,347
I...

146
00:14:41,867 --> 00:14:45,817
Do you know you and I share something in common, Ms. Yeon Ah?

147
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:47,467
"Something in common"?

148
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:51,007
Our situations are different, but we both

149
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:54,587
can't hide in the safety of being average.

150
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:58,997
Ms. Yeon Ah, our company's biggest client,

151
00:14:58,997 --> 00:15:02,317
Jisan Bank President, Jin Tae Soo's daughter.

152
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:05,297
And I am the son of someone

153
00:15:05,297 --> 00:15:07,767
whose whereabouts are unknown.

154
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:13,410
I was going to tell you first, Mr. Ho Woo,

155
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:16,087
but I was scared.

156
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:20,650
We had just started getting close,

157
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,557
and I worried we might grow apart again.

158
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:28,907
It doesn't matter to me

159
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:32,587
who you are, Ms. Yeon Ah.

160
00:15:33,327 --> 00:15:35,017
Then...

161
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:38,627
you're not going to distance me, right?

162
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,317
I won't distance you,

163
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,447
not even one step.

164
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:13,127
I'll make sure to guarantee

165
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,847
Accountant Son Hye Won's career.

166
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:22,407
And you'll receive compensation for work-related damages.

167
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:24,857
I will...

168
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:27,117
gratefully accept your offer, V.P.

169
00:16:27,877 --> 00:16:30,910
- But... 
 - "But"?

170
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,210
I want to keep working

171
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,857
at Taeil as long as I can see.

172
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:43,297
 Are you thinking of reporting it to the police? 

173
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,707
 To tell them to punish V.P. Han Je Gyun since he tried to kill someone? 

174
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,957
 You think I can't? I am a living witness to it. 

175
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:55,637
 You know better than anyone that you can't go against him like that. 

176
00:16:55,637 --> 00:16:58,590
 Do I just sit still and do nothing? 

177
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,007
 If he steps on me, just take it. 

178
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,867
 If he kills me, then just die? 

179
00:17:02,867 --> 00:17:04,557
 No. 

180
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,727
 You should go to work. 

181
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:12,897
   

182
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:16,417
Jang Ho Woo... What is this?

183
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,347
Beside this guy who is nothing, I...

184
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,137
Gosh.

185
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:26,337
   

186
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,167
"Jang In Ho"?  
    

187
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:36,237
The Jang In Ho of Haebit Construction from way back when?

188
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:39,707
   

189
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:45,667
This is suddenly getting interesting.

190
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:49,397
Let's raise our glasses!

191
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:52,257
Cheers!

192
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:54,587
Congrats.

193
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:57,367
If you've gained management rights in the succession process,

194
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:01,097
you should have many Sangah Group shares in your name, 4%?

195
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:03,970
What's the point? I've on such a short leash.

196
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,617
It's better than being an accountant and salaryman like me.

197
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:12,767
I had to buy stocks with a stock-backed loan so it's hard enough to pay interest.

198
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:16,847
Then how about you switch to a place with low interest?

199
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,627
You would have 2% less interest if you go through me.

200
00:18:19,627 --> 00:18:20,767
Two percent?

201
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:26,400
So many people around me saved money through lower interest like that.

202
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:29,657
Why mention this just now?

203
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:43,007
   

204
00:19:01,797 --> 00:19:04,557
I was going to open it anyway.

205
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:21,287
I guess he liked basketball shoes.

206
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:23,207
You know the dream of guys

207
00:19:23,207 --> 00:19:27,497
to buy all these things to feel successful in life.

208
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:53,137
What is it?

209
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:57,447
Someone searched Shim Hyung Woo's office. His laptop has disappeared.

210
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,447
Do you think V.P. Han Je Gyun ordered it?

211
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:11,337
How are things going with the inspection of the online loan company?

212
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:15,167
If we want Jisan Bank to desire it,

213
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:20,477
it seems we'll have to pay extra attention.

214
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:21,927
Yes.

215
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:28,447
It appears to be the orders of V.P. Han Je Gyun.

216
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:31,747
I took a glance at the meeting files in the copying room,

217
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:34,167
and it seemed to be a Jisan Bank case.

218
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,387
"Jisan Bank"?

219
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:52,307
Hyung Woo came to see me not long before he died.

220
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:54,757
He said he lived diligently,

221
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:57,347
but that he's lived wrong.

222
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:04,827
I forgot about it from the shock of sending Hyung Woo off like that.

223
00:21:04,827 --> 00:21:07,277
I finally looked at it yesterday,

224
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:09,977
and I thought you guys should see it, too.

225
00:21:21,457 --> 00:21:22,577
   

226
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:24,407
   

227
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,557
"People's Entertainment"?

228
00:21:26,557 --> 00:21:28,177
   

229
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:33,767
The plan strategized to suck the goods out of People's Ent.

230
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:37,577
Then all the companies here... 
    

231
00:21:37,577 --> 00:21:42,787
They're all companies that ended up bankrupt after V.P. Han Je Gyun used them.

232
00:21:43,497 --> 00:21:47,547
Just like Haebit Construction, Shim Hyung Woo likely handled them all.

233
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:52,277
So this is a record of Han Je Gyun's wrongs.

234
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,977
Proving this would be another story,

235
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:58,067
but based on the circumstances, it's correct.

236
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:00,400
But...

237
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,707
would he have sent this to only you?

238
00:22:02,707 --> 00:22:06,527
   

239
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:12,587
How many people did they bribe?

240
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:16,567
   

241
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,277
"National Forensic Service"?

242
00:22:19,627 --> 00:22:22,367
Why would Han Je Gyun get involved with National Forensic Service?

243
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:36,147
Find someone for me.

244
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,117
Hwang In Beom. 
    

245
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:47,817
The files are all ready.

246
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:49,257
Let's take a look.

247
00:22:49,257 --> 00:22:50,277
   

248
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:57,237
Is it 120%? 
    

249
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,827
If my stock price reaches the minimum limit,

250
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:03,327
my stocks could be taken; I'd be forced to sell to save money.

251
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:07,927
How could Sangah Group's stock prices drop below minimum and force you to sell?

252
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:12,207
Maybe I should ask my dad.

253
00:23:12,207 --> 00:23:15,167
I heard your chairman is overseas on business.

254
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,297
I'm an accountant at Taeil Accounting.

255
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:21,977
So?

256
00:23:22,907 --> 00:23:25,617
It means even our old fogey approved my smarts.

257
00:23:33,607 --> 00:23:39,077
   

258
00:23:53,447 --> 00:23:56,367
You dare fearlessly harass a minor?

259
00:23:57,777 --> 00:24:00,727
- You don't fear public authority, do you? 
 - "Harass"?

260
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:02,537
I don't even remember it!

261
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:05,567
I don't even know who she is!

262
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:08,457
 Drink, drink! 

263
00:24:08,457 --> 00:24:09,867
 Cheers. 

264
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:26,857
 Are you okay? 

265
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:31,587
 Drink, drink. 

266
00:24:31,587 --> 00:24:33,437
 Cheers. 

267
00:24:33,437 --> 00:24:34,967
 Exactly. 

268
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:40,187
Technology needs to advance quickly so we can scan your brain, and you'll shut up.

269
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,507
Call my dad!

270
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:46,757
Is this a school that I call your dad for you?

271
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:51,987
Come here! Come here, you b*stard!

272
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:54,487
Darn it, you b*stard!

273
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:56,737
Dang it! Hey!

274
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:58,347
Did anyone ask you to bring in money?

275
00:24:58,347 --> 00:25:02,427
All I asked was for you to do nothing! Is that so hard?

276
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:06,147
How could you cause trouble like this and create this mess?

277
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:10,987
All due to you, it appears our stock prices will be cut in half!

278
00:25:11,947 --> 00:25:15,747
Dad. This is really unfair!

279
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,277
You know my friend, Gyeong Il, right?

280
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:20,617
- He works at Taeil Accounting and– 
 - You b*stard!

281
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:22,177
This is a criminal case!

282
00:25:22,177 --> 00:25:25,750
There's a limit to what I can do to get you out!

283
00:25:26,347 --> 00:25:31,857
You b*stard! It's not like I can just kill you, geez!

284
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,757
But Dad,

285
00:25:37,397 --> 00:25:39,547
there's one more thing.

286
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:44,427
You didn't... Did she get pregnant?

287
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:46,750
Geez, that'd be awful!

288
00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:49,297
Actually, I...

289
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:53,337
changed my stock-collateral loan...

290
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:55,537
B-But?

291
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,187
Because our stocks dropped,

292
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:02,487
I ended up getting liquidated.

293
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:05,357
You... 
    

294
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:10,617
Are you saying you got... all of those stocks taken away?

295
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:12,097
Dad, just give me one more chance.

296
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:13,617
I will really do well from now on.

297
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:16,827
I really wanted to do well this time.

298
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,897
Hey, you b*stard!

299
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:21,497
You b*stard!

300
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,997
Do you know how I amassed those stocks?

301
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:26,777
That was like my blood!

302
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:30,897
And of all situations, why now?

303
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:37,937
No. No, no, no, no!

304
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:41,117
No. J-J-Jang Ho Woo, Jang Ho Woo.

305
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:43,697
I need to call Jang Ho Woo.

306
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:51,307
Aigoo, my nephew.

307
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:56,567
I wondered when you would grow up and act like a human being,

308
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:59,687
but you gave me such a great gift!

309
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:06,447
Hey, I'm not in the mood to play with you right now. Just leave.

310
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:07,987
I told you to leave!

311
00:27:07,987 --> 00:27:12,077
I guess your stocks got forcibly sold so you're busy trying to deal with that situation?

312
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,307
How did you know that?

313
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:22,217
You b*stard! No way...

314
00:27:23,097 --> 00:27:25,237
 He is Mr. Choi Gyeong Il of the audit team. 

315
00:27:25,237 --> 00:27:27,367
 He's very close to Bo Sung. 

316
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:28,887
 Say hello. 

317
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:38,517
 All you have to do is encourage Bo Sung 

318
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:43,717
 to change his stock-collateral loan while Chairman Lee Chan Joo is away on a business trip. 

319
00:27:43,717 --> 00:27:45,287
 Yes, Sir. 

320
00:27:48,707 --> 00:27:50,927
 You should know that you're benefiting due to me. 

321
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:52,797
 Okay, I got it. 

322
00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:06,227
   

323
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:14,247
   

324
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:20,577
Those stocks would have been liquidated anyway if it weren't for your son.

325
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:22,077
Who are you?

326
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,327
Since your son, who does no proper work or economic activity,

327
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:28,797
bought all those stocks with money that had unclear sources,

328
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:33,387
the financial authorities can order a liquidation for illegal acquisition.

329
00:28:33,387 --> 00:28:37,037
- You think that's easy to do? 
 - It's not easy.

330
00:28:37,037 --> 00:28:40,737
However, it's not difficult for our accounting firm.

331
00:28:40,737 --> 00:28:44,467
Even if you hold a shareholders' meeting again and appeal, you'll clearly lose to me.

332
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:47,067
So don't make more work for yourself.

333
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:49,497
Just exit on your own while I'm offering you generous severance pay.

334
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:51,377
Lee Seong Joo...

335
00:28:51,957 --> 00:28:54,167
Lee Seong Joo, you b*stard!

336
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:56,027
You son of a b*tch!

337
00:28:56,027 --> 00:29:00,107
How could you do that to Bo Sung, who knows nothing?

338
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:02,537
That's what I mean!

339
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:08,647
Would it be good for you guys, who don't know anything, to act as Chairman? Darn it!

340
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:13,907
Thanks to your stupid son, I became the major shareholder

341
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:17,067
so should I thank him?

342
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:20,867
Hey, I'm Lee Chan Joo.

343
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,377
Lee Chan Joo!

344
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,997
You think I'll come to an end like this?

345
00:29:26,027 --> 00:29:30,307
Of course, it shouldn't end like this.

346
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:38,787
I'm Prosecutor Lee Soo Young of the Economic Crime Investigation Dept. of Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

347
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:42,867
Lee Chan Joo, you are under arrest for aggravated specific economic crimes,

348
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:46,727
since there is the risk of destruction of evidence or fleeing.

349
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:50,507
What... what did I do wrong?

350
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:52,317
Wrongful subsidizing of affiliates,

351
00:29:52,317 --> 00:29:54,267
internal transactions, manipulation of stock prices,

352
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:56,067
embezzlement, breach of trust, and tax evasion.

353
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:58,567
Lee Seong Joo, you b*stard!

354
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:04,010
You can't get away with this!

355
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,917
I see you quite often these days.

356
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,587
Dad! Hey!

357
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,370
   

358
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:43,317
You've regained your position,

359
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:46,277
and everything is done now.

360
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,057
There's still...

361
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:52,177
one more interesting thing.

362
00:31:06,877 --> 00:31:10,017
Hey, Kong Hee Sam, don't you hear that?

363
00:31:10,017 --> 00:31:12,297
You go get it.

364
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:13,797
You should hurry and go.

365
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:16,017
- You should go! 
 - It's your house!

366
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:18,427
You should go!

367
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:20,157
You can't even face off against me.

368
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,747
Go.

369
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:25,327
Hey, Ho Woo.

370
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,337
Jang Ho Woo.

371
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:31,797
I'm not expecting anything at home...

372
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:45,547
- What is that? 
 - Hey.

373
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:47,497
That...

374
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:49,727
looks like a card key.

375
00:31:50,707 --> 00:31:53,357
Hey, maybe it's something like a safe key.

376
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:56,547
You sure it's not like an act of terrorism where it explodes if you open it?

377
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:01,637
What an imagination for one who deals mostly with drunks. 
    

378
00:32:09,717 --> 00:32:13,937
Excuse me, could you check the CCTV to see who sent this?

379
00:32:13,937 --> 00:32:15,657
Oh, that would be difficult.

380
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:17,917
The CCTVs are off-limits as per company rules.

381
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:20,927
I really need it. If I had any other way, I wouldn't be doing this.

382
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:24,277
Here, the person who sent this is dead.

383
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:28,167
- I just need to find out who sent it– 
 - I told you it's not possible!

384
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,987
Please leave before I call the police.

385
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:38,137
Hello.

386
00:32:38,137 --> 00:32:41,187
I'm Officer Song Yeo Jin from Dongin Police Station.

387
00:32:41,187 --> 00:32:45,927
I know it's a hassle for you, but can I take a look at your CCTV?

388
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,967
   

389
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:03,127
 Which overseas destination would take about a week for a package sent from Korea to be returned? 

390
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:04,817
 "To be returned"? Not sent? 

391
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,637
 Yes, so it would return due to an unidentified recipient. 

392
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:10,417
 The recipient's name is Jang Ho Woo. 

393
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,927
   

394
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:20,527
 I'll report to you after it's burnt completely. 

395
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:39,787
I think he earned some time by using returns on international shipping.

396
00:33:42,877 --> 00:33:48,947
He probably knew better than anyone that V.P. Han would order someone to rummage through his stuff.

397
00:33:48,947 --> 00:33:52,117
I think it's a card key.

398
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:55,327
Would it be for the rental safe at a bank?

399
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,457
Probably not.

400
00:33:57,457 --> 00:34:00,717
If he had borrowed a safe from a bank on credit...

401
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:03,867
there's no way V.P. Han wouldn't know about it.

402
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,737
He'd have searched for it and his home first thing.

403
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:14,217
Why did Director Shim Hyung Woo give me a riddle like this?

404
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:17,237
He could've just sent the data over.

405
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:20,067
While he wanted you to find it, don't you think...

406
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:22,647
he also didn't want you to find it?

407
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:28,107
Either way, he probably wanted you to understand his actions.

408
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:33,757
Since that's what comes first to find the answer.

409
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:55,397
   
   

410
00:34:57,757 --> 00:35:01,897
   

411
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:10,427
   
   

412
00:35:24,317 --> 00:35:26,147
   
   

413
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:42,647
   

414
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:50,547
   

415
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:52,737
   

416
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:12,537
It was arson, not an accident?

417
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,547
It seems Shim Hyung Woo expected it.

418
00:36:15,547 --> 00:36:21,197
A few days before the incident, he handed info about V.P. Han to Sunbae Kang Hyun.

419
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:23,207
To me, too.

420
00:36:24,437 --> 00:36:27,727
   

421
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:32,597
Taeil Scholarship Association... Politicians, prosecutors, and police.

422
00:36:32,597 --> 00:36:34,557
He's got all sorts of people, right?

423
00:36:34,557 --> 00:36:37,347
   

424
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:38,967
"National Forensic Service"?

425
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:42,057
I'm also looking into him because it's odd.

426
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:50,937
   

427
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:54,497
   

428
00:36:57,017 --> 00:37:01,187
 What you ordered for Ilseong Baby Formula, my father-in-law's company– 

429
00:37:01,187 --> 00:37:03,167
 Mr. Yang Jae Hwan... 

430
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:07,417
 Mr. Yang Jae Hwan seems to be quite mistaken about something. 

431
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:10,027
 I've never given orders before. 

432
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,867
 All I've done was give appropriate opinions. 

433
00:37:17,827 --> 00:37:20,607
All of this is...

434
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:28,427
 The one who heard my opinion and acted 

435
00:37:28,427 --> 00:37:31,557
 was by all means done of your own accord. 

436
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:34,627
 Mr. Yang, aren't you an expert? 

437
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,077
 V.P. Han. 

438
00:37:37,077 --> 00:37:40,087
 - That's an inappropriate– 
 - Mr. Yang. 

439
00:37:41,537 --> 00:37:46,197
 Have you ever seen an ambulance keep the speed limit? 

440
00:37:54,557 --> 00:37:56,987
 He lacks flexibility. 

441
00:37:56,987 --> 00:37:59,447
 Whether they're my guys or not, 

442
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:02,687
 no one knows to keep a secret. 

443
00:38:03,437 --> 00:38:05,467
 Director Shim Hyung Woo. 

444
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:06,607
 Yes, V.P. Han. 

445
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:11,227
 While burning those, could you burn one more bad inventory? 

446
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,840
   
   

447
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:19,047
   

448
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,747
 You *sshole! 

449
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:19,697
 Will you be able to handle it? 

450
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:25,447
 Yes. 

451
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:39,847
The cabinet Shim Hyung Woo used when he was a new staff?

452
00:39:39,847 --> 00:39:41,827
You're saying it was right under our noses.

453
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:45,607
Since no one cares about a new staff's cabinet,

454
00:39:45,607 --> 00:39:49,417
his cabinet number was 23.

455
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:53,237
So he couldn't help but do those things for success?

456
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:57,257
What the heck is in there anyway?

457
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:04,527
 We fabricated the ledger by importing raw materials from overseas and increasing inventory prices. 

458
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:08,287
 If we cover up with a warehouse fire, there should be no problem. 

459
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:12,717
 Nothing is more definite than burning the whole thing down. 

460
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:17,127
 While you're burning those, could you burn one more bad inventory? 

461
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:19,590
   

462
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,280
 Which one... 

463
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,830
   

464
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,457
 I'll promise you a partner position once you take care of it. 
   

465
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,067
 The decision is up to you. 

466
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:31,727
 Very slowly, take your time to think over my offer. 

467
00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:35,307
 Get out! 

468
00:40:38,997 --> 00:40:41,027
Ahjussi?

469
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:09,577
 I stand before the gates of hell numerous times, even in one day. 

470
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:13,257
 You think I wouldn't have prepared for the worst? 

471
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:31,007
   

472
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:34,477
   

473
00:41:37,687 --> 00:41:40,867
   

474
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:42,577
"A stab wound"?

475
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:44,267
   

476
00:41:44,267 --> 00:41:46,047
"A knife"?

477
00:41:50,947 --> 00:41:53,207
Why would it be there?

478
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:39,497
Are you Dr. Hwang In Beom, who used to work at NFS?

479
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:43,267
Who are you?

480
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:44,277
   

481
00:42:50,117 --> 00:42:52,807
I have some questions for you.

482
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:13,247
Is that so?

483
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:27,657
Are you saying you fabricated the autopsy report for money...

484
00:43:30,937 --> 00:43:34,967
when it was a murder and not a suicide?

485
00:43:35,577 --> 00:43:37,647
Rather than for the money...

486
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:39,587
I did it out of fear.

487
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,617
I guess you don't fear Han Je Gyun anymore, right?

488
00:44:22,457 --> 00:44:25,967
The fact that I didn't recognize the one...

489
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:29,207
who did that to Ahjussi when he was right next to me...

490
00:44:30,527 --> 00:44:34,647
I only resented him for leaving me behind alone.

491
00:44:34,647 --> 00:44:38,177
He's the one who must bow his head to Ahjussi.

492
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:45,187
I'm going to make him beg.

493
00:45:34,957 --> 00:45:36,787
Who are you?

494
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:07,257
Have you gone crazy? Are you insane?

495
00:46:07,257 --> 00:46:09,487
What are you doing?

496
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:11,567
Are you okay?

497
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:14,547
I don't think you should stay here.

498
00:46:14,547 --> 00:46:17,077
This might happen again.

499
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:40,847
- There's something I must tell you. 
 - Save it for later.

500
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:43,357
I have to tell you right now–

501
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:58,047
Even to Noona Ji Soo's hotel now?

502
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,767
We can't leave Ji Soo alone like that.

503
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:05,167
I don't think you'll make her safe just by going to V.P. Han right now.

504
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:07,187
I must do whatever I can.

505
00:47:08,017 --> 00:47:10,007
What were you going to tell me?

506
00:47:11,057 --> 00:47:12,577
Come in.

507
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:26,017
V.P. Han knows something regarding the Jisan Bank matter...

508
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:27,977
but you can't really tell what he knows?

509
00:47:27,977 --> 00:47:32,017
Even if I ask my dad, he says it's nothing.

510
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:36,917
I wouldn't be this worried if I could at least know what it's about.

511
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:40,387
It's a business where they sell online lending companies to Jisan Bank.

512
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:41,857
Pardon?

513
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:53,007
 You checked the work Mr. Woo's assigned to... right now on his time report? 

514
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:56,447
Because it's the fastest, most accurate way.

515
00:47:56,447 --> 00:48:02,247
But why would they have to be so discreet about selling online lending companies to Jisan Bank?

516
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:05,247
They wouldn't be if it was a normal deal.

517
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:08,227
And they wouldn't have told only Jisan Bank to be the buyer.

518
00:48:08,227 --> 00:48:13,707
Would there be a real reason... why they have to sell those goods to Jisan Bank

519
00:48:13,707 --> 00:48:16,127
without people knowing?

520
00:48:46,137 --> 00:48:48,947
Hee Sam, lend me a hand.

521
00:49:14,057 --> 00:49:16,187
Help yourself.

522
00:49:20,037 --> 00:49:23,057
Stop looking. You'll give me indigestion.

523
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:25,977
Unnie, you know I'm the police, right?

524
00:49:25,977 --> 00:49:27,487
My house is the safest.

525
00:49:27,487 --> 00:49:30,507
Well, Noona, I also have a free room in my house...

526
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:32,167
although it's not as nice as a hotel.

527
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,477
Why go to a hotel when she has a home?

528
00:49:34,477 --> 00:49:35,937
Have you got money rotting away?

529
00:49:35,937 --> 00:49:37,837
Grandma, that's not the point here.

530
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:40,947
- There was an intruder– 
 - I'm sure she will see to it herself.

531
00:49:40,947 --> 00:49:43,547
Everyone, just stay put.

532
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:49,007
Anyhow... I'm also against you staying in a hotel.

533
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:56,527
What's the use even if we know V.P. Han's plan?

534
00:49:56,527 --> 00:50:00,777
Without his approval, we can do nothing.

535
00:50:00,777 --> 00:50:02,947
Since he's the Deals Department leader,

536
00:50:02,947 --> 00:50:06,117
we lack a reason to ask to hand over info irrelevant to our work.

537
00:50:06,117 --> 00:50:08,437
So we just sit and watch like this?

538
00:50:08,437 --> 00:50:10,537
Is there no other way?

539
00:50:15,107 --> 00:50:17,357
Competitive bidding?

540
00:50:17,357 --> 00:50:19,707
Oh, I forgot about that. Competitive bidding.

541
00:50:19,707 --> 00:50:21,277
By competitive bidding, you mean...

542
00:50:21,277 --> 00:50:27,147
We'll bring someone other than Jisan Bank who wants to buy online lending companies... on paper.

543
00:50:27,147 --> 00:50:30,497
In that case, V.P. Han wouldn't have a reason to stop us.

544
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:31,897
Since it's official participation.

545
00:50:31,897 --> 00:50:35,047
To V.P. Han, who wants to sell it to Jisan Bank...

546
00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:39,027
having another buyer appear will be confusing.

547
00:50:39,027 --> 00:50:41,877
Because some random person might buy them instead.

548
00:50:41,877 --> 00:50:44,887
However, we can't celebrate just yet.

549
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:50,127
Because we need to find a company to hire us to enter the bid. That's our homework.

550
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,147
That homework of yours...

551
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:57,400
I'll help you out.

552
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,330
Sunbae!

553
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:24,517
What about you? Are you okay, Hyung?

554
00:51:24,517 --> 00:51:28,497
I'm sure your company doesn't really plan to buy an online lending company.

555
00:51:28,497 --> 00:51:30,567
You'll be paying quite a sum to Taeil for hiring us.

556
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:33,707
I also feel the same way you guys do.

557
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:38,487
Coming here reminds me of Hyung Woo.

558
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:42,627
We can't lose anyone else.

559
00:51:42,627 --> 00:51:44,777
That shouldn't happen.

560
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:47,977
To prevent it, we must stop...

561
00:51:47,977 --> 00:51:52,687
V.P. Han so he can't cross the line anymore.

562
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,297
   

563
00:52:05,147 --> 00:52:07,187
   

564
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,180
   

565
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,090
   

566
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:23,297
"Financial Services Commission"?

567
00:52:24,957 --> 00:52:28,687
What can Han Je Gyun do with them?

568
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,587
   

569
00:52:36,577 --> 00:52:38,067
   

570
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:44,347
Regarding the insolvency (failure) of this P2P lending company...

571
00:52:45,877 --> 00:52:48,327
let's just leave them as they are.

572
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:52,397
No need to bother to solve this one.

573
00:52:52,397 --> 00:52:54,427
 Yes, I understand. 

574
00:52:54,427 --> 00:52:56,567
 It'll be marked as unnoticed on our end. 

575
00:52:56,567 --> 00:52:58,567
   

576
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:09,287
I think you need to come and see this.

577
00:53:12,457 --> 00:53:18,247
Han Seung Jo, if you sold this without knowing, Jisan Bank would have a mountain of debt overnight.

578
00:53:18,247 --> 00:53:22,017
There's a mountain of debt, but they switched out the papers.

579
00:53:22,017 --> 00:53:25,547
They hid the problem by using a program where they loan the amount of interest

580
00:53:25,547 --> 00:53:28,537
the borrowers fail to pay on time.

581
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:29,607
What does that mean?

582
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:34,077
As time passes, debts Jisan Bank needs to repay in the

583
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:38,797
online lending company's stead will arise left and right... just like a time bomb.

584
00:53:38,797 --> 00:53:42,120
Cornering Jisan Bank on purpose?

585
00:53:42,817 --> 00:53:45,927
For what? What does V.P. Han gain from doing that?

586
00:53:45,927 --> 00:53:47,987
What are you talking about?

587
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:53,537
Is Han Je Gyun cornering Jisan Bank on purpose?

588
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,287
   

589
00:53:58,287 --> 00:54:00,527
   

590
00:54:00,527 --> 00:54:03,307
If loan failures happen so suddenly like this...

591
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:07,037
there will be issues with the BIS rate. 
    

592
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:08,747
"BIS"?

593
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:12,687
If something goes wrong with that, it means the bank will falter.

594
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:17,247
   

595
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:20,167
What does decreasing BIS rates and...

596
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:23,810
Financial Services Commission have to do with each other?

597
00:54:24,487 --> 00:54:26,507
"Financial Services Commission"?

598
00:54:27,767 --> 00:54:30,887
How do you know that, Jang Ho Woo?

599
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:33,577
Han Je Gyun is colluding with the Financial Services Commission.

600
00:54:33,577 --> 00:54:35,867
"Financial Services Commission"?

601
00:54:35,867 --> 00:54:41,337
Aren't they the people HK Private Equity Fund invited to join their side by handing out patent certificates?

602
00:54:41,337 --> 00:54:43,627
Yes, you're right.

603
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,637
What is it?

604
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:56,697
What can Han Je Gyun do by making the Financial Services Commission follow his orders?

605
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,527
What is Han Je Gyun trying to do?

606
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:07,147
The banks...

607
00:55:10,297 --> 00:55:11,670
The banks...

608
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,540
Yes, it's the banks.

609
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:17,517
V.P. Han was after Jisan Bank in the first place.

610
00:55:17,517 --> 00:55:19,167
Is he after the bank?

611
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:21,797
   

612
00:55:21,797 --> 00:55:24,867
 It's on a different scale from taking over a company. 

613
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:29,047
 It's a lot more dangerous for an unqualified individual to take over a bank. 

614
00:55:29,047 --> 00:55:32,417
If he wants to, he'll start drawing blood out of individuals and companies alike.

615
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:34,677
Once that starts...

616
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:37,247
he can adjust the books as he pleases.

617
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:39,577
Once that happens...

618
00:55:40,377 --> 00:55:43,957
it's only a matter of time before V.P. Han starts...

619
00:55:44,897 --> 00:55:47,057
meddling with the national economy.

620
00:55:53,427 --> 00:55:58,877
If Jisan Bank purchased that online lending company without even knowing these inner workings...

621
00:56:00,837 --> 00:56:04,177
How fortunate are we to have realized it now?

622
00:56:05,897 --> 00:56:09,977
Dad... are you listening to me?

623
00:56:11,177 --> 00:56:12,767
Yes, yes.

624
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:15,327
I heard you.

625
00:56:15,327 --> 00:56:18,300
I'm at a meeting offsite right now.

626
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,117
Yes, yes.

627
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:30,817
I'm sorry about this.

628
00:56:31,947 --> 00:56:36,017
According to our analysis...

629
00:56:36,967 --> 00:56:42,547
the online lending company's status is very good.

630
00:56:42,547 --> 00:56:43,937
   

631
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:46,317
   
   

632
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:51,107
I wasn't going to bother telling you.

633
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,037
But I thought you should know...

634
00:56:55,307 --> 00:56:58,487
about the person we must fight in the end.

635
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:05,087
 I stand before the gates of hell numerous times, even in one day. 

636
00:57:05,087 --> 00:57:08,087
 You think I wouldn't have prepared for the worst? 

637
00:57:13,207 --> 00:57:15,237
Yes.

638
00:57:15,237 --> 00:57:19,117
Shim Hyung Woo killed CEO Jang In Ho of Haebit Construction

639
00:57:20,267 --> 00:57:22,457
and Han Je Gyun ordered it.

640
00:57:26,987 --> 00:57:28,897
Does Ji Soo know this, too?

641
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:31,197
Yes.

642
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:12,177
I had so many thoughts about what I should say to you.

643
00:58:13,737 --> 00:58:16,107
But I couldn't really think of anything.

644
00:58:18,547 --> 00:58:20,697
Though I can't...

645
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:25,047
ever express it with these words...

646
00:58:28,457 --> 00:58:31,057
I'm really sorry.

647
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:35,347
It's not your fault.

648
00:58:35,347 --> 00:58:38,627
Having such a father is my fault.

649
00:58:38,627 --> 00:58:41,787
I hope you won't act rashly.

650
00:58:42,857 --> 00:58:45,307
You know your father.

651
00:59:00,327 --> 00:59:03,527
I'm busy right now. Let's talk next time.

652
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:06,607
There won't be a "next time." Come take a seat.

653
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:23,587
Sure. What's the matter?

654
00:59:25,757 --> 00:59:28,927
Let me ask you this one thing for the first and last time.

655
00:59:30,217 --> 00:59:33,017
Is that position... 
    

656
00:59:34,777 --> 00:59:38,087
really that important for you, Dad?

657
00:59:38,087 --> 00:59:41,137
Enough to take away someone's life?

658
00:59:42,577 --> 00:59:44,867
What are you trying to say?

659
00:59:44,867 --> 00:59:48,867
Dad, I'm asking if being the chairman of Taeil Accounting and owning Jisan Bank

660
00:59:52,067 --> 00:59:56,007
hold enough value to you that it's worth killing people.

661
00:59:56,007 --> 00:59:58,177
Of course not.

662
00:59:58,857 --> 01:00:01,837
What proof do you have that it was me?

663
01:00:01,837 --> 01:00:05,667
I'm quite sure you heard it, too.

664
01:00:06,297 --> 01:00:11,377
The police's announcement on the fire at the warehouse.

665
01:00:19,117 --> 01:00:24,657
Do I look like I'm doing all of this out of greed...

666
01:00:24,657 --> 01:00:28,307
just so I can make a fortune for myself?

667
01:00:30,997 --> 01:00:33,547
That seat you just mentioned...

668
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:37,837
I'm going to seat you there after me, no matter what.

669
01:00:37,837 --> 01:00:41,357
And when I become the chairman, you'll again

670
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:46,947
take that seat after me. I'm sure you know all this.

671
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:50,437
Did I ever say I wanted it?

672
01:00:51,957 --> 01:00:55,147
Ever since I was young, I was always...

673
01:00:55,147 --> 01:00:59,997
thinking in front of your room's door that you closed on me.

674
01:00:59,997 --> 01:01:03,287
What on Earth could he be thinking in there?

675
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:06,547
An ordinary life...

676
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:09,897
Do you even know what it looks like?

677
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:13,607
You eat together at mealtimes, and

678
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:17,740
you ask me if I'm sick or having a hard time with anything,

679
01:01:18,437 --> 01:01:21,347
consoling each other with a word.

680
01:01:21,347 --> 01:01:23,367
A family is like that.

681
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:28,607
Have you ever thought about these things, even just once?

682
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,240
You've never done any of that, Dad.

683
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:35,997
If I'm sick anywhere, taking my medicine or not...

684
01:01:35,997 --> 01:01:38,897
whether I want to live or die...

685
01:01:38,897 --> 01:01:41,697
and how much pain I'm in...

686
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:48,257
I fully understand what you mean. However...

687
01:01:49,077 --> 01:01:51,417
Mr. Han Seung Jo...

688
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:56,447
I'm sure you're too old to be a baby now.

689
01:01:56,977 --> 01:02:01,987
What conversation could I have with a man who calls that childish?

690
01:02:01,987 --> 01:02:04,487
But it doesn't matter anymore,

691
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:07,947
since I can no longer live as a murderer's son.

692
01:02:13,387 --> 01:02:15,607
You'd better watch out.

693
01:02:16,457 --> 01:02:20,337
Did you know? The greatest fortune in your life...

694
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:23,007
is that you're my son.

695
01:02:24,057 --> 01:02:26,917
And the worst misfortune in my life...

696
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:31,677
is again that you're my son.

697
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:40,177
I lived my whole life at its worst.

698
01:02:42,397 --> 01:02:45,387
Your son, Han Seung Jo, is no more.

699
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:10,367
Dad said... I mean...

700
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:13,317
Jisan Bank apparently purchased the online lending company.

701
01:03:13,317 --> 01:03:15,117
What do we do now about Jisan Bank?

702
01:03:15,117 --> 01:03:17,307
Wait, why?

703
01:03:18,447 --> 01:03:20,227
Calm down for now.

704
01:03:20,227 --> 01:03:22,797
Where is Jang Ho Woo right now?

705
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:28,327
I thought you weren't too fond of me due to what happened at the last stockholders' meeting.

706
01:03:28,327 --> 01:03:30,797
That's right.

707
01:03:30,797 --> 01:03:34,527
However... it's as you can see.

708
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:38,577
Why did you ask for me?

709
01:03:38,577 --> 01:03:41,367
Because I like competent people.

710
01:03:42,397 --> 01:03:45,417
Want to hear an interesting story?

711
01:03:48,807 --> 01:03:53,937
Of course, you'd want to stay at Taeil Accounting to get back at Han Je Gyun.

712
01:03:53,937 --> 01:03:58,987
Because the dead CEO, Jang In Ho of Haebit Construction, was your father figure.

713
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:02,967
What about this then?

714
01:04:07,397 --> 01:04:10,917
What if your birth parents were also killed by Han Je Gyun?

715
01:04:16,997 --> 01:04:18,717
What kind of nonsense is that?

716
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:23,487
I told you before. I like an interesting story.

717
01:04:24,247 --> 01:04:27,157
Let me tell you how your birth parents died.

718
01:04:29,557 --> 01:04:31,757
Cut your bullsh*t.

719
01:04:32,317 --> 01:04:35,417
How the heck do you know...

720
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:39,587
my parents, whom I don't even know?

721
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:53,120


722
01:04:56,387 --> 01:05:00,417
♫  I still hope you're coming  ♫

723
01:05:03,797 --> 01:05:07,137
♫  I still hope you're coming home  ♫

724
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:11,287
♫  Can hide away, at the end of my tears  ♫

725
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:15,307
   

726
01:05:15,307 --> 01:05:17,467
-  Hey. Will you apologize? 
 -  Have you two seen Mr. Ho Woo? 

727
01:05:17,467 --> 01:05:19,597
You'd surpass your dad if I waited a little longer?

728
01:05:19,597 --> 01:05:21,207
 I can't wait very long. 

729
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:22,477
 Are you planning to quit work? 

730
01:05:22,477 --> 01:05:25,287
 Forget your emotions right now and face reality. 

731
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:27,807
 When people can't trust a bank... 

732
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,507
 what do you think their first action will be? 

733
01:05:29,507 --> 01:05:31,857
 I told you not to buy it. I said the deal seemed off. 

734
01:05:31,857 --> 01:05:34,747
-  Have you been well? 
 - What made you decide to return? 

735
01:05:34,747 --> 01:05:38,217
 I must find out everything Han Je Gyun owns and how much. 

736
01:05:38,217 --> 01:05:41,857
 How daring of you, not knowing your place. 

737
01:05:43,007 --> 01:05:45,297
 So only I can take you down. 

738
01:05:45,297 --> 01:05:49,067
 If it's the president who's above the vice president... 

739
01:05:49,067 --> 01:05:51,857
 I think you were looking for me.
