1
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,070
   

2
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,750


3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,490
Jang Ho Woo, the question you asked me earlier...

4
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,253
I'll answer you right now.

5
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,223
What do I gain?

6
00:00:51,763 --> 00:00:53,873
It's a wild card.

7
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:56,953
a card that isn't anything, but can also become anything,

8
00:00:56,953 --> 00:01:00,823
an unpredictable card that can overturn a game

9
00:01:00,823 --> 00:01:03,333
with a clear winner.

10
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,143
You mean like a Joker in a trump card game?

11
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:10,683
I guess you are a Joker since I can't tell what you're thinking, from your appearance.

12
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:15,643
Then again, I suppose a trump card game has two Jokers.

13
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:20,353
So with that said, Jang Ho Woo, you should join my team.

14
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,773
I don't want to.

15
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,253
The coffee from the company café tastes really good.

16
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:49,343
The employee reviews are good, as well.

17
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,793
Even the people who initially opposed you in

18
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:55,423
 hiring a barista with hearing loss now favor it. 

19
00:01:55,423 --> 00:02:00,743
I was happy that I'd be working in the president's secretary's office when Vice President An Seung Yeon became President.

20
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:02,063
But what's this?

21
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:04,133
You know, she has cardiovascular disease.

22
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:07,763
It's her health, nothing else; not much can be done.

23
00:02:10,993 --> 00:02:12,633
She can't hear us.

24
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:14,643
Oh, that's right.

25
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:18,063
Well, it's because they can talk freely

26
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:22,250
without anyone listening to their conversations.

27
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:26,973
Looks like People's Entertainment's audit is almost completed as well.

28
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:30,693
I believe it will wrap up as soon as the financial institutions' confirmation letters are collected.

29
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:34,183
Well, from the banks' perspectives,

30
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:38,043
it could seem a hassle to provide confirmation letters.

31
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:41,553
Since this has nothing to do with them, even if they provide one,

32
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:43,813
there's not much to gain from this.

33
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:46,793
I will do my best to keep track of the situation.

34
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:53,113
As you run for president, the person to watch for is 
    

35
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:55,893
Vice President An Seung Yeon of the Audit Department.

36
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:59,893
- If you look at this— 
 - No need to be concerned about Vice President An.

37
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:06,433
It seems she will have a more urgent matter than becoming President of Taeil Accounting.

38
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,843
Instead of that,

39
00:03:08,843 --> 00:03:13,973
let's plant someone as a spy inside People's Entertainment's audit team.

40
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,043
You never know with these things.

41
00:03:16,043 --> 00:03:20,433
Think of it as installing a CCTV.

42
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,943
Yes, I understand.

43
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:29,063
Why don't you want to?

44
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:31,613
Do you think you'll just be making photocopies or something?

45
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:33,803
I won't make you do things like that. Don't worry.

46
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:37,403
It's not that I'm worried; I just refuse.

47
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:44,053
Any new employee at Taeil Accounting Firm will want to work on my team.

48
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,133
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,853
My risk if I am under your erratic personality,

50
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,313
your unknown competency even with your reputation as V.P. Han Je Gyun's son,

51
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:53,783
your team's culture I have seen though not experienced it,

52
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:57,113
and natural dread of uncertainty...

53
00:03:57,113 --> 00:04:01,463
You must know these things very well as an experienced accountant.

54
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,953
If you're done talking, I'll get going now.

55
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:25,393
   

56
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:27,973
 But what's this? 

57
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:30,983
 You know, she has cardiovascular disease. 

58
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:34,703
 It's her health, nothing else; not much can be done. 

59
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:40,783
 If Vice President An Seung Yeon resigns soon, then what happens to us? 

60
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:46,383
   

61
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,263
 Thank you. 

62
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,183
   

63
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:07,443
What do you mean the financial institutions' confirmation letters haven't arrived yet?

64
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:14,633
We need them to verify whether People's Entertainment's liability amount is accurate.

65
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:18,073
 Without the confirmation letters, the audit and reports are completely useless! 

66
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:21,453
 How many times have I told you to pay attention to this? 

67
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:23,730
Everything else is ready,

68
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,630
but we're only missing one from Geumyang Joongang Town Fund...

69
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:32,943
Don't you know that missing one letter is the same as missing them all?

70
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:34,893
Yes, that's true.

71
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,863
Just how careless were you with this task?

72
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:41,963
What could we do if they wouldn't give it to us when we went all the way there?

73
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:44,253
They said the manager wasn't there or they weren't ready yet.

74
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:47,243
It drives me crazy, too, that they treat me as a fool!

75
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:49,333
But you still should have gotten it somehow!

76
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,403
Should I have kissed their butts while they purposely delayed?

77
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:53,923
Yes, if necessary!

78
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:55,653
Don't you think you're out of line?

79
00:05:55,653 --> 00:05:57,033
Come on, Mr. Choi.

80
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:00,633
I'm just saying that's not why I became an accountant.

81
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:01,963
I got it. I got it.

82
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,243
I'll do it.

83
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,263
I'm Jang Ho Woo, the new recruit.

84
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:16,223
With your permission, I'll go down to Geumyang now

85
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:20,283
and be sure to bring back the financial institution's confirmation letter.

86
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:34,013
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,373
   

88
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:39,673
One cray double sandwich, please—

89
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:43,083
I'm telling you. Don't order a cray double sandwich.

90
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,963
It's not good.

91
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:48,863
What are you doing, ordering that at a roast beef sandwich shop?

92
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,733
Please give me two roast beef sandwiches.

93
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:02,473
I'm wearing sneakers to conduct due diligence.

94
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:05,170
You do know what due diligence is, right?

95
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,753
The process of verifying the actuality of the—

96
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,553
What are those documents?

97
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:13,433
It's my first duty as a new recruit.

98
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,433
I have to go to another city in a hurry.

99
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,653
I'll give you a ride; you can eat on the way.

100
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:30,133
If you eat like that, you'll be in trouble even before you get there.

101
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:32,623
- Do you even know where I'm going now? 
 - It's written there: Geumyang.

102
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:34,843
I'm going in the same direction.

103
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:46,683
   

104
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:52,143
   

105
00:08:00,923 --> 00:08:03,693
   

106
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:14,013
   

107
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,443
Thank you.

108
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:23,223
Thanks to you—

109
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:34,673
I'm from Taeil Accounting in Seoul. I'm here to get a confirmation letter.

110
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:36,243
Take a number, please.

111
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:39,353
You just need to check People's Entertainment's balance and loan amount for me.

112
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:41,953
Didn't you hear me say, "Take a number and wait"?

113
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,903
Are we your minions or something?

114
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,163
I have to work late even after we close for the day.

115
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:49,213
How dare you try to cut in line!

116
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:53,843
Sir, if you want to withdraw from your savings account, you need to fill this out!

117
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:56,663
I can't hear you. Speak louder!

118
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:59,103
What kind of writing is this small?

119
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:00,803
Ma'am, your I.D., please.

120
00:09:00,803 --> 00:09:04,083
You know who I am! Why do you ask me for that?

121
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,523
We need it to complete the process.

122
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:10,193
Gosh, come over here!

123
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,770
When will it be my turn? I can't wait forever.

124
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,093
- Why is that? 
 - Please take a seat.

125
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,193
He's not sitting still like the other accountants.

126
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:29,453
Where is he going?

127
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:34,253
Maybe he gave up already, knowing I won't give him the confirmation letter.

128
00:09:34,253 --> 00:09:36,563
Do you think Jang Ho Woo can get the confirmation letter?

129
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:39,243
Even a grand master accountant couldn't bring it back.

130
00:09:39,243 --> 00:09:42,343
Do you know how many documents I sent them, including self-addressed envelopes?

131
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:44,213
One day, I wanted to see who would win.

132
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:47,863
I sat there all day, but they completely ignored me.

133
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:49,673
There's no chance.

134
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,783
Here you go.

135
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:56,953
Is there a place for me to print something in this area?

136
00:09:56,953 --> 00:10:00,153
I'm not sure about that.

137
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:05,063
There must be a printing service somewhere.

138
00:10:08,643 --> 00:10:10,443
   

139
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:14,933
- Thank you, Sir. 
 - Sure.

140
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:17,313
Any news?

141
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:19,293
No, not yet.

142
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:22,583
I-I'll try calling him.

143
00:10:28,703 --> 00:10:31,623
   

144
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:36,133
   

145
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,953
All right, all right!

146
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:43,973
For those of you who need to withdraw from your account or borrow money,

147
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:48,873
come to me, and I'll help you fill out the forms and anything else you need!

148
00:10:48,873 --> 00:10:52,783
I'm not someone suspicious. I'm an accountant, an accountant!

149
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:56,883
The bank teller should be the only one who needs to know our bank account number.

150
00:10:56,883 --> 00:10:58,973
   

151
00:10:58,973 --> 00:11:02,403
As expected, with grandmas and grandpas (older people)...

152
00:11:02,403 --> 00:11:03,693
What did you say?

153
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:06,883
It seems he turned off his cell phone.

154
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:11,403
We have only two hours left!

155
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,263
 If you come to me, 

156
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:22,613
I will pay for all your banking charges that are such a waste of money!

157
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:24,263
- "Pay the banking charges"? 
 - Why would he do that?

158
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:26,923
Starting now, I'm paying for ten people only!

159
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:29,253
Only the first ten people!

160
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:30,643
M-Me! Me! Me!

161
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:31,653
Oh, here.

162
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:33,373
- Here! 
 - Look at this!

163
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:36,453
All right, please stand in line here!

164
00:11:36,453 --> 00:11:38,453
- Come here! 
 - Slowly, slowly!

165
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:41,933
- Just a little this way. 
 - Let go.

166
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:47,103
   

167
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:54,103
I'll look over it one more time. You brought your I.D.

168
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:56,843
All right, you can go to the last window.

169
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,883
- You're giving this to me? 
 - Oh, of course.

170
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,573
I'll just check it once for you.

171
00:12:00,573 --> 00:12:02,323
You filled it out well.

172
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,233
You can go to the window right in front.

173
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:06,643
Hello, Grandma.

174
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:11,923
There, over there.

175
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,873
You can go where that grandma went earlier.

176
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:16,573
Hello.

177
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:19,713
Customer number 462.

178
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:22,123
It seems the rush is over for you now.

179
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:25,163
May I please have the institution's confirmation letter?

180
00:12:35,633 --> 00:12:38,533
As you can see, we close in one minute.

181
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,803
If you come back tomorrow, I'll give it to you then.

182
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,463
It takes some time to complete the financial institution's confirmation letter.

183
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,410
I knew you'd be busy

184
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,570
so I prepared it in advance for you.

185
00:12:50,463 --> 00:12:52,043
   

186
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,983
   

187
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,603
   

188
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:08,233
If the information on this confirmation letter is incorrect,

189
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:11,263
then you can rip up the letter on the spot.

190
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:15,163
But if you rip it up even though the information

191
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:18,413
is the same as the one you'll give me tomorrow,

192
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,643
- then that's... 
 - What?

193
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:23,083
You'd be so embarrassed.

194
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,943
If you don't want to be embarrassed and the letter looks correct,

195
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:27,913
why don't you simply stamp it?

196
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:31,153
Let's not trouble each other further.

197
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:33,973
Let's just end it here.

198
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:38,880
   

199
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,843
Thank you.

200
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:46,343
You seem a little different from the other accountants,

201
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:48,323
seeing how you organized the waiting area.

202
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:51,123
You're a type of alpha (leader) living as a beta (follower).

203
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:55,543
I didn't become an accountant so people can treat me with respect.

204
00:13:55,543 --> 00:14:00,603
If the other party takes care of my complaint, I can resolve their problem.

205
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,073
Those are basics of transactions.

206
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:09,483
Now I'll take this to them and get what I want, too.

207
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,613
Wow, he really got this done.

208
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,023
 Hello. 

209
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:23,643
Weren't you going to get the confirmation letter this morning?

210
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,673
Well, the thing is...

211
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,593
we don't need to go there anymore.

212
00:14:28,593 --> 00:14:30,683
   

213
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:36,033
   

214
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,193
- Could you photocopy the first three pages, and... 
 - Yes.

215
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:44,593
If you look on this side, it says, "Income Statement."

216
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,043
Make seven copies of these too.

217
00:14:46,043 --> 00:14:47,903
Woo Sang Hyun!

218
00:14:48,673 --> 00:14:51,453
- I'll leave this to you. 
 - Yes, I'll take care of it.

219
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:11,873
Is it true that you brought this financial institution's confirmation letter, Mr. Jang?

220
00:15:13,743 --> 00:15:14,693
Yes.

221
00:15:14,693 --> 00:15:17,763
I-Is there something wrong with it?

222
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:21,013
If there's a problem, I can go down to Geumyang now—

223
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:22,833
No.

224
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:25,783
There's nothing wrong with the document.

225
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:29,603
I heard they weren't interested in giving it to us when we waited all day in their lounge.

226
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:32,723
How did you manage to get it from them?

227
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:35,083
I was lucky.

228
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:39,783
Then... are you saying we were unlucky all this time?

229
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:45,293
Anyway, I can breathe easily thanks to you.

230
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:48,373
Thank you. You worked hard.

231
00:16:02,323 --> 00:16:03,953
Now we have the confirmation letter,

232
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:07,383
we just have to write up the unqualified opinion, and we'll be done.

233
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,023
Gosh, when are we going to write it up now?

234
00:16:10,023 --> 00:16:13,323
Hey, compared to a disclaimer of opinion, writing an unqualified opinion is easy.

235
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,153
We'll do it in no time!

236
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:17,133
I'm going to a meeting.

237
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,643
- Yes. 
 - Have a good day.

238
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:28,353
It seems People's Entertainment's audit must be finishing.

239
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:32,513
The Deals Department Director seems to take a lot of interest in the Auditing Department.

240
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:37,203
I just heard that one of my clients bought some of People's Entertainment's stocks; I was curious.

241
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:42,363
You must know very well that we can't share our client's information with outsiders.

242
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:45,393
Are you saying that I'm included in those "outsiders"?

243
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,983
You're not on the inside.

244
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:50,073
And that's a relief.

245
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,713
If this is why you wanted to see me, I'm leaving.

246
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,143
Why don't you add one more person to your team?

247
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:00,843
There won't be any problem with accepting just one more person.

248
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:10,063
Isn't it trouble that you want to add another to a team without any problems?

249
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:14,613
The more accurate description is there was a problem, but it was solved.

250
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:17,963
I heard you couldn't acquire the financial institution's confirmation letter.

251
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,073
How about Jang Ho Woo? The one who got that confirmation letter?

252
00:17:25,073 --> 00:17:28,183
It seems you already witnessed his skills.

253
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,553
   

254
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,503
There's no way it's always this empty here.

255
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:23,803
Yes, yes. Hello.

256
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:43,413
   

257
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:52,713
Yes, this is Department 3.

258
00:18:57,063 --> 00:19:00,693
Must I always go through someone else

259
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:03,153
to see your high and mighty face?

260
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:07,193
If you know I'm worse than a stranger to you, no need to call me.

261
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,313
Sit down.

262
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,843
   

263
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:28,533
This is Sangah Group's M and A proposal of People's Entertainment.

264
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,123
Take this on.

265
00:19:30,123 --> 00:19:32,813
Is this why you called me in?

266
00:19:32,813 --> 00:19:36,823
Asking me to help out with Sangah Group's acquisition of another company?

267
00:19:36,823 --> 00:19:42,583
Then does the company being acquired this time not have any clue, either?

268
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,943
They have agreed to it, too.

269
00:19:44,943 --> 00:19:48,703
You set up the game so they're forced to agree, Father,

270
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:51,773
like that time with Haebit Construction.

271
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:57,823
That was so long ago...

272
00:19:58,603 --> 00:20:02,223
and you're still struggling with it.

273
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:07,093
Who cares about that one girl, anyway?

274
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:41,863
Yes, it's pathetic...

275
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:47,713
that I didn't know you'd use Haebit Construction as Sangah Group's secret storehouse

276
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:51,593
and just offered up Haebit Construction.

277
00:20:52,913 --> 00:20:57,763
I'm the one who told you kindly to close down the company...

278
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:00,633
and caused Ji Soo's father's death.

279
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:03,613
The reason the CEO of Haebit Construction died

280
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:09,113
was due to his guilt over his incompetence.

281
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:20,053
Why can't you understand what that person and I both feel?

282
00:21:22,383 --> 00:21:26,833
Have you ever seen a beast that

283
00:21:27,993 --> 00:21:31,993
feels guilt after biting off the neck of its prey?

284
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:36,153
So you're saying you're not human.

285
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:40,883
The law of the jungle is the survival of the fittest.

286
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:45,103
It's called the truth of natural selection, my boy.

287
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:50,913
Why don't you give this work to Shim Hyung Woo, your attack dog?

288
00:21:50,913 --> 00:21:54,223
He'll hunt it down for you at your command.

289
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:24,243
You can't afford leisure time right now.

290
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,813
The big problem is not having a cigarette, but time. Do you have one?

291
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,643
I thought you said you worked hard to quit for your son.

292
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,313
- What's wrong? 
 - A light.

293
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:38,053
Oh, Man. I forgot my lighter!

294
00:22:38,053 --> 00:22:40,123
I'm not in the mood for jokes right now!

295
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:43,123
What about me? Do I look like I want to joke?

296
00:22:43,123 --> 00:22:45,613
Hey, you're the son of a successful V.P. What's the problem?

297
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:49,323
Forget your being older; I feel I could punch you right now.

298
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:52,963
It must be due to the V.P.

299
00:22:52,963 --> 00:22:55,463
I need to quit this job or something.

300
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:57,703
Quitting accounting sounds good too!

301
00:22:57,703 --> 00:22:59,763
At least you won't hear any more bullsh*t.

302
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:02,863
Why? Did Shim Hyung Woo say something?

303
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:09,513
He's telling me to accept a new recruit for People's Entertainment's audit team.

304
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,593
When the auditing process is nearly finished? Who?

305
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,583
Jang Ho Woo,

306
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,413
the high school graduate you selected.

307
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:19,623
"Jang Ho Woo"? Did he say he would?

308
00:23:19,623 --> 00:23:21,233
The new recruit doesn't have a choice.

309
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,103
He can only do what they tell him to do.

310
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:29,423
   

311
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,553
 Jang Ho Woo, come to my office. 

312
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:13,953
Do you know your responsibilities on the People's Entertainment audit team?

313
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:18,583
I heard from Manager Woo Sang Hyun that doing nothing is my job.

314
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:24,663
I understand I should just stay quiet, then report the meeting minutes to Director Shim Hyung Woo.

315
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,653
Woo Sang Hyun recommended you.

316
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:29,193
How do you know each other?

317
00:24:29,193 --> 00:24:32,423
I've helped him with a few small tasks in the past.

318
00:24:32,423 --> 00:24:34,653
He wouldn't recommend you due to that.

319
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:37,413
If things go wrong, he's responsible.

320
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:41,653
With the confirmation letter, I guess you work hard doing others' work.

321
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:44,873
So that one day it might become my work.

322
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:48,943
My goal is to become a valuable talent at Taeil Accounting,

323
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:52,193
like you, Director Shim Hyung Woo.

324
00:24:54,413 --> 00:24:56,653
 That guy, Jang Ho Woo... 

325
00:24:56,653 --> 00:25:00,663
I'll find out what happened with him; just do what Shim Hyung Woo wants for now.

326
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:02,773
That's a safer route.

327
00:25:02,773 --> 00:25:05,393
Also, learn to hold your tongue.

328
00:25:05,393 --> 00:25:10,993
If it was easy, do you think Shim Hyung Woo, whom I trained, would be my superior now?

329
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:16,703
Why? Are you leaving?

330
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:19,923
If we're sending the audit report, we should do it on time.

331
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:22,143
What a devoted accountant you are.

332
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:26,403
Thank you. I feel a lot better after just taking a sniff of it.

333
00:25:26,403 --> 00:25:29,333
I could keep my promise to my son about quitting.

334
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,403
Bye now.

335
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:51,313
   

336
00:25:54,543 --> 00:25:59,063
In my next life, I wish I could be studious like you!

337
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:00,943
What would you want by being studious?

338
00:26:00,943 --> 00:26:04,503
To personally develop ideas or patents I devise.

339
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:06,133
But you can do that now.

340
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:09,243
It's too late in this life.

341
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:11,213
Hey, do you know how many smart people are in this world?

342
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:14,683
I wouldn't be the first to think of, register, and develop something new.

343
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:19,903
I tell you, sometimes, when a new idea comes to me, it will suddenly appear in real life!

344
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:21,923
Gosh, seriously.

345
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:28,323
I guess the only way for me to make money is through blood, sweat, and tears.

346
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:30,543
It's because you're only thinking about them.

347
00:26:30,543 --> 00:26:33,213
You should try starting something first.

348
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:37,353
Forget it! I plan to just live like this,

349
00:26:37,353 --> 00:26:40,923
then one day keel over and die without making a sound.

350
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:46,113
That's bad luck! Hurry and take it back!

351
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,363
- Good morning! 
 - Yes!

352
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:52,943
Good morning.

353
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:18,000
- Get the numbers, and check up to the decimal points. 
 - Okay.

354
00:27:23,923 --> 00:27:28,703
Excuse me, may I please take a look at the financial statements?

355
00:27:28,703 --> 00:27:32,043
Sure, we already looked them over a few times.

356
00:27:32,043 --> 00:27:34,003
Thank you.

357
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:39,903
   

358
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:48,943
   

359
00:27:48,943 --> 00:27:51,343
 It's 42 billion won ($32 million). 

360
00:27:57,313 --> 00:28:01,813
Excuse me, I saw earlier that People's Entertainment's assets are 42 billion won.

361
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,503
But could an entertainment company's inventory of assets be this much?

362
00:28:04,503 --> 00:28:06,133
Normally, it's not that much.

363
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:10,803
But they say it's due to the two movies People's Entertainment invested in plus success of their products.

364
00:28:10,803 --> 00:28:13,013
- Did you say, "Movies and products"? 
 - Yes.

365
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,283
"Products"?

366
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:18,283
You know, those items with fan-favorite entertainers' faces on them,

367
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:21,823
like mugs, t-shirts, and cheering sticks that they buy.

368
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:23,973
The promotional items.

369
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:26,353
They already shot the movies,

370
00:28:26,353 --> 00:28:30,723
but due to Covid and competing films at the theater, they're delaying the release date.

371
00:28:30,723 --> 00:28:34,283
In any case, since those movie items were meant to be sold,

372
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:36,813
they're rightfully part of the company's assets.

373
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,403
But why are you asking?

374
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,793
It's nothing.

375
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:44,423
Okay.

376
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:50,443
   

377
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:01,833
   

378
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,063
   

379
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:09,503
What's that?

380
00:29:11,473 --> 00:29:13,263
Oh, this.

381
00:29:15,093 --> 00:29:16,933
Hey, what's he doing?

382
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:20,573
He said he was skipping lunch to visit People's Entertainment.

383
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:24,203
- Why would he go there? 
 - What do you think?

384
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:26,103
He probably went since it's his first time in the field.

385
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:27,923
That's how Jang Ho Woo is.

386
00:29:27,923 --> 00:29:29,683
It's better that he's this way.

387
00:29:29,683 --> 00:29:31,613
When Jang Ho Woo helps me, how should I put it?

388
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:33,913
It feels more like we're being watched; it's not good.

389
00:29:33,913 --> 00:29:36,153
Right?

390
00:29:36,153 --> 00:29:38,573
   

391
00:29:38,573 --> 00:29:40,870
   

392
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,700
   

393
00:29:43,703 --> 00:29:45,143
   

394
00:29:45,143 --> 00:29:49,073
   

395
00:29:49,073 --> 00:29:53,233
 I searched for the movie "Game Changer" that People's Ent. produced. 

396
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:56,563
It's true that they had movie premieres last year and the year before.

397
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:59,423
However, both movies had premieres, but neither was released.

398
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,773
It's also odd no articles exist about the premieres.

399
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:05,113
The entertainment world is so special. There must have been a reason.

400
00:30:05,113 --> 00:30:08,923
Therefore, I looked up the reason they haven't been released this year; if you look here...

401
00:30:08,923 --> 00:30:11,043
- Mr. Jang Ho Woo. 
 - Yes.

402
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:16,183
Since Mr. Jo is thoroughly checking People's Entertainment's inventory of assets,

403
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:19,093
you don't need to concern yourself at all.

404
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:23,203
Isn't it strange that celebrities are linked to the movie's inventory of assets—

405
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:25,243
Mr. Jang Ho Woo!

406
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,143
L-Let's go outside and talk for a minute.

407
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:38,193
Inventory of assets...

408
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:49,673
   

409
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:52,543
   

410
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:59,563
   
   

411
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,293
I'll be right back.

412
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:13,163
Will you work under Shim Hyung Woo?

413
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,423
Are you using your brain at all?

414
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:18,733
Are you doing this knowing who Shim Hyung Woo is?

415
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,983
- I know. 
 - You know?

416
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:25,223
So you cut me down without discerning between friend or foe?

417
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:27,573
You seem to imply that you're my friend, Mr. Han,

418
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:31,403
and that Shim Hyung Woo is a foe. How absurd.

419
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:35,553
No need to go on about this. Shim Hyung Woo is just not it.

420
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:38,913
If you don't want to be harmed, get out of there instantly.

421
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:50,453
But regarding friend or foe...

422
00:31:50,453 --> 00:31:53,223
Is there a need to distinguish between the two?

423
00:31:54,843 --> 00:31:57,733
I felt someone is a friend or foe

424
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:00,123
depending on timing, not a person.

425
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:01,153
What?

426
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:04,103
If they clash with my timing, they're my foe.

427
00:32:04,103 --> 00:32:07,713
But if they unite with my timing, they're my friend.

428
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:11,933
So you're saying that based on your timing now, Shim Hyung Woo is your friend,

429
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:14,023
and I shouldn't get in the way?

430
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,063
Okay.

431
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:31,763
But you...

432
00:32:31,763 --> 00:32:34,023
Why aren't you hiding things in front of me?

433
00:32:34,023 --> 00:32:36,733
You hide them rather well in front of others.

434
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:39,993
Why are you so blatantly honest with me?

435
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,623
Do I seem gullible to you?

436
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:46,933
Or am I trustworthy?

437
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:01,123
 Mr. Kang, why can't an entertainment company include its movies and goods 

438
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:04,083
 as part of its inventory of assets? Why do this? 

439
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,193
It's not like we're the only ones who do that!

440
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:10,023
Then why can't you release those movies?

441
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:14,823
Because so many competitors are out there. I'll release them soon.

442
00:33:14,823 --> 00:33:16,283
I will sell many of them overseas—

443
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:21,153
Are you sure you can't release them, or is it that they won't sell?

444
00:33:21,153 --> 00:33:24,573
An entertainment company including its movies and goods in its inventory of assets

445
00:33:24,573 --> 00:33:26,723
isn't a problem under normal circumstances.

446
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:31,803
However, the movies and goods included as part of People's Entertainment's inventory are...

447
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:35,853
not real assets, but rather a deception to cover up its losses!

448
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:38,183
That's the problem!

449
00:33:43,103 --> 00:33:44,933
 Mr. Jang Ho Woo. 

450
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:49,073
 The news reported that they were commercially sold overseas, but they weren't sold in reality. 

451
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:52,803
 The buyer withdrew their offer after seeing the finished product. 

452
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:56,723
 Are there no buyers at all, even though they spent a fortune on it? 

453
00:33:56,723 --> 00:33:59,333
 Even if they said they spent ₩30 billion to produce the movie 

454
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,983
 doesn't mean that movie is worth ₩30 billion. 

455
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:05,143
 It appears there was a problem during the planning stage. 

456
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:08,783
 Well, what do you have to say about the goods? 

457
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:12,753
 Many of the goods they have are of inactive artists. 

458
00:34:12,753 --> 00:34:15,583
 Since these artists' contract period with People's Ent. hasn't expired, 

459
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:18,483
 it isn't illegal for them to count as inventory of assets, 

460
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:20,823
 but it means they likely won't sell them. 

461
00:34:20,823 --> 00:34:21,793
 What's the evidence? 

462
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,933
 It'd be easy to prove by checking the artists' income tax return details. 

463
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:28,263
 We can't do that. It would breach the Personal Information Act. 

464
00:34:28,263 --> 00:34:33,103
 Yes, so I viewed the company's withholding tax 

465
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,943
 since that information was already made available. 

466
00:34:36,543 --> 00:34:38,823
 You're quite good. 

467
00:34:38,823 --> 00:34:40,753
 So? 

468
00:34:41,573 --> 00:34:44,003
 They don't have any up-to-date information. 

469
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:47,053
 Since they have no profits from any artist, 

470
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:49,923
 the company has also paid no money to their artists? 

471
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:52,113
 Same goes for their tax payments 

472
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:56,543
 since the taxes paid by a celebrity are directly correlated to their popularity. 

473
00:34:57,923 --> 00:35:01,213
 In other words, they are worthless products 

474
00:35:01,213 --> 00:35:04,203
 with nobody to buy them. 

475
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:08,443
 Currently, People's Entertainment is about to go out of business. 

476
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,853
I was going to tell you.

477
00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:18,093
When? After the auditing reports were finished?

478
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:22,983
No way. You're not going to write this in the auditing report...

479
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:25,453
You're not, right... right, Mr. Kang?

480
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:27,993
If necessary, I should

481
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,283
since that is my job.

482
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:33,253
Mr. Kang.

483
00:35:35,043 --> 00:35:36,843
 What are you doing? 

484
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:41,943
 If you help us out just this once, People's Entertainment can get back on its feet quickly! 

485
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:45,273
I, Goo Joon Tak, was able to survive in this field because of my credibility.

486
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:47,493
Really! If I can get just one big hit,

487
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:50,943
I won't take any of that money for myself and take care of

488
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:53,113
the company's financial issues once and for all.

489
00:35:53,113 --> 00:35:56,763
 We even found a way for us to survive. 

490
00:35:57,933 --> 00:36:00,743
- A way for you to survive? 
 - Yes!

491
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:08,173
Sangah Group says they will pursue an M and A with my company.

492
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:10,563
If that happens, 40 billion won't be a problem.

493
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,853
The shares will skyrocket!

494
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:16,583
Are you saying an M and A with Sangah Group?

495
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:18,103
Yes!

496
00:36:19,353 --> 00:36:22,773
 The Deals Department Director seems to take a lot of interest in the Auditing Department. 

497
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:24,723
 What do you mean "interest"? 

498
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:29,113
 I just heard that one of my clients bought some of People's Entertainment's stocks. 

499
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:36,913
 Why my company ended up like this is due to Sangah Group's third-generation son! 

500
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:39,823
He doesn't have many stocks,

501
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:44,353
but when you add up all his borrowed-name accounts, he is the major shareholder.

502
00:36:48,793 --> 00:36:53,053
If it was up to me, I would say, "Forget the M and A."

503
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:54,673
But what can I do?

504
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,103
Even if they wound then fix me up, I must survive!

505
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:59,643
I can't go down unfairly like this by myself!

506
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:05,283
 Mr. Kang... I really won't do anything like this again. 

507
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:08,433
I really reflected a lot with remorse.

508
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:12,913
Since you reflected on this with remorse,

509
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:16,803
I guess you can now take responsibility.

510
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:22,133
I can't give your company an unqualified opinion this year.

511
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:26,863
Wait, Mr. Kang. Mr. Kang!

512
00:37:35,393 --> 00:37:38,453
Oh, yes, speaking, CEO Goo.

513
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:42,733
 Accountant Kang Hyun discovered everything. 

514
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:46,743
Accountant Kang Hyun... knows about what?

515
00:37:46,743 --> 00:37:50,533
The fact that Chairman Lee Chan Joo's son has bankrupted the company.

516
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,813
Everything from what I covered up in the ledgers

517
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:57,873
to the fact the company will have an M and A with Sangah Group.

518
00:37:57,873 --> 00:38:00,313
 If Accountant Kang Hyun gives us a disclaimer of opinion, 

519
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:03,513
we're really dead.

520
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:41,403
What happened with the auditing team for People's Entertainment today?

521
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,693
Did Mr. Kang Hyun get in contact with anyone separately?

522
00:38:43,693 --> 00:38:47,733
No. There weren't any major issues with the auditing team.

523
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:52,353
And there wasn't anyone that Mr. Kang Hyun contacted separately.

524
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:55,113
 He left the office at 3 p.m. and hasn't returned yet. 

525
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:58,903
 I'll find out where Mr. Kang Hyun is right now. 

526
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:01,603
Never mind. I found him.

527
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:14,233
I can't believe you'd call me all the way here.

528
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:18,013
I suppose the audit would have to result in an unqualified opinion

529
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:23,313
for the Deals Department to pursue the M and A between Sangah Group and People's Entertainment.

530
00:39:23,313 --> 00:39:29,043
If you understand that, you should give an unqualified opinion for People's Entertainment's audit.

531
00:39:29,043 --> 00:39:30,863
No.

532
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:35,213
Perhaps if I didn't know, but I can't cover it up when I know.

533
00:39:36,613 --> 00:39:41,793
What I'm saying right now... Does it sound like a request?

534
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:45,973
Are you threatening me right now or something?

535
00:39:45,973 --> 00:39:48,373
There's no reason for me not to.

536
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:51,203
I can't believe I'm having this conversation with you, Vice President,

537
00:39:51,203 --> 00:39:56,573
just to save a third-generation chaebol who is a troublemaker.

538
00:39:57,213 --> 00:40:03,453
What more can an accountant do but serve its clients?

539
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:05,523
Obviously, it's a public service.

540
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:09,933
The audit reports of an accounting firm are akin to a public good.

541
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:15,233
Mr. Kang Hyun, your expensive salary...

542
00:40:16,453 --> 00:40:19,703
Where do you think that comes from?

543
00:40:20,343 --> 00:40:24,943
The people around you that you don't know? No.

544
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:28,613
The troublemaker third-generation chaebol you just mentioned...

545
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:34,073
We live off the money from clients like that.

546
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:38,203
Even dogs don't bite the hand that feeds them.

547
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:39,223
Vice President Han!

548
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:42,483
Your pretense as a hero...

549
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:45,693
I'm telling you to stop that.

550
00:40:49,593 --> 00:40:54,293
Are abiding by rules and using common sense playing the hero?

551
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:56,793
Why is that the case?

552
00:40:56,793 --> 00:41:01,923
You think those words you hear in accounting ethics lectures will protect you?

553
00:41:05,903 --> 00:41:08,433
Think carefully.

554
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:13,583
If this M and A goes through, the company will be absorbed by the powerful Sangah Group,

555
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:16,203
and it'll be as if no issues existed in the first place.

556
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:18,413
You know that very well.

557
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:22,523
And we can just keep living well.

558
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:27,803
If you just look the other way, your salary will also increase.

559
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:32,323
And your position in our accounting firm

560
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,803
will change quite a bit as well.

561
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:40,173
Of course, the opposite could also be true.

562
00:41:40,173 --> 00:41:44,733
I can lower you as much as I can raise you.

563
00:41:45,663 --> 00:41:51,363
So it may become tough for you to work as an accountant again.

564
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:58,893
You already know the answer,

565
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:03,323
and I want to believe you're not a fool

566
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:07,673
who will write the wrong answer.

567
00:42:12,703 --> 00:42:15,583
Would it be okay for me to hope for that?

568
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:34,103
   

569
00:42:37,473 --> 00:42:39,463
It's funny, right?

570
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:41,783
Seung Joon's dream for the future is Kang Hyun.

571
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:45,553
So I asked if he wanted to become Dad when he grew up.

572
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:47,053
He said, "That's not it."

573
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:51,083
He said he just wants to become the real Kang Hyun.

574
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,273
I don't know what he meant.

575
00:42:53,963 --> 00:42:57,473
   

576
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,220
This way.

577
00:43:19,253 --> 00:43:22,013
These moments are the best.

578
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:25,853
We did well to become accountants, right?

579
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:44,893
It's right here, yet they said it's out of stock nationally to start an open bid?

580
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:47,213
Why don't you check their inventory rotation rate?

581
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:51,593
You can see if it's a true open bid or a fake one.

582
00:43:56,063 --> 00:43:58,723
Their cost of sales is ₩108 billion ($82 million),

583
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:02,253
and their average inventory is around 34 billion...

584
00:44:02,253 --> 00:44:03,553
so their rotation rate is...

585
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:07,503
If the rate is around three, the rotation time is around 120 days.

586
00:44:07,503 --> 00:44:12,083
That would mean it sells out in four months after entering South Korea.

587
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:17,413
You don't think that's enough to start an open bid, right, Ms. Hye Won?

588
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:21,653
This is why I can't stop investigating department store inventories, no matter how busy I am.

589
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:24,153
It's worth doing, although it means a late-night shift.

590
00:44:24,153 --> 00:44:25,873
Just let this department store open tomorrow.

591
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:29,383
I know they have it so I'll demand they give it to me.

592
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:32,443
- It is pretty. 
 - Hello.

593
00:44:35,243 --> 00:44:39,083
I called him in case we end up staying the entire night.

594
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:40,903
Okay.

595
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:44,160
Where should I start?

596
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:49,123
So one of these is equal to my monthly salary.

597
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:51,953
Many are worth as much as a car.

598
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:55,713
People cannot buy these since they go out of stock?

599
00:44:56,643 --> 00:44:59,763
There are people like me who go for it after much consideration,

600
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:03,143
and others buy it as if it were a pack of gum.

601
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,103
Yes?

602
00:45:10,723 --> 00:45:13,063
Fever?

603
00:45:13,063 --> 00:45:17,433
Ha Eun was just fine when she went to school this morning.

604
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:30,613
I guess you want to buy it for someone.

605
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:33,273
You seemed to be paying a lot of attention to it.

606
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:38,183
I wanted to buy something nice for my Cheon Ja when I became an accountant.

607
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:40,233
"Cheon Ja"?

608
00:45:42,383 --> 00:45:44,403
She's my grandmother.

609
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:49,013
But it appears I'll have to be a good grandson a bit later.

610
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,333
You're right.

611
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,953
Being a good son isn't about feelings; it's about money, you know?

612
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,703
- Are you done? 
 - Yes.

613
00:45:58,703 --> 00:46:02,413
Items that are damaged or stolen are viewed as losses of inventory control.

614
00:46:02,413 --> 00:46:05,363
We handled them in a way that didn't affect sales.

615
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:09,393
Anything that didn't sell for several years was classified as an inventory evaluation provision

616
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:13,013
so you can manage and check them later.

617
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:15,393
Yes, thank you.

618
00:46:24,143 --> 00:46:26,893
   

619
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,730
   

620
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:07,423
It's over.

621
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:11,853
I suppose it will be over once it's handed over to the Quality Control Group.

622
00:47:11,853 --> 00:47:16,193
From then on, it will leave everyone's hands.

623
00:47:20,623 --> 00:47:25,733
The more you work in this field, the more you will grow disappointed in people

624
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:28,263
and perhaps in yourself as well.

625
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:32,063
Even if the accounting system grows closer to perfection,

626
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:37,363
people's greed always finds the gaps.

627
00:47:37,363 --> 00:47:41,613
Even if there's just a small gap, it will push itself in, put down roots,

628
00:47:41,613 --> 00:47:45,143
and quickly grow into a big tree.

629
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:49,223
After that, they pull others in, saying

630
00:47:49,223 --> 00:47:52,013
they should rest in the shade with them.

631
00:47:52,793 --> 00:47:55,523
Thus, the tree becomes a forest.

632
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:58,493
So many bad things are like that here.

633
00:47:58,493 --> 00:48:02,503
So why did you become an accountant, Mr. Jang Ho Woo?

634
00:48:02,503 --> 00:48:06,653
Because there was no power to my rage.

635
00:48:07,603 --> 00:48:10,203
No matter how angry I got,

636
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:13,393
there was nothing I could do.

637
00:48:17,923 --> 00:48:22,763
That is why I am envious of you.

638
00:48:24,463 --> 00:48:28,063
There is power to your rage, Accountant Kang.

639
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:33,983
You have the power to change what's wrong,

640
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:40,103
the power to uproot the rotten tree

641
00:48:43,493 --> 00:48:45,453
before it becomes a forest.

642
00:48:58,423 --> 00:49:00,263
   

643
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:04,693
   

644
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:09,603
 You already know the answer, 

645
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:15,663
 and I want to believe you're not a fool 

646
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:19,833
 who will write the wrong answer. 

647
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:23,123
 There is power to your rage, Accountant Kang. 

648
00:49:23,123 --> 00:49:26,063
 You have the power to change what's wrong, 

649
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:30,293
 the power to uproot the rotten tree 

650
00:49:30,293 --> 00:49:32,313
 before it becomes a forest. 

651
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:42,213
Thanks for the meal.

652
00:49:55,403 --> 00:50:00,003
   

653
00:50:13,683 --> 00:50:17,803
   

654
00:50:25,353 --> 00:50:26,963
   

655
00:50:28,823 --> 00:50:31,713
   

656
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:34,313
   

657
00:50:41,213 --> 00:50:42,323
   

658
00:50:42,323 --> 00:50:45,523
   

659
00:51:34,503 --> 00:51:36,933
   

660
00:51:38,353 --> 00:51:41,653
 A decision isn't made in a single moment. 

661
00:51:41,653 --> 00:51:43,873
   

662
00:51:43,873 --> 00:51:48,183
 It's made on the basis of the life you have lived. 

663
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:54,783
 So a person's decision shows what kind of life they've lived 

664
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:58,353
 and how they will live in the future. 

665
00:52:10,803 --> 00:52:14,183
   

666
00:52:50,653 --> 00:52:52,563
Yes, Vice President Han.

667
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:55,733
   

668
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,073
   

669
00:52:58,073 --> 00:53:00,633
   

670
00:53:18,493 --> 00:53:21,303
Aren't you coming to work?

671
00:53:21,303 --> 00:53:24,443
I'm glad. I can at least see your face before I go.

672
00:53:24,443 --> 00:53:25,443
Pardon?

673
00:53:25,443 --> 00:53:27,783
After talking with you, Mr. Jang Ho Woo,

674
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:33,233
I realized that compromising myself wasn't wisdom but self-harm.

675
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:38,563
If I compromised with the mistake I've made, then around this time next year,

676
00:53:38,563 --> 00:53:43,593
I'd have to fight against both Kang Hyun's lies of last year

677
00:53:43,593 --> 00:53:46,363
and Kang Hyun's mistake of two years ago.

678
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:48,813
And every time the auditing season comes around,

679
00:53:48,813 --> 00:53:53,563
the wrongs I'd have to hide would grow exponentially.

680
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:59,643
Mr. Jang Ho Woo, you said you became an accountant because your rage lacks power, right?

681
00:53:59,643 --> 00:54:00,853
Yes.

682
00:54:00,853 --> 00:54:03,083
With your intelligence, Mr. Jang,

683
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:06,613
I think you will soon gain power for your rage.

684
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:15,313
Why aren't you going inside?

685
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:19,183
Instead of you quitting as an accountant, I ended up quitting.

686
00:54:19,183 --> 00:54:20,603
What?

687
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,903
Should we have made a bet or something?

688
00:54:23,903 --> 00:54:26,483
Wh-What did you do?

689
00:54:26,483 --> 00:54:31,083
If I said I would leave, I should leave at the right time.

690
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,583
Are you an audit report, Hyung?

691
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:35,773
Your jokes aren't funny.

692
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:39,183
Seung Jo, you chose the right guy as the new hire.

693
00:54:39,183 --> 00:54:41,083
I told you, I picked a random nobody.

694
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:44,413
Who starts out as somebody? Everyone begins as a nobody.

695
00:54:44,413 --> 00:54:50,353
But I feel he will become a somebody in the end.

696
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,883
You should teach him well.

697
00:54:51,883 --> 00:54:55,443
You do know the story's ugly duckling eventually grows into a white swan, right?

698
00:54:55,443 --> 00:54:57,283
Ugly duckling, as if.

699
00:54:57,283 --> 00:54:59,683
Right now, he's just an ugly b*stard.

700
00:54:59,683 --> 00:55:04,043
Seeing how you've taken quite a liking to him, I can tell you'll raise him well.

701
00:55:10,503 --> 00:55:12,223
I'm leaving.

702
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:41,603
Disclaimer of opinion...

703
00:55:42,803 --> 00:55:47,013
You said not to worry, and is this the result?

704
00:55:48,193 --> 00:55:52,453
You couldn't control one person and let things get out of hand.

705
00:55:52,453 --> 00:55:56,213
I'm sorry. I will fix this right away.

706
00:55:56,213 --> 00:55:57,913
"Fix"?

707
00:55:58,883 --> 00:56:03,553
Are you saying that because you don't know how the Quality Control Group is?

708
00:56:04,253 --> 00:56:09,483
Are you saying we should foolishly try to change a report that's been submitted to the Quality Control Group?

709
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:18,813
From now, regarding this case,

710
00:56:18,813 --> 00:56:22,973
the opinion of Taeil as a whole will have to be a disclaimer of opinion.

711
00:56:23,693 --> 00:56:27,073
It's clear they will make an official announcement

712
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:30,833
so we can't make a public announcement ourselves.

713
00:56:34,943 --> 00:56:38,413
What an accounting firm sells aren't reports

714
00:56:38,413 --> 00:56:42,353
but its reputation and name

715
00:56:42,353 --> 00:56:46,303
for never being wrong.

716
00:56:47,243 --> 00:56:48,333
Then what about Chairman Lee Chan Joo?

717
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:50,543
Is Chairman Lee Chan Joo's son the issue right now?

718
00:56:50,543 --> 00:56:53,433
We have an urgent matter on our own hands.

719
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:56,933
If we give them a disclaimer of opinion this year,

720
00:56:56,933 --> 00:57:00,033
then wouldn't the unqualified opinion we gave during last year's audit for

721
00:57:00,033 --> 00:57:02,043
similar financial indicators become a problem?

722
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:07,533
People's Entertainment shareholders may file a suit against us.

723
00:57:08,223 --> 00:57:10,693
If we say this year's disclaimer of opinion was warranted,

724
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,613
they will pick a fight with us about last year's unqualified opinion.

725
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:18,163
Then does that mean we need to prove

726
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:23,503
that the opposite results from last year to this year are both warranted?

727
00:57:23,503 --> 00:57:26,723
It's a battle of offense and defense...

728
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:31,553
and a battle Taeil must win regardless which side it's on.

729
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:34,473
Therefore,

730
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:40,263
there are some things you have to do from now on.

731
00:57:41,993 --> 00:57:44,653
Disclaimer of opinion? What the heck were you doing?

732
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:48,543
We set you up as a CCTV! Where the heck were you when Kang Hyun did that?

733
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,563
Nothing seemed off before the report was submitted to Quality Control.

734
00:57:51,563 --> 00:57:53,833
Are you serious right now?

735
00:57:59,803 --> 00:58:05,173
 If you stand in front of the copying machine all day, you tend to find out a lot. 

736
00:58:05,173 --> 00:58:09,143
 As Ho Goo, I spent all day copying and shredding other people's files 

737
00:58:09,143 --> 00:58:13,563
 since nobody would be wary of a powerless, unsupported 

738
00:58:13,563 --> 00:58:16,243
 high school graduate. 

739
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:19,203
 As a result, while I stood in front of the copying machine, 

740
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:25,323
 I felt I was receiving a report at once about all the files in Taeil Accounting. 

741
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:40,953
   

742
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:45,073
 I've learned what Taeil Accounting is doing right now 

743
00:58:45,073 --> 00:58:47,913
 and what it will do in the future. 

744
00:58:47,913 --> 00:58:53,513
 In addition, I found out who the real force is behind Taeil Accounting 

745
00:58:53,513 --> 00:58:59,413
 and which path would be fastest to get to him. 
     

746
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:05,853
   

747
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:22,040


748
00:59:35,563 --> 00:59:39,513
   

749
00:59:39,513 --> 00:59:41,303
 How dare you give us a disclaimer of opinion? 

750
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:44,863
 If things go wrong, who will suffer the losses? 

751
00:59:44,863 --> 00:59:45,833
 There is a way. 

752
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:50,883
 Taeil Accounting will be taking charge of both selling and buying in the sell-off deal of Jisan Bank's bad debt. 

753
00:59:50,883 --> 00:59:53,703
 I thought you were doing everything to get noticed by Shim Hyung Woo. 

754
00:59:53,703 --> 00:59:56,223
 Would it be advantageous to our team to get the selling team's info? 

755
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:58,863
 Will you take responsibility if the lowest selling price ends up public, Ms. Jin Yeon Ah? 

756
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:00,503
 Send Jang Ho Woo to your team? 

757
01:00:00,503 --> 01:00:02,433
 Why do you keep getting involved in my plans? 

758
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,643
 Who would want that ledger the most? 

759
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:06,943
 There's no need to get blood on our hands. 

760
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:10,143
 If you stay there, you will get hurt.
