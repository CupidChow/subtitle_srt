1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,100
   

2
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,770
   

3
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,900
   

4
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,360
If this is... selling a franchise,

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,800
there would have been many other accounting firms so why, of all places...

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,790
I wanted to take care of it quickly.

7
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,680
Holding on to something that's no longer useful is like keeping trash.

8
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,760
It also felt like Taeil Accounting was best at handling things like this.

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,540
If you can sell it faster than expected,

10
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,880
I'll also pay you a high commission.

11
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,270
I want to sell it quickly,

12
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:29,760
and you want to earn money quickly, Vice President.

13
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,960
Is that so?

14
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,380
I'm saying no one in this room will lose out.

15
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:50,150


16
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,390
   

17
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,770
   

18
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,700
Yes, it's me... Han Je Gyun.

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,110
   

20
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,110
There's something you should know before the sales processing of Cake Bean.

21
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,590
Please view the documents I've shared with you.

22
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,120
Is it all right for a cardiovascular disease patient to drink coffee?

23
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,550
You're being so careless.

24
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,000
How rude you are.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,930
Han Seung Jo, who's lost his manners...

26
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,670
You've gotten more handsome since I last saw you.

27
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,590
Well, you've become more fearless since I last saw you, Vice President An.

28
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,910
What happened?

29
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,980
You even picked a fight with V.P. Han, whom you don't like talking with.

30
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,610
He p*ssed me off.

31
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,980
How dare he mess with my people?

32
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,520
I'm so envious of the Audit Department.

33
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,160
Should I just transfer to that department?

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,150
The one who started it first was not me, but V.P. Han Je Gyun.

35
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,100
Haven't I told you since you began that you need to assess not only what's on the surface,

36
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,280
but also people's hidden inner motives in order to see the truth and the big picture?

37
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,010
In any case, my goodness.

38
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,620
No, I think the Deals Department suits me best.

39
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,940
I'm joking.

40
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,530
Speaking of the Deals Department, I noticed that one of the new staff

41
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,080
is an interesting guy.

42
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,200
Have you met Jang Ho Woo by chance?

43
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,510
 I guess you were surprised that I called you suddenly. 

44
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,510
I'm An Seung Yeon of the Audit Department.

45
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,900
- Please take a seat. 
 - Okay.

46
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,300
   

47
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,080
From what I hear, the person responsible for causing Mr. Kang Hyun to give People's Ent. a disclaimer of opinion

48
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,230
and to leave our firm was you, Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

49
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,670
The thing is—

50
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,930
You probably had a good reason.

51
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,100
And I'm sure it wasn't the wrong opinion.

52
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,670
The only thing is I just can't forgive you.

53
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,670
I would like you to leave Taeil Accounting, Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

54
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,170
   

55
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,200
 Don't misunderstand. It's not because I'm happy with you. 

56
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,340
 I'm only promoting you to prevent trouble before it happens. 

57
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,760
 I won't say anything about you making the bank happy by selling their bad loans at a high price. 

58
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,910
 But if the other accountants find out that a mere senior manager 

59
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,510
 made a fool out of a director... 

60
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,490
 You speak as though Taeil Accounting will be ruined because of me. 

61
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,750
 It would be more profitable for you 

62
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,110
 to get promoted before you are chewed up. 

63
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,360
I didn't tell you to come in.

64
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,020
Wow, maybe it's because this accounting firm loves money,

65
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,050
but the one who brings in a lot of money is king,

66
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,740
seeing as how you're promoted and given a room like this after selling bad debt at a high price.

67
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,460
Keeping a poker face is still part of the game.

68
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,990
Whether you decide to read it or not is your choice.

69
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,680
I heard one of these desks in this building costs ₩200 million ($150,000). Gosh.

70
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,900
If it's this size, how much would it be?

71
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,710
Why? Will you give up being a certified accountant to become a certified broker?

72
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:46,450
Why didn't you come in for the sales deal meeting?

73
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,460
I'm not interested.

74
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,550
Even if the person who asked for the sale was Noona Ji Soo, are you still not interested?

75
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,420
Cake Bean...

76
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,910
You should hire a different firm instead of Taeil Accounting.

77
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,810
You know nothing good will come from getting involved with V.P. Han Je Gyun.

78
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,570
I'd like for you to stop getting involved in my business.

79
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,870
- Ji Soo, what I'm trying to say is— 
 - I told you I'm not Jang Ji Soo from back then.

80
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,530
Why not wait and see if getting involved with him will be beneficial or not?

81
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,880
Hey, Sang Hyun,

82
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,060
I'll handle the Cake Bean case.

83
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,470
Even though we were so careful, you managed to join us.

84
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,350
He managed to join us.

85
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,180
Mr. Yang Jae Hwan.

86
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,180
I'm Han Seung Jo, the PM (project manager) for the Cake Bean sales deal.

87
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,980
Let's start the meeting.

88
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,790
They are conducting due diligence for a sales deal so carefully.

89
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,710
It's because the accounting firm's verification becomes the transaction's basis.

90
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,040
Why do you think people say we sell trust and not reports?

91
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,340
We don't really seem to be selling trust either.

92
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,610
What?

93
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,170
Why ask when you already know?

94
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,090
That mouth of yours...

95
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,750
You said you weren't interested.

96
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,300
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

97
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,190
Was it for Noona?

98
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,470
Even if we lack info on HK Private Equity Fund's operations director, this is bad.

99
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,370
It's usually not this bad.

100
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,670
I guess there's a reason for it to be kept secret.

101
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,250
Why would Ji Soo get involved in such a place?

102
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,770
There's likely a reason for that as well.

103
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,970
Did you hear anything useful?

104
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,150
I need to find out,

105
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,370
starting with who these shy, rich men are.

106
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,640
We must do whatever it takes to prevent Ji Soo from getting hurt.

107
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,240
 If they sent money to a private equity fund, 

108
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,340
then is it an LP (limited partner)?

109
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,800
- "LP"? 
 - I refer to owners of funds.

110
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,190
It could be an individual or an organization.

111
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,650
It may not be a person...

112
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,800
If it's a person, it could be several people.

113
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,930
But why would you suddenly ask me about a private equity fund's LP?

114
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,270
I was wondering who the LP of HK Private Equity Fund was.

115
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,890
There are so many things I can't find out with my abilities.

116
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,970
Realistically, it will be difficult to find the funds' owners

117
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,970
since the reason for creating private equity funds is to remain unseen,

118
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,880
though it may be possible if you have a point of entry

119
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,070
like a pedestrian overpass between two buildings.

120
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,740
   

121
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,170
(TN: Account Ledgers)

122
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,650
President Baek?

123
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,450
What brings her here?

124
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,430
In the morning...

125
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,830
   

126
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,420
Do I have to teach you to speak now? "In the morning," what?

127
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,880
The problem you found with Cake Bean's financial statements earlier in the morning...

128
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,340
No matter how I look at it,

129
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,290
it's not like the account subjects are wrong, nor are the amount calculations wrong either.

130
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,090
The profitability is good too.

131
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,380
If it seems good to you, then I guess it's good

132
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,110
since you're an expert like me.

133
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,340
How is a first-year newbie the same as a ten-year veteran?

134
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,830
Wait!

135
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,690
A-Accountant!

136
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,030
There is an issue that hasn't been reported yet.

137
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:17,550
I heard that Jin Tae Soo added to his embarrassing moments.

138
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,590
It wasn't an embarrassing moment, but wealth.

139
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,110
Also, how could you call your father "Tae Soo"?

140
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,370
I heard you were betrayed.

141
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,410
That will all be later...

142
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,110
Yes, sure.

143
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,460
Dad, I'm ever so glad to have become an accountant lately.

144
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,250
Aigoo, what's with you?

145
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,330
You always said you don't have time to meet friends or sleep

146
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,360
and you want to live like a human being.

147
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,910
You were always whining about that.

148
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,590
But now I want to work hard.

149
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,230
Am I...

150
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,890
am I growing up now?

151
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,670
I guess you are.

152
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,540
Well, since you've grown up now...

153
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,460
the head judge says he wants to see you after his trial.

154
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,370
Dad!

155
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,700
Well, the thing is, he's just a judge right now,

156
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,180
but he may be on to bigger things in the future—

157
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,500
You don't have to get involved in such bothersome work anymore.

158
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,730
Dad, I'm telling you I enjoy going to work every day right now.

159
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,550
   

160
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
   

161
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,400
   

162
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,340
   

163
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,220
   

164
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,070
Please show us samples of the ones I've checked.

165
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,770
I'm back.

166
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,200
The inventory check was hard, right?

167
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,920
Wasn't it cold working in the freezer storage units?

168
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,910
I'm going home.

169
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,790
Aigoo, my goodness.

170
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,530
Eat more.

171
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,140
Thanks.

172
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,900
Guys, be quiet for a bit.

173
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,750
Hello?

174
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,270
Yes.

175
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,550
Right... I didn't realize I left that behind.

176
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,620
- Tomorrow, I'll— 
  - I'm currently passing near your house. 

177
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,030
 Where are you right now? 

178
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,560
Pardon?

179
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,190
Aigoo!

180
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,230
Yes, you dummy!

181
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,690
Do you guys even know what happened to me today?

182
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,910
I was in a ridiculous freezer storage unit...

183
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,330
What?

184
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,940
What is it?

185
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,150
   

186
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,470
You should have told me your sunbae was a girl, Buddy.

187
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,990
Welcome.

188
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,890
- Here you go. 
 - Yes, thank you.

189
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,140
Please take good care of our Ho Woo.

190
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,040
Well, Mr. Jang Ho Woo is quite good.

191
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,960
Right, he's so good that he ended up like this—

192
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,550
Hey!

193
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,790
Accountants don't usually wear suits when they go do inventory checks,

194
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,590
especially if you go to a freezer unit. Even in summer, bring a padded jacket.

195
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,060
Did Mr. Yang Jae Hwan really not tell you anything?

196
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,320
I guess he didn't want to tell me.

197
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,120
You know how he hates me.

198
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,500
What happened at the last meeting was probably due to Ms. Hye Won.

199
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,780
Ms. Son Hye Won?

200
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,740
 Gosh, didn't you see a cup there? 

201
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,610
 Who's the one who placed the cup like this? 

202
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,080
 Then are you saying you did well? 

203
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,310
 Do you think it would have broken if you'd placed it properly? 

204
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,520
 It's my fault again, right? 

205
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,060
 A married couple? 

206
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,240
They were a college campus couple and entered the company at the same time.

207
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,980
They managed the triple crown (three wins).

208
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,640
If they entered the firm at the same time...

209
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,070
Ms. Hye Won's promotion got delayed as she went on maternity leave.

210
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,910
That's why she's so caught up with this sales deal

211
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,560
to boost her performance review.

212
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,560
And Mr. Yang Jae Hwan likely acted that way since he knows this.

213
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,060
There's likely something that only those two

214
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,830
would know that others can't understand.

215
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,490
Cheers?

216
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,820
Oh, yes.

217
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,530
Or maybe not.

218
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,210
In any case, it's nice to meet you all.

219
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,380
Cheers.

220
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,580
Okay.

221
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,900
I have something else to give you.

222
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,460
 So with that said, Dad, 

223
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,110
 can you help me out with something without asking questions? 

224
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,100
 - What? 
 - You know HK Private Equity Fund, right, 

225
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,000
 since my father knows everyone who's rich? 

226
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,030
 Why do you ask about that? 

227
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,590
 Can you find for me who that fund's LP is? 

228
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,020
 Is it a solicitation? 

229
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,530
 It's a request. 

230
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,300
 What for? 

231
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,980
 So I can date. 

232
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,670
 "Date"? 

233
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,970
I found this out for you.

234
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:30,780
For the first time in my life, I mixed a request and a solicitation (plea).

235
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,250
   

236
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,140
"Lee Chan Joo"?

237
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,880
Chairman Lee Chan Joo of Sangah Group

238
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,730
is supposedly one of HK Private Equity Fund's LPs.

239
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,670
You were curious about it last time, Mr. Ho Woo.

240
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,380
Are you sure?

241
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,440
How did you find out?

242
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,270
You're grateful, right?

243
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,530
My goodness, she's hopeless.

244
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,210
Are you... 
    

245
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,480
What's with your gaze?

246
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,180
What? Wh-What about my gaze?

247
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,720
Well...

248
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,380
You looked like you were envious.

249
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,640
I am envious...

250
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,470
and fascinated as well.

251
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,750
About what?

252
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,210
About how she can get drunk with people she just met

253
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,650
and laugh, work, then go home

254
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,930
like an ordinary person.

255
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:07,010
I can't live the ordinary life that's normal and easy for others.

256
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,850
So I wonder if I can mingle with people like her.

257
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:18,140
She may be... much more amazing than I thought.

258
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,200
Right. So who told you to be champion of a cause?

259
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,120
Would it hurt you to just ordinarily join them?

260
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,760
I'd have to endure and overcome as a champion.

261
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,210
What is this? Is it another drunk person?

262
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,890
Help me out this once.

263
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,250
Aren't accountants people, too?

264
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,930
Oh, I see.

265
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,760
Then I guess you, Accountant... no...

266
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,890
I guess you can take care of your fellow accountant, Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

267
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,300
I'll be going.

268
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,210
Hey, hey!

269
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,240
Gosh.

270
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,970
I told you just to come by and show your face. Why would you pay the bill? 
    

271
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,820
I should escort you to get hangover food,

272
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,750
but I have a meeting that's hard to cancel in the morning so...

273
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,460
Hey, hey!

274
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,310
If you do this, you make me look bad for calling you out, Mr. Shim.

275
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,700
I'll come by next week to pick up the corporate card.

276
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,350
Until then, treat yourself to good, healthy food with your teammates.

277
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,480
I heard it's a mess in the Audit Department at your firm

278
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,270
trying to acquire external auditing of Jisan Bank.

279
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,920
It will be easy for a family to fall apart

280
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,570
once people start focusing on filling their own pockets.

281
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,170
V.P. Han Je Gyun must be rather displeased.

282
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
You must be going through a lot, Mr. Shim.

283
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,820
I came here to hang out with my favorite hyungnim.

284
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,610
I didn't come here to talk business.

285
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,690
Whatever. I'll believe you.

286
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,880
I also believe in you, Mr. Shim.

287
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,490
Sir, we should move on to the third round.

288
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,190
Let's go. I'm leaving.

289
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,960
Let's go.

290
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,670
Goodbye.

291
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,760
Is it around here?

292
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,240
The place CEO Jang In Ho died?

293
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,840
I'm not trying to criticize you.

294
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,670
Working at a company is like a theatrical play.

295
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,250
So that was probably the role you were given,

296
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,980
and you likely didn't have the power to refuse.

297
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,870
But it would be a problem if you mistake that to mean I forgive you.

298
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,590
Repay me...

299
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,780
so I'll keep you alive when I want to kill.

300
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,450
Repay me by showing that

301
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,230
Accountant Shim Hyung Woo's continued corporate value

302
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,730
is greater than his liquidation value.

303
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,240
By doing what?

304
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,430
   

305
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,950
   

306
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,950
   

307
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,270
   

308
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,690
 If what Ms. Yeon Ah said is true, 

309
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,790
 then An is an important figure in the private equity fund. 

310
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,670
 And if that person is connected to Lee Chan Joo, 

311
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,440
 things will grow on a bigger scale than expected. 

312
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,950
 While Noona approaches An, 

313
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,460
 it may be right for me to chase Lee Chan Joo. 

314
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,540
 For sure, there will be a point of connection. 

315
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,120
 Stand up straight! Darn you incompetent b*stards! 

316
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,440
Sh*t. Why do you guys even eat?

317
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,420
You should have some money from the sale of Sangah Village.

318
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,020
Since we're in need of money, use that for now!

319
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,290
Even if we build the residential and commercial complex,

320
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,720
the apartment sale's price is the same as construction cost,

321
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,710
and the margin is decided by the complex. But an issue caused the complex to not sell.

322
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,570
D*mn it!

323
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,050
Hey, what about Sangah Pharmaceutical?

324
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,340
Since they will be releasing a new drug soon, won't some money be there?

325
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,510
They failed the third round of clinical trial so the release date is delayed.

326
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,350
You b*stards!

327
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,050
I pay you guys a lot of money! Are you even doing your jobs?

328
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,350
Since the agencies keep getting loans to pay off debts when they're in need,

329
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,720
none are in good financial condition...

330
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,330
Are you rubbing salt into my wounds?

331
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,390
Forget it.

332
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,770
Just call Jisan Bank.

333
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,560
Say we'll repay fast after using it.

334
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,070
Ask them to lend us ₩20 billion ($15.5 million)... no, no...

335
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,110
ask them to lend us ₩50 billion ($39 million) to play it safe.

336
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,390
Why the heck aren't you calling them?

337
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,470
Jisan Bank isn't answering our calls.

338
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,880
Why not?

339
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,950
They won't take our calls with all the tabloids

340
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,180
saying Sangah Group's high debt ratio.

341
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,730
They've done business with us since my father was the chairman!

342
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,320
Would they dare ignore

343
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,190
Sangah Group's calls due to a mere tabloid article?

344
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,990
These b*stards!

345
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,270
They're all dead. Hey, move.

346
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,340
Chairman, what if they tell us to repay all loans at once?

347
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,300
If you tell me you can't, why do you even get paid salaries?

348
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,810
Before the bank closes,

349
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,720
take action, whether you sell something off

350
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,620
or involve loan sharks!

351
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,980
Won't you do it? Do you want me to beat you up?

352
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,210
Yes? Hey, you all, get out! Leave!

353
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,060
Go, you b*stards!

354
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,880
Why do I keep those useless guys around!

355
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,830
Gosh!

356
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,270
I'm the crazy one.

357
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,210
Oh, my goodness.

358
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,150
Jeez.

359
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,830
Gosh, what is it now?

360
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,730
   

361
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,480
The Cake Bean sales deal... What do you think...

362
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,860
we'll need to do to sell it?

363
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,780
Who knows?

364
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,090
If I like what you have to say,

365
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,870
I might raise your performance review points.

366
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,380
Please do it for the entire team.

367
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,850
Fine.

368
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,350
I think I'd look into

369
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,860
what they can sell off after buying Cake Bean.

370
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,370
So one can sell something else if they buy Cake Bean.

371
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,380
You need to make them feel they're making money while spending money

372
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,260
to get them to open their wallets.

373
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,650
 With Cake Bean's positive brand image 

374
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,980
 and an owner troubled by an unsold complex 

375
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,350
 in need of an attraction effect, 

376
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,420
 they'll become the target of focus. 
   

377
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,310
For instance,

378
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,520
Sangah Village is a good example.

379
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,920
Okay.

380
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,100
Are you saying if we buy the franchise,

381
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,700
we can sell Sangah Village?

382
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,420
There's nothing faster and more effective than selling real estate.

383
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,770
That's only possible when selling a large property.

384
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,880
You can't even sell stores in Sangah Village.

385
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,580
We're lucky if we can even recoup the cement costs.

386
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,840
By the way, do you both have time to do this here?

387
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,210
Aren't you busy?

388
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:26,660
What I'm sying is that in order to sell Sangah Village for a reasonable price,

389
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,220
we can take care of the unsold stores with the franchise.

390
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,880
Aigoo, the franchise is old news.

391
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,770
It's been a while since it was popular.

392
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,120
It's more than possible if we approach it as a steady seller.

393
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,210
Cake Bean is a dessert specialty─

394
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,990
Chairman,

395
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,630
in your opinion,

396
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,170
what do you think an audit is?

397
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:56,980
"Audit"?

398
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,500
Aigoo, V.P. Han.

399
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,680
That's so random.

400
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,690
I guess auditing is auditing.

401
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,080
What do you think it means

402
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,150
to conduct an audit well?

403
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:16,960
Oh, that means to check inside and out whether

404
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,420
a company is doing anything wrong—

405
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,460
For the Deals Department,

406
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,280
we can openly boast about our work doing sales.

407
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,580
But as for the Audit Department,

408
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,020
it's ambiguous to say if one is doing a good job

409
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,650
or to say they're doing a bad job.

410
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,620
So as a fellow accountant, I feel their pain.

411
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,920
Even V.P. An Seung Yeon, who is rumored

412
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,080
to be very competent, faces

413
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,720
such a situation. That says everything.

414
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,310
Well, in any case...

415
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,790
which client would like to hear that...

416
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:11,030
the sword given to them could be used

417
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,690
to cut their own throat?

418
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,270
But then again, it might be better

419
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,810
not to know and get attacked.

420
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,430
So...

421
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,380
Th-That... wh-what did you say?

422
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:36,030
Cake Bean? Are their cakes made of beans?

423
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,090
How did you know that V.P. An

424
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,890
made contact with Chairman Lee?

425
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,980
It's quite obvious when someone like him who doesn't have

426
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,290
any source of money acts so arrogantly like that.

427
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,970
An Seung Yeon likely told him if he let her do the audit,

428
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,900
she'd connect him to a bank to handle his fund issues.

429
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,580
Oh, okay, we'll talk later. All right.

430
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,080
Aigoo.

431
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,510
So where were we?

432
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:16,010
Earlier, we were discussing the cake... the beans...

433
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,200
 So one can sell something else if they buy Cake Bean. 

434
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,440
 You need to make them feel they're making money while spending money 

435
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,760
 to get them to open their wallets. 

436
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,980
So it's okay to pre-freeze everything in advance?

437
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,530
That's why the exceptional technology has a patent.

438
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,810
If we don't prepare them this way, we can't meet demand during the Christmas season.

439
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,820
The cooling technology is amazing, not only for cakes

440
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,560
but in various aspects.

441
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,920
I'm sure they'll discover their own uses.

442
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,170
   

443
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:09,490
Until we sign the contract, please take good care of us.

444
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:12,270
Our Cake Bean has many franchise stores,

445
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,210
and it's a really good company.

446
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,020
May I ask why you're selling such a great company?

447
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,820
- Oh, that's because... 
 -  Hey! 

448
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,720
 Do you really want to die? 

449
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,670
 Hurry up and get out! 

450
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,400
-  Hey!  
 - I can't go.

451
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,060
Who are you trying to kill?

452
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,590
You can't take even one step from here!

453
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,190
   

454
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,010
"Forcing out the franchise"?

455
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,980
If you want to leave, you must drive over me!

456
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,750
- My whole family will die! 
 - Hurry!

457
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,660
- Let go! 
 - Hey! Get up!

458
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,610
Let go of me!

459
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,980
- Ahjussi, what are you doing? 
 - Hurry up!

460
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,360
- I won't move! 
 - Lift him!

461
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,120
It seems we must report this to Mr. Han Seung Jo.

462
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,620
I'll do it.

463
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,200
Please help me!

464
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,680
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't touch me!

465
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,470
Minus 12 percent?

466
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,760
Does that mean Cake Bean franchises are losing money while doing business?

467
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,180
It makes sense why he lay there wrapped in chains.

468
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,510
Since they saw constant cash flow,

469
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,670
it was hard to tell from the franchise owners' perspectives

470
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,840
if they were actually making money.

471
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,590
They learned of their loss only after two years had passed.

472
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,040
Oh, I saw that somewhere.

473
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,810
It's Cake Bean franchise stores' average business period.

474
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,020
Did HK Private Equity Fund know from the beginning

475
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,210
that the franchise stores would fail after two years?

476
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,360
That's why they increased our commission,

477
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,400
for us to sell it quickly.

478
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,910
Because after the host dies,

479
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,950
the parasite can no longer survive.

480
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,310
 Yes? 

481
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,640
Was everything all right at the site today?

482
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,630
Well, that's how inspections go.

483
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,070
Any other issues?

484
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,830
We have ensured there aren't any

485
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,890
since it's an important sales deal to me.

486
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,820
Get going.

487
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,710
 He lay down before the van, asking for franchise survival rights. 

488
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,820
 I thought something terrible would happen. 

489
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,270
 It's understandable if they're being forced out. 

490
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,650
 I heard they pushed products at the franchise stores and forced owners to buy them. 

491
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,220
 You don't think there will be a problem with our case due to this, do you? 

492
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,230
 Mr. Ho Woo said he'd talk to Mr. Han. 

493
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,540
 I'm sure we'll hear something. 

494
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,860
Chairman Lee Chan Joo will be joining us, too?

495
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,310
Yes. We'll leave right away.

496
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,080
Mr. Ho Woo!

497
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,800
I'll see you later.

498
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,290
 If you look in this area, 

499
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,810
where Cake Bean used to be...

500
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,100
Oh! You're saying it will come in here!

501
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,550
Oh, I see!

502
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,870
The general area is about one hundred,

503
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,690
and as for surrounding businesses...

504
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,650
These are Cake Bean's desserts.

505
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,550
- If you take a look... 
 - Wow, so they made it with beans.

506
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,860
Anyway, this will enter this space, right?

507
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,030
These look delicious!

508
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,560
Once the contract is signed tomorrow, Cake Bean's sale will be complete.

509
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,480
You don't need to come to the Sangah Group meeting tomorrow.

510
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,030
Yes. I heard the chairman is going on a business trip.

511
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,420
You sure know all kinds of things.

512
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,550
How are you informed on everything?

513
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,620
That's how contracts are since we can't be sure of anything until the end.

514
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,700
Mr. Ho Woo!

515
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,320
What happened with this?

516
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,400
Didn't you report to Mr. Han Seung Jo?

517
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,690
Confirming how they were forced out...

518
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,180
Didn't you say you would tell him?

519
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,220
I have to at some point.

520
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,830
When?

521
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:51,340
During the flight? After the contract has been signed?

522
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,820
Didn't we confirm everything?

523
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,650
What are you thinking exactly?

524
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,580
 I would like you to leave Taeil Accounting, Mr. Jang Ho Woo. 

525
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,930
 Although it began with good intentions, 

526
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,810
 achieving your goals using someone else 

527
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:13,890
 is not permissible as long as I'm at Taeil Accounting. 

528
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:19,920
 Accountants must be responsible not only for the results but also for the process. 

529
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,570
 Please grant me one more chance. 

530
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:30,110
 Having good intentions without results is meaningless. 

531
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,910
 Your good intentions... 

532
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,810
 I'd like to fulfill them. 

533
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,070
I don't know. I'll go tell him.

534
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,340
Someone once told me

535
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,490
that an accountant isn't a bringer of justice.

536
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:52,280
Does this even need a bringer of justice?

537
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,170
It's extremely common sense.

538
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,750
Selling a company, whose financial statements can't be trusted, is just wrong.

539
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,390
We're not trying to backstab the person who trusted his accountants.

540
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,560
Is keeping quiet your specialty these days?

541
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,840
Don't misunderstand me.

542
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,350
You guys happened to come while I was here already.

543
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,170
Why didn't you say anything

544
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:22,620
about what happened during due diligence?

545
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,660
Look who's talking.

546
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,890
You knew right away what HK Private Equity Fund did to Cake Bean

547
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,670
just by looking at their financial statements.

548
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,540
But you didn't say anything.

549
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,550
 Forcing them out? 

550
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:46,630
 We don't force our franchise stores to 

551
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,170
 purchase our products. 

552
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,720
 If the sales were regular transactions, although they wouldn't appear on financial statements, 

553
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,580
 there would be sales patterns. 

554
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,020
 Due to dessert brand characteristics, 

555
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,680
 sales patterns would change based on seasons and promotions. 

556
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,500
 But Cake Bean doesn't have these sales patterns 

557
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,420
 because they were forced sales artificially matched by someone. 

558
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,020
 It was a good attempt, but it won't go your way. 

559
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,950
 You can't sell unreliable products. 

560
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:18,230
 That client of yours! 

561
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,980
 Even if I did what Joyce Jang told me to do? 

562
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:28,390
 She told me to listen to her if I wanted to retain any of my money. 

563
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,020
It's not Ji Soo's fault.

564
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,720
It's common in a private equity fund's exit procedure.

565
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,220
There is no obligation for the accountant to consider

566
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,230
the franchises not included in the due diligence process.

567
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,670
All right. That's why I'm going with the flow.

568
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,440
What's the problem?

569
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,600
It doesn't seem what Jang Ho Woo would do.

570
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,710
I'm sure I'll be fine.

571
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,060
I'm a professional, too.

572
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,490
Do you still think

573
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,640
accounting firms don't sell reports

574
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,340
but sell trust?

575
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,300
   

576
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,240
 What you asked for before... 

577
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,570
 There's no information here at the location either. 

578
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,980
 Regardless, 

579
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,990
 I was able to find a few companies that HK Private Equity Fund contacted, 

580
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,150
 and I emailed that to you. 

581
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,210
 But what do these guys do? 

582
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:10,060
   

583
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,970
Mr. Jin from Jisan Bank?

584
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,590
Is he still asking me to bid on the special bonds?

585
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,090
What should I do?

586
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,300
Ignore it.

587
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,150
There's no upside (benefit) to it.

588
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,650
Does he think I came here to do small things like that?

589
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:50,520
What's going on that you'd call me out after work?

590
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,440
   

591
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,060
 Overseas funds are going after Korean companies 

592
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,900
 as they're making money rotating through companies in Korea. 

593
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,750
Korean money?

594
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:10,250
Korean people.

595
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,630
Right. Black-haired foreigners.

596
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,720
Since the money was earned in Korea, it can legally stay in the country.

597
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,210
In any case, since the money belongs to foreigners,

598
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,790
they could take it overseas if something happens.

599
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,240
Why make it so complicated?

600
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,930
They can pull money hidden in the dark into the sun.

601
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:30,850
Money laundering.

602
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,780
Even if this is true,

603
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,450
Chairman Lee Chan Joo couldn't have done this by himself.

604
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,690
Who does she think she is?

605
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,720
Han Seung Jo?

606
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,180
Move out of the way.

607
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,480
That's fine.

608
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:24,390
Is HK Private Equity Fund's source in Korea?

609
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:29,170
Do you even know how dangerous what you're doing is?

610
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:36,420
This is on a completely different level than forcing out Cake Bean's franchise stores!

611
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,620
It seems you're not an incompetent accountant.

612
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,500
But danger?

613
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,350
A danger I'm aware of is no longer a risk factor.

614
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,160
It was a price formation variable reflected in my prices.

615
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,030
Since it's risky, is HK giving you

616
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,390
more for hazard pay?

617
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,180
As you can see,

618
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,670
everything is costly.

619
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,430
Ji Soo.

620
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,000
Why are you doing this?

621
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,990
You acted all high and mighty by yourself,

622
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,400
but Han Seung Jo doesn't amount to much, either,

623
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,260
coming after drinking to see the woman he parted with. .

624
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:31,940
The real danger is...

625
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,280
uncertainty,

626
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,540
a situation where you can't tell if it's favorable or unfavorable.

627
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:45,180
Don't regret when you're sober in the morning and just leave.

628
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,610
You have the contract, right?

629
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,900
Yes.

630
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,270
Get in!

631
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:37,730
What are you doing? Chairman Lee Chan Joo's schedule changed.

632
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,150
Okay.

633
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:58,150
Didn't you want this sales deal to go through?

634
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,140
I thought that's why you didn't tell Mr. Han on purpose.

635
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,840
You have to drop it from up high for it to shatter into pieces.

636
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,840
Excuse me? What?

637
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,820
By the way, what's with this car?

638
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,320
It's the fastest one out of all my cars.

639
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,330
"Out of all my cars"?

640
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,900
Oh, M-Ms. Yeon Ah...

641
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,130
Mr. Ho Woo!

642
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,020
I'm telling you I have an urgent message for a passenger!

643
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,490
I told you as well, but

644
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:42,960
it's impossible if he's already in the departure lounge.

645
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,650
How about delivering a note or an in-flight announcement?

646
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:49,620
That would also be difficult since it concerns the passenger's personal info and safety.

647
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,610
Then I'll buy a ticket.

648
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,380
If I have a ticket, I can enter the departure lounge, right?

649
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,460
- Here. 
 - Your passport, please.

650
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,260
It's not like I'm really going to leave.

651
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,930
I'm just going into the departure lounge and coming right back out.

652
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,820
But do you still need my passport?

653
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,450
Yes.

654
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,500
   

655
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,200
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to voicemail. 

656
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,510
Accountant Han Seung Jo?

657
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,630
What are you doing here, Mr. Han?

658
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,410
Don't buy Cake Bean, Chairman.

659
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:54,760
What?

660
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:01,750
So you came all the way here to tell me that, too?

661
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,110
Excuse me?

662
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,360
You're working hard. Thank you.

663
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,990
Mr. Ho Woo.

664
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,840
How are you coming out of there?

665
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,270
   
   

666
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,030
   

667
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,040
   

668
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,120
   

669
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,520
 Thank you. 

670
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,050
 Please give me any ticket that will allow me in the departure lounge. 

671
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,590
 Chairman Lee Chan Joo! 

672
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,340
 I'm accountant Jang Ho Woo from Taeil Accounting. 

673
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,720
 If you mean Cake Bean's sales deal, the head office right now... 

674
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,700
 That contract... Please don't do it, Chairman Lee. 

675
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:17,740
 What? 

676
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,670
 Cake Bean is very different from what you know about them. 

677
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:25,030
 There's plenty of evidence to support it. 

678
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,400
 How could that be? 

679
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,430
 V.P. Han definitely told me... 

680
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,160
 V.P. Han may not have known, 

681
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,410
 or he might have. 

682
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:40,230
 If he didn't know, it was a mistake. But if he did, it was deception. 

683
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:45,210
 Whichever is true, it's a problem for you, Chairman. 

684
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,140
 Rather than the person giving you a delicious cake, 

685
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:55,580
 the one who removes a poisonous cake looks more amazing. 

686
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,920
   

687
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,090
A glass of champagne worth ₩14 million ($11,000)...

688
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:23,840
♫  Left behind in this place all alone  ♫

689
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,820
♫  That was me  ♫

690
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:36,350
♫  The lonely days that blinded me with sadness made me who I am today  ♫

691
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:41,620
♫  Please tell me why, find out the truth you wanted  ♫

692
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:46,970
♫  Find again the dreams that you've forgotten  ♫

693
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:51,600
♫  Focus your mind, see deep inside  ♫

694
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:58,940
♫  I will call out in the midst of it for all to see  ♫

695
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,690
V.P. Han.

696
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:15,890
Who do you think you are to ruin the contract?

697
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,400
I told you I'd make you pay if you ruined the Cake Bean deal.

698
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,400
How dare you stab us in the back!

699
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,510
By chance, did you plan all this to mess with me?

700
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,950
Did you sabotage us?

701
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:29,310
What a crazy b*stard! Look at this idiot.

702
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:32,320
What are you doing?

703
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,400
   

704
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,850
   

705
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:04,340
You didn't purposely hold out until the airport, did you?

706
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:08,750
If that was effective, let's say it was my plan.

707
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:11,270
What are you talking about?

708
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,600
Was their patent missing from Cake Bean's sales deal?

709
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,780
Yes. HK Private Equity Fund said they won't sell the patent but will hold on to it.

710
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,370
They're selling the company but not the patent?

711
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,600
   

712
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,110
   

713
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,570
   

714
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:51,900
   

715
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,140
   

716
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,620
"Patent"?

717
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:07,330
Are these all the patents held by HK Private Equity Fund?

718
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:12,450
Why would they need this many patents?

719
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,110
 It's a shield 

720
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,300
to protect us from responsibility and criticism.

721
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,170
We don't need to worry about a slush (secret) fund if we have this.

722
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,110
But in this day and age?

723
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,500
In your district, Assemblyman,

724
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,430
I noticed there's the largest food manufacturing company in the metropolitan city.

725
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:36,630
How much would they like to contribute to your political funds?

726
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:39,230
If they could, I'm sure they'd like to give you funds

727
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,250
and reap the benefits.

728
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,700
I'm sure they can't because they don't know how.

729
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:48,080
I'll take care of it for you,

730
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,490
legally and absolutely.

731
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,580
A patent usage fee.

732
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:05,630
The money given to the patent holder for using their patent?

733
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:10,340
If money is exchanged futilely, it would be illegal incentive and bribery.

734
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,080
But if we receive payment for lending a needed patent to the company,

735
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,850
that would be doing business.

736
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,850
So that's why this is a shield?

737
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,460
It's an exclusive right allowed by the state.

738
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,090
That's what a patent is.

739
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,770
It's a legal way to give them all the work.

740
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,480
Considering the information here,

741
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,810
let's find out where HK Private Equity Fund acquired all their patents and who is using them.

742
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,120
Okay.

743
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:40,640
And if we give the patent rights to your son, it'll cover gift tax issues as well.

744
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,240
You can exemplify being a great father in the process.

745
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,560
Ultimately, this is all for the benefit of our children.

746
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,550
   

747
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,230
Lee Bo Sung, Sangah Group's Lee Chan Joo's son.

748
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:57,750
Park Seung Joon, nephew of Mirae Party's representative.

749
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:02,370
Nam Hyung Min, KSC Broadcasting Company's son-in-law.

750
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:06,380
Kim Suh Ra, Financial Services Commission chair's brother.

751
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,690
The remaining patents are similar.

752
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,730
Should I continue?

753
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:17,820
So what is it that you want from me?

754
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:20,580
You must want something from me to be doing this.

755
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:24,390
 Jang Ji Soo is not actually collecting patents. 

756
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,600
She is collecting people.

757
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:37,600
   

758
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,010
Yes.

759
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:41,780
How did the interview for a nonperforming fund manager go?

760
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,670
Select someone in his forties who is the sole breadwinner with children to spend money on.

761
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:50,070
He must have no escape route so he'll do what he's told.

762
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,570
Who finds their job rewarding these days?

763
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,760
Just offer more money. Yes.

764
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,180
Chairman Lee.

765
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,980
I was on my way to see you, but here we are.

766
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:14,450
I'm here to collect my payment for lending my name to you last time.

767
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,820
Yes.

768
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,560
What is it that you want?

769
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,110
How are you so confident? You don't know what I'll ask for.

770
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,120
You want me to collect Sangah Group's bonds?

771
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,580
For a company like Sangah Group with the owner's risk,

772
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:34,160
the creditors will have more power than its shareholders.

773
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,530
Even with the owner's risk,

774
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:40,600
if the company pays its principal and interest on time, there's nothing the creditors can do.

775
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,530
Situations can always change.

776
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:53,640
If the situation changes, the creditor status would change too.

777
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,300
They're like the meek lamb when they receive the principal and interest.

778
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,330
But if you don't feed them,

779
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:04,600
don't savage beasts hunt and eat even their trainers?

780
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,460
   

781
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,320
Mr. Ho Woo!

782
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,910
Well, the thing is...

783
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,730
I...

784
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,250
What's this?

785
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:58,910
Well... do you normally not have any boundaries with other people?

786
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:02,010
People could get distracted at times. Who cares, right?

787
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,450
Is it something that embarrassing?

788
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:13,160
I've never done anything to be embarrassed about.

789
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,350
Then include me too.

790
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,560
- What? 
 - I don't usually meddle in other people's work, but

791
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,390
I also don't want new staff to struggle.

792
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:30,210
Shall we... do it properly this time?

793
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,600
Cooperation.

794
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:42,110


795
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,750
♫  It's time to show you my way  ♫

796
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,680
♫  Don't want to lose all my pride  ♫

797
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,100
♫  You're not the man at the wheel  ♫

798
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,780
♫  I can smell all your secrets  ♫

799
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,720
♫  There's something you need to know  ♫

800
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,900
♫  Already feel it in my veins  ♫

801
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:06,910
   

802
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:10,910
 Please remove Mr. Jang Ho Woo from major tasks. 

803
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:12,880
 Let's look through Sangah Group's documents for now. 

804
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,150
 Do you even know what you're doing? 

805
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,410
 I want to help you. Do I need a reason? 

806
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,550
 Yesterday's enemy can become your friend today. 

807
