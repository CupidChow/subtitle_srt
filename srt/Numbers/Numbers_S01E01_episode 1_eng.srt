1
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:34,674
   

2
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:47,340


3
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,304
This is yours, right?

4
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,204
Yes.

5
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:11,514
   

6
00:01:15,954 --> 00:01:21,464
Aigoo! This is your favorite seaweed soup, Mr. Kim!

7
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:24,424
Have a hot bowl of soup

8
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,944
and get some energy to work hard.

9
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:28,584
Thank you.

10
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:31,234
Aigoo. There's not much meat here today.

11
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:33,154
Don't you like meat?

12
00:01:33,154 --> 00:01:35,784
- I have to go on a diet. 
 - Oh my!

13
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:37,494
That's not spicy, right?

14
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:40,764
My dad can't eat spicy food, either.

15
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:43,494
Whenever he comes here, he asks Grandma,

16
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:47,044
"Could I please have just three fried eggs?" Don't you do that?

17
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:49,114
Your dad...

18
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:55,764
I really don't enjoy spicy foods.

19
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,174
Even if you're a grownup?

20
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:00,874
Of course!

21
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:03,494
Grownups are people who were children.

22
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:05,754
Many still don't like spicy food,

23
00:02:05,754 --> 00:02:09,004
and we are still afraid of many things.

24
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,694
You're a grownup with many problems, aren't you?

25
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,604
I like spicy food, and

26
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,814
there's nothing I fear.

27
00:02:18,814 --> 00:02:21,344
Don't worry about anything!

28
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,124
I told you I don't know!

29
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:29,284
How many times do I have to check for you to believe me?

30
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,234
The child has no family background information.

31
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:35,324
Because my friend asked, I looked up all his age of missing children.

32
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:37,154
I inquired in all the hospital medical records,

33
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:39,884
and I even investigated around the construction site.

34
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,394
But absolutely nothing turned up!

35
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,594
   

36
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:52,854
Now, let's just live at my place forever.

37
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:57,084
Where you and Noona Ji Soo live?

38
00:02:57,084 --> 00:02:59,304
And

39
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,624
we'll never come back here.

40
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:06,884
Then aren't you going to see your police friend?

41
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:08,514
Yes.

42
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:12,344
- Did you fight? 
 - Yes.

43
00:03:13,074 --> 00:03:16,694
When you fight with your friend, you don't play with them either.

44
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,614
   

45
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,814
Hey, you a**holes!

46
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:47,104
You're dead today!

47
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,754
Ho Woo...

48
00:03:55,354 --> 00:03:57,084
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:57,084 --> 00:03:59,134
We'll get going.

50
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:04,574
I told you to stand up for yourself, not beat them up!

51
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:07,054
They started it with Yeo Jin and Hee Sam!

52
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:09,894
He's right! Those punks started it first!

53
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:11,424
That's right. It wasn't Ho Woo's fault.

54
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:12,814
See? I told you!

55
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:16,184
Oh, all right! Let's just go eat.

56
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:18,574
Look at you, getting out of this easily,

57
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:20,644
when you don't even have parents!

58
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,234
Even dogs know where they come from!

59
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:26,804
That doesn't make any sense!

60
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:29,474
Oh! Oh, Ahjussi!

61
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:32,254
Oh, come on! This isn't it!

62
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:34,004
Ahjussi!

63
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:38,260
Wow, wasn't Ahjussi so fast?

64
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,190
Oh, yes.

65
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,674
Oh, my gosh! I'm so tired!

66
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:44,764
He's in great shape!

67
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:47,584
Next time we get called to the police station,

68
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,874
let's call my grandma and not Mr. Jang.

69
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:52,874
It's not just once or twice we did this. I feel like I'll die!

70
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:55,294
Ms. Cheon Ja will kill us all if we call her.

71
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:58,104
I feel that might be better.

72
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,954
Where does Mr. Jang get all that energy?

73
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:08,664
Whenever anyone even mentions "orphan" to Ho Woo, he gets so worked up!

74
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:12,214
That's how parents must feel.

75
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:18,634
Hey, hey! It's all right.

76
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:21,914
I can't long for anything that I don't remember!

77
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:25,444
Do you still only remember your name?

78
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:27,384
Not even your parents' names?

79
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,204
That's why when Ahjussi took him to the police station many times,

80
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:34,764
they returned empty-handed!

81
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,004
Ahjussi looked into it,

82
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:43,420
but there weren't any reported accidents on the day I was found at the construction site.

83
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,194
There weren't any reports of missing children either.

84
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:48,924
Then does it mean they abandoned you or what?

85
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:51,524
How could that be?

86
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:53,634
This punk, seriously! Get it together!

87
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:55,634
That's not what I mean...

88
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:59,474
- Gosh, come on... 
 - Seriously...

89
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,004
They told us to conduct an inspection so here we are...

90
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:06,684
What shall we do then?

91
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:08,504
Do we count rebars or something?

92
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:11,004
What did the supervision report say? 
    

93
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:14,244
They do have a completion schedule, but

94
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:18,634
the provision in the clause says we can tolerate 5-10% difference.

95
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:20,904
We need to know what that 5-10% amounts to.

96
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:23,384
- Give that to me. 
 - Oh, yes.

97
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:27,404
Wouldn't that be by exterior wall construction standards?

98
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:29,514
Let's go eat first.

99
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:31,934
Have a good day!

100
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,554
Ho Woo! Jang Ho Woo!

101
00:06:34,554 --> 00:06:36,604
Yes, I'm coming!

102
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,384
Welcome!

103
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,224
We should go to an expensive place with our company card. Why a place like this?

104
00:06:48,224 --> 00:06:50,674
Well, it suits the project we're working on.

105
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:52,274
That's true.

106
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:55,224
If the accountants wrote something like the Michelin (restaurants) guide, I'm sure it'd be daebak.

107
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:58,394
We usually get treated to many dinners and ate at many places

108
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:00,084
so we know tons of great eateries.

109
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:04,104
I noticed yesterday that the company's numbers don't seem to add up.

110
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,374
Oh, that?

111
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,854
It's rare to have a company where the numbers add up perfectly.

112
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:09,924
There could be discrepancies due to debt as well.

113
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:12,194
If it's minor, you could bury the numbers in there somewhere.

114
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,964
But we'd have to find out why they have that discrepancy.

115
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:16,354
So we can say we verified it.

116
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:19,134
Or you can just say "sudden death" and write 2 down.

117
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:26,614
If I could, I'd rather do that instead of verifying.

118
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,674
Vinegar.

119
00:07:32,674 --> 00:07:36,204
 What do you mean, the report conclusions may be reversed? 

120
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:39,484
If the conclusion has changed, then we should go with another...

121
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,484
I haven't heard anything like that from the PM (Project Manager).

122
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:44,954
He has no idea so how could he say anything?

123
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:47,824
If he doesn't know, then who...

124
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,384
That's why you told her to write down "2."

125
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:57,404
If the conclusions change, we won't even use that data so why make her suffer?

126
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:59,624
If it's not a big deal, just bury it in there.

127
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:04,044
 If we tweak the numbers a bit, then even if someone opens it up later, they can't... 

128
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:07,264
It's not like they're talking in codes. What are they saying?

129
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:11,634
Oh, Man. He's working hard to construct a building that will collapse anyway.

130
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,304
Aigoo. Someone will trip and fall on this.

131
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:19,614
- Mr. Kim, hurry and move these pallets. 
 - Okay.

132
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,284
Ahjussi.

133
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:25,154
The accountants came by.

134
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:27,214
Yes, they come out quarterly.

135
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,414
But this time, the accountants...

136
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:34,054
You said you want to become a police officer. Are you studying for it?

137
00:08:34,054 --> 00:08:39,884
If all you do is go around fighting, you'll die of exhaustion or die alone when you're old.

138
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,024
And wear your safety helmet!

139
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,374
Hey, Ahjussi!

140
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,844
 And the residents in the area... 

141
00:08:53,844 --> 00:08:56,064
I don't see Yeo Jin today.

142
00:08:56,064 --> 00:08:58,834
I haven't seen her all day, either!

143
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:03,404
She's too busy preparing for the police examination.

144
00:09:03,404 --> 00:09:07,170
 Haebit Construction, which was in the spotlight for its patent on modular architecture technology,  

145
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,970
 will be liquidated. 

146
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:12,044
 According to Taeil Accounting that represents Haebit Construction, 

147
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:16,274
 management deteriorated due to decreased domestic demand. 
    

148
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:18,454
 Reporter Noh reports. 

149
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:24,114
 By developing a breakthrough patent technology that shortens the construction period and lowers the cost, 
   

150
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:27,874
 Haebit Construction, which received the Minister's Award for its innovative technology, 
   

151
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:29,924
 has been discussing renewal for a month now. 

152
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:33,944
 But they couldn't overcome funding issues and are liquidating. 
   

153
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:37,244
Ho Woo, what does that mean?

154
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:42,814
Aigoo. I did hear the workers discussing something strange yesterday.

155
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:45,094
Is this what they were talking about?

156
00:09:45,094 --> 00:09:49,234
Aigoo. Then how about our restaurant?

157
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:53,894
Grandma, don't worry too much. I'll go and find out.

158
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,884
 Stand down! Stand down! 

159
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:02,914
 Everyone, you need to stand down! 

160
00:10:02,914 --> 00:10:05,634
 Stand down! Stand down! 

161
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:09,804
 You all need to move out! 

162
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,954
Hey!

163
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:15,934
 Hey, you punk! 

164
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:25,584
 Sh*t! 

165
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:11,994
That's enough!

166
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:31,594
Even if you beat up everyone here, Haebit Construction is already finished.

167
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:41,144
"Liquidation Decision"? 
    

168
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:45,074
   

169
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:47,434
"Taeil Accounting"?

170
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:53,454
As of now, Haebit Construction is bankrupt.

171
00:11:53,454 --> 00:11:56,874
So don't make a fuss and just go away.

172
00:11:56,874 --> 00:11:58,834
According to who?

173
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:02,054
Then what about Hanbat Restaurant and all these people here?

174
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,674
What the heck does that piece of paper mean anyway?

175
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:06,904
Who the heck are you guys?

176
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:12,104
We are... people who hold the lifeline of a corporation.

177
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:17,134
If we want to, we can either save or destroy a company.

178
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:20,144
People who have the power of life or death.

179
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:22,884
- Does that even make sense? 
 - It doesn't matter.

180
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:24,974
Accountants look only at numbers.

181
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,294
"Numbers"?

182
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:31,004
There's no way a neighborhood bully, who only knows how to fight, would understand.

183
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:34,764
Don't concern yourself with grown-up matters and just run along.

184
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:43,584
Do you think all grownups are adults?

185
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:46,484
You think the money is yours from stabbing someone in the back.

186
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:48,844
And you think that's a success!

187
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,004
You piece of trash!

188
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,464
What the heck is money, anyway?

189
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,894
Fine. Do whatever you want, you b*stards!

190
00:12:56,894 --> 00:13:01,944
I'll fight you with all I have until the very end!

191
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:06,924
You can't protect anything with this kind of cheap talk.

192
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:11,254
Your anger? That has no power.

193
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:12,394
Watch carefully.

194
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:17,824
See what these pieces of paper, written by accountants, can do from now on.

195
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,100
   

196
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,634
   

197
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:44,934
   

198
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:18,974
Hey, Ho Woo! Take a look at this!

199
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:20,884
Look!

200
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,514
 Thank you for everything so far. 

201
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:27,544
 Thank you. 

202
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:29,554
 I'm sorry. 

203
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,300
   

204
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:21,644
Ahjussi!

205
00:15:23,844 --> 00:15:25,694
Ahjussi!

206
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:35,344
Ah-Ahjussi...

207
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:40,124
Ah-Ahjussi...

208
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,914
Ahjussi!

209
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,704
Ahjussi...

210
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,714
Ahjussi!

211
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:52,494
Ah-Ahjussi! Please wake up!

212
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,564
Ah-Ahjussi!

213
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,604
Ahjussi!

214
00:16:58,404 --> 00:17:00,684
Hey, hello!

215
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:03,164
Is anyone here?

216
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:07,264
Could someone help me? Over here!

217
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:11,024
Ah-Ahjussi! Please, wake up!

218
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:17,164
Please, help!

219
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,784
Please!

220
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:47,094
   

221
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:58,334
   

222
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:04,414
   

223
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,124
   

224
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:14,114
I don't know about this.

225
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,974
- Could you please look at it carefully? 
 - Please leave.

226
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:18,554
It doesn't make sense that all that happened due to this one piece of paper!

227
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:19,944
- I'm busy so please go. 
 - Here, look...

228
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:22,084
- I don't know. Please leave. 
 - Accountant, Sir. 
    

229
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,624
Please, just go!

230
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,860
Please! Could you just take one look?

231
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,050
   

232
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,314
   

233
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:34,690
   

234
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:42,280
   

235
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,494
   

236
00:18:53,324 --> 00:18:55,224
 Accountant? 

237
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:58,154
Yes, accountant.

238
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:04,114
I don't know if they're afraid of Taeil Accounting

239
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:07,510
or only the insiders would know.

240
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,840
No one is being honest with me.

241
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,810
Even if I go to the police or prosecutors, they all say they don't know anything related to accounting.

242
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,624
Just because you want to become an accountant doesn't mean you can easily become one...

243
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:27,444
I need to find out why this happened

244
00:19:28,624 --> 00:19:31,964
to Ahjussi and us...

245
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:37,094
by entering Taeil Accounting.

246
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:43,614
   

247
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:48,084
This design's influence...

248
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,574
Since it depends on the corporation's...

249
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:54,470
You can see, as it continues to go up...

250
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:04,314
 Ho Woo! Hee Sam! 

251
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:07,534
Hey, I got it! Check this out!

252
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:10,114
Hey! What?

253
00:20:17,714 --> 00:20:21,184
Ho Woo! You should come eat, at least.

254
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,414
   

255
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:34,324
Oh, hey! Wow!

256
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:40,374
Study, study.

257
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:48,314
   

258
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:12,374
   

259
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:13,364
   

260
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:29,744
Hello.

261
00:21:29,744 --> 00:21:33,064
Hello. Hello.

262
00:21:33,064 --> 00:21:35,344
Hello, Sunbaenim.

263
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,544
- Yoo Jung! 
 - Sunbaenim!

264
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:39,134
- Congratulations on getting in! 
 - Thank you!

265
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:43,224
- Hello! 
 - Good to see you!

266
00:21:43,224 --> 00:21:44,434
Hello, Sunbaenim.

267
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:47,834
If you have any questions, just ask...

268
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:55,074
Hey, Han Seung Jo!

269
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:57,444
I knew you'd be here!

270
00:21:57,444 --> 00:22:00,134
Gosh, seriously...

271
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:03,024
Don't you know there's a new recruit training today?

272
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:10,944
Why should I come to the new recruit training?

273
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,964
You have to make an impression and network in places like these.

274
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:16,454
So you can become a partner when the time comes.

275
00:22:16,454 --> 00:22:19,974
Since when was making an impression the secret to becoming partner at our company? 
    

276
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:23,034
Doing good work is basic by default.

277
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:25,264
Don't you know you need a plus alpha (extra)?

278
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:28,764
All the major hits, timely hits, and clinchers (wins) hinge on that.

279
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,514
Hey, Yoon Sung Min.

280
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:33,284
I told you to stop watching baseball.

281
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:38,684
You must be right.

282
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:44,264
That b*stard who would do anything to be a partner at Taeil Accounting.

283
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:46,954
Seeing that punk is here, too...

284
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:49,934
Hello, Director Shim! 
    

285
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:55,474
Hey! You need to greet them!

286
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,914
You make me feel bad for not having a Vice President dad.

287
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,674
I'm going.

288
00:23:04,914 --> 00:23:07,414
They said they picked the new hires through a blind test,

289
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:10,254
but you can barely tell.

290
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:14,344
Didn't you hear? One of the new hires this time has only a high school diploma.

291
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:17,204
- A high school graduate? 
 - Isn't it daebak?

292
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:20,574
They usually hire only ones from an elite university.

293
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:23,544
It must have been obvious at the interview that he's only a high school grad.

294
00:23:23,544 --> 00:23:24,734
-  One moment...  
 - How did he pass?

295
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:27,534
- Joo Soo! 
  - The training will begin in a short while. 

296
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:28,914
All right.

297
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:32,264
Man, high school graduate.

298
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:38,104
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

299
00:23:39,254 --> 00:23:42,044
Did you know there's a high school graduate this time?

300
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,484
Excuse me?

301
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:49,224
- Yes. 
 - What? I'm the only one who didn't know!

302
00:23:49,224 --> 00:23:52,814
But do you think a high school graduate could actually cope here?

303
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:56,734
From working, organizing teams, and doing fieldwork with clients,

304
00:23:56,734 --> 00:24:00,314
from 1-10, everything is taught by our sunbaes.

305
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:05,594
Didn't your university sunbae tell you about that high school graduate, too?

306
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,434
No.

307
00:24:07,434 --> 00:24:10,114
Then from your college sunbae?

308
00:24:10,114 --> 00:24:12,864
I didn't go to college.

309
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:17,684
I took the General Educational Development so I don't have a high school sunbae.

310
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:24,964
You're the high school graduate accountant.

311
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:27,504
Why didn't you say so?

312
00:24:27,504 --> 00:24:32,434
I now introduce Vice President Han Je Gyun of Taeil Accounting.

313
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:38,414
   

314
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:52,164
You and the Vice President really don't look alike, Seung Joo.

315
00:24:52,164 --> 00:24:55,214
It can't be easy for a father and son to look so different.

316
00:24:55,214 --> 00:24:58,234
You are now part of Taeil Accounting,

317
00:24:58,234 --> 00:25:01,944
the best and strongest in the nation.

318
00:25:01,944 --> 00:25:04,624
I warmly welcome you all.

319
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:12,274
This year, in order to emphasize our ethics in accounting

320
00:25:12,274 --> 00:25:14,524
and to show our best in social duty,

321
00:25:14,524 --> 00:25:20,044
we hired you through a blind (unbiased) test to enable change. 
    

322
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:23,704
While such change may seem uncomfortable for some at first,

323
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:29,104
we need to pay attention to the synergy that kind of change may bring.

324
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:32,734
To create opportunities through such change for Taeil's future, 
    

325
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:36,434
all of you are in the center of it all... 
    

326
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:37,694
Does this even make sense?

327
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:39,264
- Why? 
 - Look!

328
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:41,334
 Is that even possible? 

329
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:46,334
 To produce the best results for the corporations in Korea... 

330
00:25:48,684 --> 00:25:50,614
Excuse me.

331
00:25:51,354 --> 00:25:53,924
 We ask for your full attention. 

332
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:03,434
They're discussing the new hire that's a high school graduate.

333
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:07,154
An ugly duckling rescued from Nakdong River somehow made it here.

334
00:26:07,154 --> 00:26:09,274
What will we do with him?

335
00:26:09,274 --> 00:26:13,204
Taeil Accounting with the highest reputation in the industry

336
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:18,014
became the target of domestic news at times.

337
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:20,874
This also is a novelty that comes with the reputation of Taeil.

338
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:25,074
I hope you'll enjoy it as an honor.

339
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,134
What's wrong?

340
00:26:58,814 --> 00:27:00,614
Hey, we'll be late. Let's go.

341
00:27:00,614 --> 00:27:03,034
Isn't he a new hire, too?

342
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:05,504
But he doesn't have any files!

343
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,524
All right, for the Zebra project this time are...

344
00:27:13,524 --> 00:27:15,404
- Mr. Kim Yong Min. 
 - Yes.

345
00:27:15,404 --> 00:27:17,294
- Mr. Yoo Kang Jae. 
 - Yes.

346
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:19,244
And...

347
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,294
- Jo Chan! 
 - Yes.

348
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:24,694
- Mr. Lee Gyun. 
 - Yes.

349
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:28,744
You four, meet me in the conference room at 2 p.m.

350
00:27:28,744 --> 00:27:31,044
I'll form the Lion project team.

351
00:27:31,044 --> 00:27:33,254
- Mr. Ok Sun Ha. 
 - Yes.

352
00:27:33,254 --> 00:27:35,384
- Ms. Lee Min Jung. 
 - Yes.

353
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:37,274
And...

354
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:43,684
Ms. Jung Si Young.

355
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:49,304
I'm currently assigned to many projects starting with the Wolf project.

356
00:27:49,304 --> 00:27:50,464
That's good then.

357
00:27:50,464 --> 00:27:52,974
Since you already have many, one more won't make a difference.

358
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:55,014
Oh, gosh!

359
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:57,334
Excuse me, Manager Yang.

360
00:27:57,334 --> 00:27:59,464
I don't have any assignments.

361
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:01,884
- So what? 
 - Excuse me?

362
00:28:01,884 --> 00:28:06,774
What's that got to do with me? That's what I'm asking.

363
00:28:08,024 --> 00:28:12,024
Since she has many cases, maybe I could...

364
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,790
Do you need help?

365
00:28:14,374 --> 00:28:17,364
Oh, no. I can do it.

366
00:28:24,024 --> 00:28:26,624
Do you think all accountants are the same?

367
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:34,084
He wants to work so badly.

368
00:28:34,084 --> 00:28:38,074
Then take him when you're the one in charge.

369
00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:40,954
How can you say such a harsh thing?

370
00:28:40,954 --> 00:28:43,884
Then why are you acting so harshly toward me?

371
00:28:43,884 --> 00:28:45,754
That hurt.

372
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:50,744
   

373
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:57,604
Someone must have authorized hiring him.

374
00:29:01,104 --> 00:29:03,314
   

375
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:11,694
V.P. Han! This is Goo Joon Tak from People's Entertainment.

376
00:29:11,694 --> 00:29:14,184
I prepared everything as you instructed me.

377
00:29:14,184 --> 00:29:16,254
But I don't feel good about this...

378
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,894
We'll be okay, right?

379
00:29:18,894 --> 00:29:20,674
Oh, yes.

380
00:29:22,124 --> 00:29:24,344
I'll hang up now.

381
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:31,724
How is it going with the audit for People's Entertainment?

382
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:33,364
How have you been, CEO Goo?

383
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:37,384
Aigoo, Mr. Kang! Please take good care of us this year too.

384
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:39,784
- Then shall we get going? 
 - Sure.

385
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,544
 Senior Manager Kang Hyun from the audit department 

386
00:29:42,544 --> 00:29:46,074
 in charge of People's Ent. for the last two years is currently out on the field. 

387
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:51,634
If it's been two years, he must be close to the people at that company.

388
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:53,144
Yes, probably.

389
00:29:53,144 --> 00:29:57,204
Although we thoroughly instructed People's Ent. to prepare for the audit,

390
00:29:57,204 --> 00:30:02,064
it wouldn't be unusual for them to get either an unqualified (clean) opinion or a disclaimer (no) opinion.

391
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:07,564
Whether to ignore it or make an issue out of it, depends on the accountant in charge.

392
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:09,734
So what do you think?

393
00:30:09,734 --> 00:30:14,404
Although you have a higher position now, that guy Kang Hyun was your mentor

394
00:30:14,404 --> 00:30:17,084
when you were a new hire.

395
00:30:18,054 --> 00:30:20,664
Wouldn't you know the best?

396
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:32,314
   

397
00:31:01,524 --> 00:31:04,524
I'm still at the first stage.

398
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:12,604
No one is here.

399
00:31:13,954 --> 00:31:17,004
I'm here! Someone is right here!

400
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,914
I'm Jang Ho Woo, a new recruit.

401
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:28,664
I currently don't have any task so I can take on any project right away, and

402
00:31:28,664 --> 00:31:31,924
I'm confident I can successfully complete any order you give me.

403
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:33,824
What did you say?

404
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:38,814
Aren't you selecting new members for a project? 
    

405
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,444
No, I'm not.

406
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:44,244
Then...

407
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:47,794
I'm Jin Yeon Ah, the senior associate in charge of training new accountants.

408
00:31:47,794 --> 00:31:52,354
I just came to inform you of training in the auditorium in a while.

409
00:31:52,354 --> 00:31:55,674
Oh, I-I just have a question.

410
00:31:56,534 --> 00:31:58,434
What?

411
00:31:58,434 --> 00:32:01,374
Lion, Wolf, Zebra...

412
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:04,744
Why are all the projects named after animals?

413
00:32:04,744 --> 00:32:07,754
Is it because we're not supposed to say the real names?

414
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:12,984
It will become a problem if the market finds out what's going on in a particular company,

415
00:32:12,984 --> 00:32:14,854
especially if that company is listed (public shares).

416
00:32:14,854 --> 00:32:17,524
- Oh, their stocks... 
 - There would be a disaster.

417
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:20,154
So even accountants who work at the same accounting firm

418
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:23,464
should not know what a different team is doing, nor should they ask.

419
00:32:23,464 --> 00:32:27,474
Stock trading using insider information is illegal.

420
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:31,174
Thank you. I was so curious about it.

421
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:33,524
If I have a question, can I ask you again?

422
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:34,934
Pardon?

423
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:37,944
You just said you're in charge of the new accountants.

424
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:41,284
Well, that is true...

425
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:43,214
Thank you.

426
00:32:51,754 --> 00:32:54,094
I feel like I just screwed up.

427
00:32:58,504 --> 00:33:00,904
First, here's the Tax Department.

428
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:02,704
In addition to corporate and personal income taxes,

429
00:33:02,704 --> 00:33:05,884
it also manages transfer tax, inheritance tax, and property tax.

430
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:09,664
It handles all tax-related issues for corporations and owners.

431
00:33:09,664 --> 00:33:12,654
The second department in our accounting firm is the Auditing Department,

432
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:17,894
to handle auditing work and accounting transparency for the corporations.

433
00:33:18,834 --> 00:33:20,934
And finally, the Deals Department.

434
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:24,644
All other business-related work, aside from the taxes and auditing,

435
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:27,134
falls under the Deals Department.

436
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:30,274
For corporation-employee relations, Mergers and Acquisitions, sales of assets,

437
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,444
and providing financial advice for corporate investments,

438
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:36,854
it is where the things you've seen on the news actually take place.

439
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:38,434
 Watch carefully. 

440
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:46,904
 That b*stard is definitely here as well. 

441
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:50,414
However, since this requires high-level expertise and skills,

442
00:33:50,414 --> 00:33:55,084
the chances a new hire will join a major project in the Deals Department is next to none.

443
00:33:56,194 --> 00:33:58,324
All right, let's get moving.

444
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,464
S.M. (Senior Manager) Han Seung Jo?

445
00:34:38,194 --> 00:34:41,594
I wonder what it's like to have your father as V.P. of Taeil Accounting.

446
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:44,444
Probably a bed of flowers. He's good, and his family is also rich.

447
00:34:44,444 --> 00:34:46,784
Wouldn't it be like playing cards with both Jokers in your hand?

448
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:48,534
Is that why he's so stuck up?

449
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:51,554
Our V.P. would be a Joker.

450
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:54,274
I heard he was the one who pushed for the blind hiring process this year.

451
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:57,664
He also hired a barista with hearing loss for our workplace cafe.

452
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,204
Noblesse oblige (obligation) he's so cool.

453
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:02,824
I'd be smiling all the time if I had a father like that.

454
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:05,614
Would I just be smiling? I would always eat with him

455
00:35:05,614 --> 00:35:07,934
and go to the sauna with him.

456
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:09,344
Oh, thanks.

457
00:35:09,344 --> 00:35:12,244
Hey, it's good! You should have said something–

458
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:18,044
Hello.

459
00:35:30,204 --> 00:35:34,294
Though all disclosures posted by the accounting firm are important,

460
00:35:34,294 --> 00:35:38,344
the most important of all would be the auditing report.

461
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,594
Our auditing report has an impact not only on the corporation,

462
00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:43,774
but also on the shareholders.

463
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:48,294
So extra care must be taken for it.

464
00:35:55,734 --> 00:36:00,434
The profit-loss is good, but you have no capital...

465
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,474
You f***ing bastard!

466
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:09,924
Hey, stand up straight. Straighten up now!

467
00:36:09,924 --> 00:36:13,494
CEO Goo, you b*stard! How could you do your job like that?

468
00:36:13,494 --> 00:36:16,514
- Well, Dad, s-so the thing is... 
 - Bo Sung, that boy...

469
00:36:16,514 --> 00:36:20,204
Even if he tries to use his money however he wants as a major shareholder,

470
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:23,124
you should have held your ground and stopped him.

471
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:28,224
You b*stard. Did you even cover up Bo Sung's mistake in the ledger properly?

472
00:36:29,584 --> 00:36:31,794
Yes, I covered it properly as you had ordered me.

473
00:36:31,794 --> 00:36:35,374
If anything happens, you will be held responsible for it all!

474
00:36:35,374 --> 00:36:37,124
You got that?

475
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:50,644
Well, our...

476
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:57,274
Bo Sung probably did that with good intentions to do well.

477
00:36:57,274 --> 00:37:00,384
Yes, I transferred some funds into China,

478
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,534
and after releasing a news article about doing a duty-free shop, our stocks went up a lot, Dad.

479
00:37:03,534 --> 00:37:05,754
This rascal!

480
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,974
The place where you said you would run a duty-free shop...

481
00:37:07,974 --> 00:37:11,614
The local government used up all its funds and is going bankrupt!

482
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:14,834
You punk, if you want to put on a show, at least check the details!

483
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:17,314
Your lies lack effort.

484
00:37:17,314 --> 00:37:20,234
Dad, you're really amazing. You seem like an actual business chairman now!

485
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:22,874
You little brat...

486
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:26,184
We'll stand in a prosecution photo lineup for embezzlement and breach of trust,

487
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:28,574
yet you still can't come to your senses!

488
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:34,004
Aren't we here...

489
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:39,604
so that doesn't happen?

490
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:46,554
Usually, issues of embezzlement and breach of trust arise when shareholders lose money.

491
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:51,544
In other words, if you help the shareholders gain money, those issues will disappear.

492
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:54,244
What if Sangah Group acquires People's Entertainment?

493
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:57,774
Then the embezzlement and breach of trust issue would fall onto you,

494
00:37:57,774 --> 00:38:01,384
because Sangah would be acquiring a company that's at risk of delisting.

495
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:03,584
Then what do you want me to do?

496
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:05,584
Do I just let my son get arrested?

497
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:11,734
For now, focus on having People's Ent. get an unqualified (clean) opinion

498
00:38:12,644 --> 00:38:14,674
during this audit.

499
00:38:14,674 --> 00:38:19,314
After that, stabilize the financial structure of People's Ent. through recapitalization,

500
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:22,654
and you can acquire People's Entertainment then.

501
00:38:22,654 --> 00:38:24,734
If you take action in this order and timing,

502
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:28,344
both you and your son can walk away freely, Chairman.

503
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:32,874
But what if People's Ent. isn't able to get an unqualified opinion?

504
00:38:32,874 --> 00:38:35,164
Then all of this goes down the drain!

505
00:38:35,934 --> 00:38:41,834
That is something our accounting firm will take care of.

506
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:48,684
As expected, I knew our V.P. would be able to take care of it.

507
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:52,924
Three years ago, a sudden slush funds investigation came out of nowhere;

508
00:38:52,924 --> 00:38:56,274
you were amazing then as well.

509
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:07,054
It's as if they wanted to prove they're family.

510
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:10,544
Father and son are just the same.

511
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:12,544
Though it's a shame for Sangah Group,

512
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:14,934
it's a good thing for our accounting firm, isn't it?

513
00:39:14,934 --> 00:39:18,204
Thanks to that, the sales pitch was easy.

514
00:39:18,204 --> 00:39:22,674
That is true since we managed to get an M and A unexpectedly.

515
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:29,584
An impotent CEO...

516
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:32,964
Is the most potent client for an accounting firm.

517
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,590
   

518
00:40:10,704 --> 00:40:13,424
We must give them an unqualified opinion, no matter what.

519
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:16,804
It's not like they have a fatal flaw that requires a disclaimer of opinion.

520
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:19,334
If we give them a disclaimer of opinion and they get delisted,

521
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,594
the shareholders will get in a rage, file a suit, and hold protests.

522
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,734
The consequences will be severe.

523
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:27,934
The real consequences would come if they deserved a disclaimer of opinion,

524
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:30,434
but we just let it slide, hoping not to cause trouble,

525
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:32,754
but when things blow up, that's what you call consequences.

526
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:35,594
If we give them an unqualified opinion yet the company ends up closing, what will you do then?

527
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:38,674
Why go overboard for something that didn't even happen yet?

528
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:41,854
Also, who would want them to receive a disclaimer of opinion for their audit?

529
00:40:41,854 --> 00:40:43,894
People's Ent., its shareholders,

530
00:40:43,894 --> 00:40:46,994
banks and lenders to People's Ent. all don't want it.

531
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:49,164
For whom should we give them a disclaimer of opinion audit?

532
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:52,754
As CPA stands for "Certified Public Account," don't we work for the public's good?

533
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:57,734
If anything seems off, we must give them a disclaimer of opinion rather than an unqualified opinion!

534
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,494
 You can't help but become careful. 

535
00:41:01,494 --> 00:41:06,834
 An accounting firm's disclaimer of opinion audit leads directly to delisting. 

536
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:12,044
Simply put, it would not be an exaggeration to say the company's fate

537
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:16,094
and everyone in its interests is in the accounting firm's control.

538
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:17,624
   

539
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:20,324
 As of now, Haebit Construction is bankrupt. 

540
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:22,234
 Ahjussi... 

541
00:41:25,154 --> 00:41:27,764
 Ahjussi! 

542
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:40,864
We will end today's training here.

543
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,154
- Great work. 
 -  Thank you. 

544
00:41:57,484 --> 00:41:59,184
Though he'll consider it quite a bit,

545
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,714
it will be difficult for Mr. Kang Hyun to get a disclaimer of opinion.

546
00:42:02,714 --> 00:42:05,444
Disclaimer of opinion is a nice way to put it.

547
00:42:05,444 --> 00:42:08,504
It is akin to a death sentence, isn't it?

548
00:42:10,104 --> 00:42:14,574
Betraying CEO Goo, whom he's known for many years,

549
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,494
is not easy.

550
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:18,764
It won't be easy.

551
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:22,754
However, he must.

552
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:27,064
I'll take care of this without any mistakes.

553
00:42:32,194 --> 00:42:34,004
I'll call you later.

554
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:40,254
You're busy, right?

555
00:42:40,254 --> 00:42:42,774
Everyone is during auditing season.

556
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:50,474
"Sometimes, doing your best might not be for the best."

557
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:52,714
Do you remember when you said that?

558
00:42:53,454 --> 00:42:55,664
When I was a new hire,

559
00:42:55,664 --> 00:42:58,344
I just needed to choose a few to sample,

560
00:42:58,344 --> 00:43:01,184
but I insisted on doing a full investigation on my own,

561
00:43:01,184 --> 00:43:04,874
and we almost didn't get to submit our report on time due to it.

562
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,444
That was what you told me then.

563
00:43:08,094 --> 00:43:13,734
That person did his best, but the people around him didn't agree.

564
00:43:14,904 --> 00:43:17,794
I just suddenly thought about it today.

565
00:43:18,574 --> 00:43:22,184
There was an answer that everyone else had accepted.

566
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:27,634
Why was I so stubborn then and believed it as my conviction?

567
00:43:32,184 --> 00:43:37,974
Are you saying there's something I shouldn't try my best at?

568
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:43,554
It seems you have something to say to me while bringing up the past you're not particularly fond of.

569
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:51,134
I see you want to say that what everyone accepts is what's best for all,

570
00:43:51,134 --> 00:43:54,294
but who represents the "everyone" in this case,

571
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,644
and who represents the "all"?

572
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:42,744
 The documents that I mentioned aren't here. 

573
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:45,694
 I asked you for them several days ago. How could you not give them to me yet? 

574
00:44:45,694 --> 00:44:48,104
 I can't move forward because of this. 

575
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:50,224
Hurry and get them to me now.

576
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:54,444
Gosh, it's already been several days since I've asked for them.

577
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:56,714
Please get them to me right now.

578
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:01,524
- Senior Associate Park Jin Kyung. 
 - What is it?

579
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:04,564
Is there anything I can help you with?

580
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:06,544
It's all right. Just do your own work.

581
00:45:06,544 --> 00:45:08,264
My own work...

582
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:11,924
I don't have work to do so I'm requesting some work.

583
00:45:14,284 --> 00:45:16,544
There's no work that I am participating in.

584
00:45:16,544 --> 00:45:20,394
I thought it would be good to help you with what you're working on, Sunbaenim.

585
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:23,094
- Ms. Park. 
 - Pardon?

586
00:45:23,094 --> 00:45:28,944
Regardless of positions, the official terms used by the accountants here are Mr. and Ms.

587
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:31,234
Oh, yes, Ms. Park.

588
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:36,474
Mr. Jang Ho Woo? You said you have no work to do?

589
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:37,510
Yes.

590
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,404
Have you seen a result without reason?

591
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:43,474
Did you ever think why no department needs you, Mr. Jang Ho Woo?

592
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:47,144
What could be the reason for that? I thought about it, but I have no answer, Ms. Park.

593
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:49,144
You must be misunderstanding something.

594
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:53,594
I was saying we address each other like that; I wasn't trying to teach you something.

595
00:45:55,234 --> 00:45:57,174
Is it because I'm only a high school graduate?

596
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:59,484
It's true I've only graduated high school, but I passed the CPA exam,

597
00:45:59,484 --> 00:46:02,044
passed the proper procedures and got hired,

598
00:46:02,044 --> 00:46:04,564
then why is it a problem that I've only graduated high school?

599
00:46:04,564 --> 00:46:06,664
Do you think that's the reason?

600
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:10,074
If that's how you feel, then I guess that is the case.

601
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:14,634
Have you anything more to say?

602
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:17,564
I have nothing to say but a lot to do.

603
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,734
Give me a review as soon as you're done.

604
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:38,244
Yes.

605
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:19,654
What will I do looking like this anyway?

606
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:40,174
So no one told you that you can't come up here?

607
00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:05,064
Didn't you just run away from the office?

608
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:07,534
It appears you went to the bathroom.

609
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:15,334
Unfortunately,

610
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:19,754
your rage lacks any power.

611
00:48:22,374 --> 00:48:26,804
Do you really think they leave you out and won't work with you since you're a high school graduate?

612
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:30,614
They don't like how a high school graduate accountant came in and muddies the waters.

613
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:32,994
- Isn't that it? 
 - You're wrong.

614
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:38,154
If you're a high school or middle school graduate means nothing to these accountants here.

615
00:48:38,154 --> 00:48:42,774
It's not like they're paying your salary so what does it matter?

616
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:46,064
- Then why– 
 - They may not care for your education level,

617
00:48:46,064 --> 00:48:49,514
but if you enter their team and affect their own salaries...

618
00:48:49,514 --> 00:48:51,714
That's a different story.

619
00:48:52,484 --> 00:48:55,604
- It's because of money? 
 - I mean if you can prove

620
00:48:55,604 --> 00:49:00,414
that you are able to pull your own weight as a team member.

621
00:49:01,124 --> 00:49:03,014
Prove...

622
00:49:03,014 --> 00:49:05,174
Time report.

623
00:49:05,174 --> 00:49:08,004
You probably heard of it during the new staff orientation.

624
00:49:08,004 --> 00:49:11,274
It's a profit evaluation that records how many accountants worked on a project,

625
00:49:11,274 --> 00:49:15,354
how many hours they spent, and how much money they made.

626
00:49:17,244 --> 00:49:19,104
   

627
00:49:23,114 --> 00:49:24,924
How many staff were assigned?

628
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:26,654
Six.

629
00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:29,844
Six staff members should be enough.

630
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:32,564
But why do you look so stressed?

631
00:49:32,564 --> 00:49:36,604
There are six of us, but I feel we'll spend lots of time with little profit.

632
00:49:36,604 --> 00:49:39,414
It's better to go with five trustworthy guys.

633
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:41,914
Though that would strain our bodies more, my mind would be more at ease.

634
00:49:41,914 --> 00:49:47,454
I suppose. If even one member sucks, the whole team suffers.

635
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:51,704
In the past, a new staff screwed up big time;

636
00:49:51,704 --> 00:49:55,054
he dug a grave to bury his entire team.

637
00:49:55,054 --> 00:49:58,204
The size of the grave was like a royal tomb.

638
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,834
Not only can it negatively impact their salary, bonus, and promotion,

639
00:50:01,834 --> 00:50:05,604
if they're unlucky, they might end up stuck with a useless guy on their team for an entire year.

640
00:50:05,604 --> 00:50:08,334
So they can't help but be careful.

641
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:10,504
But what did you talk about? Education level?

642
00:50:10,504 --> 00:50:11,844
Do you think it's that easy?

643
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:14,574
If it were you, would it be so simple?

644
00:50:14,574 --> 00:50:18,804
Then why didn't they just tell me how things are?

645
00:50:18,804 --> 00:50:20,854
This isn't a school.

646
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:25,474
It's your duty to learn, but we have no duty to teach you.

647
00:50:25,474 --> 00:50:30,124
Even if we do teach you, it must be for our own good, not yours.

648
00:50:30,124 --> 00:50:33,844
And that's not including risk evaluation, value assessment, expected returns...

649
00:50:34,414 --> 00:50:37,874
If you are an accountant, shouldn't you know these terms?

650
00:50:37,874 --> 00:50:41,624
A clear risk of a high school graduate with an unknown skill level,

651
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:43,444
whom they've never worked with before,

652
00:50:43,444 --> 00:50:46,234
leads to unclear expected returns.

653
00:50:46,234 --> 00:50:50,374
If you tried thinking like an accountant, you could figure it out quickly.

654
00:50:50,374 --> 00:50:52,894
Can you not see it because you're impatient?

655
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:58,834
What were you so impatient for that you'd even skip college?

656
00:50:58,834 --> 00:51:01,804
What is it that you want to accomplish here?

657
00:51:05,014 --> 00:51:07,164
Forget it. I'm not curious.

658
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,414
I don't need to know.

659
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:15,294
If you won't smoke, go back down.

660
00:51:16,944 --> 00:51:19,834
Even if I were in charge of a team,

661
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:22,304
I would never pick you.

662
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:03,574
Yes, hello?

663
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:06,004
- All right, get ready. 
 - What's this?

664
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:09,874
It's Hee Sam's special kimchi stew!

665
00:52:09,874 --> 00:52:11,434
Shall we eat? 
    

666
00:52:11,434 --> 00:52:15,274
I bought meat just so I could make you guys kimchi stew.

667
00:52:17,704 --> 00:52:19,864
Okay, let's drink.

668
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:29,114
So? Not bad, right?

669
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:30,444
- It's salty. 
 - Give me a refund.

670
00:52:30,444 --> 00:52:32,334
- Is this salty? 
 - Yes, add some more water.

671
00:52:32,334 --> 00:52:36,164
- If this is too salty, then is this also salty? 
 - It's salty.

672
00:52:39,414 --> 00:52:41,274
The alcohol tastes sweet today...

673
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:43,604
though life is quite bitter.

674
00:52:43,604 --> 00:52:47,974
A police rookie and an intern accountant...

675
00:52:47,974 --> 00:52:50,704
Your words are not that nice.

676
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:54,614
The accounting firm is full of proud people.

677
00:52:54,614 --> 00:52:58,554
I'm just trying to find the mistakes that those people make.

678
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:01,754
That's my job every day.

679
00:53:01,754 --> 00:53:03,394
Why?

680
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:05,674
Because I'm a high school graduate.

681
00:53:05,674 --> 00:53:09,094
Tell me about it. I know the feeling.

682
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:14,164
No matter how much I consider, we should have sent Ho Woo off to college first, right?

683
00:53:14,164 --> 00:53:17,854
Still, it's better than how I had to deal with drunk guys for several months straight.

684
00:53:17,854 --> 00:53:20,744
Or me with too many loans and too few customers,

685
00:53:20,744 --> 00:53:23,654
to the point I need to find a part-time job.

686
00:53:23,654 --> 00:53:27,964
Not only that, you guys have a friend like me, no?

687
00:53:27,964 --> 00:53:29,934
Who are you?

688
00:53:29,934 --> 00:53:33,914
Hey, you tell me. When life feels like sh*t, and you're going through a hard time,

689
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:37,264
wh-whom do you think of?

690
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,804
About 119.

691
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,834
- Why 119? 
 - It's not you!

692
00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:48,774
The 119? Hey, hey, hey, come here.

693
00:53:50,274 --> 00:53:52,884
- Hey, good night. 
 - Same to you.

694
00:54:27,574 --> 00:54:30,284
Oh, did you get this certificate from the bank?

695
00:54:30,284 --> 00:54:31,834
- Here you go. 
 - You can't send it like this.

696
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:34,334
Request it again with the financial statement.

697
00:54:34,334 --> 00:54:36,454
Thank you.

698
00:54:48,324 --> 00:54:55,034
 I mean if you can prove that you are able to pull your own weight as a team member. 

699
00:54:55,034 --> 00:54:57,054
 Prove... 

700
00:55:09,344 --> 00:55:11,974
 It's not that I was trapped, 

701
00:55:13,774 --> 00:55:16,254
 but that I was doing nothing. 

702
00:55:48,224 --> 00:55:50,374
   

703
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,784
Ms.

704
00:56:08,784 --> 00:56:12,184
If it's all right with you, can I make the copies for you?

705
00:56:12,184 --> 00:56:13,904
It's quite a lot to copy.

706
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,704
That's all right.

707
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:19,964
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

708
00:56:24,434 --> 00:56:26,944
You're not done yet copying the files for the Iron Project, right?

709
00:56:26,944 --> 00:56:29,364
It's almost finished.

710
00:56:29,364 --> 00:56:31,164
Then please bring it to the meeting room.

711
00:56:31,164 --> 00:56:32,784
Yes.

712
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:57,214
By chance, besides making copies, could you also send business emails for me?

713
00:56:57,214 --> 00:56:59,844
Yes, I can.

714
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:13,004
After I receive a fax, I need to comment on it and send it to another team;

715
00:57:13,004 --> 00:57:15,054
could you receive the fax for me?

716
00:57:15,054 --> 00:57:16,544
Of course.

717
00:57:16,544 --> 00:57:19,524
But that's coming in from England so the time difference

718
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:22,114
will likely be late at night.

719
00:57:22,114 --> 00:57:24,234
Yes, okay.

720
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:26,374
Oh, is that really all right with you?

721
00:57:28,234 --> 00:57:31,404
When I receive the fax, what comment should I write on it?

722
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:33,574
Oh, I'll prepare that for you and send it to you.

723
00:57:33,574 --> 00:57:35,164
Sure.

724
00:57:47,504 --> 00:57:49,044
Is the meeting room set up?

725
00:57:49,044 --> 00:57:51,054
Jang Ho Goo (sucker in Korean) is doing it right now.

726
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:53,284
Then let our team borrow him later at 3 p.m.

727
00:57:53,284 --> 00:57:55,884
You must return Jang Ho Goo by 4 p.m., okay?

728
00:57:55,884 --> 00:57:58,264
He needs to send my documents.

729
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:01,954
Jang Ho Goo?

730
00:58:24,294 --> 00:58:27,964
Is this all you know to do besides getting angry?

731
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:31,084
Are you doing this knowing what the others are calling you?

732
00:58:32,484 --> 00:58:35,464
Ho Goo... Jang Ho Goo.

733
00:58:37,464 --> 00:58:39,804
I think that's what they call me.

734
00:58:39,804 --> 00:58:40,924
Can you laugh about it?

735
00:58:40,924 --> 00:58:45,054
At least I'm not invisible anymore.

736
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:48,914
Even if I'm a Ho Goo, at least I'm visible now.

737
00:58:52,204 --> 00:58:53,804
I've been looking everywhere for you!

738
00:58:53,804 --> 00:58:55,894
What are you doing over there?

739
00:58:56,864 --> 00:58:58,614
What do you think?

740
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:02,054
I'm sorry.

741
00:59:06,554 --> 00:59:10,244
Now I'm someone that people seek.

742
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:12,694
Compared to an invisible person,

743
00:59:12,694 --> 00:59:15,094
it's an incredible improvement.

744
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:18,544
Why are you resorting to this to try to stay here?

745
00:59:18,544 --> 00:59:20,394
It doesn't have to be here.

746
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:23,634
- If you go somewhere else– 
 - It has to be here.

747
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:25,624
So why is that?

748
00:59:25,624 --> 00:59:29,854
I want to become the center of Taeil Accounting.

749
00:59:29,854 --> 00:59:31,754
"Center"?

750
00:59:31,754 --> 00:59:34,814
Do you mean the top central talent of the company?

751
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:36,984
Oh, top central talent.

752
00:59:36,984 --> 00:59:39,604
I suppose that would come first.

753
00:59:39,604 --> 00:59:41,274
What are you talking about?

754
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:44,694
Then let me ask you something as well.

755
00:59:45,344 --> 00:59:47,294
Last time,

756
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:50,624
why were you like that to me?

757
00:59:53,034 --> 00:59:55,254
What do you mean by last time?

758
00:59:56,164 --> 00:59:58,284
On the rooftop.

759
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:03,554
Why did you tell me what I was doing wrong?

760
01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:07,734
You said that even if someone teaches me something,

761
01:00:07,734 --> 01:00:10,404
it's not for me but for the one who teaches me.

762
01:00:10,404 --> 01:00:13,534
What good did it do you, Accountant?

763
01:00:13,534 --> 01:00:17,424
What do you gain from teaching me, Accountant Han Seung Jo?

764
01:00:18,444 --> 01:00:20,524
Tell me what that is.

765
01:00:41,794 --> 01:00:45,264
You go to the rooftop whenever you get the chance.

766
01:00:45,264 --> 01:00:48,744
You've got an easy life working at the company.

767
01:00:48,744 --> 01:00:51,914
How could I, when I'm in the same building as you, Father?

768
01:00:52,754 --> 01:00:55,784
Do you think others accommodating you

769
01:00:56,364 --> 01:00:58,954
is all your doing?

770
01:00:58,954 --> 01:01:02,104
It's not accommodation but exclusion.

771
01:01:02,104 --> 01:01:05,624
And I know all of that is thanks to you, Father.

772
01:01:05,624 --> 01:01:08,304
Once you take over the Chairman's office as your wish,

773
01:01:08,304 --> 01:01:10,574
that will grow even more severe.

774
01:01:11,494 --> 01:01:13,074
So?

775
01:01:13,644 --> 01:01:15,794
Wasn't it since you were lonely working here

776
01:01:15,794 --> 01:01:19,304
that you hired a high-school graduate accountant?

777
01:01:19,904 --> 01:01:22,504
Where could you possibly have use for him?

778
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:26,634
How could a high-school graduate like him dare?

779
01:01:26,634 --> 01:01:32,474
One dared to submit his application, and one actually hired him.

780
01:01:32,474 --> 01:01:37,034
I will kick him out soon so keep that in mind.

781
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:43,654
If you do, your true face might be revealed, Father.

782
01:01:44,354 --> 01:01:49,994
People likely can't imagine what you could do to satisfy your own greed,

783
01:01:49,994 --> 01:01:52,024
but it's quite fascinating.

784
01:01:52,024 --> 01:01:55,854
They don't even know that you are so different inside and out,

785
01:01:55,854 --> 01:01:58,754
and yet, they call you a Joker.

786
01:02:05,164 --> 01:02:08,004
- Han Seung Jo– 
 - So I'm telling you to be careful.

787
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:11,464
It wasn't enough for you to use your son as a pawn,

788
01:02:11,464 --> 01:02:16,204
but you even gave up being human to raise your precious tower.

789
01:02:17,054 --> 01:02:19,904
I may just bring it all down.

790
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:32,254
So don't touch anyone else now.

791
01:02:57,064 --> 01:03:00,644
Jang Ho Woo. The question you asked me earlier...

792
01:03:00,644 --> 01:03:02,834
I'll answer you right now.

793
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:06,274
What do I gain?

794
01:03:06,274 --> 01:03:08,144
It's a wild card.

795
01:03:08,144 --> 01:03:12,084
a card that isn't anything, but can also become anything,

796
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:15,994
an unpredictable card that can overturn a game

797
01:03:15,994 --> 01:03:18,944
with a clear winner.

798
01:03:18,944 --> 01:03:22,044
You mean like a Joker in a trump card game?

799
01:03:22,044 --> 01:03:27,124
I guess you are a Joker since I can't tell what you're thinking, from your appearance.

800
01:03:27,124 --> 01:03:31,744
Then again, I suppose a trump card game has two Jokers.

801
01:03:35,004 --> 01:03:37,504
So with that said, Jang Ho Woo,

802
01:03:38,604 --> 01:03:40,804
you should join my team.

803
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:59,360


804
01:04:02,264 --> 01:04:08,744
♫  Left behind in this place all alone  ♫

805
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,844
♫  That was me  ♫

806
01:04:11,844 --> 01:04:14,684
♫  I couldn't see blinded by sadness  ♫

807
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,644
   

808
01:04:17,644 --> 01:04:20,534
 Without the confirmation letters, the audit and reports are completely useless! 

809
01:04:20,534 --> 01:04:22,104
 I'll do it. 

810
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:24,404
 Do you think Jang Ho Woo can get the confirmation letter? 

811
01:04:24,404 --> 01:04:27,784
 Even a grand master accountant couldn't bring it back. 

812
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:29,814
 Didn't you hear me say, "Take a number and wait"? 

813
01:04:29,814 --> 01:04:31,564
 How dare you try to cut in line! 

814
01:04:31,564 --> 01:04:34,694
 I'm not someone suspicious. I'm an accountant, an accountant! 

815
01:04:34,694 --> 01:04:39,064
 Let's plant someone as a spy. Think of it as installing a CCTV. 

816
01:04:39,064 --> 01:04:41,224
 Will you work under Shim Hyung Woo? 

817
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:43,334
 If you don't want to be harmed, get out of there instantly. 

818
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:45,824
 If that happens, 40 billion won't be a problem. 

819
01:04:45,824 --> 01:04:46,844
 The shares will skyrocket! 

820
01:04:46,844 --> 01:04:50,004
 - What happened? 
 - There weren't any major issues with the auditing team. 

821
01:04:50,004 --> 01:04:53,020
 So you cut me down without discerning between friend or foe? 

822
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:57,900
 I felt someone is a friend or foe depending on timing, not a person. 

823
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:03,600
♫  I will call out in the midst of it for all to see  ♫
