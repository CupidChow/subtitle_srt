1
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,590
   

2
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,640
I thought you weren't too fond of me due to what happened at the last stockholders' meeting.

3
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,030
That's right.

4
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,800
However...

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,630
it's as you can see.

6
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,500
Why did you ask for me?

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,350
Because I like competent people.

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,370
Want to hear an interesting story?

9
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:03,240
Of course, you'd want to stay at Taeil Accounting to get back at Han Je Gyun.

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,280
Because the dead CEO, Jang In Ho of Haebit Construction, was your father figure.

11
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,600
What about this then?

12
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,480
What if your birth parents were also killed by Han Je Gyun?

13
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,900
What kind of nonsense is that?

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,300
I told you before.

15
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,940
I like an interesting story.

16
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,050
Let me tell you how your birth parents died.

17
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,000
Cut your bullsh*t.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,120
How the heck do you know...

19
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,190
my parents, whom I don't even know?

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:58,050


21
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,450
   

22
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,960
But...

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,570
a perfectly fine building

24
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,400
wouldn't have collapsed for no reason.

25
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,230
   

26
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,260
   

27
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,570
A dual ledger...

28
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,430
The poor construction was covered up by hiding the embezzlement of construction funds.

29
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,460
Han Je Gyun's hand was involved in everything.

30
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,420
 I don't think this can even withstand a load of 300 kg (660 lb) per pyeong (36 sq. ft.) 

31
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,650
 I'm starting to see cracks here and there. 

32
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,620
 Hey! 

33
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,310
 Don't you hear me? 

34
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,430
 I was thinking for a moment. 

35
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,690
 What thoughts? 

36
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,300
 What are you thinking about this time? 

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,980
 If we're idle, this building will collapse! 

38
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,960
 I've told you several times that we must reinforce this building! 

39
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,600
 I know that Director Lee Chan Joo embezzled the construction funds. 

40
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,060
 And you made a dual ledger for him to cover it up! 

41
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,070
 Whether it's Lee Chan Joo, who ordered poor construction materials to embezzle the funds, 

42
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,450
 or you, who helped him do it, 

43
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,090
 are you toying with people's lives? 

44
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,450
 I will tell everyone at a press conference tomorrow. Keep that in mind. 

45
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,150
 Why isn't your dad coming out? 

46
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,820
 Ho Woo, just wait here for a bit. 

47
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,400
 Honey! 

48
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,460
 Honey? 

49
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,780
 Yes? 

50
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,390
 Where is Ho Woo? 

51
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,220
 Honey! What do we do! 

52
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,660
   

53
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,630
The bodies of your parents...

54
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,290
well...

55
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,150
I wonder which hill they're buried in.

56
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,700
That's not for me to know.

57
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,760
All right.

58
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,350
Go.

59
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,120
Go and bite him!

60
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,440
Hello.

61
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,340
You guys should ride the next one.

62
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,680
Do you have some business with me?

63
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,110
   

64
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,160
What is this?

65
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,430
The people you killed...

66
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,800
twenty years ago.

67
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,770
Doesn't it say here

68
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,000
that it was poor construction?

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,060
What?

70
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,840
Are you sure I killed these people?

71
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,380
Sangah's poor construction that you covered up

72
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,740
and the embezzled construction funds...

73
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,470
Aren't those the reasons it collapsed?

74
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,020
Are you sure it wasn't your father's fault for not maintaining the building's safety

75
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,680
despite getting paid sufficiently for it?

76
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,940
What kind of garbage is that?

77
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,150
Then...

78
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,390
how will you explain the dual ledgers?

79
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,410
Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

80
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,430
Aren't you an accountant, Mr. Jang Ho Woo?

81
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,640
From what you just said, have you personally gathered any objective evidence

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,750
apart from what you presumed based on what you heard elsewhere?

83
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,230
The audit gave an unqualified opinion that the building was constructed per floor plan and

84
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,150
that all expenses were properly paid with qualifying evidence.

85
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,690
Were you unable to check that?

86
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,850
For someone, who is supposedly an accountant, to act like this

87
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,490
with no plan or fear when he has no clear evidence...

88
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,810
Do you think identification and evaluation of significant distortion marks

89
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,050
are only needed for situations like this?

90
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,040
What are you showing me right now?

91
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,450
What the lowly nobodies

92
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,060
don't even do...

93
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,280
How daring of you, not knowing your place.

94
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,510
I'll assume you'll take responsibility

95
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,110
for this act of disrespect.

96
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,270
Get out.

97
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,520
Dad.

98
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,050
- We need to talk. 
 - Later.

99
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,210
I have a morning meeting.

100
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,040
Why did you buy the online lender?

101
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,480
I told you not to buy it. I said the deal seemed off.

102
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,720
To tell you the truth, Dad...

103
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,120
V.P. Han Je Gyun...

104
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,900
Yeon Ah.

105
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,350
 According to our analysis, 

106
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,290
 the online lending company's status 

107
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,830
 is very good. 

108
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,660
   

109
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,230
 As I told you last time, 

110
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,690
 Jisan Bank has concluded that we don't need it. 

111
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,870
 So you will enjoy things by yourself? 

112
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,500
 Speaking of which, 

113
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,760
 shall I give an order to Ms. Jin Yeon Ah to uncover 

114
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,510
 how her father maintained his position as Jisan Bank's president? 

115
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,760
 - V.P. Han Je Gyun. 
 - So... 

116
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,520
 So instead of making matters complicated, 

117
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,230
 I would like for you to cooperate with me. 

118
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,770
Jisan Bank won't collapse just because of something like that.

119
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,550
Don't worry.

120
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,030
Dad...

121
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,060
Ms. Jin Yeon Ah,

122
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,530
what happened?

123
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,670
Is it true that Jisan Bank took over an online lender?

124
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,860
Yes.

125
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,920
Didn't you tell the bank president that the company had problems?

126
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,430
I definitely did.

127
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,490
Why is Han Seung Jo not answering his calls at a time like this?

128
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,730
Aren't you coming to work?

129
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,850
Are you saying you'll resign or something?

130
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,470
I was going to quit sooner or later.

131
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,680
No way. Did you hand it in already?

132
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,010
 Sung Min, 

133
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,530
right now, it's better to make wise decisions

134
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,440
than to be emotional.

135
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,840
I'll return after doing some thinking.

136
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,480
Ms. Jin Yeon Ah is extremely distressed for Jisan Bank right now.

137
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,840
The bank won't collapse from taking over a single failing company.

138
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,030
Tell her not to worry so much.

139
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,140
Hey!

140
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,820
Seriously.

141
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,190
Hey.

142
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,920
Will you apologize?

143
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,320
- Come on, don't. 
 - Hey! I told you to apologize.

144
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,030
What's with this guy's eyes?

145
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,310
- Stop it. 
 - I told you to apologize!

146
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,930
- I told you to apologize, you b*stard! 
 - Gosh, I told you to stop.

147
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,380
Let me teach this b*stard a lesson today.

148
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,570
Hey, you're not going to apologize? Apologi─

149
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,030
Stop, stop, stop! Just go.

150
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,890
- Sorry, sorry. 
 - F***.

151
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,690
Stop it!

152
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,020
Stop it!

153
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,340
- Hey, stop, stop! 
 - I'm sorry!

154
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,050
Let go! Let go, you b*stard! You hit me!

155
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,920
Let go, you b*stard! Let go!

156
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,650
Aren't you going to talk?

157
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,630
You need to tell us why you're like this

158
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,360
so we'll know what to do, whether we

159
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,400
beat up you or someone else!

160
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,950
Hey, Jang Ho Woo! Will you really not tell us?

161
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,410
- Hey! 
 - Hey, hey, hey.

162
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,300
Let go!

163
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,510
Just let him be. You know how he is.

164
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,490
Do I leave him like that?

165
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,820
 What time is it right now? 

166
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,790
 Did you not sleep at all, by chance? 

167
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,180
About Jisan Bank...

168
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,770
Since this is V.P. Han Je Gyun's doing,

169
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,220
I think it's only right for me to take care of it.

170
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,850
Did anyone say anything about that?

171
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,410
 First, find out the purchased online lender's total amount of insolvency (unpaid debts). 

172
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,290
Calculate the expected loss at each period's expiration date.

173
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,500
All right.

174
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,030
Ask Ms. Jin Yeon Ah to check if Jisan Bank plans any seasoned equity offering (issue more shares).

175
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,660
Find out the shareholders' dividend payout date. Also...

176
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,780
I'll find if it's possible to get a subordinated bond (lower priority of repayment in case of liquidation).

177
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,620
There's nothing faster than that.

178
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,380
 Thanks, Hyung. 

179
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,240
What do you mean by "thanks"?

180
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,320
But how long will you be out?

181
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,990
I'll call you later.

182
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,230
Hello?

183
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,490
- Hello. 
 -  Welcome. 

184
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,610
 Please take a seat wherever you'd like. 

185
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,780
What should we eat?

186
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,480
I don't really have much appetite.

187
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,460
We don't have much time; let's just eat whatever.

188
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,810
I question the point of working like this without being able to eat on time.

189
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,910
When your head is filled with thoughts,

190
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,880
how about a refreshing pollack soup?

191
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,150
You can chew on pollack heads and your bosses.

192
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,320
I'll take you up on the pollack soup

193
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,690
and a soda that's like soju.

194
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,070
What could you fear after studying hard

195
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,400
and becoming an accountant?

196
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,250
Behind closed doors, you can badmouth even the king.

197
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,510
Accounting careers are as fragile as flies these days.

198
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,370
I wonder why I even studied so hard.

199
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,890
How is it that your company is so quiet

200
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,290
when one of its accountants died?

201
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,880
Goodness.

202
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,310
I remember you bragged so much about getting into Taeil.

203
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,420
- Taeil really is different. 
 - Who can stop Han Je Gyun?

204
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:03,550
Besides, there's a rumor that it wasn't an accident but arson.

205
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,950
It's also rumored as murder for hire.

206
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,930
If it's Han Je Gyun, it's possible.

207
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,260
If that happened at Taeil, doesn't that mean it can happen anywhere now?

208
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,740
Are you really going to be childish and not tell me?

209
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,180
Yes.

210
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,860
Unbelievable. Are you acting spoiled since you're ill?

211
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,480
You stubbornly insist on coming to work when you're not well!

212
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,770
Be quiet.

213
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,800
It's all for you.

214
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,230
So what is it?

215
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,060
What are you hiding for my sake

216
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,960
that you're acting like a dog that needs to go, first nervous, then blanking out?

217
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,520
You've been like this for the past few days—

218
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,410
You can keep your mouth shut, right?

219
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,530
Ho Woo?

220
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,650
 V.P. Han Je Gyun did that? 

221
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,100
Let's get ready, too.

222
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,810
Hye Won.

223
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,030
I have a plan.

224
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,120
Okay. I trust you,

225
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,870
whatever that may be.

226
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,100
Ms. Yeon Ah, do you want some coffee, too?

227
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,150
Oh, yes.

228
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:35,430
Well, by chance, have you two seen Mr. Ho Woo?

229
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,700
Not sure. I haven't seen him today.

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,020
 You'll be connected to voicemail. 

231
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,770
This grandma is waiting for you.

232
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,870
 What do I need to press after this again? 

233
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,990
I should do my part, too, since the director isn't here anymore.

234
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,990
I got a call from Seung Jo recently,

235
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,610
saying he needs something unbeatable by tabloids.

236
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,090
But wouldn't Jisan Bank prepare for that as well?

237
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,250
Since buying it made no sense from the start,

238
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,500
we don't know what V.P. Han Je Gyun might do next.

239
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,090
I'm currently investigating the other companies that V.P. Han Je Gyun manages separately.

240
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,290
What do you mean by "managing separately"?

241
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,320
I thought about it after experiencing something like that.

242
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,210
It's just too strange.

243
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,490
Even if V.P. Han Je Gyun is that powerful with many allies,

244
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,230
it makes no sense how he can gather such funds

245
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,420
and control these situations.

246
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,920
Well, it depends on how you see it.

247
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,370
There's surely something there.

248
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,270
Things are happening behind the scenes.

249
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,980
Well, I won't be able

250
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,740
to see the world one day, but I want the world

251
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,190
where my daughter and Shim Hyung Woo's son live to be a safe one.

252
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,160
You are quite the reliable father.

253
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,730
Cheers.

254
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,070
Thanks.

255
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,370
But... what brings you all the way here?

256
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,960
Well, I thought I might get some fresh air

257
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,000
and for other reasons too.

258
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,520
Yes, did you check the files I sent you?

259
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,750
Oh, I see.

260
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,960
Then please check your email again.

261
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,790
   

262
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,110
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

263
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,890
What happened to Jang Ho Woo?

264
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,840
   

265
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,330
   

266
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,430
   

267
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,440
Go inside first.

268
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,360
   

269
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,900
   

270
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,970
   

271
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,560
   

272
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,620
As you ordered, I'm releasing the articles about Jisan Bank

273
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,220
through all possible routes.

274
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:20,040
Give them a few more provocative things that would attract public attention

275
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,870
and also release them on TV economic programs.

276
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,880
I will discuss it with Taeil Scholarship Association members in the media and get it done right away.

277
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,150
The more anxious people get, the more they talk.

278
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,840
If they say it and hear it often,

279
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,210
then regardless of facts,

280
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,710
Jisan Bank would become untrustworthy.

281
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,820
When people can't trust a bank...

282
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,540
Mr. Woo Sang Hyun,

283
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,290
what do you think their first action will be?

284
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,440
This place hasn't changed.

285
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,940
How long do you plan to be like this?

286
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,880
This is the article to be released tomorrow.

287
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,350
   

288
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,700
V.P. Han Je Gyun's takes over Jisan Bank

289
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,530
on a different level than he takes over a company.

290
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,990
What happened with Haebit Construction might happen again.

291
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,560
Ji Soo.

292
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,720
I am... really sorry.

293
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,360
It was hard for you, right?

294
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,570
Living as that man's son... must have been tough.

295
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,510
Since we both have difficult lives,

296
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,160
don't say you're sorry anymore.

297
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,730
In the past,

298
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,620
do you remember how you said

299
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,050
you'd surpass your dad if I waited a little longer?

300
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,290
Yes.

301
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,510
I can't wait very long.

302
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,210
 Jisan Bank's state of assets triggered a warning light. Its loan delinquency rate and... 

303
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,540
Yes? Jisan Bank! 
    

304
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,450
Right, it went bankrupt!

305
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,940
 Jisan Bank, the topic of recent gossip as a moral hazard with insulting pay, 

306
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,520
 has declared an end to its new household mortgage loans. 

307
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,190
 The cautious experts criticize Jisan Bank's leadership 

308
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:39,980
 for passing on the responsibility of its management failures to its customers. 

309
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,120
   

310
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,890
Fortunately, even when we assume the worst,

311
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:52,680
the online lender's impact on Jisan Bank is still at a level it can handle.

312
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,710
Social media and internet cafes are a mess right now.

313
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,350
"My subscription savings are there. If it goes bankrupt while my money is there,"

314
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,620
"will I lose my savings?"

315
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,120
"My wedding and retirement funds are there. Will I lose that money?"

316
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,790
Since Jisan Bank is a commercial bank most used by common people,

317
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,860
it's natural to be sensitive and anxious due to such an article.

318
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,620
That's right. To most people,

319
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,230
their bank account and house represent their entire assets.

320
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,710
I get several calls a day from peers

321
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,120
saying they got a mortgage from Jisan Bank,

322
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,430
and they're worried what might happen with their houses along with the bank.

323
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,540
I get calls from stock investors

324
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,010
saying they heard from the tabloids and asking for insider info.

325
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,590
They won't even take responsibility so why make and spread rumors?

326
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,780
Does it please them to make a perfectly fine bank look bad?

327
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,760
Of course, it would please them...

328
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,690
since there'd be a lot to take for themselves.

329
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:51,290
But at least one guy came.

330
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,830
 Are you planning to quit work? 

331
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,630
Go to work all you want by yourself.

332
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,740
It suits you.

333
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,860
Do you have time to waste like this?

334
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,970
Didn't you become an accountant and advance for revenge?

335
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:32,500
However, like a child you can't even control your own emotions and brawl.

336
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,980
What do you think you gain by acting this way?

337
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,890
"Acting this way"?

338
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,100
My parents, whom I don't even remember, died due to him.

339
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,670
Unknowingly, I ran away to survive.

340
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,540
I finally learned what the nightmare is that I dream every night

341
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,400
and who is at fault,

342
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,840
yet that's how you see me?

343
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,280
You said yourself

344
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,210
that even if you can't change the world, you won't let the culprit live in peace.

345
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,030
But?

346
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,450
In your current dreadful state,

347
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,320
do you think that's possible?

348
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,140
Forget your emotions right now and face reality.

349
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,150
 Did you really cover up Bo Sung's mistake in the ledger? 

350
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,650
   

351
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:08,060
 Why did you switch out my report? 

352
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,210
   

353
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,910
 Who are you trying to kill? You can't take even one step from here! 

354
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,430
 "Forcing out the franchise"? 

355
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,220
   

356
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,630
 Whether it's Lee Chan Joo, who ordered poor construction materials to embezzle funds, 

357
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,260
 or you, who helped him do it, are you toying with people's lives? 

358
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,460
   

359
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,520
 Director Shim Hyung Woo! 

360
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,790
   

361
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,690
   

362
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,860
   

363
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,120
Why is it taking so long!

364
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,840
Give me my money!

365
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,900
What about the other branches?

366
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,700
Please let me in! I've been waiting here for hours!

367
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,170
Don't just tell me to wait.

368
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,940
Excuse me, Ma'am.

369
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,400
I don't know what you've heard, but there are no problems with Jisan Bank.

370
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,040
The stories spreading online are baseless rumors.

371
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,610
Please trust our Jisan Bank and...

372
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,420
This is my retirement fund.

373
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,670
Will you take responsibility if I trust your words and lose it all?

374
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,360
Let me withdraw my money quickly!

375
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,830
Goodness!

376
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,320
It's so frustrating!

377
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,250
 Come on! 

378
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,090
 Hurry up and give me my money! 

379
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,160
Even if civilian customers withdraw a lot of their money,

380
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,640
Jisan Bank will be okay, right?

381
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,440
The corporate customers are the danger.

382
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,960
With large amounts, suspension of payments essentially suspends the companies as well.

383
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,630
They'll also be sensitive to it.

384
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:12,010
Who knew so many people would believe rumors spreading online?

385
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,420
Since online rumors are published as articles and spread by word of mouth,

386
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,750
telling fact from rumor is confusing.

387
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,040
What do we need to do to calm people down?

388
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,180
   

389
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,130
   

390
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,220
 In tomorrow's morning news, there will be a gift for returning. 

391
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,590
Give me a second.

392
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,380
 According to a government agency source, 

393
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,070
 Jisan Bank is evaluated as safe and sound 

394
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,850
 by every indicator of a bank's health, 

395
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,730
 and their nonperforming loan ratio (percentage of loans not being repaid) 

396
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,080
 and their liquidity ratio (value of outstanding loans versus collateral assets) are stable. 

397
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,690
 The recent interest rate hikes and inflationary trends contributed as negative factors. 

398
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,150
Gift...

399
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,050
- It is a gift. 
  - And considering the profitability... 

400
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,820
I saw the news.

401
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,170
Congratulations on your ad billboard.

402
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,390
When I called them, they said an article was released suddenly.

403
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,780
So our tabloid work wasn't for nothing—

404
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,720
Who did this?

405
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,850
About that online lender that Jisan Bank bought...

406
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,640
Let me leave it with your company until things calm down a bit, Hyung.

407
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,430
No matter how much I ponder it, that's the only current solution.

408
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,560
Parking. 
    

409
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,880
We can use Parking. 
    

410
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,730
Parking a messy problem somewhere else temporarily

411
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,500
certainly gives them some time.

412
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,820
Pretending to lend this problem to another place may be the way to ease people's minds.

413
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,750
It might be difficult to secure bonds right away, but at least we can do something.

414
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,470
Wow... Han Seung Jo, you really racked your brain for this. 
    

415
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:22,930
Here's my bribe.

416
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,120
Not even close, my pride sells for much higher.

417
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,320
I got it.

418
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,780
   

419
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,420
Mr. Ho Woo?

420
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,080
   

421
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,110
Have you been well?

422
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,600
Are you okay now?

423
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,750
I am fine now.

424
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,140
What made you decide to return?

425
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,400
Everything that I want

426
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,940
is here in this company.

427
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,810
But why did you hug me?

428
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,030
I never said you could hug me.

429
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,730
I'm sorry.

430
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,820
You must have been quite busy taking over the chairman's position.

431
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,650
I am busy, but it's still quite interesting.

432
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,100
I heard something very interesting not long ago.

433
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,250
I'll tell you when it's the right time.

434
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,330
Since you must be busy as the new chairman now,

435
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,060
I was thinking of helping you

436
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,860
take care of the children's foundation.

437
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,750
What do you think?

438
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,250
As you already know, I have a child who only knows how to spend money, not make it.

439
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,790
What choice do I have?

440
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,860
I'll pass on the title of foundation director.

441
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,170
That's true.

442
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,760
Since it'll be recognized as a nonprofit,

443
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,150
you can use the foundation assets freely without worrying about taxes.

444
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,020
Children's foundation work will be helpful

445
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,280
to the group's image as well.

446
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Well, most chaebols (family-run business group) have at least one...

447
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,250
Except...

448
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,640
from time to time,

449
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,120
you should do some good deeds.

450
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,770
Do what you want to do.

451
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:02,970
I'll cover for you however I can.

452
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,140
While you prepare for your fight with Han Je Gyun,

453
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,730
I'll become your alibi.

454
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,950
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

455
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,750
 I'm sorry. 

456
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,050
   

457
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,390
I'm glad.

458
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,350
Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

459
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,560
What is the first thing you say after two weeks of absence without a leave?

460
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,650
The face of Taeil Accounting,

461
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,920
the president...

462
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,430
I realized that it was "Vice" President Han Je Gyun.

463
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,050
If it's the president who's above the vice president...

464
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,230
Mr. Jang Ho Woo,

465
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,560
I can see you're very confident and fearless,

466
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,650
but the president isn't just someone that new employees can meet at their convenience.

467
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,180
Then...

468
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,260
I guess I'll make the president want to come find me.

469
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,030
   

470
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,350
Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

471
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,060
The person who killed your friend seemed totally fine.

472
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,080
Did you already forgive him?

473
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:04,180
 What is it that you want from me? 

474
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,940
What's your reason for telling me what Han Je Gyun did to my parents?

475
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,960
You're getting angry at the wrong person.

476
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,760
Don't be angry at who told you,

477
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,610
but rather at the person who hid it after doing such a thing.

478
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,710
I believe you pushed Lee Chan Joo out of his position thanks to Han Je Gyun,

479
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,140
then took the chairman's position.

480
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,330
"Thanks to Han Je Gyun"?

481
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,790
You must be joking.

482
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,230
I took a long detour due to Han Je Gyun,

483
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,420
for something that would be done if not for Han Je Gyun.

484
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,540
I wasted my precious time.

485
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,820
Then why did you even receive Han Je Gyun's help?

486
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,410
"Help"?

487
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,070
I didn't need help to take Lee Chan Joo down.

488
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,520
With those grimy hands that forced me into a flour factory,

489
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,700
I wanted to see him use them to put me in the chairman's position.

490
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,340
But you know...

491
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,340
I still have some steam left to release.

492
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,240
You may leave now.

493
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,490
So it's the case that...

494
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:29,810
through Jang Ho Woo,

495
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,150
Lee Seung Joo seeks revenge on me.

496
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,950
That should be interesting.

497
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,190
   

498
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,960
Let's do it together.

499
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,080
What are you viewing?

500
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,050
Sangah? 
    

501
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,220
I noticed that affiliates donated 10-20 billion won ($8-16 million) to this foundation.

502
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,640
I guess they fear the punishment they'll face when they die.

503
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,660
Nuri Children's Foundation...

504
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,550
Children's Foundation...

505
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,050
Where did I see this?

506
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,550
   

507
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,620
   

508
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,260
   

509
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,650
Nuri Children's Foundation has 4.9% of Sangah Product stocks.

510
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,870
If it's 4.9%...

511
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,440
That's more than Lee Chan Joo's son, Lee Bo Sung, has.

512
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,420
There must be something in the Children's Foundation.

513
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,200
A hundred percent for sure.

514
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,120
Thanks to the rebuttal news Joyce posted,

515
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,900
public opinion has calmed down a bit.

516
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,030
I could have gone to the Children's Foundation alone.

517
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,690
It's just that... I was going this direction anyway.

518
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:59,390
What are you expecting to find in Lee Seong Joo's Children's Foundation?

519
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,220
Who knows?

520
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,130
Hello, I'm from Taeil Accounting.

521
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,890
I wonder if I could look through materials related to the foundation.

522
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,860
 Give me one second, please. 

523
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:29,190
Will you return to Hong Kong once you're done with work?

524
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,960
Probably so.

525
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,760
Should I transfer to the Hong Kong branch?

526
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,070
What?

527
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,730
Never mind.

528
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:50,850
♫  The time flows only for me  ♫

529
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:52,650
Here you go.

530
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:57,990
- What is it? 
 - It's nothing special.

531
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,800
♫  The words "I miss you"  ♫

532
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,820
♫  Float in the air  ♫

533
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,480
It's a bit big, isn't it?

534
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,280
I heard children these days grow up really fast

535
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,440
and can't wear small sizes for long

536
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,350
so I bought a bigger size.

537
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,610
You haven't changed one bit.

538
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,600
Why? Don't you like it?

539
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,550
I think it's nice.

540
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,810
Do you really not know?

541
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,950
Know what?

542
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,590
♫  By my side every day  ♫

543
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,720
He's a son.

544
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,180
♫  Perhaps you're comforting me  ♫

545
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,600
What?

546
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,600
♫  An unfamiliar child  ♫

547
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,350
"A son"?

548
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,900
♫  By chance, do you remember?  ♫

549
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,030
Hold on. I have a picture.

550
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,860
♫  I will recognize you  ♫

551
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:01,040
How can this be a boy?

552
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,670
Anyone would say it's a girl.

553
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:04,560
Where did you find this?

554
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,150
I asked Sung Min for it during the Ilseong Baby Formula case.

555
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,260
♫  I won't forget you; I won't cry  ♫

556
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,290
How on Earth is this a girl?

557
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,020
She's so pretty the way she resembles me.

558
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,750
How could you think it's a girl?

559
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,770
How could this be a girl?

560
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,490
I'm going crazy here.

561
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,960
   

562
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,070
   

563
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,860
   

564
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,650
There's a sponsor that's also on the donors list...

565
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,780
They must have lots of money left over every year.

566
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,170
There's an odd pattern in the donations.

567
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,300
The donations jump from a very small amount to a couple billion won.

568
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,260
Five companies donate up to 10 billion won.

569
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,320
The period and amount are always the same.

570
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,540
The owner of those five companies couldn't possibly be one person.

571
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,060
How could they all be the same?

572
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,390
It is one owner.

573
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:17,400
   

574
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,900
   

575
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,900
   

576
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,760
   

577
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,510
Is anyone there?

578
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,440
I wonder if no one is here or they went somewhere.

579
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,690
Since leaflets are a couple years old... 
    

580
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,000
It's an empty tin-can company without anyone or anything.

581
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,590
It's not just one or two. How could all five be...

582
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:43,030
   

583
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:46,400
   

584
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,520
   

585
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,670
   

586
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,640
   

587
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,540
   

588
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,090
   

589
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,770
   

590
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,850
 The companies that donate a lot to the children's foundation 

591
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,590
 are the same as those under Han Je Gyun's special management targets? 

592
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:25,320
Companies that only exist on paper made large donations to a children's foundation.

593
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,460
But you saw it yourself, Mr. Ho Woo.

594
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,150
Do you think it's possible such a small company could donate a couple billion won

595
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:33,410
to a children's foundation?

596
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:37,340
It's very strange, but it's also not illegal.

597
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,240
If you hadn't mentioned digging into the children's foundation case,

598
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,970
we would never have imagined that Han Je Gyun had a paper company like this.

599
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:47,730
Because it's perfect on paper unless you visit the companies in person,

600
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,770
since there are sales and they pay taxes without fail.

601
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:56,120
Of course, there are no flaws. It's the work of V.P. Han Je Gyun.

602
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,730
It's not just one or two.

603
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:03,250
If five paper companies are regularly donating such large amounts,

604
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,560
he must have a lot of money.

605
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,890
But don't you think it's odd?

606
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,960
- What is? 
 - The fact that Han Je Gyun would donate such large amounts

607
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,590
to the Children's Foundation.

608
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,070
 

609
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,040
   

610
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,790
   

611
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,110
   

612
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,830
   

613
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,190
Are you awake now?

614
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,060
Did you work all night?

615
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:59,770
Did you find anything?

616
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,760
Really?

617
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,080
So you're saying Han Je Gyun's paper companies

618
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,010
donate such large amounts to the Foundation for this?

619
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:24,490
It must cost a lot of money to build something like this.

620
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,570
Of course, it does. It takes tons of money to build any infrastructure.

621
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:29,160
Exactly.

622
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,050
Only if they would really build it.

623
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:37,720
Are you saying they're not actually building?

624
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:45,300
Because it's perfect on paper unless you go looking for it,

625
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,250
there wouldn't be any tax receipts since it's overseas.

626
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:51,260
In addition, foundations don't have to be audited.

627
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:55,620
And money withdrawn from the foundation in the name of overseas construction costs...

628
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,460
Money laundering!

629
00:49:58,550 --> 00:49:59,890
No wonder.

630
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,200
Because of slithering leeches like this, 99% of good people suffer instead.

631
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,310
With this tremendous amount of money Han Je Gyun launders,

632
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,790
what does he have in mind?

633
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:19,830
I must find out everything Han Je Gyun owns and how much.

634
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:22,600
It's HK Private Equity Fund's financial data.

635
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,400
Maybe an accountant could see something stand out.

636
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:32,440
 I think there's something fishy about HK Private Equity Fund's handling method. 

637
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:56,030
Hold on, Mr. CEO. You can't change your mind all of a sudden.

638
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,640
What do you mean we don't need to hassle financially powerful HK Private Equity Fund?

639
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,270
We might be in need of Jisan Bank's help in the future.

640
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,900
V.P. Han Je Gyun?

641
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,450
What's going on here?

642
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,730
There's no way this could be. 
    

643
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:29,350
What are you saying? Who is going bankrupt?

644
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:35,460
Stop talking nonsense and tell Father not to withdraw any money.

645
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:40,160
Everyone is going crazy due to Jisan Bank.

646
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,570
What is it? Is it something urgent?

647
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,270
About parking the shares...

648
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,850
The one you were going to park with our online lender...

649
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,590
I think V.P. Han Je Gyun took some action.

650
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,180
Are you saying we couldn't park it?

651
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,650
V.P. Han must know many people at the Financial Services Commission.

652
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,240
It must take no effort to convince a philanthropist CEO to do him a favor.

653
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,400
What do we do now?

654
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,160
   

655
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:20,720
   

656
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,090
Survivor?

657
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,400
Yes, hello.

658
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,100
The survivor from the Sangah Construction building collapse in 2003...

659
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,150
I have some questions to ask Mr. Yoo Moo Il.

660
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,090
Yes, that's correct.

661
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:43,080
   

662
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,820
Are you okay?

663
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,160
He's a victim of the same accident as my parents.

664
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,830
I knew there was a survivor,

665
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:00,390
but I didn't think I'd learn about him here.

666
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,100
I hope I can get in touch with him soon.

667
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,360
Don't worry.

668
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,870
Let's search together until we find him, if it takes one or ten attempts.

669
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,340
I confirmed that all funds from the listed companies have been transferred.

670
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,140
Taeil Scholarship Association...

671
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:37,570
Let's all gather and see everyone. It's been a while.

672
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:43,380
Also, about the Children's Foundation...

673
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:48,920
Go and come up with an interesting article about it.

674
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:51,380
Yes, Sir.

675
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,320
 Today, the prosecution and National Tax Service conducted a search and seizure at Nuri Children's Foundation 

676
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,060
 where Sangah Group's Chairman, Lee Seong Joo, is the director. 

677
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:04,210
 All attention is focused on the unprecedented search and seizure of a children's foundation. 

678
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,520
 Reporter Goo Chae Lin is reporting. 
   

679
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,960
 Nuri Children's Foundation was established with Sangah's support and donations from general donors. 

680
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,920
 According to an anonymous source close to the organization, 

681
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,950
 in addition to illegal use and embezzlement of donations, 

682
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,360
 even in board of director selections and executive hiring, 

683
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,530
 Chairman Lee Seong Joo has been deeply involved. 

684
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:25,310
 If such allegations of misconduct are found to be true, 

685
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:29,510
 it will be difficult for Chairman Lee Seong Joo to avoid legal and moral responsibility. 

686
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,020
 V.P. Han. 

687
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:34,930
Okay.

688
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,960
Vice President Han Je Gyun.

689
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,190
Please make yourself at home and speak. 
    

690
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,730
Because I think this will be

691
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:59,560
the last conversation between us two.

692
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:09,060
What do you think you're doing?

693
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,070
Will I be the only one brought down if the Children's Foundation is exposed?

694
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,240
Pretending to make donations from paper companies all this time

695
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,410
and laundering all that money...

696
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,090
It was all you.

697
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:23,130
Was it Prosecutor Baek who was in charge of that case?

698
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,930
Prosecutor Baek is a bright talent of the Taeil Scholarship Association.

699
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,590
He is a very hard-working fellow,

700
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,710
and I remember him very well.

701
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,520
I see.

702
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,880
Are you saying they're members of the Taeil Scholarship Association?

703
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,620
Do you think...

704
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,380
I will just watch this happen?

705
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,210
Not too long ago...

706
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:58,360
an accountant from Taeil died in a warehouse fire.

707
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,990
Everyone believes that it was an unfortunate accident.

708
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,880
But you find that it was not an accident, but rather an incident...

709
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,880
to create slush funds.

710
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,620
What the heck are you rambling about? That's because you—

711
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:22,360
The borrowed name of that warehouse's owner is...

712
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,710
Lee Seung Joo.

713
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:35,300
Are you crazy?

714
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:40,540
No, you should be asking yourself that question.

715
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,830
When you tried to deal with me by using Jang Ho Woo,

716
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,150
you should have asked that to your mirror.

717
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,410
I was the one who threw you into the flour factory,

718
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,930
and the one who gave you the chairman's position.

719
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,960
So only I can take you down.

720
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:15,110
Don't touch me.

721
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:17,070
How dare you...

722
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,360
No matter...

723
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,770
when it's my time to go,

724
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:31,050
I'll be sure to impede in your life.

725
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,210
Look forward to it.

726
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:54,320
   

727
00:57:58,380 --> 00:57:59,610
   

728
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,330
   

729
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,030
   

730
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:08,240
   

731
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,200
   

732
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,270
   

733
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:16,290
   

734
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,680
   

735
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,340
   

736
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,130
   

737
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:27,570
 I am Reporter Lee So Eun from YTN. Please contact me. 

738
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,380
I think you were looking for me,

739
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,450
that you posted such a claim on the company's website.

740
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,180
Mr. President.

741
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,780
Yes.

742
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:04,800
I see.

743
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,320
Yes, for now.

744
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,370
The paper companies' assets that were with Jisan Bank...

745
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:16,310
I took them all out for now.

746
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,800
Don't leave a single won.

747
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,140
   

748
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,810
   

749
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,100
Mr. President.

750
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:04,360
How long will you make us wait?

751
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,770
You're going to keep me here all day!

752
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,860
Give me my money!

753
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,330
You have to give me the money!

754
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:16,840
 What did you say? 

755
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,590
Are you saying they failed to maintain the BIS ratio?

756
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:22,190
Then what's going to happen to Jisan Bank?

757
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,700
Because corporations are withdrawing their funds and moving to other banks,

758
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,910
other corporate clients

759
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:33,260
and individuals insist on leaving.

760
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,880
Ms. Yeon Ah...

761
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,160
How much could the BIS ratio have dropped?

762
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:44,830
Hold on a second.

763
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:57,020
   

764
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,130
It dropped this much all at once?

765
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:05,640
The BIS ratio needs to be over 8% in order to protect the bank!

766
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,790
Now they're up for sale.

767
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,720
Anyone can purchase them.

768
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,090
Does that mean...

769
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:16,730
the bank can actually go down?

770
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,880
That can't be, right?

771
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,950
It all started from fake news and rumors.

772
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:23,990
So let's pick up the pieces from there─

773
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,040
   

774
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,550
   

775
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:09,020
The online lender was only bait to incite people.

776
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:13,570
It was the most efficient method to drop the BIS ratio.

777
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,090
They've made a bank run (customers withdraw funds at the same time).

778
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,510
   

779
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,290
   

780
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,860
 Is anyone home? 

781
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,820
Hello!

782
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:09,210
Are you here, Mr. Yoon Moo Il?

783
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,720
Who is it?

784
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:35,180


785
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:47,150
♫  Skipping stones into the night  ♫

786
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,860
♫  A night to see my eyes  ♫

787
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:54,530
♫  But moments pass; I don't know why  ♫

788
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,300
♫  Why did I leave without saying a word?  ♫

789
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,540
   

790
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,600
 Han Je Gyun wants Jisan Bank. 

791
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,020
 Do you think my dad didn't know? 

792
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:07,520
 He's worked with V.P. Han Je Gyun for so long. 

793
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,070
 Let's figure out what we can do from our end. 

794
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,970
 Are you going to be okay, Accountant Han? He's still your father. 

795
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,730
 Accountants Han Seung Joo and Jang Ho Woo 

796
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,940
 seem to be behaving out of the ordinary. 

797
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,250
 If you act like this, it will be hard for us both. 

798
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,810
 He's more or less firing me, right? 

799
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:24,270
 This is just too unfair. 

800
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:29,120
 No matter how you try to interfere, Jisan Bank will be in my hands after all. 

801
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:33,530
 As a Taeil accountant, I must stop that. 

802
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:37,400
♫  I still hope you come back  ♫
