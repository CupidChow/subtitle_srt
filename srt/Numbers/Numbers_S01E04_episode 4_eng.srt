1
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,170
   

2
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:42,990


3
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,780
Why did you do that?

4
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,820
Do what?

5
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,090
Haebit Construction.

6
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,260
What made you come to the decision to liquidate?

7
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,860
People's lives are not a joke

8
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,070
so how could you?

9
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,310
Why are you asking me about that?

10
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,700
Because the person I want to ask has died.

11
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,890
Don't lie and say it was a decision based on their financial statements.

12
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,720
- I know it wasn't. 
 - What?

13
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,970
If it really was due to a dire financial situation, as announced publicly,

14
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:49,090
 relevant reports should be stored in the Document Storage Room like other projects, 
   

15
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,750
 without worry if anyone would look 
   

16
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,980
 or find out. 

17
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,850
 But they were nowhere to be found, 

18
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,850
as if they were never there to begin with.

19
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,670
I've checked every day since joining Taeil,

20
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,510
without missing a single day,

21
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,980
since this was the reason I joined Taeil and no other firms.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,270
I wanted to see with my own two eyes

23
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,400
the report on why Haebit Construction was shut down.

24
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,130
If you were to see it,

25
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,670
what difference would it make now that it's done?

26
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,520
The future...

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,880
The future of those who ended Haebit Construction.

28
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,050
I won't let them live in peace

29
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,790
as if nothing bad had happened.

30
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,850
Do you think that's possible?

31
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,640
Nothing is impossible.

32
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,100
When you first saw me at the Haebit Construction site,

33
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:07,070
did you ever imagine we'd be having this conversation?

34
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,280
Now, tell me.

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,390
The fabricated Haebit Construction liquidation report that you put together...

36
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,000
Where is it now?

37
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,810
The bid for it was higher than expected,

38
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,780
but you kept the ledger out of Chairman Lee Seong Joo's hands.

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,890
Please take consolation in that.

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,460
Director Shim Hyung Woo,

41
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,250
- what were you doing earlier, not stopping me? 
 - Pardon?

42
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,350
Aren't you the so-called "expert"?

43
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,190
But you decided to just sit there and watch me write that ridiculous amount?

44
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,950
That was only because you were so adamant─

45
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,290
You should be worth your high price!

46
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,790
Can you still call yourself an accountant?

47
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,730
Isn't this dereliction and negligence of duty?

48
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,720
You think this is funny?

49
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,920
You must be laughing at how pathetic I look

50
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,140
as a chairman scared of his younger brother!

51
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,090
How could I possibly be?

52
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,060
Please take this glass and put yourself at ease.

53
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,470
You b*stard!

54
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,270
You think you can walk all over me just because I hang out with you?

55
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm Chairman Lee Chan Joo!

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,170
I was born the chairman of Sangah Group!

57
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:48,540
You punk. You think you're all that just because you're smart?

58
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,440
In that smart brain of yours,

59
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,770
should I open it up to see what crap is in there?

60
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,300
Acting as if you're some big deal paying a dog for its worth?

61
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,490
You think Taeil is the only accounting firm in Korea?

62
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,690
There's a whole truck of people who would come running at Sangah's name

63
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,970
even while peeing with their pants down!

64
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,730
It's easy to crush little b*stards like you.

65
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,720
Hey, I'll say I won't work with Taeil if you're there.

66
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,290
What choice will Taeil have but to fire you?

67
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,790
Wow, "Partner," as if.

68
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,860
Your life is ruined, Man!

69
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,020
Please save me, Chairman.

70
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,090
If you look the other way this one time, I swear not to disappoint you ever again.

71
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,480
For failing in my duties as an accountant today,

72
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,620
I sincerely... apologize, Sir.

73
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,940
Director Shim Hyung Woo...

74
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,920
Get it right, okay?

75
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,180
B*stard.

76
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,920
Jeez...

77
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,630
 Because the person I want to ask has died. 

78
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,500
 J-Ji Soo, no... 

79
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,090
 Don't do this. 

80
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,520
 Dad! 

81
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,690
Are you up?

82
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,690
Yes.

83
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,260
- Are you okay? 
 - What's up?

84
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,180
That's my question.

85
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,140
I came because you wouldn't answer the phone.

86
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,260
You were fine for a while.

87
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,980
Did something happen?

88
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,960
I just need to rest a bit.

89
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm worried you'll go back to the way you were.

90
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,800
I assume you haven't been drinking while taking anxiety medication.

91
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,880
Weren't you able to sleep?

92
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,640
Because you were preparing to sell off bad debts?

93
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,850
Yes.

94
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,680
Really?

95
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,010
You're acting too out of character after hiring Jang Ho Woo.

96
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,390
I have to act out of character to change my life.

97
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,040
I think you're seriously ill.

98
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,370
I should go now that I've seen you're alive.

99
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,380
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

100
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,790
Don't go out, not now or for work tomorrow.

101
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,410
 Now, tell me. 

102
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,470
 The fabricated Haebit Construction liquidation report that you put together... 

103
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,020
 Where is it now? 

104
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,220
 As a creditor, an accounting firm will either decide to keep an indebted enterprise alive 

105
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,220
 or close the company's doors. 

106
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,740
 Simply put, keep the goose alive 

107
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,970
 and see if its hatched eggs are more profitable, 

108
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,480
 or kill the goose and sell its feathers and meat instead. 

109
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,630
 They'll compare the two. 

110
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:24,480
 For argument's sake, the option of keeping the goose alive and keeping its eggs is called "going concern value." 

111
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,200
 We call the option of killing the goose and selling its feathers and meat the "liquidating value." 

112
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,430
 If the liquidating value is greater after comparing the two, 

113
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,580
 the goose dies, and the enterprise closes. 

114
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,720
 In contrast, if the going concern value is greater, then the goose and enterprise both live. 

115
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,510
 Long story short, an enterprise's life or death is in the accounting firm's hands. 

116
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,080
 It would have been more profitable to keep Haebit Construction alive. 

117
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,990
 Despite that, why did Taeil Accounting decide to slice the goose's stomach open? 

118
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,710
 Why did Han Seung Jo write such a report? 

119
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,240
You went through a lot yesterday.

120
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,570
I didn't do much.

121
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,240
It's all thanks to Mr. Han Seung Jo.

122
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,950
You must have heard rumors among the employees.

123
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,330
Just let it go in one ear and out the other (ignore it).

124
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,630
I guess I shouldn't have said that.

125
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,880
I hear they're whispering that you're becoming a partner

126
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,470
by taking credit for someone else's work.

127
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,640
I reprimanded them sternly; don't worry about a thing.

128
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,140
Sit down.

129
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,980
For the sake of your father,

130
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,440
I should make you a partner.

131
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,040
Isn't that right?

132
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,280
Thank you for your words, but

133
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:29,990
I believe Mr. Han Seung Jo should get the credit for these bad loan sales.

134
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,470
I'll make sure it's reflected in his performance record with HR (Human Resources).

135
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,750
   

136
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,410
 Woo Sang Hyun speaking. 

137
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,390
M and A, firm accounts, real estate sales...

138
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,180
Bring in all projects that will be profitable!

139
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,790
What do you mean "why"?

140
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,990
Should I be a director all my life?

141
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,760
I should become a partner so you can climb up the ladder, too!

142
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,210
What the heck? Weren't you off today?

143
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,040
I went to Jisan Bank for a Compliance Inspection.

144
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,730
"Compliance Inspection"? Were you handling the Workout?

145
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,550
- Soma Tech. 
 - Oh, I see.

146
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,180
Right, Jisan Bank is their creditor.

147
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,990
Wait a minute. If it's Soma Tech, Director Shim is in charge.

148
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,080
 Then what are your conditions for this, Accountant? 

149
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,170
 Only work with me from now on. 

150
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,980
 I will essentially become Taeil Accounting to Jisan Bank. 

151
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,560
I'm in charge now.

152
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,940
 What difference would it make now that it's done? 

153
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,290
 The future... 

154
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,690
 The future of those who ended Haebit Construction. 

155
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,370
 Do you think that's possible? 

156
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,180
- Grandma, I'm here. 
 - You made it.

157
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,480
Hey, you came.

158
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,340
Sit down.

159
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,830
 Sangah Construction succeeded in building a modular structure for the first time in the nation. 

160
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,530
 The modular architecture technology used vigorously in overseas construction industries 

161
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,370
 is displayed for the first time in this country. 

162
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,260
- There it goes. 
  - Reporter Lee Sung Min covers the story. 

163
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,610
Building that was Unnie Ji Soo's father's dream. 
    

164
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,920
No matter how I think about it, Unnie Ji Soo should have gotten married then.

165
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,630
She's so stubborn.

166
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,490
Her boyfriend was begging her to get married,

167
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,460
but she insisted on waiting until his family approved.

168
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,220
Then that happened to Ahjussi's company. She disappeared after.

169
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,180
People who are meant to meet will meet, even if it's in the future.

170
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,820
How could that be our Ji Soo's fault?

171
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,020
But I'm your granddaughter, Grandma, not Unnie Ji Soo.

172
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,650
Anyone who eats my food is my family; we're all one family.

173
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:09,140
Lucky you, Grandma!

174
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,730
Your child is over there and there. Everyone is your child.

175
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,360
Of all days, why does it have to be today? 
    

176
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,520
Since it's the new year tomorrow, they need it done today.

177
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,480
I checked the inventory assets.

178
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,650
It's all done, right?

179
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,640
Please follow me.

180
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,970
Okay, this is the last of the inventory.

181
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,390
Pardon?

182
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,310
Gosh, wait...

183
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,800
Wait, all... all of this?

184
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,500
♫  Time flows only for me  ♫

185
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:58,330
♫  You have stopped moving all alone  ♫

186
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,540
♫  The words "I miss you" float in the air  ♫

187
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,420
- You're awake? 
 - Yes.

188
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,110
You came.

189
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,450
Sorry. I'm sorry.

190
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,630
Well, that's what being an associate is like.

191
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,800
Just a moment.

192
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,170
♫  I wonder what you look like now  ♫

193
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,190
♫  Perhaps...  ♫

194
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:36,100
One, two...

195
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,890
Happy New Year!

196
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,590
♫  An unfamiliar child  ♫

197
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,670
♫  By chance, do you remember?  ♫

198
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:56,240
♫  It's okay, Child  ♫

199
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,240
♫  I will recognize you  ♫

200
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,250
♫  Even though the strong scent seeped into me is gone  ♫

201
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:16,630
♫  I won't forget you; I won't cry  ♫

202
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,510
   

203
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,170
Yes.

204
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,970
What drink? I said I'm working right now.

205
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,310
Then I guess I'll have to drink alone.

206
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,260
- Okay, bye. 
  - Miss you, Darling. Hurry home. Darling, the movie— 

207
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,930
You really do come here every day. 
    

208
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,480
Did you come here to check up on that?

209
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,080
Then you think I came here to give you this?

210
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,560
Forget it. I don't need it.

211
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,700
Then I guess you won't need this either.

212
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,310
   

213
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,620
   

214
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,240
How about the rest of it?

215
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,560
Where is the rest of this report?

216
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,810
Do you want to see it?

217
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,030
Are you mocking me right now?

218
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,890
Then work...

219
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,950
What is he saying?

220
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,770
on my team.

221
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,740
Then I'll give you the rest of the report.

222
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,500
We're conducting a workout compliance inspection of Soma Tech.

223
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,590
Why should I do that?

224
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,750
Even though there is a report like this,

225
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,830
if I report to the internal audit team that records are missing—

226
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,380
If I were afraid of that,

227
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,810
do you think this would be empty like this?

228
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,590
Pay cut, suspension, exclusion from promotion, I can stand all that. However,

229
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,570
could you handle it?

230
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,430
Could you stand not reading all the report?

231
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
It's at 8 a.m. tomorrow. Don't be late.

232
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Your minute and my minute differ in value.

233
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,180
Due to a request made by Jisan Bank,

234
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,560
the creditor for Soma Tech and our main client,

235
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,270
Mr. Han Seung Jo will work with us going forward.

236
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,540
Then Director Shim Hyung Woo, who is in a higher position

237
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,530
and worked on the case first, will oversee the project.

238
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:12,550
Mr. Han Seung Jo, why don't you take charge of the project?

239
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,380
V.P. Han.

240
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,850
With your permission, I think Mr. Han Seung Jo should be in charge of this project,

241
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,220
and I'll be the backup.

242
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,890
HK Private Equity Fund overseas is interested in purchasing a 3D building company

243
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,640
that has exceptional technology and is easy to take over.

244
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,760
They're seeking a company like Soma Tech.

245
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,240
Then what do you want to work on instead of the workout?

246
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,510
Sell Soma Tech to HK Private Equity Fund.

247
00:22:55,510 --> 00:23:00,660
It's more profitable to sell it than revive the company through workout.

248
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,230
You said you'd become a partner with your own competency.

249
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,370
There was a reason you were so confident.

250
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,200
Wouldn't it help you become the chairman of Taeil Accounting?

251
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,290
I'm sure they'd look for a chairman who'd add another won to their pockets.

252
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,120
So are you saying I should get on the boat that you've set sail on?

253
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,740
Take it if you like it.

254
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,620
I'm not interested in getting into something that doesn't make me money.

255
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,820
Then would you help me get more people on this boat?

256
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:52,580
   

257
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:12,020
This is the master key for all rooms on the twenty-sixth floor.

258
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,690
Looks like V.P. Han is running late. Should I call him?

259
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,370
It's not necessary.

260
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,300
He'll come after I'm done talking.

261
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,840
Wasn't V.P. Han meeting the president of Jisan Bank  with you?

262
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,150
He must be preparing in case things go awry.

263
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:31,430
He'll take his first step only after determining a way out.

264
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,050
Wait for me here.

265
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,590
But still, they're doing everything to survive.

266
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:44,110
Never mind helping them. How can I push them out?

267
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,210
Let's pretend this never happened.

268
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,120
To be blunt, Soma Tech...

269
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,940
Why don't you let us do the workout by forcing them to hold out to pay off their debt?

270
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,960
You don't even care if they survive or not.

271
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,390
Look at this guy. How dare you judge Jisan Bank like that?

272
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,070
You're holding on to them until they pay off their debt,

273
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:13,410
while tapping your calculator, trying to figure out how to sell it off by adding this or that.

274
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,300
Consider it a tumor removal and just sell it off.

275
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,900
That is true, but...

276
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,080
You want to sell it but don't want to be criticized?

277
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,840
We'll take care of that as well.

278
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:42,010
While we sell Soma Tech, you can sell us out.

279
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,470
Taeil Accounting is saying you're doing the right thing, that selling is right.

280
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,350
Who dares to make an issue out of it?

281
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,050
We'll give you plenty of reasons why you should sell it off.

282
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:03,460
Our job is to check how well Soma Tech is carrying out the promised tasks when we started the workout.

283
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,850
As you work, please don't forget that a company's future is on the line based on our evaluation.

284
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,830
As for Soma Tech's cash flow situation...

285
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,400
Mr. Yang Jae Hwan, please take it.

286
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,630
Okay, will do.

287
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:49,510
As for the inspection, Ms. Jin Yeon Ah... and Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

288
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:54,790
There's a possibility that their customers tried to cut prices using the workout as a reason.

289
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,180
Please keep this in mind as you check.

290
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,380
To raise the sales figure, it's very likely they had no choice but to agree to such a deal.

291
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,450
I'll definitely verify if price dumping took place.

292
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,650
Yes, and next is checking on liabilities.

293
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,540
The reason we let Mr. Han Seung Jo handle Soma Tech's compliance inspection is...

294
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,200
I already know.

295
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,250
Han Seung Jo demanded that of you while working on selling bad debts.

296
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,150
Then what should I tell Mr. Han regarding this?

297
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:37,440
If he finds out later that we kicked him out and started working with you again,

298
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,860
I don't think he'll just take it.

299
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,750
Just blame the bank president.

300
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:48,190
The superiors are there for us to use as excuses while making deals.

301
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,900
Jang Ho Woo.

302
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,030
Here's your day's pay. Good luck. 
    

303
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,060
Well, 3D buildings produce less waste,

304
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,980
the construction period is shorter, and costs are reduced.

305
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:33,070
At first, we started building them as they could be used in slums or disaster areas.

306
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,490
However, you need money to make that happen.

307
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,870
So we got the patent first.

308
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,220
How is Soma Tech's patent different from other building technologies?

309
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,320
The most important aspect of building a structure using 3D technology is durability.

310
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,690
The concrete used for 3D structures to enhance durability can't be developed by other builders.

311
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,650
We've developed a technology that can use any mixture...

312
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:01,020
 With a fraction of the cost, the durability is the same. 

313
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,070
 That is the biggest advantage. 

314
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,280
 Also, the construction period is short, and it produces a small amount of waste. 

315
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,670
 So it's environmentally friendly. 

316
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:13,170
 And if you consider site safety, 

317
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:17,960
 it's a futuristic technology that kills three birds with one stone. 

318
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,650
 You must have worked so hard on it. 

319
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,640
Although we're not doing too well,

320
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,750
 I'm confident about our technology in any arena. 

321
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,430
Aren't you working, Mr. Jang?

322
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:36,280
Stop watching me while we're working.

323
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,380
Excuse me?

324
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,580
W-Wait. I did?

325
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,940
I fell for someone at work, too.

326
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,330
But you should still focus on work.

327
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,270
Oh, wait...

328
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,630
Gosh! Look at this.

329
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,690
You're not listening because you're busy eyeing me, right?

330
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,590
Whom did you like before?

331
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,390
Han Seung Jo.

332
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,250
I mean, you try working every day, pulling all-nighters.

333
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,810
Forget having a boyfriend due to working late all the time. I can't keep social connections.

334
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,410
At the time, Han Seung Jo was the only eye candy at the firm.

335
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:26,710
Well, I bet there's no one in the firm who hasn't had a crush on Han Seung Jo.

336
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,790
I see...

337
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:32,120
Mr. Jang Ho Woo!

338
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,630
   

339
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,900
Well, this looks quite good.

340
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:17,750
If you have no objections, we'll conclude the report with Soma Tech having "going concern value."

341
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,560
- Good work. 
  - Thank you! 

342
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,900
- And Ms. Son Hye Won. 
 - Yes?

343
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,190
Why don't you send our opinion to Jisan Bank first so they can lend to Soma Tech?

344
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,540
Yes, will do.

345
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,060
- Mr. Jang Ho Woo. 
 - Yes.

346
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,610
Wow, the final page.

347
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,110
I guess we won't be seeing each other anymore.

348
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,140
You really think so?

349
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,520
Of course.

350
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,950
   

351
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,750
   

352
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,580
   

353
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,980
A barcode?

354
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,670
   

355
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,920
   

356
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,460
 It's an employee number. 
   

357
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,490
 To record on the company server who photocopied or 

358
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:09,220
 printed this paper, the copies are marked by barcodes. 

359
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,650
Why is that?

360
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,750
It's the accounting firm's way of internal control.

361
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:18,010
Just in case an internal document is leaked and causes trouble, we must find who's at fault quickly.

362
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,940
It's a fast, economical reprimand system.

363
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,730
If you don't want to be responsible for anything,

364
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,240
it's a silent warning not to copy or print anything unnecessarily.

365
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,740
By chance, is it possible to print a document without barcodes?

366
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,240
The partners can.

367
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,400
There's nothing partners can't do inside the accounting firm.

368
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,370
A partner...

369
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,680
Thank you.

370
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,940
Even if you're not a partner, if you log in with a partner's approval,

371
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,770
you can print without barcodes,

372
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,070
but it's extremely rare, in case things go wrong.

373
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:03,130
If it ever happened, I guess it's by someone very close to the partner.

374
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,190
For example...

375
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,250
like a family member...

376
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:26,010
How come there are two Haebit Construction liquidation decision reports?

377
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,640
Why do you think so?

378
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:39,250
This one has the barcode of the person who compiled and printed this report,

379
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,350
but this one doesn't.

380
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,720
Either a partner prepared and printed the report,

381
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,000
or it's someone with permission from a partner.

382
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,810
It also means these two reports are different.

383
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,770
The same report could have been printed at two different times.

384
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:55,710
No.

385
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,860
There's an even greater difference between these two reports besides the barcode:

386
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,250
the purpose of writing the report.

387
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,470
The nuances completely differ between the two.

388
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:13,940
This one states Haebit Construction is limited but more than good enough for growth.

389
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,080
But this one says it has potential, except the limitation is too great.

390
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,740
With the same facts, the interpretations and arguments differ.

391
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,130
If what I'm thinking is correct,

392
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,540
the conclusion of these two reports must contradict each other.

393
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,300
Thus,

394
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,250
"Haebit Construction should be shut down."

395
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,400
"Despite that,"

396
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,610
"it should not be shut down."

397
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:49,180
Ultimately, Haebit Construction was shut down so...

398
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:55,250
this report advocating against the shutdown was written first, and for some reason,

399
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,860
it was switched to this report urging its shutdown.

400
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,310
I believe that is theoretically correct.

401
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,990
"Written by Han Seung Jo." 
    

402
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,560
Do you know what happened due to this report?

403
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:18,580
If not for this report, that would have never happened.

404
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,190
So why exactly did you do it?

405
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,710
Why?

406
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,970
   

407
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,750
Did the father and son, Han Seung Jo and Han Je Gyun,

408
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:48,720
get paid by someone to liquidate Haebit Construction?

409
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,230
Don't just ask obvious questions.

410
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,980
Look for answers that not just anyone can find.

411
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,330
   

412
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,110
As for Soma Tech, it's been decided that the workout result was bad,

413
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,740
and it will be closed down, just so you know.

414
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,300
I'm the one in charge of this project. Who'd do that?

415
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,080
But my report says otherwise.

416
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,050
Who would fail Soma Tech and shut it down?

417
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,170
As for that report, you don't have to rewrite it.

418
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:47,280
I have one that was pulled together as a backup.

419
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,340
Father.

420
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,620
The company will go down even if you just leave it alone.

421
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,510
We should just move up the date. What's the problem?

422
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,600
Are you saying that because you really don't know?

423
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,180
The problem is it's exactly like what happened back then.

424
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,520
 What's this? 

425
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,350
 I clearly wrote that Haebit Construction's going concern value is greater. 

426
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,470
 But the liquidation decision? 

427
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,150
 Why did you switch out my report? 

428
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,550
 I only corrected your wrong answer. 

429
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,390
 What did you say? 

430
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,320
 Our job isn't about finding the optimum solution, 

431
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,280
 but rather the most satisfying solution. 

432
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,300
 How many times do I have to tell you? 

433
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:48,590
 I'm saying the correct answer is what's good for our client, not for Haebit Construction. 

434
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,060
 It's all finished. Nothing will change just because you do this. 

435
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,040
 I personally sent that company to you, Father. 

436
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,380
 Since you're a better accountant than I am, I wanted you to take good care of it because I trusted you. 

437
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,710
 But it wasn't enough for you to use that company to satisfy your greed; now you've switched my report? 

438
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,430
 All the while, I was absent taking care of Mom's funeral! 

439
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,500
 I took care of everything for Mom; you didn't! 

440
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,780
 Don't you feel bad toward Mom? 

441
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,030
 Your mom would have understood 

442
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,840
 because it's all for your own good. 

443
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,700
 And since things have come to this, 

444
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,210
 you should finish things yourself, 

445
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,050
 if you don't want to see Ji Soo struggle in poverty all her life due to her father's debt. 

446
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,920
 Father! 

447
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,590
 Even if you move out of this house and try to do something else, 

448
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,170
 the result will be the same. 

449
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,040
 You know best that I have the power 

450
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,350
 and competency to do that. 

451
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,750
 Also... 

452
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,670
 your rage... 

453
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,540
 has no power. 

454
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,330
 Your rage that can't do anything about it... 

455
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,870
 It's merely your opinion. 

456
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,960
 Don't be so childish. 

457
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,930
Will you sell Soma Tech to a foreign company just like you did with Haebit Construction?

458
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,270
How much more must you sell off to be satisfied?

459
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,570
What do you mean by "sell off"?

460
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,530
Are you saying it's a global investment if we take over a foreign company,

461
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:00,000
but we're traitors if we sell our business to a foreign company?

462
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,850
There are things a human should

463
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:05,960
and should not do!

464
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,720
You call yourself an accountant.

465
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,610
Yet how could you have such cheap romantic notions?

466
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:22,300
I don't even have a trace of respect left for you, Father, or any desire to respect you.

467
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,070
You know better than anyone else

468
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,200
that I don't need that cheap respect of yours.

469
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,930
Yes.

470
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:36,360
You don't need a son. You need a loyal dog just like Shim Hyung Woo.

471
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,590
Stop being an eyesore and hand everything over to Hyung Woo.

472
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:45,630
He's the one who suggested to HK Private Equity Fund that they purchase Soma Tech. And...

473
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,400
please listen to your elder.

474
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,040
An elder...

475
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,040
Where is the elder here?

476
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,050
Jisan Bank rejected the loan extension to Soma Tech.

477
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,540
They also rejected the transaction proposal.

478
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:16,310
- They say it's based on our decision, but I don't know— 
 - I know who.

479
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,820
Pardon?

480
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,060
Where are you right now?

481
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,860
What? Aren't you getting off?

482
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,940
You still haven't answered me yet.

483
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,230
No matter how busy you are, I'm sure you've got time to talk in the car.

484
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,740
Get—

485
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,490
Where are we going?

486
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,130
Come on, slow down!

487
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:05,680
Say one more word, and I'll just throw you out.

488
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,410
Shim Hyung Woo!

489
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,790
Are you even human?

490
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,750
Selling Haebit Construction wasn't enough for you.

491
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,460
What will you do by selling Soma Tech too?

492
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,810
"Haebit Construction."

493
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:45,070
Making partner at Taeil Accounting... That's what I'm working for.

494
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:47,740
I don't even expect any trace of conscience.

495
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:53,110
But at the very minimum, have you any rules or pride as an accountant?

496
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:58,510
When you switched my report with yours in the Haebit Construction liquidation, I thought I'd seen your worst.

497
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,930
But I guess I underestimated you.

498
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,950
You can still stoop lower.

499
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,370
What did you just say? "Haebit Construction"?

500
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:09,680
Are you saying Director Shim switched your report with his?

501
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,890
It makes me sick. Don't act like a victim while appearing a good-natured person.

502
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,500
I'm the real victim here.

503
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,100
- What? 
 - I'm human, too.

504
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,870
While you were mourning your mother's death,

505
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,960
do you think I wanted to switch your report with mine?

506
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,660
So if you do what you're told, does that make you human?

507
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,970
Stop anyone on the street and ask!

508
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,910
How many could actually refuse if ordered by their superior?

509
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,340
No one.

510
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:40,310
The only person who can object to V.P. Han Je Gyun inside Taeil Accounting

511
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,310
is you, Han Seung Jo.

512
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,960
Does that still make me a perpetrator and not a victim?

513
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,400
Stop saying nonsense. There were many ways to avoid that.

514
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,120
There's only one choice out of two options for a regular person.

515
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,150
Do what I'm told or quit. Or turn it down and get kicked out!

516
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,260
I'm sure you only see me as crazy about becoming a partner.

517
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:03,660
You're right. I'm crazy. I've totally lost it!

518
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,870
If only to be partner, I'd switch the report a hundred times over!

519
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,260
Soma Tech...

520
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:14,310
I could sell off organs by becoming a trafficker if I had to!

521
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,850
Why?

522
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,840
Because I'm sick and tired of living with blood on my hands.

523
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,520
I don't want to do this sh*t anymore!

524
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:26,870
And if you become a partner, do you think you won't have to?

525
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:30,490
Once you cross the line, you can never return,

526
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,510
especially as someone who gained by crossing the line.

527
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,100
People like you and my father can never stop.

528
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,390
So I'll stop it... Your making partner.

529
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,410
You a**hole!

530
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,540
Strangely, you think you could, right?

531
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,500
I'm so energized seeing you behave this way.

532
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,570
I was born on third base and barely made it home.

533
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,580
What's wrong with doing my best?

534
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,630
Your best is...

535
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:08,100
causing the worst-case scenario for others.

536
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,140
That woman you were head over heels for...

537
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:16,370
If you dare mention that one more time, I'll seriously kill you.

538
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:20,200
Never mind Haebit Construction, you couldn't even protect one woman.

539
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,200
I look forward to find out what you could actually do.

540
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,450
Don't look forward to it, Man.

541
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:31,380
Even if you don't, I'll exceed your expectations. Got that?

542
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:53,900
You opposed shutting down Haebit Construction, but while you had your mother's funeral,

543
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,650
Shim Hyung Woo switched the report with V.P. Han Je Gyun's order. Is that right?

544
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,410
You heard everything. Why ask?

545
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,780
Is it fun to toy with people?

546
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,370
What the heck were you thinking while I was angry at the wrong person?

547
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:14,430
I never thought it wasn't my fault.

548
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,390
It happened while I was absent from my post.

549
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:20,180
And it's true I couldn't take responsibility to the end.

550
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,460
You didn't rage at the wrong person.

551
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,670
You came to the right person.

552
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,650
Hey, Jang Ho Woo!

553
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,010
Can you handle alcohol?

554
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:58,990
Is this your first time drinking wine?

555
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,740
Well... it's fairly good.

556
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:23,670
I think you're really drunk.

557
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,590
I'm not drunk.

558
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:30,300
Wow, but it's rather nice.

559
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,690
I always drank at home by myself.

560
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,390
Why are you alone, Mr. Han?

561
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,780
In my opinion, I think you're in about ninety...

562
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:42,250
no, almost in the ninety-fifth percentile.

563
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:46,590
Hey, Jang Ho Woo, you've come a long way.

564
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:52,050
And how come I'm only 95%?

565
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,380
I'm competent, nice, tall, and...

566
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,470
it's a bit awkward having to say it myself, but...

567
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,950
I'm really good-looking.

568
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,830
That good—

569
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,740
Do something about that good-looking mouth of yours.

570
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:13,820
Y-You arrogant punk, you should wipe it for me...

571
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,060
How can you just toss some Kleenex to your sunbae?

572
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:26,920
No matter how carefully I try to walk, the mud splashes on me.

573
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,000
Maybe a car drove right by you when you were walking.

574
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,730
That's how my life has been all this time.

575
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,040
Even if I run far while running out of breath,

576
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,210
I'm standing in a mud field where I can't see the end of it.

577
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,930
Someone like you would never know how I feel.

578
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,920
Well, you might see your house.

579
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:10,250
 The Federal Reserve raises key interest rates on Wednesday 

580
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:13,440
 from the original rate of 0% to 0.15% 

581
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,520
 to a new range of 0.4% to 0.15%. 

582
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,520
 The move was widely expected. 

583
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,830
 However, a small increase in the interest rate will affect millions of investors, home buyers, and savers. 

584
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,820
It's the original copy that I wrote.

585
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,480
   

586
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,920
When I said there is no power in your rage...

587
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,550
Actually, I was told that.

588
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:52,520
My father told me that, but I couldn't deny it.

589
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,490
And there I saw you, who totally resembled me.

590
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:00,920
 You had no idea what to do but get angry. 

591
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,650
 Do you think all grownups are adults? 

592
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:06,690
 You think the money is yours from stabbing someone in the back. 

593
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:11,050
 And you think that's a success! You piece of trash! 

594
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,600
 What the heck is money, anyway? 

595
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,760
 And I happened to see you at the new recruit interview site. 

596
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,720
 Yes, this way, please. 

597
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,530
   

598
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,090
   

599
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,140
   

600
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,100
 Tell them it's Han Seung Jo's direct hire. 

601
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,390
 When I saw you reappear as an accountant, 

602
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:52,590
I felt so pathetic.

603
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:58,060
I couldn't abandon Taeil, and I had no courage to bring my father down.

604
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,750
I guess I seemed indecisive.

605
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:06,300
So why did you show so much interest in me all this time?

606
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,180
It wasn't really interest.

607
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,660
Let's just say I was being cautious.

608
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,490
Even so, we might have different goals but the same target.

609
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:18,840
"We have different goals but the same target"?

610
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:24,300
You and I have begun separately, but we want to see the same result.

611
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,300
V.P. Han Je Gyun, Shim Hyung Woo,

612
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,910
and those who are protected by them...

613
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:34,490
We want them to pay for what they've done. Something like that?

614
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:37,460
But V.P. Han Je Gyun is still your father.

615
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,430
Father...

616
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:42,540
He took more from me than he gave me.

617
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,050
Trust no one and trust a deal.

618
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,890
This is a type of deal too.

619
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:50,020
It's not about trusting and helping each other.

620
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,690
It's a strategic alliance to achieve each of our own goals.

621
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:58,410
Well, do you mean MOU (memorandum of understanding)?

622
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:00,600
MOU sounds good.

623
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,120
Let me ask you one thing, though.

624
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,610
What do you gain by finding out what happened with Haebit Construction's liquidation?

625
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:11,930
Are you trying to whistle-blow or something?

626
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,330
What's the point of doing that?

627
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:17,240
Doesn't everyone know this is how the world is?

628
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,850
Then why?

629
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,660
Because I promised him that I'd repay him.

630
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,330
"Repay"?

631
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:31,170
Are you saying you'll shut down this firm or something?

632
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,090
That's just the principal. I need to collect interest too.

633
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:40,430
I'm still thinking daily about what the interest rate will be.

634
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:46,520
Then... what should we do now?

635
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:51,560
First we need to stop... the same thing from happening again.

636
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,410
   

637
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,590
 What did you just say? "Haebit Construction"? 

638
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:21,190
 Are you saying Director Shim switched your report with his? 

639
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,810
Look into Jang Ho Woo,

640
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:37,370
starting with his resume, his family and friends, everything,

641
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:40,430
especially his connection with Haebit Construction.

642
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:56,770
 They revived the company by bringing in accountants and funding it. 

643
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:00,080
 Why are they dying to kill off Soma Tech now? 

644
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,870
 I just don't get it, based on my understanding. 

645
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,120
 Your premise is wrong. 

646
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,370
 Let's say Soma Tech revives through the workout procedure. Who would that benefit? 

647
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,450
 Well, of course, Soma Tech... 

648
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,110
 It's Jisan Bank. 

649
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:21,540
 The fact that Soma Tech is worth saving means that someone who wants Soma Tech could appear someday as long as it's alive. 

650
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,830
 As long as the price is right, Jisan Bank can sell it off. 

651
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:28,930
 So when Soma Tech fell into Jisan Bank's hands, 

652
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:31,160
 they could have sold it then. 

653
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:36,730
 Between the spicy stew's fish and a live fish, 

654
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:39,450
 which do you think will sell for more? 

655
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:46,380
 Just because a fish is swimming in water, it may not be in the ocean. 

656
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:53,540
 For some, that could be a sashimi restaurant's fish tank where you can pick your own fish to eat. 

657
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,760
 They were so close that people thought they were birth father and son. 

658
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,330
 Jang Ho Woo was also the one who saw Mr. Jang die and called the police. 

659
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:40,820
Then he became an accountant and

660
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,120
entered Taeil Accounting, which handled Haebit Construction's liquidation?

661
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,020
Good work.

662
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,310
You a**hole, what's your intention for crawling in here?

663
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,380
To find out what?

664
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:23,040
Why?

665
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,700
Are you suddenly feeling guilty about switching the report?

666
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,160
Are you afraid I might take revenge?

667
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,830
I'm not afraid of you at all.

668
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,580
Plus, I didn't do anything wrong.

669
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,950
Listen up.

670
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,390
There was no error in the Haebit Construction report that I wrote.

671
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,570
It was a situation where the liquidation decision

672
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:48,830
could be made depending how an accountant viewed it.

673
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,770
I have no qualms about it at all.

674
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:54,670
So don't you dare think about being cheeky.

675
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:58,930
I'm different than Han Seung Jo, who lets you off easy for being cutesy.

676
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,920
The fact that you're acting this way toward me

677
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,310
proves that you're not blameless.

678
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,280
If you were truly blameless, why would you care who I am or

679
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,910
what I decide to do in the future?

680
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,410
Do you think you can do whatever you want?

681
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:29,750
Even if you have a few mishaps at first,

682
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:33,010
do you think it will all work out in the end?

683
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:34,600
Don't be mistaken.

684
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,770
You're different than Han Seung Jo, too.

685
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:41,480
People who have a backup like Han Seung Jo could call a failure an experience.

686
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:47,410
It's over for b*stards like you who have nothing if you slip up once.

687
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,070
Do you think people live quietly because they're stupid?

688
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:52,050
Because they lack courage?

689
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:55,380
No way.

690
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,770
It's because they don't have another chance.

691
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,010
If you get what I mean, be grateful to your grandma and grandpa,

692
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:07,010
who raised you although you're not their blood, and live quietly.

693
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,360
Don't loaf around idly.

694
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,830
Call HK Private Equity Fund right now.

695
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,070
Don't forget it.

696
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:08,670
The bad things that happen in front of you

697
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:12,480
are not anyone's fault, whatever they may be.

698
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,580
If you don't have self-esteem on your own,

699
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,940
it's hard to survive here.

700
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:22,700
For me, it's no different when I get off work, too.

701
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,960
It's hard to survive at work, but

702
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,350
it's tough even to stay alive at home sometimes.

703
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,060
Thus, if it's not about ruining your work over some woman,

704
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:38,100
just drink this and let it go.

705
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:56,640
So HK Private Equity Fund people will be at today's meeting, too?

706
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,570
Joyce Jang will be there.

707
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,430
If everyone gathers in one place,

708
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:03,830
I thought we could get things rolling faster. That's why I arranged it that way.

709
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,670
Well, there's no need to meet twice.

710
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:09,740
That Joyce Jang... If she wears a long sword brooch on a given day,

711
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:12,360
she slashes the other party. Isn't that her?

712
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,600
That is true, but due to her unusually fast rise in position,

713
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,630
I'm sure people exaggerated the rumor.

714
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,980
The meaning of that sword brooch...

715
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,380
Who do you think first spread that rumor?

716
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:29,950
It was probably herself

717
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:34,910
so she can observe the other party

718
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:38,570
when they see that she's wearing it.

719
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:44,890
It seems she will be a tough match for you.

720
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,540
Are you ready, Jang Ho Woo?

721
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,830
I was born ready.

722
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,100
Noona Ji Soo...

723
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,640
I'm Joyce from HK Private Equity Fund.

724
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:51,070


725
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:03,210
♫  Time flows only for me  ♫

726
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:10,720
♫  You have stopped moving all alone  ♫

727
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,660
♫  The words "I miss you" float in the air  ♫

728
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,200
   

729
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,200
 You could have called at least once to say you were okay. 

730
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,670
 Did you already forget what you did to my dad and the company? 

731
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:28,030
 I don't think it's valid to assist in reviving Soma Tech when it could most likely stand on its own. 

732
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:29,740
 Are you looking for a compliment instead of money? 

733
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:34,540
 Had I known she'd be that magnanimous back then, she'd be much better off now. 

734
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,850
 Don't mess with her. 

735
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:38,320
 You should also change if there's something you want. 

736
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,530
 Since you could send Soma Tech to be revived with your own hands... 

737
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,760
 If you were going to do this, you shouldn't have acted arrogant. 

738
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,970
 To make the company shake. 

739
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:49,120
 Watch how I open the door you can't seem to open. 

740
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:51,100
 CEO! 

741
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,180
 Ahjussi!
