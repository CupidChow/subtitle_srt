1
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,994
   
   

2
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:36,124
   

3
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,974
Disclaimer of opinion...

4
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:44,084
You said not to worry, and is this the result?

5
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:47,594
From now on, regarding this case,

6
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:52,144
the opinion of Taeil as a whole will have to be a disclaimer of opinion.

7
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:55,494
It's clear they will make an official announcement

8
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:59,214
so we can't make a public announcement ourselves.

9
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:03,654
What an accounting firm sells aren't reports,

10
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:09,604
but its reputation and name for never being wrong.

11
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:12,554
If we say that this year's disclaimer of opinion was warranted,

12
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:15,864
then they will pick a fight with us about last year's unqualified opinion.

13
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:17,784
Then does that mean that we need to prove

14
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:22,584
that the opposite results from last year to this year are both warranted?

15
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,834
It's a battle of offense and defense...

16
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:30,654
and a battle Taeil must win regardless which side it's on.

17
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:37,234
Therefore, there are some things you have to do from now on.

18
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:46,304
   

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:54,140


20
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:56,484
   

21
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:02,914
   

22
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,484
   
   

23
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:12,964
 In the audit report or the books, there can't be a single flaw. 

24
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:15,264
Use whatever means you must.

25
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:17,824
If things should go wrong...

26
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:20,904
who in this firm...

27
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:23,864
will suffer the losses?

28
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:37,364
They've arrived.

29
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:40,524
- One moment. 
 - Pardon?

30
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:44,444
What's the matter here?

31
00:02:44,444 --> 00:02:46,534
Wait! Why are you taking my bag?

32
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,164
What's the matter with you?

33
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:50,494
You need to explain what this is about!

34
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:51,994
Give me my bag!

35
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:53,314
Wait a minute.

36
00:02:53,314 --> 00:02:56,434
You have to explain what's going on!

37
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:01,264
 Since I threw a rock into a peaceful lake... 

38
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,484
 my team members will have a hard time. 

39
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:07,584
 It's shameless of me, but please take care of them. 

40
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:10,584
Why are they taking away their laptops?

41
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:12,164
Accountant...

42
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:15,794
What's the first thing you'd do to an enemy you capture during a war?

43
00:03:15,794 --> 00:03:19,204
- I'd disarm them first. 
 - We're also at war here.

44
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:21,784
While the laptops of rookies like you are meaningless...

45
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:27,574
accountants' laptops with all kinds of secrets of countless corporations are basically bombs.

46
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:32,434
If they explode unexpectedly... they'll wipe out friend and foe alike.

47
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:36,974
They're doing that in case the accountants might sell corporate info out of spite?

48
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:39,484
"A desperate man takes desperate measures."

49
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:42,894
It's not hard to drive a man to desperation here.

50
00:03:48,504 --> 00:03:51,604
Flawed aspects were found in last year's audit report.

51
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:53,854
It's indeed our accounting firm's mistake.

52
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:57,144
Accounting firms don't make mistakes.

53
00:03:57,144 --> 00:04:00,364
Though, a single accountant might be a different story.

54
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:06,814
Why did Vice President An have to take a sick leave now?

55
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:10,504
We won't be at a loose end like this, right?

56
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:13,004
If only Mr. Kang had discussed this with us in advance...

57
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:17,214
And if he had discussed, would we have told him to go ahead?

58
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:21,434
We're the only ones who can save ourselves right now.

59
00:04:27,654 --> 00:04:30,514
It's not like submitting a disclaimer of opinion is a crime.

60
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:36,574
Our firm won't be finding any of you accountable for this year's disclaimer of opinion.

61
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:40,924
However, the company is concerned with last year's matter, with regards to the recent happening.

62
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:43,694
"L-Last year"?

63
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:48,904
Technically, one could say we changed our words

64
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:51,554
since we said we couldn't trust that company this year

65
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:55,294
when we verified them for a similar financial statement last year.

66
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,014
To avoid it becoming a problem,

67
00:04:57,014 --> 00:05:00,904
we need to properly explain our unqualified opinion from last year.

68
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:05,414
Don't tell me there's no way you just gave

69
00:05:05,414 --> 00:05:07,654
an unqualified opinion without even knowing

70
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:11,884
they failed to premiere the movie and the situation with their goods, right?

71
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:16,804
It's not like accounting firms give unqualified opinions as a joke.

72
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:24,594
You all seem dumbfounded by this when you put in the effort to fabricate the report

73
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:27,334
after looking through the board meeting minutes.

74
00:05:27,334 --> 00:05:29,074
But please understand.

75
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:32,354
- "Board meeting minutes"? 
 - Yes.

76
00:05:32,354 --> 00:05:35,474
Board meeting minutes.

77
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:43,524
I mean, what can an accountant do when the board decides to go that way?

78
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:47,264
It would've been hard to give something other than an unqualified opinion, even if it was me.

79
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:57,914
Your notes regarding People's Entertainment board meeting minutes are included in last year's audit report, right?

80
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:03,604
And I'm sure a copy of the board meeting minutes is stored together.

81
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:10,654
The board meeting minutes were missing.

82
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,524
Yes, I'm sure that was the case.

83
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:15,544
That means...

84
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:19,434
It's those fellows' fault for failing to recognize danger.

85
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:24,134
They can admit their mistake like Accountant Kang did, or...

86
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:29,384
they can avoid responsibility by creating non-existent board meeting minutes

87
00:06:29,384 --> 00:06:32,024
to cover up their mistake.

88
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:36,064
Won't they have to choose between the two?

89
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:39,194
A fake board meeting minutes...

90
00:06:39,194 --> 00:06:42,514
Are you telling me to order the fabrication of a corporate document?

91
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:48,024
If this goes wrong, you and I could be in trouble for fabricating a corporate document.

92
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:56,604
Hyung Woo, are you going to order those fellows...

93
00:06:56,604 --> 00:07:00,474
to fabricate fake meeting minutes?

94
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:05,674
I'm asking if you're going to tell them to prepare in advance

95
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:09,824
a fake meeting minutes if they fear possible litigation,

96
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:14,644
which they'll be entirely accountable for?

97
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:20,794
You're not going to, are you?

98
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,354
And of course, I won't, either.

99
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:33,324
There's no need to get blood on our hands.

100
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:38,554
We only need to prepare and set the stage properly.

101
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:44,764
Those fellows will have to decide what to do on top of that prepared stage and

102
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:48,244
also their responsibility, right?

103
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:51,414
   

104
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,374
Be on the lookout.

105
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,374
Look carefully. Do you see the board meeting minutes?

106
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:01,014
We never saw it. There's no way it's there.

107
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,074
I never even saw such a thing.

108
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,984
What do we do now?

109
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:09,384
As of now, our last year's decision makes sense only if we have that thing.

110
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:21,084
Why are you all looking at me?

111
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,384
You're now in charge of our team.

112
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,104
Hey, everyone, gather for now.

113
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:37,554
Who's the accountant in charge of People's Entertainment?

114
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,614
Who are you?

115
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:41,994
Come out here!

116
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:49,024
Hurry up and come out here!

117
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:07,754
 Jang Ho Woo, get over here right this moment. 
   

118
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:16,014
 Jang Ho Woo, why do you think those people came here? 

119
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:26,664
They're here since People's Entertainment is about to be delisted due to the disclaimer of opinion, aren't they?

120
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,294
Really?

121
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,134
What about the major shareholders?

122
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:37,404
They're sure to take bigger losses.

123
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:40,714
It's because their accountants come to them in person.

124
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:44,274
They probably prepare a plan and resolve the issue together.

125
00:09:45,394 --> 00:09:47,554
But those people...

126
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,944
Your role and responsibility as an accountant...

127
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:57,064
should be sold to people whose money makes money for them,

128
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:00,794
not those who work to make money.

129
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:04,734
They're expensive products to be sold on top of marbled floors,

130
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,664
not on the streets like that.

131
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,840
Did you say you'll be a top talent of Taeil Accounting Firm?

132
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:19,404
Then don't think of wasting your emotions and position.

133
00:10:19,404 --> 00:10:24,634
And remember, your first step dictates your end.

134
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:43,520
   

135
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,680
- He's here. 
 - He's here!

136
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:52,554
 One word for us, please. 

137
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:55,354
Is Chairman Lee Chan Joo aware of this?

138
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,844
Are you remorseful at all?

139
00:10:57,844 --> 00:11:01,434
Was this intended or was it a mistake?

140
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:05,154
 V.P. Han Je Gyun! 

141
00:11:05,154 --> 00:11:06,574
 You can't go in like this! 

142
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:08,604
Hey, Han Je Gyun!

143
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:11,004
There's a limit to how much you can betray a person.

144
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,364
How dare you give us a disclaimer of opinion?

145
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:16,094
If my son gets arrested, I won't sit still!

146
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:19,194
All of you, prepare yourselves, you hear?

147
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:21,464
I'll take responsibility.

148
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:28,424
I'll take responsibility... to stop your son from getting arrested.

149
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:40,514
A fake board meeting minutes?

150
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,634
The allegations of your son's embezzlement

151
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:50,214
stems from him dogmatically pressing on an unreasonable business plan.

152
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:53,924
Which means, if we can prove that the plan was a result of a board meeting...

153
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:59,704
we can make it a common investment failure instead of embezzlement.

154
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,924
Wait, so you're saying...

155
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:08,234
he won't be arrested as long as there's a board meeting minutes...

156
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:13,954
and Taeil will prepare the said fake board meeting minutes?

157
00:12:14,954 --> 00:12:16,824
You're correct.

158
00:12:27,194 --> 00:12:28,604
Whether it's a copy or an original doesn't matter.

159
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:31,884
Just find a paper that has the words "board meeting minutes" and the corporate seal on it.

160
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,574
 Yes! 

161
00:12:35,374 --> 00:12:37,504
 There is no problem. 

162
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:40,224
 I said it's all fine. 

163
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:46,414
I found it.

164
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:51,734
Aigoo, get off your phones. What are you doing?

165
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:54,674
I can't hear myself think!

166
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:57,084
- I found it! 
 - Let me see.

167
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:03,164
How dare you come in here?

168
00:13:03,164 --> 00:13:06,484
After ruining someone else's business...

169
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:11,184
what more do you want that you come in all the way here?

170
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,394
Whose fault do you think this is?

171
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:27,914
If only you hadn't fooled us with those fake numbers...

172
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:29,894
none of this would have happened!

173
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:33,254
Both you and I wouldn't have to do this, all right?

174
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:36,154
Get out. "Get out," I said.

175
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:38,934
Didn't you hear me say to get out?

176
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:41,734
This place is still my company!

177
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:44,414
We need to survive for you to survive as well!

178
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:48,394
In all honesty, we're the only ones who can help you.

179
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,994
The bank will ask for the money you borrowed any time now.

180
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:53,564
What are you going to do?

181
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:57,054
I also want to just die right now!

182
00:13:58,024 --> 00:14:00,054
But you know, don't you?

183
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:02,784
People don't die from being embarrassed.

184
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:05,084
It's something else that kills.

185
00:14:12,254 --> 00:14:15,954
Sangah Group transferred the investment funds on March 16.

186
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,564
Okay, March 16.

187
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,464
March 8, there was a board meeting on March 8.

188
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:23,374
Okay, we can say the board agreed to invest on that day.

189
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,824
- What's next? 
 - The next meeting was on April 24.

190
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,734
April 24.

191
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,784
All documents needed for fabrication of fake board meeting minutes...

192
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:38,894
have been collected, and fabrication is in the process right now.

193
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:42,614
Once the minutes are complete, I'll deliver them to Sangah Group.

194
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:45,254
And what about our business?

195
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:50,504
Just because the M and A failed... we can't just sit still and watch.

196
00:14:50,504 --> 00:14:53,434
We need to make money in our way.

197
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:58,714
I'm already calculating the odds of winning for different cases... using People's Entertainment case.

198
00:14:58,714 --> 00:15:01,264
I'll report to you separately tomorrow.

199
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:05,324
All right then.

200
00:15:12,364 --> 00:15:14,784
   

201
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:18,440
   

202
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,990
 Give us a comment. 

203
00:15:27,964 --> 00:15:30,464
Don't you understand what prohibited means?

204
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:32,914
I'm sure I told you not to come up here.

205
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:38,284
No one is willing to save People's Entertainment's minor shareholders, who are innocent.

206
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:42,274
 But he's has so many people saving him when he did wrong. 

207
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:45,594
How unfair.

208
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:08,434
 Your role and responsibility as an accountant... 

209
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,164
 should be sold to people whose money 

210
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:14,834
 makes money for them, not those who work to make money. 

211
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:18,774
 They're expensive products to be sold on top of marbled floors, 

212
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:21,724
 not on the streets like that. 

213
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:27,724
If you're about done eating, hurry and get to work.

214
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:31,594
What are you thinking so hard about, first thing in the morning?

215
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:34,524
You're right.

216
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:39,524
You can't hide being an accountant, either, Ho Woo.

217
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:41,914
Why?

218
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:47,804
I listen in on customers when I pass them by.

219
00:16:47,804 --> 00:16:50,824
The ones who have a frown on their face and

220
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:54,394
talk about serious things are all accountants.

221
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:58,684
Well, you shouldn't have opened a restaurant here.

222
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:05,754
It's because Yeo Jin insisted I must open one in her jurisdiction for her to rest assured.

223
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:14,944
It's been just a few months since I opened this restaurant.

224
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:19,124
And it'll soon turn into a restaurant for accountants.

225
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:21,954
They said this place used to be...

226
00:17:21,954 --> 00:17:25,744
their hangout or something before.

227
00:17:26,394 --> 00:17:31,574
I'm already worried I'll meet my co-workers here.

228
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:35,714
I don't want to tell them for now.

229
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:38,314
Why do you have to tell them?

230
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:42,264
Whenever I see that arrogant professor...

231
00:17:43,014 --> 00:17:47,334
I want to run my mouth and brag to him about my grandson being an accountant.

232
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,394
But I held myself back all this time.

233
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:59,004
One soup and rice, please.

234
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,824
Yes. Sit anywhere you want.

235
00:18:16,634 --> 00:18:19,074
Ho Woo, what's the matter?

236
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:23,914
Gosh, just stand up straight and act like a customer and leave.

237
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:26,574
Aigoo, you idiot.

238
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:38,164
   

239
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,264
I need to change the name now. 
    

240
00:18:44,264 --> 00:18:46,904
There's a new eye candy now.

241
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:50,244
Yes, hello?

242
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:53,924
 Ms. Jin Yeon Ah, are you working these days? 

243
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,264
Well, I did...

244
00:18:56,264 --> 00:18:58,284
Up until just now.

245
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,554
A proposal, you say?

246
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:02,574
 It'll only take a day. 

247
00:19:04,514 --> 00:19:07,864
Well, I was on my way home after working all night.

248
00:19:11,654 --> 00:19:16,924
 Are they saying we'll only organize... and the seller will be the one to do the valuations? 

249
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:21,404
They're saying they'll only trust us halfway, right?

250
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:32,604
So what's the total bond amount?

251
00:19:36,604 --> 00:19:40,354
Jisan Bank owns a total of ₩72.4 billion ($55.5 million) in bonds.

252
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,374
And...

253
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:45,464
Jang Ho Woo.

254
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:48,284
Take a seat if you're here.

255
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:50,334
You, too.

256
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:52,264
Yes.

257
00:19:52,264 --> 00:19:57,784
   
   

258
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:05,774
If the audit report is rejected, wouldn't Jisan Bank reject the request to delay payment and ask for immediate repayment?

259
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:09,644
Asking for the money back that they lent? It's more than possible.

260
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:13,174
The company is already on the brink of collapse due to the disclaimer of opinion.

261
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:15,464
So it's meaningless to give them more time to repay.

262
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,864
But it's impossible for People's Entertainment to repay the loans with its current finances.

263
00:20:19,864 --> 00:20:21,884
Which is why we should use bad debt–

264
00:20:21,884 --> 00:20:25,714
Let's make them into bad debts and sell them off?

265
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:27,684
- Yes. 
 - Okay, that's great.

266
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,824
Now, will it be the seller or the buyer?

267
00:20:31,544 --> 00:20:33,184
Sorry?

268
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:36,274
He's asking which side Taeil Accounting needs to side with

269
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:39,584
for greater commission, the seller or the buyer of the bonds?

270
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:42,134
Well...

271
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:43,864
That would be...

272
00:20:55,824 --> 00:20:58,474
   

273
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:02,364
To sell or...

274
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:18,884
 It's indeed the best proposal... 

275
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:22,094
 but the branch manager will obviously oppose it. 

276
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:26,304
Losing 70 billion won will only earn him disdain from his shareholders.

277
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:31,204
What does he have to gain in selling the bonds?

278
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:34,794
He'll just stall for time until his term ends and

279
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,304
try to waste time away, probably.

280
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:42,204
For the plan to succeed, we need the branch manager's cooperation. So it's a big problem.

281
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:49,164
There's a way.

282
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:50,664
Jang Ho Woo...

283
00:21:53,524 --> 00:21:57,974
I have a way to convince Jisan Bank.

284
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,184
   

285
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:07,684
 Have you heard of the phrase, "Wag the dog"? 

286
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:09,504
 Wag the dog... 

287
00:22:09,504 --> 00:22:12,434
 It means you just move the tail of a dog 

288
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:15,204
 if his head isn't budging when you're trying to move him. 

289
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:25,184
If we say Jisan Bank, the leading bondholder of People's Entertainment, is the head of the dog,

290
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:27,024
although the amount is way smaller,

291
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:32,544
we can theorize the other bank that lent money to People's Entertainment to be the tail.

292
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:36,734
But the problem is the head isn't budging, being worried that people might discover the loss,

293
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:39,524
so it's acting like nothing is wrong.

294
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:43,504
Instead of the head, we make the bank's tail

295
00:22:43,504 --> 00:22:47,724
take the lead and sell off their bad debts first.

296
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:54,424
The same company borrowed money in the same way...

297
00:22:55,104 --> 00:22:57,354
but one bank says nothing is wrong...

298
00:22:57,354 --> 00:23:00,274
and the other is blatantly saying there's a big problem.

299
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:02,764
People's attention will naturally be drawn to it.

300
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:06,534
And there's no way Jisan Bank's shareholders will sit after seeing this...

301
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:10,614
meaning they're sure to pressure the bank into taking action.

302
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:16,684
Jisan Bank can't help but sell off bad debts according to Taeil Accounting's instructions,

303
00:23:16,684 --> 00:23:22,884
since the tail has shaken the head completely.

304
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:29,234
I appreciate your opinion, V.P. Han Je Gyun...

305
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:34,914
but we at Jisan Bank decided to take the time and watch.

306
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:40,144
You readily hand over individual customers to collection

307
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:43,954
if their interest payments are delayed even by a day...

308
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:48,974
but toward a corporation that borrowed a large sum,

309
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:52,504
you're ever so generous.

310
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:59,584
Isn't this why there's a joke telling you to be a big thief if you've decided to steal?

311
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:03,384
I mean, we, the lender, are saying that it's okay.

312
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:04,904
So what's the problem?

313
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:10,124
I think the problem is with Jisan Bank, not me.

314
00:24:11,654 --> 00:24:13,814
What do you mean by that?

315
00:24:13,814 --> 00:24:17,354
Much like Jisan Bank...

316
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:22,634
Hanra Bank had lent money to People's Entertainment.

317
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:28,844
And they have just decided to enter the process of selling off bad debt. 
    

318
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:34,914
On top of that, this case involves the third-generation heir of Sangah Group.

319
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:39,744
So the press will be talking so happily about it.

320
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:44,124
If your shareholders ask you about what's happening...

321
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:47,174
will you have something to tell them?

322
00:24:48,804 --> 00:24:53,684
What if they interrogate you saying, what made you think it was okay

323
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,104
to give him such a large loan?

324
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:09,654
Please entrust this matter to Taeil Accounting.

325
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:13,894
We'll take care of everything for you.

326
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:30,784
   

327
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,864
- Good morning. 
 -  Good morning. 

328
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:46,514
What I'm going to tell you is that Taeil Accounting will be...

329
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:50,304
taking charge of both selling and buying...

330
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:52,454
in the sell-off deal...

331
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:57,354
of Jisan Bank's bad debt.

332
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:19,864
To explain to our new staff who are here,

333
00:26:19,864 --> 00:26:22,714
we, the seller team, are completely on the selling side.

334
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,464
Our most important task is to calculate

335
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:28,574
the minimum selling price, which would be our dead minimum.

336
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:33,244
If you don't know the cost of the goods you're selling, it's the same as having wasted your business.

337
00:26:33,244 --> 00:26:38,164
The highest bidder among the buyers who called prices higher than the minimum price,

338
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:43,324
the cost of goods we decided on, will be selected.

339
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:48,894
What if all of the bidders' bid prices are lower than the minimum price we decide on?

340
00:26:48,894 --> 00:26:54,124
If such a thing happens, all the accountants here will have to resign.

341
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:56,234
In reality, such things don't happen.

342
00:26:56,234 --> 00:26:58,544
If a couple of buyers do that, it's one of two things:

343
00:26:58,544 --> 00:27:01,844
They don't know what they're doing or aren't interested in buying.

344
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:06,564
But it's unlikely for someone to enter an expensive auction without an interest in buying.

345
00:27:06,564 --> 00:27:11,454
Obviously, the cheaper the purchase, the greater our benefits as buyers.

346
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:14,194
Our only way to win is to

347
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:18,264
go slightly over the minimum selling price, but also bid even a penny

348
00:27:18,264 --> 00:27:21,294
higher price than other buyers.

349
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:25,444
Can't we ask the seller team directly about the minimum selling price?

350
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,954
We've got the seller team in the same firm.

351
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:30,954
I don't understand why we'd calculate the minimum selling price separately.

352
00:27:30,954 --> 00:27:32,564
That's impossible.

353
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:36,874
It's a strong regulation for the sake of fair auction.

354
00:27:36,874 --> 00:27:39,264
Unless you want to create unnecessary trouble...

355
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:43,694
it'll be good for you not to go near the seller team.

356
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:51,704
   

357
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:53,574
   

358
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:54,854
   

359
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:56,484
   

360
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:21,154
What do you mean you might not enter the bid, Chairman Lee?

361
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:24,834
I mean, I just had a second thought.

362
00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:29,244
I was trying to do M and A with People's Entertainment

363
00:28:29,244 --> 00:28:33,634
because I was worried my son would get arrested for embezzlement.

364
00:28:33,634 --> 00:28:36,314
But it was resolved thanks to you two.

365
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,384
So now I'm wondering why I would need to

366
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,454
buy that useless company at this point.

367
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:47,744
I'm not saying I'm not entering for sure.

368
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:51,844
I'm saying it's just making me wonder a little.

369
00:28:57,534 --> 00:29:00,714
You understand what I'm saying, right?

370
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:09,564
Whoa, now. I drank too much.

371
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:12,380
Hey, Vice President, I'm leaving!

372
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:16,304
Aigoo... let's go!

373
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:26,984
I've known him to be an angel in borrowing and a devil in repaying.

374
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:30,064
He said he'd sign once the purchase advisory request contract is finished.

375
00:29:30,064 --> 00:29:32,374
So I'll speed up the contract process as much as possible.

376
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:36,284
A mere base commission fee isn't much.

377
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:39,604
Successful remuneration is what becomes big money.

378
00:29:40,284 --> 00:29:42,174
Isn't that so?

379
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,384
I didn't even realize this...

380
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:51,474
and put in so much effort all along.

381
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:12,504
It's the buyers' list for Sangah Group. Please have the attorney in charge review it and give it to me.

382
00:30:12,504 --> 00:30:14,474
Wait, where do I–

383
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:26,604
It's the twelfth floor.

384
00:30:27,314 --> 00:30:29,924
We have in-house lawyers within our accounting firm,

385
00:30:29,924 --> 00:30:32,364
not a law firm elsewhere.

386
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:34,344
I see...

387
00:30:43,434 --> 00:30:46,024
Are you claustrophobic?

388
00:30:49,494 --> 00:30:51,344
What's the problem then?

389
00:30:51,344 --> 00:30:53,454
You're not looking too well.

390
00:30:57,794 --> 00:30:59,914
Do you think I'm a pervert or something?

391
00:30:59,914 --> 00:31:01,824
That's not it...

392
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:05,384
They said the buyer team shouldn't talk with the seller team.

393
00:31:05,384 --> 00:31:08,254
- Sorry? 
 - The thing is...

394
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:12,294
they said we couldn't share what the minimum selling price is.

395
00:31:12,294 --> 00:31:14,404
That it'll get me in trouble.

396
00:31:16,244 --> 00:31:20,264
What's your buyer team's bidding price?

397
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:23,804
How much do you plan to use at the auction?

398
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:26,084
Sorry?

399
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,914
You don't know, right?

400
00:31:29,484 --> 00:31:32,624
- I don't. 
 - I don't know the seller team's minimum selling price, either.

401
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,914
How would I know that?

402
00:31:34,914 --> 00:31:37,644
We need to know something to share that info and cause trouble.

403
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:39,504
Do you think just anyone can cause trouble?

404
00:31:39,504 --> 00:31:42,084
Only if you've got a position and power.

405
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:45,684
So come closer when I'm still telling you nicely.

406
00:31:55,534 --> 00:31:58,374
You don't need to go to this extent...

407
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:11,504
Oh, your document!

408
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:16,314
   

409
00:32:23,794 --> 00:32:26,084
Why? Is it strange?

410
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:29,134
To see a lawyer working at an accounting firm?

411
00:32:29,134 --> 00:32:31,454
Oh, n-no.

412
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:47,274
By chance, did you see a document on the floor?

413
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:48,894
No.

414
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,294
What do you mean the rights analysis document disappeared?

415
00:32:53,294 --> 00:32:55,144
I'm sorry.

416
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:56,934
I will try looking for it again.

417
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:59,924
Will you take responsibility if the lowest selling price ends up

418
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:02,634
 public, Ms. Jin Yeon Ah? 

419
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:14,754
What's this? Why is a buying team member loitering around the selling team's meeting room?

420
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:56,934
- Where's the contract that was reviewed? 
 - O-Oh, yes...

421
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:00,524
- Here you go. 
 - Please take care of this too.

422
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:02,644
By chance,

423
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:07,164
would it be advantageous to our team to get the selling team's info?

424
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:11,184
Of course. So we can estimate the lowest selling price.

425
00:34:11,184 --> 00:34:14,574
Just knowing that would give us a major advantage.

426
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:16,844
Why? Did you find something out?

427
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,264
No. I-I'm just asking.

428
00:34:22,154 --> 00:34:23,824
Please take care of that.

429
00:35:03,284 --> 00:35:07,464
I thought you were doing everything to get noticed by Shim Hyung Woo so why?

430
00:35:07,464 --> 00:35:09,204
It's the power of principles,

431
00:35:09,204 --> 00:35:12,944
of not killing someone else to save myself.

432
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:17,884
The real power is to get someone to do something by themselves without being told.

433
00:35:23,044 --> 00:35:26,524
The power to make someone take action on their own...

434
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:38,364
What's this?

435
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:42,934
Why is this here?

436
00:35:43,664 --> 00:35:46,474
I think Mr. Jang Ho Woo dropped it off earlier.

437
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:48,514
What do you mean?

438
00:35:51,104 --> 00:35:53,274
Elevator...

439
00:35:54,474 --> 00:35:57,094
But if he dropped it off, he should have told me!

440
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:59,134
I went through all that trouble looking for it.

441
00:35:59,134 --> 00:36:04,584
Any chance you would be grateful that he found it for you?

442
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:28,894
Mr. Jang Ho Woo.

443
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,634
The document from earlier...

444
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:36,444
Oh, that?

445
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,524
- I didn't take a look at it. 
 - Pardon?

446
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:44,044
Aren't you worrying I might have looked at the estimated sale price?

447
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:45,924
It's not that.

448
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:49,624
I just wanted to thank you. It was an important document.

449
00:36:50,904 --> 00:36:55,144
I wanted to bring it to you in the meeting room, but I was too busy so I couldn't go.

450
00:36:55,144 --> 00:37:00,184
No, I was waiting for you until now so I could thank you.

451
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,544
Finding it for me was enough.

452
00:37:04,924 --> 00:37:06,454
I'll buy you a meal next time.

453
00:37:06,454 --> 00:37:10,284
I know a place with really good soup and rice.

454
00:37:10,284 --> 00:37:12,184
Oh, okay.

455
00:37:12,184 --> 00:37:14,254
See you tomorrow, Ms. Yeon Ah.

456
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:22,744
   

457
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:27,884
What do you mean, come up with a new package of bad loans to sell with People's Entertainment?

458
00:37:27,884 --> 00:37:31,894
I know you have some bad loans that you've hidden away

459
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:36,774
hoping that they won't be found until after you retire.

460
00:37:36,774 --> 00:37:38,564
Gosh, Accountant.

461
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:40,184
Where would I have something like that?

462
00:37:40,184 --> 00:37:44,784
You should get rid of them all during this bad debt sale.

463
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:51,004
Gosh, I mean, you think that will work?

464
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:55,404
Taeil Accounting especially requested good products

465
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:57,964
because they need to successfully strike this deal.

466
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:02,724
I will take care of it for you, not Taeil Accounting,

467
00:38:02,724 --> 00:38:04,824
with a high price at that.

468
00:38:07,724 --> 00:38:10,504
Whatever the package, the buyer is set.

469
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:13,614
So you don't need to worry about closing the deal.

470
00:38:14,844 --> 00:38:17,374
Then what are your conditions for this, Accountant?

471
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:19,984
Only work with me from now on.

472
00:38:19,984 --> 00:38:24,794
I will essentially become Taeil Accounting to Jisan Bank.

473
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:33,384
How could you suddenly change the product without letting us know?

474
00:38:33,384 --> 00:38:35,614
Who would buy these garbage products?

475
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:38,144
How do you expect me to sell this?

476
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:42,774
   

477
00:38:42,774 --> 00:38:44,964
 Are you in your right mind? 

478
00:38:44,964 --> 00:38:49,384
I'm heartbroken from just that b*stard Kang Hyun messing up the M and A deal.

479
00:38:49,384 --> 00:38:53,464
And yet, you would mess up the bad debt sale as well?

480
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:56,054
It won't be ruined so don't worry.

481
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:58,834
Chairman Lee Chan Joo of Sangah Group will buy it, no matter what.

482
00:38:58,834 --> 00:39:02,284
Do you think Chairman Lee Chan Joo is crazy to buy such garbage?

483
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:04,584
Well, he may not want them for himself.

484
00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:08,584
But he'd hate them to fall into someone else's hands.

485
00:39:08,584 --> 00:39:11,384
No, it would be more accurate to say he'd be afraid.

486
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:15,654
Are you suggesting someone would threaten Chairman Lee Chan Joo with such garbage, or what?

487
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:16,764
The right to read ledgers.

488
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:19,634
What about the right to read ledgers–

489
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:27,114
Right to read ledgers...

490
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,714
Whoever buys the bad debt of People's Entertainment

491
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:33,244
will get the right to read all the ledgers,

492
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:36,800
such as its financial statements, whenever they want.

493
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:39,774
That ledger, a pandora's box containing

494
00:39:39,774 --> 00:39:44,064
the embarrassing secrets of Lee Bo Sung, the successor of Sangah Group...

495
00:39:44,064 --> 00:39:47,274
Who would want that ledger the most?

496
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:50,464
Continue.

497
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:54,854
Chairman Lee Chan Joo's younger brother, Lee Seong Joo,

498
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:57,494
despite being better than his older brother,

499
00:39:57,494 --> 00:40:00,594
he was chased out of Sangah Group.

500
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:02,564
The tragic...

501
00:40:03,254 --> 00:40:04,794
prince. 
    

502
00:40:04,794 --> 00:40:09,134
If it wasn't for you, Father, he might already be Chairman right now.

503
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:12,260
From Chairman Lee Seong Joo's view, it would seem unfair.

504
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:21,104
So are you saying you will step in

505
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:26,454
as Chairman Lee Seong Joo's representative for this sales deal?

506
00:40:26,454 --> 00:40:29,344
Don't you think there was a reason

507
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:33,164
he amassed wealth while being ridiculed as a loan shark?

508
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,464
Such as...

509
00:40:35,464 --> 00:40:38,954
wanting to regain the position that was taken away from him?

510
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:45,184
It appears the real product in this bad debt sales deal

511
00:40:45,184 --> 00:40:48,634
is the right to read People's Ent. ledgers.

512
00:40:51,184 --> 00:40:53,324
That's what it seems to me.

513
00:41:04,234 --> 00:41:05,754
The right to read ledgers?

514
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:09,484
If that was such a big deal, you should have told me sooner!

515
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:11,744
The right to read ledgers is not a big deal.

516
00:41:11,744 --> 00:41:15,774
It is an ordinary right for any shareholder who owns a certain percentage of shares.

517
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:18,804
Then are you saying that for something so trivial,

518
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:21,794
that b*stard Lee Seong Joo will turn this place upside down?

519
00:41:21,794 --> 00:41:26,464
Did your son cause any other trouble besides embezzlement and breach of trust?

520
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:29,824
I don't know. That's what is driving me crazy!

521
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:32,914
He's caused so much trouble here and there!

522
00:41:35,964 --> 00:41:38,134
You know how tenacious that b*stard Lee Seong Joo is.

523
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:41,174
You experienced it when we were chasing him out!

524
00:41:41,174 --> 00:41:44,664
But imagine that the ledger falls into his hands!

525
00:41:44,664 --> 00:41:48,174
My Bo Sung will die, I will die, and we'll all die!

526
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:52,044
No, no, no, no! We must stop this, no matter what!

527
00:41:57,134 --> 00:41:58,564
Buy it.

528
00:41:58,564 --> 00:42:00,884
Whether it's 10 billion or 100 billion won, buy it at all costs!

529
00:42:00,884 --> 00:42:05,134
No matter what, buy the ledger and bring it before my eyes!

530
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,284
Send Jang Ho Woo to your team?

531
00:42:36,284 --> 00:42:38,824
You heard me. Why ask again?

532
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:41,624
Tell Jang Ho Woo not to be late for tomorrow's meeting.

533
00:42:42,454 --> 00:42:44,064
Is that it?

534
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:48,194
Even if he's just a high school graduate accountant, you should at least explain why.

535
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:50,344
You weren't going to mentor him or use him properly.

536
00:42:50,344 --> 00:42:54,254
It doesn't matter if I take that high school graduate accountant.

537
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:58,654
I'll decide how to use Jang Ho Woo.

538
00:42:58,654 --> 00:43:02,084
I won't say it twice. Send Jang Ho Woo to me.

539
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:04,534
Don't make him turn into another you.

540
00:43:14,734 --> 00:43:17,034
 Why do you decide on your own where I would be situated? 

541
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:21,874
Should I go to your team if told to go, and come if told to come, Accountant Han?

542
00:43:21,874 --> 00:43:25,384
Do you not know what a salaried employee means yet?

543
00:43:25,384 --> 00:43:29,184
If you're trying to find out the proposed bidding price

544
00:43:29,184 --> 00:43:32,734
from Director Shim's buying team, don't even consider it.

545
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:36,664
With an accountant's honor on the line, I won't ever let that happen.

546
00:43:36,664 --> 00:43:38,974
Not because you don't know anything?

547
00:43:40,544 --> 00:43:42,154
I'm leaving.

548
00:43:44,904 --> 00:43:47,494
I have an appointment with an appraisal and assessment firm. I can't hang out longer.

549
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:50,024
I was there because I had a plan.

550
00:43:50,024 --> 00:43:52,434
There was something I needed to do.

551
00:43:58,974 --> 00:44:01,294
Why are you doing this to me?

552
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:04,384
Why do you keep getting involved in my plans?

553
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:08,214
If you stay there, you will get hurt.

554
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:13,224
But you have no strength to get back up on your own, or anyone to pick you up.

555
00:44:13,224 --> 00:44:16,984
If you fall, it will be the end of your plans and all else.

556
00:44:24,694 --> 00:44:26,274
What the...

557
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:30,524
What did you say he said?

558
00:44:30,524 --> 00:44:35,204
He says I have no strength to get back up on my own, or anyone to pick me up.

559
00:44:35,204 --> 00:44:39,594
This guy! Tell that crazy b*stard to clench his teeth and wait for me.

560
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:43,584
He dares mess with Ho Woo? Let him come. I'll give him a one, two!

561
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:46,284
- I'll hit him with an upper hook, bam! 
 - Hey!

562
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,464
Stop fooling around.

563
00:44:49,964 --> 00:44:54,344
I'll take care of it. I'll be prepared to die on the job tomorrow.

564
00:44:54,344 --> 00:44:57,514
I'll smash that motherf***er's head!

565
00:44:57,514 --> 00:45:00,404
I'm being serious right now.

566
00:45:05,124 --> 00:45:08,214
"If you stay there, you will get hurt."

567
00:45:08,214 --> 00:45:10,474
When he said that, it felt weird.

568
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:12,974
So he made your heart flutter?

569
00:45:12,974 --> 00:45:14,864
Gosh, seriously.

570
00:45:16,984 --> 00:45:22,884
Well, I almost felt like he was sincere.

571
00:45:22,884 --> 00:45:25,464
Oh. You can't afford to feel another man's sincerity recklessly.

572
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:28,154
Gosh, seriously! You guys...

573
00:45:28,154 --> 00:45:31,054
How could you guys be so useless?

574
00:45:31,054 --> 00:45:34,154
Didn't I tell you guys that tonight is a strategizing night?

575
00:45:35,604 --> 00:45:37,864
Did you draw up the confidentiality contract?

576
00:45:37,864 --> 00:45:39,824
Yes, here it is.

577
00:45:42,944 --> 00:45:44,084
What about the financing contract?

578
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:47,014
It will be done as soon as we get the proof of loan.

579
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:51,434
I think the lowest selling price will be at least 50 billion won

580
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:53,514
so for the bidding price...

581
00:45:56,794 --> 00:45:59,144
   

582
00:45:59,144 --> 00:46:01,650
   

583
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:04,924
Did you check the audit report of the depreciation assets?

584
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:06,824
Yes, I've checked it.

585
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:16,354
How is this? I think it looks okay.

586
00:46:18,434 --> 00:46:20,444
Yes, let's go with this.

587
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:23,674
Hey, Jang Ho Woo.

588
00:46:23,674 --> 00:46:25,174
Yes?

589
00:46:36,384 --> 00:46:37,924
You didn't write a bidding price on this, right?

590
00:46:37,924 --> 00:46:39,974
Yes. You said we'd write it at the location.

591
00:46:39,974 --> 00:46:44,254
Don't forget that lots of crazy things happen on bidding day. So be on your guard.

592
00:46:44,254 --> 00:46:45,674
Okay.

593
00:46:57,334 --> 00:46:59,714
I told you to be on your guard.

594
00:47:09,344 --> 00:47:10,944
Get ready.

595
00:47:41,814 --> 00:47:44,414
I guess they came out to greet us.

596
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:50,414
How many minutes do we have left?

597
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:52,194
Forty minutes.

598
00:49:17,364 --> 00:49:18,824
Hey, are you okay?

599
00:49:18,824 --> 00:49:21,584
Oh, yes, I'm okay.

600
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,714
And the proposal is fine too.

601
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:30,604
I guess there was one more car tailing us.

602
00:49:30,604 --> 00:49:34,004
It's the same model as the ones that were following us.

603
00:49:43,604 --> 00:49:46,224
Come out. I told you to come out!

604
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:49,814
Who sent you?

605
00:49:49,814 --> 00:49:51,764
I asked who sent you, you punk!

606
00:49:51,764 --> 00:49:54,624
Is it Vice President Han? Won't you speak?

607
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,364
- You're not going to speak? 
 - Sir, Sir...

608
00:49:56,364 --> 00:49:58,734
- Accountant– 
 - Let go, let go of me!

609
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:00,644
Calm down!

610
00:50:04,904 --> 00:50:06,714
This guy hit me first!

611
00:50:06,714 --> 00:50:08,884
You should stay where you are!

612
00:50:11,004 --> 00:50:12,894
Hey, Jang Ho Woo, we don't have any more time.

613
00:50:12,894 --> 00:50:15,204
You go ahead to Jisan Bank with the proposal.

614
00:50:15,204 --> 00:50:17,264
You know you have to submit it on time, right?

615
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,294
- Yes. 
 - Hurry and go.

616
00:50:34,914 --> 00:50:36,614
Hey, what is it?

617
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:42,254
What's wrong?

618
00:50:46,864 --> 00:50:49,244
The proposal disappeared.

619
00:50:59,484 --> 00:51:02,174
 

620
00:51:02,174 --> 00:51:06,454
What? The price isn't written on it?

621
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:11,294
Okay. Good job.

622
00:51:11,294 --> 00:51:12,974
All right.

623
00:51:12,974 --> 00:51:15,394
Let's hand it in now.

624
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:18,300
What about that side?

625
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,084
Come on. I said we should submit it.

626
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:24,014
We will soon wrap up the bid submissions.

627
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:30,194
Wait!

628
00:51:38,074 --> 00:51:42,664
This is SA Investment's bid proposal.

629
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,514
   

630
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:46,594
   

631
00:51:51,854 --> 00:51:54,104
There's no way...

632
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:06,494
   

633
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:18,920
   

634
00:52:23,294 --> 00:52:26,654
Gosh, even if you're a cop, how could you block the road like this?

635
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:28,464
Sir, I've received a report.

636
00:52:28,464 --> 00:52:33,934
If you keep acting like this, you may be penalized for violating Section 5 of the Road Traffic Act.

637
00:52:39,664 --> 00:52:41,684
Wrapping the situation for the fallen object report.

638
00:52:41,684 --> 00:52:44,744
 Fallen object? What kind of fallen object would be in our jurisdiction? 

639
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,684
 Who are you? 

640
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:49,494
I learned jurisdictions don't matter when it comes to preventing accidents.

641
00:52:51,344 --> 00:52:53,774
Hello.

642
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:58,714
There's nobody here by the name of Jang Ho Woo.

643
00:52:58,714 --> 00:53:02,054
- He'll be here soon. 
 - I'm right here!

644
00:53:03,154 --> 00:53:05,164
I am...

645
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:07,284
I am Jang Ho Woo.

646
00:53:07,284 --> 00:53:09,424
Yes, here you go.

647
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:29,034
Could you give us just five more minutes to discuss this?

648
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:40,814
The price we have written right now is already 10 billion more than the 60.1 billion won I originally proposed.

649
00:53:40,814 --> 00:53:43,744
If you raise the bid even higher, you will be buying it at a higher price

650
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:46,684
than the price you were trying to acquire People's Entertainment through M and A.

651
00:53:46,684 --> 00:53:49,264
I know! I know that, too,

652
00:53:49,264 --> 00:53:53,504
but when I just imagine the ledger falling into Lee Seong Joo's hands...

653
00:53:53,504 --> 00:53:57,554
What use is all this money if something goes wrong with my Bo Sung?

654
00:53:58,324 --> 00:54:00,854
Ninety billion. Let's play it safe and write ₩90 billion ($69 million)!

655
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:03,664
Chairman! Our current price is already high enough.

656
00:54:03,664 --> 00:54:05,614
We already have a high probability of getting the bid.

657
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:10,074
I don't need probability right now, but certainty!

658
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:11,744
Write it down.

659
00:54:15,354 --> 00:54:16,834
Geez, I'll do it.

660
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:25,254
   

661
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:28,994
   

662
00:54:33,154 --> 00:54:36,934
Do you think he can hear what you're saying to him?

663
00:54:37,634 --> 00:54:40,804
If he wants to run rampant, we should let him.

664
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:44,824
The higher the price Chairman Lee pays for it,

665
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:48,384
the greater our compensation would be for a successful bid

666
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:51,324
so we have nothing to lose.

667
00:54:52,514 --> 00:54:54,384
Don't you think so?

668
00:55:08,064 --> 00:55:12,944
I will announce the minimum selling price and the bid proposal prices.

669
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:18,334
The minimum selling price is 54.6 billion won. 
    

670
00:55:18,334 --> 00:55:19,544
What happened?

671
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:21,504
And bids above 54.6 billion won will be eligible to be successful.

672
00:55:21,504 --> 00:55:23,794
You said all sorts of crazy things happen on bidding day.

673
00:55:23,794 --> 00:55:25,524
That's why...

674
00:55:28,204 --> 00:55:33,334
First Investment Trust, 54.9 billion won.

675
00:55:34,614 --> 00:55:38,914
Sangah Group Holding Company, 90.1 billion won.

676
00:55:45,434 --> 00:55:49,464
And last of all, SA Investment,

677
00:55:51,174 --> 00:55:54,064
33 billion won.

678
00:56:04,284 --> 00:56:07,134
I declare that People's Entertainment's eight bad loans

679
00:56:07,134 --> 00:56:11,414
are sold to Sangah Group Holding Company.

680
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:31,444
 I'm Han Seung Jo of Taeil Accounting, Chairman Lee Seong Joo. 

681
00:56:31,444 --> 00:56:32,354
   

682
00:56:32,354 --> 00:56:36,784
 Someone just told me that real power is to get someone to act 

683
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:40,184
 on their own without pushing them. 

684
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:45,684
 The only person who can move Chairman Lee Chan Joo through only imagination and fear 

685
00:56:45,684 --> 00:56:48,484
 is you, Chairman Lee Seong Joo. 

686
00:56:49,924 --> 00:56:52,904
 So you want to borrow my name. 

687
00:56:52,904 --> 00:56:54,584
 Yes. 

688
00:56:54,584 --> 00:56:59,784
 I need the name "Lee Seong Joo of SA Investment." 

689
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:05,764
 All right. 

690
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:08,944
 Just return what you use back to where it was 

691
00:57:08,944 --> 00:57:12,734
 since everything naturally returns to its original position. 

692
00:57:12,734 --> 00:57:13,944
 Thank you. 

693
00:57:13,944 --> 00:57:17,244
 Well, I'm not interested in the entertainment company at all, 

694
00:57:17,244 --> 00:57:19,454
 but this is an interesting situation, 

695
00:57:19,454 --> 00:57:25,454
 especially the risk of the owner who uses the company funds 

696
00:57:25,454 --> 00:57:28,124
 for his own personal use. 

697
00:57:32,384 --> 00:57:34,394
 I hope you win. 

698
00:57:34,394 --> 00:57:38,634
 I will make sure to win by losing. 

699
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:48,204
When he mentioned 90.1 billion, I almost yelled.

700
00:57:58,334 --> 00:58:01,084
Congratulations on your successful bid.

701
00:58:02,184 --> 00:58:05,504
You would have won even if you had bid 60 billion instead of 90 billion won,

702
00:58:05,504 --> 00:58:08,534
but even your bidding is impressive since you're a chaebol.

703
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:10,584
I was quite moved.

704
00:58:34,574 --> 00:58:38,004
Knowing how to use the other person's weakness...

705
00:58:39,954 --> 00:58:42,404
That was quite well done.

706
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:44,544
It was a good call.

707
00:58:45,774 --> 00:58:49,474
That target will soon be you, Father.

708
00:58:50,804 --> 00:58:53,914
No, no.

709
00:58:53,914 --> 00:58:56,014
No.

710
00:58:57,294 --> 00:59:00,434
No matter what you say to me today,

711
00:59:00,434 --> 00:59:04,824
it will be difficult for you to screw up my good mood.

712
00:59:05,384 --> 00:59:10,684
Both as your father and as the Vice President of Taeil Accounting,

713
00:59:12,464 --> 00:59:15,134
I'm quite satisfied with you.

714
00:59:32,674 --> 00:59:34,604
Aigoo, Accountant.

715
00:59:37,164 --> 00:59:40,034
Is there an accountant from Taeil Accounting here?

716
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,844
Oh, yes, I am.

717
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:46,254
How do you handle business so cleanly?

718
00:59:46,254 --> 00:59:48,944
Accountant Han Seung Jo has always been famous for that.

719
00:59:48,944 --> 00:59:54,884
Accountant Han Seung Jo always points out what will ultimately be the conclusion so everyone likes it.

720
00:59:54,884 --> 00:59:59,114
If so, I've already experienced that during the Haebit Construction case.

721
00:59:59,114 --> 01:00:05,574
Honestly, there were lots of internal discussions if we should force Haebit Construction to close or not,

722
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:11,274
but Accountant Han here made the conclusion for us that Haebit Construction should close

723
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:15,354
so we had them liquidated right away!

724
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:24,384
 Watch carefully. See what these pieces of paper, written by accountants, can do from now on. 

725
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:45,640
- I'll get going. 
 - Yes.

726
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:51,540
Shall we get going?

727
01:00:56,524 --> 01:00:58,744
Why did you do that?

728
01:01:01,234 --> 01:01:02,884
Do what?

729
01:01:08,974 --> 01:01:11,094
Haebit Construction.

730
01:01:18,524 --> 01:01:23,614
What made you come to the decision to liquidate?

731
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:29,404
People's lives are not a joke

732
01:01:30,484 --> 01:01:32,644
so how could you?

733
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:55,160


734
01:02:08,744 --> 01:02:12,404
   

735
01:02:13,004 --> 01:02:16,634
 The fabricated Haebit Construction liquidation report that you put together... Where is it now? 

736
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:21,004
 I think Mr. Han Seung Jo should be in charge of this project, and I'll be the backup. 

737
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:22,334
 Where are the pages after this? 

738
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:24,744
 Do you want to see it? Then work on my team. 

739
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:26,384
 It's not about trusting and helping each other. 

740
01:02:26,384 --> 01:02:28,884
 It's a strategic alliance to achieve each of our own goals. 

741
01:02:28,884 --> 01:02:31,604
 It's more profitable to sell it than revive the company through workout. 

742
01:02:31,604 --> 01:02:33,004
 Is it fun to toy with people? 

743
01:02:33,004 --> 01:02:36,244
 Did someone pay you off in compensation for the liquidation? 

744
01:02:36,244 --> 01:02:38,744
 How much more must you sell off to be satisfied? 

745
01:02:38,744 --> 01:02:40,224
 You're that annoying punk! 

746
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,914
 You're causing the worst-case scenario for others. 

747
01:02:42,914 --> 01:02:48,684
 I won't let them live in peace as if nothing bad had happened. 

748
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:51,854
♫  Don't play  ♫

749
01:02:51,854 --> 01:02:54,750
♫  It's time for me to show my strength  ♫
