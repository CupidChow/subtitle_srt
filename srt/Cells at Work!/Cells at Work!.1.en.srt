1
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,161
The number of cells living
inside a human body

2
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,747
is approximately 37 trillion.

3
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,837
Each cell has their own role,
depending on their type.

4
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,716
For instance, red blood cells are tasked

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,301
with delivering oxygen.

6
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:56,848
White blood cells fight harmful
things that enter the body.

7
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,856
Every single cell helps another

8
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,484
to keep working every day,

9
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,653
and that's how humans stay alive.

10
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,956
WELCOME TO THE LUNGS
RIGHT LUNG - RIGHT WING

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,417
IMPROVEMENT WEEK
EXCHANGE CHEERFUL GREETINGS

12
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,174
VEIN ANGLE SQUARE

13
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,227
This

14
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,812
is the red bone marrow,

15
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,690
where blood cells are born
and spend their early days.

16
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,236
It is the blood cells' homeland.

17
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,622
Here, hematopoietic stem cells
produce progenitor cells

18
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,250
which will later be sorted by category.

19
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,173
In this place,

20
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,010
the young precursors mature
into cells called "erythroblasts."

21
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,720
It isn't a race, but do your best anyway.

22
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,430
Now of course

23
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,974
- let's try some practice deliveries.
- And they are nurtured by macrophages.

24
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:21,891
Okay!

25
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,228
Hurry, we have to go fast!

26
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,064
- Here you are.
- Thank you!

27
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,485
Huh?

28
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:34,612
Oh no...

29
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,410
Ms. Macrophage?

30
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,251
Hello...

31
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,296
How did you get all the way over here?

32
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,090
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my...

33
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,301
You know...

34
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,805
I always love to bully and destroy
all you little red cells!

35
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,809
Target sighted!

36
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,271
Not even a fully formed cell!

37
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,356
Are you capable of taking me on?

38
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,524
You're safe now.

39
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,820
I'll be the greatest white blood cell!

40
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,415
Poke.

41
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,584
Leave him alone!

42
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:30,877
You know...

43
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,171
there's little I hate more than

44
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,714
cocky cells!

45
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,842
Yaa-ha-ha-ha! Ahh-hah--!

46
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,266
You two are safe.

47
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,146
Oh thank goodness.

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,898
I've been so worried.

49
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,525
Ms. Macrophage

50
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,486
There, there.

51
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,238
Don't cry.

52
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,406
Come, let's get back to the others.

53
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,408
Congratulations

54
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,452
on your denucleation.

55
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,454
Today, all of you become

56
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,039
mature red blood cells.

57
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,291
You'll receive oxygen in the lungs

58
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,128
and deliver it to places
and cells around the body.

59
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,428
Well done on passing.

60
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,264
Remember not to get lost

61
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,016
and complete the missions you're assigned.

62
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,482
I will!

63
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,026
I'll become the greatest red blood cell.

64
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,622
Papa?

65
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,207
It's late.

66
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,375
Wake up!

67
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
Come on, seriously?

68
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:55,837
Papa!

69
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,380
You need to get up.

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,798
Papa, come on!

71
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,134
I said wake up!

72
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,678
Nasty.

73
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:05,930
C'mon!

74
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,598
Time for work! Let's go!

75
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,891
Wake up!

76
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,477
Good morning!

77
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,688
- What is that?
- Hm?

78
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,231
Oh, tofu scrambles.

79
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,776
- Less calories, it's healthy for you.
- I don't need healthy, though.

80
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,736
I just want eggs,

81
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,778
scrambled with--

82
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,990
Your blood pressure,
blood sugar, uric acid, cholesterol...

83
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,116
They're too high.

84
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,951
You can't keep hiding these things.

85
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,663
It says you need to work on your diet,
and get a re-examination.

86
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,081
I feel like I'm responsible.

87
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,499
- Ah!
- Look here:

88
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,917
"Positive fecal occult blood test"?

89
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,918
What is that?

90
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,420
- That seems really bad.
- Oh, that's not a big deal,

91
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,379
just a little

92
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:39,005
rear end issue.

93
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,007
This isn't funny, Dad.

94
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,717
You need to see a doctor.

95
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,093
Okay.

96
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,636
See you later!

97
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,067
I bring carbon dioxide to the lungs...

98
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,363
and then I get oxygen and deliver it
around the body where it's needed.

99
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,534
I've got this.

100
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,869
I've definitely got this.

101
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,039
Okay.

102
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,957
Wh-what?

103
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,042
What?!

104
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,418
Uhh...

105
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,214
- Hey, hey, move it, move it, move it!
- Oh, I'm sorry!

106
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,673
Watch where you're standing!

107
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:25,885
Oh,

108
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,261
there it is!

109
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,847
So this must be a vein entrance.

110
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,599
Okay.

111
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,850
Huh?

112
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,352
Hey, one-way traffic here!

113
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,937
Oh! I'm so sorry!

114
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,063
Huh?

115
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,356
One way?

116
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,441
Seriously?

117
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:44,779
Huh?

118
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,115
Quickly, go! Just go, get out of here!

119
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,493
Attack!

120
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:58,251
Find the redundant cells
and kill them all.

121
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,129
This place and its residents are ours now.

122
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:03,923
Get away!

123
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,515
There's too many, what do we do?!

124
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,545
You're safe now.

125
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,446
Well there you are. Oh my, you look tasty.

126
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,864
I could eat you up!

127
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,164
Neutrophil Division White
Blood Cell U-1146:

128
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,999
Invading germs exterminated.

129
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,836
Wait!

130
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,963
Thank you for saving me.

131
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,840
I was lucky you came when you did.

132
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,467
When I'm older,

133
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,718
and a little stronger,

134
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,469
I will

135
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,596
be a worthy red cell too.

136
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:34,847
I swear!

137
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,827
What do you want from me?

138
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,162
Oh, No, I...

139
00:08:58,913 --> 00:08:59,705
Many thanks, sir.

140
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,374
For saving my life again.

141
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,502
- Just doing my job, that's all.
- Okay! Bring 'em through!

142
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,672
- Coming through, coming through.
- How many we got back there?

143
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:08,673
Thank you.

144
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,550
Uh, sorry, I mean...

145
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,426
You are very welcome.

146
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,929
Oh... Okay!

147
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,559
I'll kill them all.

148
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,644
I'll kill every last one of them.

149
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,479
It's a white cell.

150
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,690
- Whoa, watch out.
- Those guys are ruthless!

151
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,400
I guess not.

152
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,492
Attention,

153
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,702
Helper T alarm raised.

154
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,454
We received word that pneumococcus is
on the run inside the blood stream.

155
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,414
Stay alert:

156
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,582
Killer T cells are deploying.

157
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,667
The helper T cell and killer T cells?

158
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,253
The Helper T cells.

159
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,255
Macrophages like myself

160
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,967
will alert them to viruses or
bacteria invading the body.

161
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,887
They form a battle plan and direct
the killer T cells to attack.

162
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,265
And the killer T cells:

163
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:04,478
These are reliable cells that directly
attack and defeat cells infected with

164
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,855
viruses or bacteria.

165
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:06,564
Hustle up!

166
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:07,940
Yes, sir!

167
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,318
Operational orders!

168
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,570
All targets are to be killed on sight.

169
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,947
Any wuss who lets a single invader go

170
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,866
gets the spleen, understood?

171
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,034
Yes, sir!

172
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,539
Those are the killer T cells
I heard about, then.

173
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,665
This isn't good.

174
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,792
We need to kill them before
they start dividing.

175
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,377
- Huh?
- Take care.

176
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,548
Any cells carrying nutrients like oxygen
are the infection's primary targets.

177
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,508
I was actually just on
my way to the lungs to...

178
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,635
If we let this thing free

179
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,137
it'll attack each organ and eventually

180
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,640
seize the advantage and
destroy the whole body.

181
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,058
The whole body...

182
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,518
Oh, wait a minute,
hang on, don't leave me here!

183
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,107
The lungs:

184
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,444
Their role is to take oxygen into the body

185
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,239
and release carbon dioxide
back into the air.

186
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,575
Here we are.

187
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:00,826
This is the lung.

188
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,411
Whoa,

189
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,829
look at this place!

190
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,708
Receptor has been triggered...

191
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,876
What is that thing?

192
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,878
It's a radar to detect intruders.

193
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,133
Where is it?

194
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,135
I know they're here... kill them all!

195
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,430
I guess a better design
was out of the question.

196
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,140
It's definitely near here.

197
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,685
- I'll sweep the area for stragglers.
- Oh--

198
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,435
okay!

199
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,729
I'm getting oxygen so I'll see you.

200
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,855
That leads to the bronchi.

201
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,857
Ah...

202
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,236
How embarrassing.

203
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,575
Kind of a klutzy one...

204
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,750
Finally here!

205
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,585
The alveoli:

206
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,672
Where oxygen and carbon
dioxide are exchanged

207
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,966
between the air and capillaries.

208
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,050
Let's see...

209
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,010
this is where gases are exchanged.

210
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,266
Huh?

211
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,489
WHEN EXCHANGING
CARBON DIOXIDE AND OXYGEN

212
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,533
DON'T RUSH - TAKE YOUR TIME
DO IT WITH CARE

213
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,496
I should thank you!

214
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,416
Couldn't make the journey
without your help.

215
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,042
This is

216
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:38,299
such a nice place to ambush unsuspecting
little red cells.

217
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,594
Might as well have a little snack!

218
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,263
I'm gonna eat ya!

219
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:50,811
Huh?

220
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,689
Mr. White Cell?

221
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,984
The moment you walked away,
the receptor went silent.

222
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,944
I wasn't completely sure, though.

223
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,613
Didn't think you hiding in the CO2.

224
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,907
How'd you get in here?

225
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,116
Should've studied more.

226
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,826
All white cells

227
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,455
can "migrate," so we can travel through
the walls of blood vessels to reach

228
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,539
our enemies.

229
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,918
I came all this way,
you're not gonna kill me now!

230
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,171
We're running.

231
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,005
Wha?

232
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,674
Where you going??

233
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,431
Come here!

234
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:36,065
Scamper all you like,
but I got you cornered.

235
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,068
- You wimpy little cells!
- Hey, red cell,

236
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,319
step back a little more.

237
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,111
Okay...

238
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,823
You're looking scared there, white cell.

239
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,616
Giving up already?

240
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,869
Hope you're both ready to meet your end.

241
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,162
Now die!

242
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,582
Huh?

243
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,626
The end has come for you instead.

244
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,463
Whoa...

245
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,257
Whoa, whoa, what the--? What're you doing?

246
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,175
- Bacterium successfully captured.
- Let me out! What he hell is this?!

247
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,134
How do...?

248
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,678
- Let me out, come on!
- Now commencing germ removal process.

249
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,679
No! No, not that!

250
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,138
- This is no joke!
- So...

251
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,640
Let me outta here! Can you
hear me?! Hey, let me out!

252
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,933
Little break sound good?

253
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,143
Hey! What are you doing to me?
! Let me out!

254
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,103
Wouldn't fight it.

255
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,730
That capsule is unbreakable from inside.

256
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,524
That's a bronchus you're riding in.

257
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,610
- Do you know what that means for you?
- I don't know! I want out!

258
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,153
Where are you going?!

259
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,322
Lemme out, c'mon! Wait a second!

260
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,740
Hey! Don't you--

261
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,033
Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait...

262
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:28,868
- Easy now, easy!
- Want something to drink?

263
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,369
- No-no-no-no--
- Um, sure...

264
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,912
No-no, what is this?!

265
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,913
You! Hey!

266
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,915
Let me down, let me down! Oh no.

267
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,959
Where is it gonna get taken now?

268
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,294
- Well, like I said:
- Agh!

269
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,295
Watch out!

270
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,629
- Put me down!
- This area's the bronchi.

271
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,714
Where are you taking me?!

272
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,339
Let me down!

273
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,050
Whoa-whoa-whoa, this doesn't look-

274
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,063
What is this? Hey!

275
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,148
SNEEZE 1

276
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,862
Sneeze Number One?

277
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,614
Commencing with countdown.

278
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,159
Three... two... one... zero.

279
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,583
No, no...
hey, hey, hey, whoa, hey, whoa, stop!

280
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,517
Bye-bye, bacterium.

281
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,967
CELLS AT WORK!

282
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,729
Arata, good morning.

283
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,273
- How are you doing?
- Oh, hey Niko.

284
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,400
Good morning...

285
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,401
You have a test, right?

286
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,235
Um, yes.

287
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,487
- Rooting for you.
- Thanks.

288
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,279
See ya.

289
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,701
Let's go, let's go!

290
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,994
Adrenaline surge

291
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,328
let's go!

292
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,374
It's going haywire!

293
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,335
- Dopamine!
- Huh?

294
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,253
- Endorphines!
- What the...

295
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,547
Let them all flow!

296
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,385
Turn! It! Up!

297
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,262
Alright! Alright! Get hype! C'mon!

298
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,473
We lost control!

299
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,274
Adrenaline! Let's dance, get hype!

300
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,650
Let's goooo!

301
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,407
Jump! Jump! Jump!

302
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,534
Losing control!

303
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:19,621
Hey!

304
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,963
Oh! Are you okay, Niko?

305
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,006
Ah-

306
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,591
- I'm okay...
- Are you hurt?

307
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,675
That looks ouchie...

308
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,059
What?

309
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,520
Mr. White Blood Cell!

310
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,314
You. We meet again.

311
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,066
What's going on here?!

312
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,025
What it looks like.

313
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:52,529
The outer walls of the blood vessels are
being impacted and destroyed from outside,

314
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,906
causing the blood to flow out.

315
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,240
This is bad...

316
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,533
It's an ouchie!

317
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,038
An ouchie?

318
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,125
If you fall into that wound,
there's no coming back to this world.

319
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,628
What? So it's really not good!

320
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,670
And that's not all.

321
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,214
We could get invaded

322
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,466
unless we get to the wound to close it up.

323
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,343
So what are we gonna do?

324
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,469
Nothing to worry about.

325
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,555
In situations like these
we call the professionals.

326
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,390
They should get here in no time.

327
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,938
- They're up there.
- Who are those kids?

328
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,566
- Slowly. Slowly.
- Slowly. Slowly.

329
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,694
- Look out for the stairs! Be careful!
- Slowly. Slowly.

330
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,321
Platelets, good to see you.

331
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,781
Greetings, teammates!

332
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,908
Greetings, teammates!

333
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,536
The platelet:

334
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,372
They are specialized
blood cell components.

335
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,917
When blood vessels are damaged,
they gather to close wounds,

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,918
and stop bleeding.

337
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,629
- Are we all ready?
- Yeah!

338
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:55,008
- Everybody's fibrin is ready to go?
- Ready to go!

339
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,676
Okay!

340
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,094
Let's go!

341
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,887
- 'Kay!
- Let us through please!

342
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,721
Oh, sorry...

343
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:04,768
Okay!

344
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,939
Now we'll connect our fibrin
with the quackulation factors.

345
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,065
'Kay!

346
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,446
Hold on, everyone!

347
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,364
'Kay!

348
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,325
Are you ready?

349
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,952
One, two...

350
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,162
Heave ho!

351
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,630
Blood clotting:

352
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,968
Proteins in the blood called coagulation
factors are activated,

353
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,472
and a mesh-like membrane called fibrin
covers the injury as it solidifies.

354
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,683
Blood clot's done!

355
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,476
Yay! Hooray!

356
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,854
They're so great,

357
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,688
aren't they?

358
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,524
Oh?

359
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:53,734
Mr. White Cell?

360
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,821
- Okay, everybody can go ahead now!
- Okay, everybody can go ahead now!

361
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,286
Mr. White Blood Cell!

362
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,664
Mr. White Cell?

363
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,584
Are you okay?!

364
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,337
'Kay, you too, miss!

365
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:15,547
Huh?

366
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,758
Oh, I'm sorry!

367
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:19,551
Huh?

368
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,053
What?

369
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,012
Are we stuck here?

370
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,056
When there's a hole in a blood vessel,

371
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,642
we all need to help seal the
injury until it's repaired.

372
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,770
The platelets form the
primary hemostatic plug.

373
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,480
Now this

374
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,523
- is the secondary one.
- Really?

375
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,275
How much longer will we be stuck here?

376
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,318
Hard to say.

377
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,529
We stay until it dries up
and the scab is formed.

378
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,374
Hey Boss!

379
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,209
Thank you again for dinner last night.

380
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,168
Look at you.

381
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,003
Niko-chan's making lunch for you, then.

382
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,672
She says I need to eat healthier,

383
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,756
she makes me eat less, too.

384
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,801
Aw man, you got a good daughter.
At home, mine won't even talk to me.

385
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,718
Really?

386
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,678
Oh!

387
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,513
- That's good to go!
- Huh?

388
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,265
- You're having that too?
- This little lunch box is

389
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,307
just not cutting it, Boss.

390
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,686
You're really wasting her effort in
trying to help you get healthier.

391
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,230
Hey boss, Wanna hit the bar tonight?

392
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,690
We were just there last night.

393
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,983
He's a lush, huh?

394
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,442
You been drinking every day?

395
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,708
A carbon monoxide warning has been issued.

396
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,961
A toxic substance has entered
into the bloodstream.

397
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,298
All cells should take extra
precautions when going out.

398
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,007
Wha?!

399
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,550
- Run!
- Here, here, here, here!

400
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,634
Exhaustion build-up.

401
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,428
Over-eating and drinking.

402
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,221
Sleep deprivation.

403
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,140
This body, right now,

404
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,267
is under extreme stress!

405
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,602
Starved of oxygen!

406
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:54,604
But never give up!

407
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,357
Keep carrying that oxygen!

408
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,318
You cells!

409
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,528
Keep on going!

410
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:02,988
Yes, sir!

411
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,241
Aortic valve is open!

412
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,413
SEVEN BACTERIA
GIVE ME OXYGEN IF YOU PITY ME

413
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,543
Hey wait!

414
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:17,586
You there, red cell.

415
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,755
- We're not getting enough oxygen!
- Ah' I'm sorry!

416
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,550
I think we got orders from up top to
prioritize delivery to main organs.

417
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,719
Marginal cells are supposed to just die?!

418
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,054
I'm very sorry, ma'am!

419
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,889
- We just get our orders and--
- Let's go!

420
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,098
Wait a minute!

421
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,433
I wasn't done talking to you!

422
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,686
- Hey!
- Don't apologize for everything.

423
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,147
And you better get used to their whining, newbie.

424
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,190
Right...

425
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,316
Hey, you! Red blood cells!

426
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,276
You two quit slacking and get on it!

427
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,528
Sorry, sir, we're going as fast as we can!

428
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,950
Moron! What the hell!?

429
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,661
Now you got me
apologizing like an idiot, new cell.

430
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,455
Um, right... sorry 'bout that.

431
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,791
Whoa!

432
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,167
Watch your step.

433
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,212
- Who's dumping all this trash back here?
- Come on. Hurry up!

434
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,422
Quick! Let's go.

435
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,256
LDL?

436
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,467
Illegal dumping of cholesterol!

437
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,636
If we get more of these,

438
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,471
we might have heart disease in our future.

439
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,181
This way!

440
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,684
FROZEN SHOULDER - OLD PERSON SMELL

441
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,229
Agh! What is this?!

442
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,689
Alright, relax!

443
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,483
This is alcohol.

444
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,651
Alcohol?

445
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,277
- Not bad tonight.
- Oh, man!

446
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,072
- That hits the spot!
- It's pretty good, pretty good.

447
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,698
Ah, liver steak and um, guts!

448
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,409
Man, this sucks...

449
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,910
We gotta move outta here.

450
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,664
We'll be transporting alcohol
all over the body if we--

451
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,292
It's true...

452
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:40,919
It tastes like alcohol...

453
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:42,796
Uh oh.

454
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,715
- I'm kinda... feeling a little dizzy...
- Watch out, hey.

455
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,343
I'l show you how to release it.

456
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,681
The liver:

457
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:58,186
The body's chemical factory - an organ
with a variety of functions - such

458
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,731
as substance synthesis,
excretion and detoxification.

459
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,233
That was brutal, huh?

460
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,152
Here man, have a drink.

461
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,154
Okay...

462
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,239
Uh...

463
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,949
- What's this?
- Alcohol is broken down with--

464
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,576
The ADH enzyme.

465
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,661
The ADH enzyme...?

466
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,288
Sometimes...

467
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,499
when there's an alcohol build-up
that you need to release,

468
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,585
The hepatocytes will help you with that.

469
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,589
What's wrong?

470
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,300
You're not here to sulk,
come on, have some fun.

471
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,385
If you really want...

472
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,554
I could help you drink it?

473
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,265
This body isn't...

474
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,350
in top condition, is it?

475
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,978
We can hardly even walk through
the blood vessels...

476
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,814
They make us hit the oxygen supply quotas,

477
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,692
and the higher-ups don't
care about us at all.

478
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:51,406
We have to stand up against this
exploitative work environment.

479
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,328
He expired.

480
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,621
What?

481
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,331
We all end up like that;

482
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,124
food for the Kupffer cells.

483
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,418
Consumed and then recycled.

484
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,558
This is our cycle of life.

485
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,521
We only exist to keep delivering
oxygen until we die.

486
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,898
That can't be!

487
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,483
But you'll be okay!

488
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,818
I'll be there to help you out!

489
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,487
If anything happens, then I'll-

490
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,364
After all our hard work...

491
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,783
we just... end up like that?

492
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,035
I'm not gonna take it!

493
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:38,870
Hey!

494
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,081
Newbie!

495
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,666
You can't blame the kid.

496
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,335
Unless this body changes,

497
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,462
our environment will never change.

498
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,881
It'll stay abusive forever...

499
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,676
I wonder who really is the one at fault.

500
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:58,890
♪ Until two hours ago
♪It was just Tomoko alone

501
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,519
Ridiculous... Mm... Mm...

502
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,857
Thank you again for today.

503
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,403
If you feel like it, how about
we go somewhere together sometime?

504
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,779
- What the...
- What is he doing?

505
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:14,906
No, no, no.

506
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,242
He's gonna think this is creepy, though.

507
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,243
Maybe, maybe...

508
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:23,623
Ah--!

509
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,166
I-- Oh shoot...

510
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,336
READ

511
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,590
I'm so done.

512
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,431
- Okay.
- What?

513
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:40,890
It's okay?

514
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,017
Uh...

515
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,519
Thank you so much!

516
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,316
When?

517
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,525
When?

518
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,111
Uh... er...

519
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:54,946
so...

520
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,657
How 'bout Sunday next week?

521
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,412
Sounds good.

522
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:03,872
Yes!

523
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,251
Senpai is going on a date with me.

524
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,507
Why's it...

525
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,216
so cold?

526
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,471
Hmm?

527
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,974
- Feels hot...?
- Ugh, so hot...

528
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,395
Huh?

529
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,272
This isn't right...

530
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,401
Man, I went the wrong way again...

531
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,782
When I'm older,

532
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,077
I will be a worthy red cell too.

533
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,286
I swear!

534
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:49,876
Okay.

535
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,050
Hi, excuse me.
I'm trying to get to the kidney?

536
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,094
Ah!

537
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,390
Too close!

538
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,784
Your arc is too wide.

539
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,621
That's good!

540
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,790
What do you think?

541
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,209
The front-line white blood cell is strong, huh?

542
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,920
Work hard and you'll be as good as him.

543
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,922
You jerk!

544
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,762
You got some guts there, kid.

545
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,683
Mister!

546
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:52,355
Someday I'll grow into a white blood
cell as strong as you are, sir!

547
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,203
- I'll be waiting.
- Thank you... mister.

548
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,793
You know,
that kid's a little bit like you were.

549
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,265
This is Macrophage.

550
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,435
Influenza B viruses are currently
invading the body.

551
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,352
Roger.

552
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,022
Killer T cells are being dispatched.

553
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:40,278
Viruses like influenza B multiply much
faster than bacteria, so stay alert!

554
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,446
Yes, sir!

555
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,405
Killer T,

556
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,573
good to see you here.

557
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:47,285
Nothing at all to worry about now that
we're here to save the day! Let's go!

558
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,203
Yes, sir!

559
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,460
What the...

560
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:56,711
You're late.

561
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,805
NK, you punk...

562
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,058
You always gotta go over our
heads and take credit, don't you?!

563
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,184
Keep it civil--

564
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:11,976
Ah-

565
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,394
Don't act so tough, Killer T.

566
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,773
You need Helper T's commands
to take any action, don't you?

567
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,733
Lymphoblasts are stronger.

568
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,776
What the hell did you say?!

569
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,070
Too weak to enter the fight alone.

570
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,988
I, on the other hand,

571
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:28,117
I can move around freely inside
the body all by myself.

572
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:29,786
Unlike you,

573
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,913
I'm born to kill diseased cells.

574
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,540
A Natural Killer.

575
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,750
The strongest white blood cell.

576
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,210
Yeah, natural, my ass, NK.

577
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,922
Natural narcissist would be
a more accurate description.

578
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,132
Repeat that for me?

579
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,300
This is no time to fight.

580
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,844
More of them.

581
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,053
Coming this way.

582
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,103
Move.

583
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,564
I can handle these on my own.

584
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,325
Well now,
we can't let her take all the credit,

585
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,285
can we, boys?

586
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,411
Let's go!

587
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,287
Yes, sir!

588
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,746
Stay here, Red.

589
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,914
This'll be dangerous

590
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,292
Okay...

591
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,929
- Ready!
- Yes, sir!

592
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,033
You're just in the way, get going!

593
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,200
I- I'm sorry.

594
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,017
I had no idea there was a place
like this in the body.

595
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:20,813
Here in the nasal cavity,
one liter of mucus springs every day.

596
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,358
Then it becomes snot

597
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,068
gets rid of mold

598
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,362
infections, dust and dirt.

599
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,574
It's really nice...

600
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,536
What's wrong?

601
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,039
Huh?

602
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,999
You've just been staring at the ground.

603
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,630
I guess...

604
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,465
I've been jealous.

605
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,969
You do all these different things,

606
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,639
working hard to protect this body
with the other white blood cells.

607
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,349
And you're awesome.

608
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,602
But all I do

609
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,523
is take oxygen from one organ to another.

610
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,025
But I mess up with that too.

611
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,030
Red blood cells have one task
and I still can't do it.

612
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,700
That isn't true.

613
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:21,374
We white cells do patrol
the body and find enemies,

614
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,794
but macrophages gather information
on the enemy.

615
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,673
That allows helper T cells to give orders,

616
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,553
then killer T cells join us and
we all defeat the enemy together.

617
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,890
We all take pride in the
jobs that we do here.

618
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,643
And so should you, Red.

619
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,188
You allow us to fight.

620
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,026
The body needs you red blood
cells to deliver your oxygen.

621
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,945
We're all teammates here

622
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,574
working together to sustain this body.

623
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,577
So...

624
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,247
don't worry, you're doing a good job.

625
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,463
Huh?

626
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:13,718
Thank you very much.

627
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,431
Well...

628
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:20,975
You're welcome, of course...

629
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,620
Senpai!

630
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:41,913
Good morning!

631
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,040
- Hey Niko!
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

632
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,541
Mm-mm. Shall we go?

633
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,335
Sure!

634
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,421
Are you feeling okay now?

635
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,672
I heard you had the flu.

636
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,381
Ah,

637
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,925
I'm feeling a lot better.

638
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:54,884
Fully restored.

639
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,885
That's good.

640
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,011
Yeah!

641
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,305
We've got a first date!

642
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,723
Love is in the air!

643
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:01,974
Everybody get hype!

644
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:02,934
Let's go!

645
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,644
- Delicious.
- Of course.

646
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,104
It's just so good.

647
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,647
- Oh, oh, really?
- This corn's tasty.

648
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,731
Niko's dating, is she?

649
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,526
- She's growing up, huh?
- Well, hopefully he's not weird.

650
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,069
- I gotta head out.
- You weren't scheduled,

651
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,654
- so thanks for coming in.
- Oh boy!

652
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,030
- Thanks!
- Yeah, take care.

653
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:20,785
Yeeeah-

654
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,372
hooo! pew pew-pew-pew-pew! Yeah!

655
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,418
Love is in the air! Turn up!

656
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,045
Yeah!

657
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,881
- Whoa!
- All right, make some noise!

658
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,633
Go! Go! Go! Go!

659
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,177
Everybody jump! Hey! Hey!

660
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,555
Come on!

661
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:44,475
Wooo!

662
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,395
Lovey-dovey love dance!

663
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,148
Super-soaked love dance!

664
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,109
Everybody, get hype and dance!

665
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,196
It's beautiful.

666
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,823
So sparkly.

667
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,660
I haven't been here in so long.

668
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:03,995
Oh yeah?

669
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,413
Yeah.

670
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,375
When I was a kid,

671
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,544
during school vacations,

672
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,588
mom would take us here a lot.

673
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,631
So I always liked the aquarium.

674
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,800
You're a little too old for that now, huh?

675
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,553
Well, I would if I still could.

676
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:23,931
She died, though...

677
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,100
when I was nine years old,

678
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,351
illness.

679
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,730
I had no idea...

680
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,065
So...

681
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,943
is that why you're aiming for med school?

682
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,028
Yeah.

683
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,363
Oh...

684
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,032
Actually, this scarf...

685
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,910
Mom was in the hospital
when she started this.

686
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,995
She had to stop halfway through...

687
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,790
Here. Look.

688
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,377
The stitches are looser
and uneven starting here.

689
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,380
You see, dad...

690
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,425
wanted this gift from my mom to
be completed no matter what,

691
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,594
so he knitted the rest of it.

692
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,223
I like it a lot.

693
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,523
You're so grown up compared to me.

694
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,318
Not really, no.

695
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,537
<i>I will never lose
I will never bend</i>

696
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:34,710
If my will was stronger
Than anyone else's then I-

697
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,836
Ah!

698
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:40,716
Uh-oh...

699
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,927
Listen men, don't fear death!

700
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,055
We're the strongest muscle
because we act as one.

701
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,724
Until we hear from up top,
you keep it tight!

702
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,768
Not one leak!

703
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,647
Don't give ground to those
internal sphincters!

704
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,316
- You give this battle your all!
- Let us out!

705
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,526
Take pride in today!

706
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,777
- We can't take it!
- You don't move for anyone!

707
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,696
- The strain, it's just too much!
- Not a poo gets through!

708
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,363
No!

709
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:03,739
- Oh no, I'm slipping...
- Hey!

710
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,325
You all will stand and hold
with all your strength!

711
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,077
- Yes sir!
- Excuse me, guys...

712
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,078
Hold firm, men!

713
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,413
- Um.
- I know you boys can pull this through!

714
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,622
I brought oxygen for you.

715
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,248
Yes sir!

716
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,791
So where...!

717
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,961
- Set it down in here.
- This is the final stand!

718
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,088
- Don't give in to the pressure!
- You're in a danger zone!

719
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,006
What?

720
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,215
Rookie...

721
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,800
- I can't stand by and watch you die.
- So let's go!

722
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,718
Let's GO!

723
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,845
- Last time was a real "this place" show.
- Yeah!

724
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,097
I remember the timing could
not have been worse...

725
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,141
- we lost good men that day.
- Hold the line, muscles of the hole

726
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,100
Senpai?

727
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,020
- Are you okay?
- Act as one, and don't lose control!

728
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,938
Yeah. We're headed to the gonads next.

729
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,899
- We should hurry.
- Hold it till the cortex says to go!

730
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,526
Seriously?

731
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,695
What did I do to deserve this again?

732
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,072
Newbie... Bad news...

733
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,782
Rectal pressure is increasing!

734
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,243
Now entering dump mode!

735
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,203
- Dump mode...?
- Alright, clear the way!

736
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:53,914
It's beginning...

737
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,875
it's gonna evacuate!

738
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,209
- What is that?
- Let us out!

739
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,085
Let us out!

740
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,879
Let us out!

741
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,838
Let us out!

742
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,590
Let us out!

743
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,307
TO MAKINOUCHI REST AREA
CROWDED

744
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,434
Hold it...

745
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,269
Hold it...

746
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,313
We're in the blast zone, rookie!

747
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,147
We gotta run!

748
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,648
Red alert!

749
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,816
Red alert!

750
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,944
Block defecation immediately!
Repeat, block defecation immediately!

751
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:24,945
Close the anus!

752
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,531
Shit! Let's go! Rookie!

753
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,200
What are they all doing?!

754
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,370
The brain sent an order down,
no evacuation yet!

755
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:41,337
Senpai!

756
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,089
Come on, please--

757
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:52,306
- ♪I will never lose ♪I will never bend
- That's right... I won't lose or bend! Huh?

758
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,770
Oh no, are you kidding?!

759
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,408
Don't let out even a single drop!

760
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,454
Oh god, please...

761
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:16,914
Oh, please...

762
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,462
SAY NO TO HOLDING!
VIOLATION OF POO'S RIGHTS!

763
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,797
LET US OUT!
WE CAN'T WAIT!

764
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,756
That stench...

765
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,925
It's so bad... what's the body been eating

766
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,176
to make it smell like that?!

767
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,595
Push harder, come on!

768
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,721
They're starting!

769
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,772
, Thank--

770
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,607
I... thank you...

771
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,984
What are they doing?!

772
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,988
- The brain said we can't let them out!
- It's the internal sphincters! Get back!

773
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,406
Hurry, let them through!

774
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,576
- Why are you keeping them back?!
- Neural signals don't get to those guys.

775
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,578
They're simple muscles with just one job:

776
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,913
push feces out when it gets to the rectum.

777
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,874
They're idiots!

778
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,135
This is bad...

779
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,345
If this keeps going,
they'll break through!

780
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,139
Hold this position, rookie

781
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,099
or we'll be flushed
right out with the waste!

782
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:17,766
GO!

783
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:18,976
Push them back now!

784
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,991
Help us!

785
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,326
Wh- where are they going?

786
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,577
Wait.

787
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,954
- Was there a leak?
- No, but it's bad:

788
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,539
anal fissure.

789
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,045
And it's bleeding?!

790
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,214
It hurts...

791
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,051
Just how much is this body
going to make us suffer?!

792
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,228
Go ahead.

793
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,358
Oof...

794
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,943
Almost...

795
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,369
Oh no...

796
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,473
Thank you...

797
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,683
Hang on!

798
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,017
I...

799
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,270
- can't take it...
- Stay strong!

800
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,312
Newbie!

801
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,109
Ah!

802
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,527
Please-!

803
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,657
Gate opening!

804
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,953
- Gate opening!
- Open the anus!

805
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,430
Newbie!

806
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,389
Senpai!

807
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,400
Are you okay there? Newbie?

808
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:33,402
Yeah...

809
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:34,903
I swore to you.

810
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,239
That, "if anything at all happens to you,

811
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,949
I'll be there to save you."

812
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,326
Senpai...

813
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,621
Let's get out of this awful place.

814
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,206
We need to hurry to the
next stop on the route.

815
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,876
All right, next stop...

816
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,461
gonads.

817
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,718
Round two...

818
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,554
There's a second surge!

819
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,434
Open it up again!

820
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,483
- Senpai...
- Don't let me go...

821
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:13,984
Hold on!

822
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,278
- Don't you ever let me go!
- I won't!

823
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,405
Let them flow, let them flow!

824
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,991
- Let them flow!
- Listen, Rookie!

825
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:22,951
I'm gonna see you...

826
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,120
at the gonads!

827
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,292
Senpai!

828
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,337
Newbie!

829
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,219
I won...

830
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,522
I guess it's kinda cringey.

831
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:52,981
Ah,

832
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,191
uh, thank you...

833
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,526
for everything today...

834
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,152
Thanks to you too.

835
00:44:58,904 --> 00:44:59,697
Senpai?

836
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,073
Hm?

837
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,908
Uh, d-...

838
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,911
I really...

839
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,416
I...

840
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:11,542
I really

841
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,043
had a lot of fun today.

842
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:13,961
I really

843
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,963
I really appreciate it! Uh,

844
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:16,755
so, I'll

845
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:17,506
see you

846
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,257
at school.

847
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,140
Niko!

848
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,352
Will you...

849
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,148
Will you go out with me?

850
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:36,900
Huh?

851
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,321
Yes! I'd...

852
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,073
I'd really love that!

853
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:46,744
You're serious?

854
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:49,955
Heck yeah!

855
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,708
Thank you!

856
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,752
This is so great!

857
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,713
Thank you.

858
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:58,839
Um...

859
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:00,591
- I...
- I--

860
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:01,258
It-- it's

861
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:01,759
my pleasure.

862
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,302
It's my pleasure as well.

863
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,556
Oh. Excuse me for a moment.

864
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,266
Oh, sure.

865
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,602
Hello?

866
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,107
Where?

867
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:23,572
Papa!

868
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:24,865
Whoa! What is it?

869
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,159
Your boss told me you collapsed
in the bathroom.

870
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,410
Pretty crazy, Niko.

871
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:29,995
I was in the toilet,

872
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:30,954
got real dizzy,

873
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,915
and then apparently fainted.

874
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,708
I got scolded by a doctor who said

875
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,251
I neglect my health.

876
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,253
What? Neglect...?

877
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,088
- You still hadn't gone?
- Guess not.

878
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,757
Come on dad, listen to you!

879
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,676
Why can't you put a little
care into your own health?

880
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,011
Okay...

881
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:47,513
I will.

882
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,851
'Scuse me.

883
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,603
You Niko's boyfriend?

884
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,064
Ah- here.

885
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:07,783
Sorry, honey.

886
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,993
I'll go to sleep soon, okay?

887
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,338
Are you okay?

888
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,181
Oh.

889
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,016
Here.

890
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,270
This turned up in your father's truck.

891
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,356
I heard

892
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,483
he's always telling his coworkers

893
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,361
how you make him a proud father.

894
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,031
He said that,
"Unlike her good for nothing dad,

895
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,992
she's smart, she's going to med school."

896
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,871
"I'll need more money for her tuition,
so please give me more work."

897
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,541
I heard that's what he asked his boss.

898
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,588
That's why he went in
today on his day off.

899
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:25,652
Let's chat.

900
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,198
It's been 14 days since you
were born as blood cells.

901
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,702
While your peers have matured
into myelocites,

902
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,787
you two seem to have
stopped as myeloblasts

903
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:36,955
and haven't grown at all.

904
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,498
Huh?

905
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,251
At this rate,
the ability to differentiate will be lost.

906
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,337
The body won't see you as abnormal,

907
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,881
and cells like you could multiply,

908
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:49,092
which will then jeopardize our
ability to create healthy blood.

909
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,429
Are you saying we're abnormal?

910
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,597
Regretfully,

911
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,891
you aren't needed in this body any longer.

912
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,184
I'm sorry.

913
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,311
- No way!
- Get rid of these two.

914
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,228
Sir!

915
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:06,193
- No, no! No, no, stop! Please!
- You're coming, too.

916
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,027
Let go!

917
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,614
I'm gonna be a worthy white
cell like I said, let go!

918
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,075
Don't let him go!

919
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,293
No more of that.

920
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,045
Okay?

921
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,339
- Now let's go.
- I don't wanna go!

922
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,091
Just let me stay!

923
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,427
What did...

924
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,055
What did I do to you?!

925
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:45,983
The hell is that?

926
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,453
ONE MONTH LATER

927
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,581
Wellp, I'm done!

928
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,291
Oh, I'm running late.

929
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,793
- Hey.
- Hm?

930
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:05,544
I think from now on

931
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:06,503
I won't eat so much.

932
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,421
What?

933
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,047
I got a blood test,

934
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,090
at the doctors yesterday,

935
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,383
all results improved

936
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,010
It's all about the diet!

937
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,553
Okay, okay, I got it.

938
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,179
Then I'll stick with
the smaller portions.

939
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,347
Yeah. Here,

940
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,974
I made your lunch for you.

941
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:19,558
You get the dishes.

942
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:20,892
Sure thing.

943
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,144
- Hm?
- Hm?

944
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:23,311
Your leg...

945
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,187
what'd you do?

946
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:24,938
Oh,

947
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,356
I don't know.

948
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,649
- Looks like I bumped it somewhere.
- Oh.

949
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,358
See you later.

950
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,067
Sure.

951
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,698
- Oxygen delivery, thanks for waiting.
- Mhm.

952
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,033
I just need your hanko here.

953
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,784
You're prompt as always. Thank you.

954
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,786
No problem,

955
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:40,954
it's what we do.

956
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,748
- I'm sure I'll see you again soon.
- I'll be counting on you.

957
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,665
Okay!

958
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,543
I did it!

959
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,921
Took the blood stream all the
way around and didn't get lost.

960
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,132
Next up, I'm headed
for the small intestine...

961
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,800
She's become reliable all right.

962
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,594
Okay!

963
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,056
Ow!

964
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:00,766
Are you okay?

965
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,560
Mr White Blood Cell! I'm sorry!

966
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,145
No, it's okay...

967
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,355
I should pay better attention.

968
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:12,277
- Platelets?
- Oh! Greetings, teammates.

969
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,489
Have you seen any more
of our friends lately?

970
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,531
Not very many, no.

971
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,158
Have you?

972
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,326
No, me neither...

973
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:20,744
What's going on?

974
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,871
Not many of us have been around,

975
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,040
so we're having trouble healing bruises.

976
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,750
That is odd...

977
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,668
I wonder where they went?

978
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,129
Maybe they're lost somewhere?

979
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,808
You alone?

980
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,518
Yeah.

981
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,353
Though it's strange...

982
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,480
Lately it's been quiet.

983
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,649
Not too many white cells around.

984
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,746
- That's what I said.
- ...I swear...

985
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,039
- ugh, whatever
- You should just tell

986
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,165
her that you're busy.

987
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,295
Niko.

988
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,840
Oh, Arata. Good morning.

989
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,217
What happened?

990
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,556
Niko, what's wrong?

991
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:23,682
Niko?

992
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:25,183
Are you okay?

993
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,860
Please make sure to check in fifteen
minutes prior to appointments.

994
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,777
What?

995
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,988
I will be reviewing the
detailed exam results,

996
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,906
after which I can explain

997
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,241
any routes for treatment.

998
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:44,828
Right now,
she has a low platelet count and her

999
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,164
whole body is prone to bleeding.

1000
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,498
Therefore,

1001
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:52,878
she needs immediate blood transfusion
in order to start receiving treatment.

1002
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,131
Sir?

1003
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,426
Mr. Urushizaki, are you okay?

1004
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,552
Y-Yeah...

1005
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,513
So, Niko...

1006
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,056
thanks to her...

1007
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,641
I'm eating healthy!

1008
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,935
I feel like I can take on the world.

1009
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,103
She needs to get well.

1010
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,105
Doctor.

1011
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,150
Whatever I can do...

1012
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,318
to help her live.

1013
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,319
Just...

1014
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,529
Niko is... she's all I've got, doctor.

1015
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,697
Please save her.

1016
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,117
- I'm begging you!
- Okay.

1017
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,328
Leukemia...?

1018
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,412
Yeah.

1019
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,788
Acute...

1020
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,832
myeloid leukemia, I think it's called.

1021
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,294
So, in your blood,

1022
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,797
you have red cells,
white cells, and platelets, you know?

1023
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,592
So right now... the nasty-looking cells...

1024
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:42,177
are increasing...

1025
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,347
So...

1026
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,641
What do we do next?

1027
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,434
Yeah... so that...

1028
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,145
If we just let them be,

1029
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,731
you won't have as many normal blood cells

1030
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,982
and that's not good.

1031
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,151
Uh, so, the next step is...

1032
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,404
Chemotherapy.

1033
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,572
That's what they do.

1034
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,367
Anti-cancer drugs.

1035
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:09,996
Mm...

1036
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,414
but, I mean...

1037
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,207
Well, you know...

1038
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:13,959
You'll be okay.

1039
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,502
Yeah?

1040
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:18,880
I swear you'll be okay.

1041
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,341
Mhm...

1042
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,052
Why don't...

1043
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,472
Why don't you take me instead...

1044
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,728
Why Niko?

1045
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:19,274
Why is...

1046
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,527
Why is this happening?

1047
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,160
Ahh, why is this so hard?

1048
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,371
Well, you are pretty clumsy, aren't you?

1049
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,748
Come on.

1050
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,790
I guess you

1051
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,126
had better heal up quickly
so you can finish it.

1052
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,085
I'm back.

1053
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,045
Hello.

1054
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,254
Mama, guess what?

1055
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,715
I got asked to join the
field day planning club.

1056
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:44,924
Oh?

1057
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,427
I'm so thrilled for you, that's great!

1058
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,472
- It's exciting
- Yes, it surely is.

1059
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,931
Ma'am? Are you still with us?

1060
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,599
Yuko.

1061
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,392
Stay strong, Yuko.

1062
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:55,393
Mama! Mama!

1063
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:56,686
Let's start 'pressors.

1064
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,687
Right away.

1065
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,064
Yuko.

1066
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:00,482
Mama!

1067
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,734
Mama!

1068
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:06,696
Mama!

1069
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,367
Taking donors all day, blood donors!

1070
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,328
Anybody have time?
It's just a few minutes.

1071
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,165
Blood types A and O are especially needed.

1072
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,168
We can assist you right away.

1073
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,546
We'll be taking donors
just a few more hours.

1074
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,257
Hey look!

1075
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,968
Finally got around to
fixing up these roads.

1076
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:29,761
Yeah.

1077
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,472
It's starting to look pretty
good around here.

1078
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,795
What the hell is that?

1079
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,474
Here's oxygen. Please feel better.

1080
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,476
Give me some too.

1081
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,727
Yeah, I'm on my way!

1082
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,605
- I need some too.
- Here you go.

1083
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:04,814
- I need oxygen.
- Okay

1084
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,940
Here you go.

1085
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,984
- Over here too.
- Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1086
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:08,943
Need oxygen... hurry...

1087
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:09,736
Here.

1088
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,614
Leukemia cells are rapidly
multiplying in the body.

1089
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:13,781
Please take care.

1090
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,582
Reinforcement squad's here.

1091
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,459
Thank you for coming.

1092
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,294
Are you okay, Red Blood Cell?

1093
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,296
I'm fine, yes.

1094
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,757
We'll deliver the oxygen,
we're determined to.

1095
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,218
We're counting on you.

1096
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,307
Everybody ready to go?

1097
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,433
Do you have oxygen?

1098
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,018
Uh, yeah.

1099
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:43,895
Uh,

1100
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:47,065
- could you... tell us what's going on?
- There'll be time for that later.

1101
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:48,733
Oxygen's here.

1102
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,360
Be careful out there.

1103
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:53,947
There's no telling where cancer cells
could be hiding, so stay alert!

1104
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:54,989
Yes, sir.

1105
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,327
Moron.

1106
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,580
When you're always so loud,
your adversaries can hear you.

1107
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,457
You're so damn cocky, you know that?

1108
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,333
Keep it down.

1109
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,920
I'm not like a cowardly T-cell,
always hiding behind my allies.

1110
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,755
Hey, you wanna say that again?!

1111
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,173
Be quiet.

1112
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:15,802
We have a guest.

1113
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:23,226
HANDLE WITH CARE
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT

1114
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,247
It's been a while.

1115
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,708
Big brother.

1116
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:53,715
"Someday I'll grow into a white blood
cell as strong as you are, sir!"

1117
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,426
The boy...

1118
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,552
you were the little one.

1119
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,054
I'll be waiting.

1120
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,348
Thank you, mister...

1121
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:03,558
So...

1122
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,184
you've been waiting for me

1123
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:06,519
all along?

1124
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,648
Mister! Let me fight you one-on-one again.

1125
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,817
See if I'm any stronger.

1126
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,278
How 'bout I fight you?

1127
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,613
A rejected cell!

1128
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,072
Let's do it!

1129
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:19,282
Huh?

1130
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:20,658
Who's this brute?

1131
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,994
I'm talking with my older
brother right now.

1132
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,625
Attention cell workers,
leukemia has been detected

1133
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:29,584
throughout the body.

1134
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,545
The cells are rapidly spreading
to the lungs and spleen.

1135
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,090
They've invaded the lymph nodes and
they're headed to other organs.

1136
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:37,800
Killer T's are being summoned.

1137
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,594
That's a waste.

1138
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,388
We're growing exponentially now.

1139
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:46,726
- So there's more and more and more of us.
- Enough.

1140
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,562
We maintain this body and it needs us.

1141
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,230
It doesn't need rejected cells.

1142
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,150
What the...

1143
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:57,111
You don't really believe that, do you?

1144
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,740
Weren't you waiting for our rematch?

1145
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,034
Fight me.

1146
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,994
Let's see if I can beat you.

1147
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:07,246
I'm sorry.

1148
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:09,749
I can't let you pass.

1149
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:13,670
Even my white cell big brother
treats me like a defect.

1150
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,964
Then, I'll kill you.

1151
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:23,596
Reports say that the red bone marrow
is being overrun with leukemia cells.

1152
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,473
Head there immediately.

1153
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,019
This isn't good.

1154
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,562
Cell start their lives there.

1155
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,314
Blood cells will stop being created.

1156
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:35,858
We cannot let them occupy
the red bone marrow.

1157
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,319
We should hurry.

1158
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,533
We have to get oxygen to
both intestines next.

1159
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,201
Hang on a minute.

1160
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,078
Can we break for a second?

1161
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,454
We don't have time for breaks.

1162
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,707
We have to get oxygen
to the weakened cells.

1163
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,042
Okay.

1164
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:05,680
What the-?

1165
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:06,889
What the hell's going on?

1166
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,396
It's those things.

1167
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,566
They're sent to destroy leukemia cells.

1168
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,943
They can't discern targets, though.

1169
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,946
Healthy and helpful cells
will be taken out as well.

1170
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,907
Anti-cancer agent?

1171
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,744
ANTI-CANCER AGENT

1172
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,127
Move now.

1173
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,342
NK.

1174
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:45,887
I'm fine.

1175
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,183
Hey! There's even more!

1176
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,562
They're still going strong...

1177
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,694
The missiles...

1178
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:04,447
They aren't doing anything,
they're not affected.

1179
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:08,743
Shit, look out...

1180
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,370
where the hell are they all coming from?

1181
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,708
ANTI-CANCER AGENT

1182
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:25,927
Are you okay?

1183
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,264
Arata, can you get her some...?

1184
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:31,808
Yeah.

1185
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,392
I'm sorry.

1186
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:35,561
I'm sorry, dad.

1187
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,771
What do you mean?

1188
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:38,356
There's nothing to be sorry for.

1189
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,066
- I'm sorry.
- No...

1190
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,692
Can you... drink water?

1191
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:44,237
Okay.

1192
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,240
Ah, thanks. Okay.

1193
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:01,420
NK.

1194
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:02,922
Are you okay?

1195
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:04,423
More over there...

1196
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,259
It just never ends.

1197
01:04:07,426 --> 01:04:08,427
We're low on oxygen.

1198
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,972
Why are the red blood cells slacking off?

1199
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:13,683
We'll all be killed if they
can't make another run.

1200
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,268
The red cells are on their way.

1201
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,186
Hold out a little bit longer,

1202
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,188
they'll get us that oxygen.

1203
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:20,523
Hey.

1204
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,900
You guys really still think we can win?

1205
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,778
Didn't know you'd give up so easily.

1206
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,656
We make our stand and we beat them back!

1207
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:30,825
Or this body will perish.

1208
01:04:56,809 --> 01:05:00,021
You get to the red bone marrow and
I'll hold these guys off here.

1209
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,524
NK, don't push too hard!

1210
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,359
I don't take orders from you!

1211
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,070
I fight by my own will.

1212
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,950
You really are such a narcissistic cell.

1213
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,495
I'm not letting you take all
the glory from us today.

1214
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,164
I'm ready to give these invaders hell!

1215
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,248
Captain!

1216
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:21,584
Hey White Cell!

1217
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,419
This corridor's locked down.

1218
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,172
Red bone marrow is our only hope now!

1219
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,553
Let's go!

1220
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,347
Yes, sir.

1221
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,029
White Blood Cell, hurry up and run!

1222
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,281
Stop dancing around!

1223
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,157
Hurry and go!

1224
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,390
What is it?

1225
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,142
This... is never going to work.

1226
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,564
You don't really think our pitiful efforts

1227
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,067
can do anything at all to
change this situation!?

1228
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,861
Take a good look.

1229
01:06:31,445 --> 01:06:33,990
We are the only red blood cells left.

1230
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,286
No matter how hard we try,
our oxygen supply won't be enough.

1231
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:45,626
It's clear our body's coming to an end.

1232
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:53,926
I'm just scared.

1233
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,181
I just want to feel safe again.

1234
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:04,562
You think I don't?

1235
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,442
You think we all aren't scared?

1236
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,818
We're terrified.

1237
01:07:13,779 --> 01:07:14,864
But even so...

1238
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,742
we all want to protect
this body at all costs.

1239
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,211
I won't run away.

1240
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,548
So no matter what,

1241
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,968
our duty is to keep delivering
oxygen to cells.

1242
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,015
It's what we're trained to do.

1243
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:04,205
She's never whined or complained
once since she was little.

1244
01:08:05,498 --> 01:08:06,624
Even when Yuko passed...

1245
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,001
she was the one comforting me.

1246
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:12,129
Here, look.

1247
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:17,551
DADDY, CHEER UP.
FROM NIKO

1248
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,428
I'm a pathetic father.

1249
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,848
Truly lousy.

1250
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:31,816
I can't do much, you know?

1251
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:33,651
So let's...

1252
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:35,111
you and I...

1253
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,153
support her how we can.

1254
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:37,655
Yeah?

1255
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:39,907
I beg you.

1256
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:42,660
Sure,

1257
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,121
of course I will.

1258
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,046
Mr. Urushizaki,

1259
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,632
- Niko is...
- What?

1260
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,514
Are you okay?

1261
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,025
BP is dropping.

1262
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,152
Hold the chemo.

1263
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,403
- Run saline wide open.
- Niko,

1264
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,070
On it.

1265
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,613
Niko.

1266
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:22,074
- Five liters of O2 by mask.
- Yes, sir.

1267
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:22,908
Yes, sir.

1268
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,119
- Get a 'pressor ready as well.
- Okay.

1269
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,579
Niko? Can you hear me?

1270
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,207
NK.

1271
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:38,257
- Niko,
- Niko,

1272
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,134
- Honey, hang in there Niko!
- can you hear me?

1273
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:41,343
Securing the mask.

1274
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:42,720
- Starting O2, five liters.
- Niko.

1275
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:43,387
Niko.

1276
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:44,305
Can you hear me?

1277
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:45,639
Hang in there!

1278
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:46,265
Niko!

1279
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,227
Are you okay?

1280
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:51,687
Hey!

1281
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:56,775
Killer T.

1282
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:00,654
I had fun today.

1283
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:03,616
Sometimes it's good

1284
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,577
to fight as a pack,
isn't it? It's not bad.

1285
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:12,666
Hey.

1286
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:15,961
Hey!

1287
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:20,257
Damn it.

1288
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,886
Come on, you idiot!

1289
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:26,263
NK, you know what?

1290
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,308
I truly envied you, NK.

1291
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,145
I was jealous because you
could fight without taking

1292
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,147
stupid orders from anyone!

1293
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,194
Screw you!

1294
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:47,701
Go.

1295
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:51,789
Here

1296
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,107
We're countin' on ya,

1297
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:20,234
White Blood Cell.

1298
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:27,533
Leukemia cells are also appearing
in the pancreas area.

1299
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,618
As well as in the small
and large intestines.

1300
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:32,037
Killer T, get over there immediately!

1301
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:34,498
Killer T?

1302
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,167
Respond.

1303
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,003
Respond.

1304
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,095
Or...

1305
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:50,222
They're here already.

1306
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:20,753
We're able to fight...

1307
01:12:21,253 --> 01:12:24,590
thanks to you red blood cells
constantly delivering oxygen.

1308
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,216
I'm counting on you.

1309
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:37,561
I need to...

1310
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:39,438
keep going...

1311
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,615
For now,
her body is holding up, miraculously.

1312
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:51,200
That said...

1313
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:54,411
I'm not sure how much longer Niko
will survive in her current state.

1314
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,081
Eh, so, what now?

1315
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:58,707
A bone marrow transplant...

1316
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,751
is now her only option.

1317
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,713
As soon as we find a donor,
we'll begin radiation therapy.

1318
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:06,924
You said... radiation?

1319
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:13,222
To prevent the immune system from
attacking the new bone marrow,

1320
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:16,350
a pre-transplant procedure
will use radiation

1321
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:19,269
to destroy all the cells in her blood.

1322
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,383
Hey, here!

1323
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,176
I've got some oxygen right here.

1324
01:13:57,808 --> 01:13:58,892
What are you doing?

1325
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,103
Deliver that oxygen, hurry, let's go!

1326
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:07,317
Behind you!

1327
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:24,668
Ms. Macrophage?

1328
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:26,628
Hello Red Blood Cell.

1329
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:38,515
Why are you here?

1330
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:39,892
Didn't I tell you?

1331
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:41,518
I have many roles.

1332
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,521
I'm more than just the new cells' teacher.

1333
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,231
I'm also a killer.

1334
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:48,817
You need to hurry and go now.

1335
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:51,695
You have a mission to fulfill don't you?

1336
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:53,614
I do.

1337
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:58,952
Let's go.

1338
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:00,454
No.

1339
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:03,332
I'm gonna stay here

1340
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:06,251
Ms. Macrophage will need
oxygen for her mission.

1341
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:09,463
No matter what happens,

1342
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:12,174
the oxygen will be delivered.

1343
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,471
It's the job we're here to do, isn't it?

1344
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,685
Oxygen here!

1345
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:11,567
Mr. White Blood Cell?

1346
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:24,997
You're still alive!

1347
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,624
Red... Cell...?

1348
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,132
I have oxygen for you.

1349
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,726
I'm sorry it took so long to find you.

1350
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:52,232
Thank you,

1351
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:52,941
Red Blood Cell.

1352
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,068
Of course.

1353
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,749
We'll start the radiation therapy now.

1354
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:18,842
Help me.

1355
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:21,553
Someone.

1356
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:28,727
Help me.

1357
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:34,983
What was that light?

1358
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:47,579
What do you think is going on here?

1359
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,289
Why is everyone getting vaporized?

1360
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,457
I have no idea.

1361
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,876
If we lose any more allies,
we're in a bind

1362
01:17:54,127 --> 01:17:56,213
the body won't be able to sustain itself.

1363
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,342
We need to go.

1364
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,261
In our hometown,

1365
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:04,930
the red bone marrow,

1366
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:09,309
the hematopoietic stem cells that once
produced us should still be working.

1367
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,728
You need to gather some oxygen,

1368
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:14,731
and bring it to the stem cells.

1369
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:16,775
That way,

1370
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,486
they can start to make
some more allies for us.

1371
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:21,738
I'm not...

1372
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,949
I'm not sure if I can get there alone.

1373
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:24,950
You'll be fine.

1374
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,453
The whole way I'll make
sure you're protected.

1375
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,124
We gotta go.

1376
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,769
We have to run.

1377
01:19:17,627 --> 01:19:18,795
We're almost there.

1378
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:19,504
Okay.

1379
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:27,679
Hey,

1380
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,139
I'm a little hungry.

1381
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,808
Why don't you give me that oxygen?

1382
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:34,728
I'm not doing that.

1383
01:19:35,395 --> 01:19:36,605
I can't give it to you.

1384
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:39,608
I see.

1385
01:19:40,692 --> 01:19:41,401
I'll kill you then.

1386
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:53,830
Mr. White Cell.

1387
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:55,373
Red Cell.

1388
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,000
You keep on going.

1389
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:58,293
No,

1390
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,295
- but you're...
- Hurry and go.

1391
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,048
You complete the mission, you hear?

1392
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:07,260
Okay.

1393
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,309
Mister.

1394
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:17,854
Sorry...

1395
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:21,358
You left me with no choice
but to kill you.

1396
01:20:22,776 --> 01:20:23,610
Hm.

1397
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:25,570
So I...

1398
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,991
am a mutant defect to the
white cells like you.

1399
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:34,454
Just do it.

1400
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:37,123
You might as well kill me.

1401
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,314
Why is it...

1402
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,943
I'm treated like I'm worse than nothing?

1403
01:21:20,834 --> 01:21:21,668
Why!?

1404
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,838
Why do I have to die?

1405
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:26,590
It's not fair!

1406
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,352
What reason did I give you to hate me?

1407
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,159
I was dragged into this world.

1408
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:59,247
I wanted to be a heroic
white cell like you.

1409
01:22:06,212 --> 01:22:07,631
How's it feel, Mister?

1410
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:11,092
Being extinguished by a
so-called defect like me.

1411
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:13,929
Frustrated?

1412
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,264
You must be.

1413
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:18,767
Now say this:

1414
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,312
Say you're weaker than I am.

1415
01:23:07,065 --> 01:23:08,066
You're already done?

1416
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:10,777
Too bad then.

1417
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,549
Thank you very much.

1418
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,300
I'll leave her with you.

1419
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:36,761
Niko, are you okay?

1420
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:41,141
There are hardly any cells
in the bone marrow

1421
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:43,727
now, so we need to be very cautious.

1422
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:48,773
Doctor,

1423
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:50,608
is there anything

1424
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,152
that I can do for her?

1425
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:56,364
I think it's best to...

1426
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,992
stay with your daughter for the procedure

1427
01:23:59,075 --> 01:24:00,869
until we know her body's healing.

1428
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:29,189
THINGS DADDY USED TO LOVE

1429
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,422
BUT WHAT I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE MOST IS...

1430
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:01,638
NIKO'S SMILE

1431
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:12,524
I LOVE YOUR BIG SMILE
MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

1432
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,698
HE SAYS SO TOO.

1433
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:40,635
I HEARD YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM
IMPROVES WHEN YOU SMILE

1434
01:25:48,059 --> 01:25:49,894
JUST A LITTLE MORE!
HANG IN THERE, NIKO

1435
01:25:54,899 --> 01:25:55,775
One two

1436
01:25:56,442 --> 01:25:59,696
- Go! Go! Niko!
- Go! Go! Niko!

1437
01:25:59,779 --> 01:26:03,199
- Go! Go! Niko!
- Go! Go! Niko! Go! Go! Niko!

1438
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:06,619
Go! Go! Niko! Go! Go! Niko!

1439
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,288
- Wow
- Wow

1440
01:26:09,956 --> 01:26:10,874
Thank you.

1441
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,088
Thank you.

1442
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:13,728
No way.

1443
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,467
You're delivering oxygen to
help your friends multiply?

1444
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:46,386
Too bad.

1445
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:47,845
That's a waste.

1446
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:49,764
What?

1447
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,600
Nobody is coming to rescue you.

1448
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:02,694
You and I should be allies,
we were born in the same world.

1449
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,032
Why do we have to fight
each other like this?

1450
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:09,742
We're not allies.

1451
01:28:11,327 --> 01:28:13,371
You guys tried to eliminate me first.

1452
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:16,416
That's why I

1453
01:28:16,499 --> 01:28:18,376
will change this world for the better.

1454
01:28:18,918 --> 01:28:20,712
A world where we can live freely

1455
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:23,172
from the fear of getting
utterly destroyed.

1456
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:27,051
I won't let you do that.

1457
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:29,679
Never.

1458
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:33,349
Oh you're funny.

1459
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,436
You're just a lowly red blood cell.

1460
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:40,690
Now die, weakling.

1461
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:54,704
Mr. White Cell.

1462
01:28:56,414 --> 01:28:57,915
You didn't study enough.

1463
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,211
All white cells can "migrate";

1464
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:06,174
we travel through walls
to meet our enemies.

1465
01:29:09,635 --> 01:29:10,678
Why is it?

1466
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,353
I just wanted that sense of...

1467
01:29:20,313 --> 01:29:22,815
belonging with the other white cells.

1468
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:26,027
I don't

1469
01:29:27,653 --> 01:29:29,155
have the ability to save you.

1470
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:33,576
Nor can I heal you

1471
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,872
or let you live at all.

1472
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:06,192
You must be destroyed.

1473
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,528
That is our duty.

1474
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:20,248
I suppose...

1475
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:21,999
you're strong.

1476
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,043
You're strong after all.

1477
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:26,504
Sorry.

1478
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,567
Some day,
I'll grow into a white blood cell

1479
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:48,943
as strong as you are, sir!

1480
01:31:01,914 --> 01:31:02,832
The body

1481
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:05,626
is in a state of devastation.

1482
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:07,336
All cells,

1483
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:11,966
please take the necessary steps
to protect yourselves.

1484
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,386
What will happen to us?

1485
01:31:21,767 --> 01:31:22,810
Are you feeling okay?

1486
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,355
I still have some oxygen.

1487
01:31:28,566 --> 01:31:29,400
Here.

1488
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:36,574
I don't need it.

1489
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:42,747
There are more cells...

1490
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,919
that need this oxygen to keep on living.

1491
01:31:49,795 --> 01:31:50,713
Yeah but...

1492
01:31:52,965 --> 01:31:55,468
To protect and maintain this body,

1493
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:04,352
we need you red cells to keep working.

1494
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:09,941
Whatever happens...

1495
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:14,987
deliver that oxygen.

1496
01:32:24,956 --> 01:32:25,623
Swear to it.

1497
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:29,669
It was you...

1498
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:32,672
you're the one who...

1499
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:40,972
Red Blood Cell.

1500
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,605
You've become worthy.

1501
01:33:02,034 --> 01:33:02,952
We need you...

1502
01:33:05,663 --> 01:33:06,581
Red Cell...

1503
01:33:16,674 --> 01:33:17,550
I'll do you proud.

1504
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:20,011
White Cell, please...

1505
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:21,804
Don't leave us today.

1506
01:33:22,805 --> 01:33:23,639
Please don't.

1507
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:35,568
Mr. White Cell?

1508
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:43,117
Mr. White Cell?

1509
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:47,913
Mr. White Cell!

1510
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:41,384
Thank you for everything.

1511
01:35:35,521 --> 01:35:36,689
Please, please...

1512
01:35:36,772 --> 01:35:37,523
Oh,

1513
01:35:38,023 --> 01:35:39,233
here's oxygen. Please feel better.

1514
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:40,359
Thank you.

1515
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:42,903
I have oxygen...

1516
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:44,006
Okay.
We'll begin the bone marrow infusion.

1517
01:39:03,437 --> 01:39:04,396
Congratulations.

1518
01:39:05,147 --> 01:39:07,942
Looks like your newly injected
stem cells are engrafted?

1519
01:39:08,567 --> 01:39:09,151
So now

1520
01:39:09,652 --> 01:39:10,736
healthy regular blood cells

1521
01:39:10,819 --> 01:39:12,112
are starting to get made again.

1522
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:13,447
Right, Doctor?

1523
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:14,573
That's exactly right.

1524
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:16,450
Doctor,

1525
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:19,036
- thank you for all your help.
- No, no,

1526
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,412
Niko, you've come this far

1527
01:39:20,996 --> 01:39:22,373
all on your own strength.

1528
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:26,460
Without your own strength,
your body couldn't have made

1529
01:39:26,543 --> 01:39:27,795
it to the transplant.

1530
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:29,880
You should thank your cells,

1531
01:39:30,381 --> 01:39:32,132
they put in the real work.

1532
01:39:40,182 --> 01:39:41,100
Thank you.

1533
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:48,167
Dear erythroblasts who are
still small and cute,

1534
01:40:49,752 --> 01:40:54,214
I'm a red blood cell who
used to work in this body.

1535
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:59,303
I'm a little slow and always lose my way.

1536
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:03,807
Unlike white blood cells that can
fight off bacteria and viruses,

1537
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,810
all I could do was deliver oxygen.

1538
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:09,063
And I felt insecure.

1539
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:13,067
But now, I see myself as an important

1540
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:16,904
part of this body,
helping to protect and sustain it.

1541
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:22,576
It's not about who's superior
or who's stronger.

1542
01:41:23,202 --> 01:41:26,080
None of us can survive alone,

1543
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:31,627
so we support and complement each other.

1544
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:37,257
That's how we all work together
to maintain this body.

1545
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:43,347
I loved working with
these friends of mine.

1546
01:41:48,477 --> 01:41:51,814
The number of cells in a human body
is approximately 37 trillion.

1547
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:56,652
Most eventually die from external threats
or due to the end of their lifespan.

1548
01:41:57,402 --> 01:42:00,948
They pass on their duties
to newly produced cells.

1549
01:42:03,408 --> 01:42:05,536
We are cells at work.

1550
01:42:06,995 --> 01:42:10,499
And now I'm passing the work on to you.

1551
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:16,213
Please keep delivering oxygen
to sustain this body.

1552
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:19,758
From your senior red blood cell.

1553
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:22,970
We're about to get going, everyone. Oh!

1554
01:42:24,054 --> 01:42:27,015
What are you doing?
Our next class is starting soon.

1555
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:28,392
Okay!

1556
01:42:32,229 --> 01:42:34,940
ONE YEAR LATER, SPRING

1557
01:42:36,024 --> 01:42:36,733
Dad, come on!

1558
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:38,235
We're running so late!

1559
01:42:38,735 --> 01:42:40,445
Sorry, sorry, I couldn't pick a tie!

1560
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:42,906
It's not like it's your
school entrance ceremony.

1561
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:44,449
You're entering med school, though.

1562
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,326
Can't let 'em look down on you.

1563
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:47,995
- Gotta look sharp, don't I?
- Okay, okay.

1564
01:42:48,078 --> 01:42:49,746
We really should hurry,
we're gonna be late soon.

1565
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,123
You don't have to come, you know.

1566
01:42:51,206 --> 01:42:53,167
No, no! I mean, Arata...

1567
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,127
- you're like family now, right?
- Well...

1568
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:56,461
Ooh, sir...

1569
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:57,796
- Sure that tie isn't a bit casual?
- I agree.

1570
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:58,839
- One sec
- Why are you saying those

1571
01:42:58,922 --> 01:42:59,923
kinds of things? You're okay!

1572
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:00,841
Hurry.

1573
01:43:02,467 --> 01:43:03,010
Huh?

1574
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:04,136
Got a cold?

1575
01:43:04,928 --> 01:43:05,762
No,

1576
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:07,264
I think this is...

1577
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:10,434
Heave ho.

1578
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:12,060
Heave ho.

1579
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:12,978
Heave ho.

1580
01:43:13,478 --> 01:43:14,605
Heave--

1581
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:20,527
Here, take care.

1582
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:21,904
Thank you, miss!

1583
01:43:22,696 --> 01:43:23,697
You're very welcome.

1584
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:28,160
Alert, alert.

1585
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:32,122
Cedar pollen allergens have entered
the drainage duct near the eye's

1586
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:32,789
mucous membrane.

1587
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:34,082
Allergens?

1588
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,836
Where'd they go?

1589
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:39,379
Where're they hiding?

1590
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:40,422
Kill them all.

1591
01:43:40,505 --> 01:43:42,216
Kill them, annihilate them!

1592
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:45,969
What is it, Red Blood Cell?

1593
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,429
Oh, nothing.

1594
01:43:47,512 --> 01:43:49,932
I don't know why,
but I feel like we know each other.

1595
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:55,437
It's right near here.

1596
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:57,481
Cedar.

1597
01:44:01,276 --> 01:44:02,903
- Cedar.
- Cedar.

1598
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:05,322
This is White Cell Neutrophil U-8996.

1599
01:44:05,822 --> 01:44:07,658
I've located the target allergen.

1600
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:09,034
Going in to eliminate.

1601
01:44:10,369 --> 01:44:11,245
Mr. White Blood Cell?

1602
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:14,623
So will I

1603
01:44:15,123 --> 01:44:16,041
be seeing you later?

1604
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,293
We work together, don't we?

1605
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:19,962
I'll see you around.

1606
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,424
Yeah, I hope so.

1607
01:44:25,717 --> 01:44:26,551
Until then...

1608
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:28,804
Put them down.

1609
01:44:29,304 --> 01:44:30,889
Slaughter them, annihilate them!

1610
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:34,268
Ce- dar.

1611
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:38,772
Well,

1612
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,190
let's get to work.

1613
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:49,449
Heave ho. Heave ho. Heave ho. Heave ho.
Heave ho. Heave ho. Heave ho. Heave ho.

1614
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:52,661
Heave ho.

1615
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:03,672
RED BLOOD CELLS: THEIR JOB
IS TO DELIVER OXYGEN TO CELLS

1616
01:45:03,755 --> 01:45:06,341
THROUGHOUT THE BODY
AND CO2 TO THE LUNGS.

1617
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:10,470
IT TRAVELS AROUND THE BODY
IN LESS THAN A MINUTE!

1618
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:12,014
90 DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE EXAM!

1619
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,559
WHITE BLOOD CELLS
PROTECT THE BODY FROM

1620
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:17,811
BACTERIA, VIRUSES,
AND OTHER FOREIGN SUBSTANCES

1621
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:20,022
THAT HAVE INVADED THE BODY
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

01:45:20,105 --> 01:45:23,442
RECEPTORS: RADAR-LIKE THINGS THAT
DETECT BACTERIA AND OTHER ORGANISMS.

1623
01:45:23,525 --> 01:45:25,902
TYPES: NEUTROPHILS,
EOSINOPHILS AND MACROPHAGES.

1624
01:45:27,946 --> 01:45:31,908
KILLER T CELLS RECOGNIZE AND DESTROY
FOREIGN CELLS SUCH AS

1625
01:45:31,992 --> 01:45:35,162
VIRUS-INFECTED CELLS AND
CANCER CELLS - SCARY!

1626
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:39,291
DEPLOYED ON THE ORDERS OF
HELPER T CELLS - ARE THEY FRIENDS?

1627
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:44,254
SCOPE OF THIS WEEK'S REVIEW:
NATURAL KILLER CELL BORN WITH

1628
01:45:44,338 --> 01:45:48,467
THE ABILITY TO KILL EXTERNAL ENEMIES
AND ATTACK THEM AT THEIR OWN DISCRETION.

1629
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,969
I'M GOING TO GET INTO
MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR SURE!

1630
01:45:54,765 --> 01:45:56,600
MACROPHAGE: A TYPE OF WHITE BLOOD CELL

1631
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:59,853
THAT ASSISTS IN THE DIFFERENTIATION
AND MATURATION OF ERYTHROBLASTS.

1632
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:02,522
THEY ALSO FIGHT AGAINST
FOREIGN SUBSTANCES LIKE BACTERIA

1633
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:04,524
AND PASS THIS INFO
ONTO HELPER T CELLS.

1634
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:11,323
HELPER T CELLS: COMMANDERS THAT
RECEIVE NEWS OF FOREIGN INVASION

1635
01:46:11,406 --> 01:46:13,158
AND DECIDE ON THE STRATEGY OF ATTACK.

1636
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:18,205
SUMMARY: HELPER T CELLS
ORDER TO MOBILIZE KILLER T CELLS

1637
01:46:18,288 --> 01:46:19,748
MACROPHAGES - ANTIGEN INFO

1638

HEPATOCYTE: CELLS THAT MAKE UP
THE BULK OF THE LIVER.

1639
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:28,548
THE LIVER HANDLES THE METABOLISM
