2
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,918
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,200
Yunlin.

4
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,719
Do you know

5
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,400
how much I miss you?

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,200
Yu.

7
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,319
Yu.

8
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,000
Wake up.

9
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,159
Get up now.

10
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,079
Yunlin.

11
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,200
Let me sleep a little longer.

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,680
I swept eight streets today.

13
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:28,799
Hurry.

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,040
Come on, get up.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,120
You fuss over your brother
during the day,

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,359
only to sneak him out at night?

17
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,400
Is he studying, or is there
something else going on?

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,840
Come on.

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,719
Take a look at them.

20
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,560
They don't even try to be discreet now.

21
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,519
I could have cleared

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,879
the space for you.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,159
What nonsense?

24
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,920
Watch your tongue.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,079
Why bully your own kind?

26
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are you worked up?

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,479
Even if you want a lover,

28
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,960
at least pick someone strong.

29
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,639
What?

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,319
Are you "training" your brother?

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,639
He claims to be "studying".

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
But it's more like

33
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,719
puberty education...

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,159
How dare you hit me!

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,280
What's all this noise?

36
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,639
My lord, thank goodness you came.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Thirty-five.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,039
Thirty-six.

39
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,840
Thirty-seven.

40
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,560
My lord, please.

41
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,520
Stop hitting her.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,680
Stop hitting her.

43
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,680
My lord, please.

44
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,560
Forty-one.

45
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,479
Stop hitting her, my lord.

46
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,319
I'm begging you.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,319
Forty-three.

48
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,479
Forty-four.

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,759
My lord, your imposing presence

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,520
is truly admirable.

51
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:11,039
Get lost.

52
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,360
My lord, please.

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,960
Let us go.

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
You little brat.

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,439
Please.

56
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,360
I don't know if this woman

57
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,639
is your sister or your lover.

58
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,159
We're eunuchs.

59
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,800
Yunlin.

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,240
Yunlin.

61
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,000
Now no one can bully us anymore.

62
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,840
Your Majesty.

63
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,479
I am the third daughter
of the Sheng family.

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Sheng Yunfei.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,919
Fine. You may leave.

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,120
Wait.

67
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,639
You may find palace life tedious.

68
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,879
This jade pendant

69
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,000
grants you unrestricted access.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,759
None will dare stop you.

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,000
Thank you.

72
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,279
My lord.

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,319
Sheng Yunfei rarely goes out.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,079
We don't know how she looks.

75
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,720
A series of schemes.

76
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,439
Jia Cheng accidentally killed someone.

77
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,959
Wan desperately tried to save him.

78
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,920
The Eliminate Evil Order
points at the Grand Princess.

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
And right at this moment,

80
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,879
a woman showed up, bearing

81
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,079
an uncanny resemblance
to the Grand Princess.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,879
No way.

83
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Three years ago,

84
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,000
I saw her take her last breath.

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,040
Xie Huaiyong.

86
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,360
You want to "resurrect" Sheng Yunlin

87
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,120
through Sheng Yunfei?

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,879
Fine.

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,720
Then I will

90
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,600
send you to meet
the King of the Underworld.

91
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,560
They call you the "Burglar Sage"?

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,399
"Lady-killer" suits you better.

93
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,920
Seeking romance in the palace?

94
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:36,920
What?

95
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,519
Want to try
the 72 tortures in the palace?

96
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,079
My lady.

97
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,240
Blame it on

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,040
your overly fragrant bedding.

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,959
The scent drew me here.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,879
How many people
did Chancellor Huo deploy against you?

101
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,000
You have no idea.

102
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,480
There are over thirty archers
around the Chancellor's residence.

103
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,240
And I happen

104
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,639
to be craving

105
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,639
that cup of tea in your hand.

106
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,639
It's poisoned.

107
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,879
How do you know?

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,520
It's a colorless and odorless poison

109
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,680
from the Qi State.

110
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,240
Think about it.

111
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,639
Wouldn't tea leaves unfurl in water?

112
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,920
How clever.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,120
It's Huo Wan's doing.

114
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,720
One more thing.

115
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,600
Inside your bedding,

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,439
there was Chancellor Huo's
unique Heartbreak Powder.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,839
I took care of it.

118
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,519
The Huo family's assassins
have the nerve

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,720
to infiltrate the palace.

120
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,439
Without an inside helper,

121
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,279
how could they act so brazenly?

122
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,439
Ten taels of silver.

123
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,639
I bet up there,

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,279
Huo Wan's maid is counting roof tiles.

125
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,279
We truly are a pair of doomed lovebirds.

126
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:11,920
It seems your place

127
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,560
isn't very safe either.

128
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,000
Where are you hurt? Is it bad?

129
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,199
It's nothing.

130
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,920
A minor wound is hardly worth mentioning

131
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,720
for a martial artist.

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,839
You know...

133
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,720
Wait.

134
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:29,639
You...

135
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:31,800
What is this?

136
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,519
Xie Fei gave it to you?

137
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,639
The one for me is put away.

138
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,200
He prepared this one
specifically for you,

139
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,879
just in case you needed it.

140
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,879
Don't worry.

141
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,360
It works well.

142
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
(Xie Fei.)

143
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,039
(I didn't know you'd be so cunning.)

144
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,919
We're both in danger.

145
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,879
I wonder if things

146
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,559
are going well with Huaiyong.

147
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,960
I never realized my closest confidant
wasn't truly mine,

148
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,840
but my father's.

149
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,120
I...

150
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,639
I...

151
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,480
Every single item here

152
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,799
is something favored
by the Grand Princess.

153
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
What is my father up to?

154
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,919
Your Majesty, please calm down.

155
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:29,639
This...

156
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:30,960
This...

157
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,320
Chancellor Huo did it for you.

158
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,279
If you don't conceive soon,

159
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,679
the Huo family will send ladies
from collateral branches.

160
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,639
Spare me, Your Majesty.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,200
My entire family serves the Chancellor.

162
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,039
I had no choice
but to obey Chancellor Huo.

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,000
Your Majesty, I've been

164
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
serving you wholeheartedly...

165
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,200
Take her away.

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Your Majesty.

167
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,424
Spare me.

168
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:56,360
Feed her to the fish.

169
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,240
Your Majesty.

170
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,399
Spare me, Your Majesty.

171
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,679
Your Majesty.

172
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,879
Spare me.

173
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,240
Your Majesty.

174
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
Your Majesty.

175
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,240
Investigate everyone around me again.

176
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,279
Get rid of anyone related

177
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,840
to Chancellor Huo.

178
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,000
Understood.

179
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,159
By the way,

180
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,679
what is Sheng Yunfei doing?

181
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,720
Summon her to attend to me.

182
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,600
(Isn't this the incense
of the Weiyang Palace?)

183
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,159
(Huo Wan loves a strong aroma.)

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,360
(Why is she...?)

185
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,360
This ebony agarwood incense

186
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,360
is that woman's favorite scent.

187
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,320
I detest it, yet I've used it

188
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,960
for three years.

189
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,480
A full three years.

190
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,720
Because he likes it.

191
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,559
He likes his own sister.

192
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,639
This I have always known.

193
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,399
But I can't accept it.

194
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,480
How could I ever accept it?

195
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,360
I finally managed to get rid of her,

196
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,000
only to welcome
someone so similar to her.

197
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,840
Isn't heaven playing tricks on me?

198
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,759
I have just finished bathing.

199
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,519
Please clean this up, Miss Sheng.

200
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:59,600
(What game is Huo Wan playing?)

201
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,399
(Things are complicated in the palace.)

202
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,120
(I must be careful.)

203
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,960
(Remaining still is the best strategy.)

204
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,679
Resemblance might be a good thing,

205
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,360
but you're too much like her.

206
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,080
This face of yours

207
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
will bring you disaster.

208
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,879
And that Sheng family of Yunnan

209
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,440
is merely clinging to life.

210
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,960
(Huo Wan.)

211
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,480
(Do you know the pain
of being burned alive?)

212
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,960
(I will return this pain
to you tenfold.)

213
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,399
(I'll make you lose everything
you own and cherish,)

214
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,440
(cast out by your family,)

215
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,840
(despised by the world,)

216
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,080
(and suffer for eternity.)

217
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:36,879
(No.)

218
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,960
(Not now.)

219
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,128
(Chancellor Huo hasn't fallen.)

220
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,759
(Qi State is watching closely.)

221
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,559
(Yu is still in trouble.)

222
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,679
(I can't.)

223
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,879
You wretch! How dare you!

224
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:53,080
Why wouldn't I dare?

225
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,120
Your Majesty,

226
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,000
things are not as good
as they used to be for you now.

227
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,919
You should be prudent
in what you do and say.

228
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,559
Feel free

229
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,200
to clean this bathtub yourself.

230
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,679
(Now that I've turned against Father,)

231
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,960
(if I fail to conceive a child soon,)

232
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,440
(I'll be heading to my doom.)

233
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,159
