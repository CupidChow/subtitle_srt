00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:56,064
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,918
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,039
You've traveled a long way.

4
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,079
We are so blessed.

5
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,200
This rascal

6
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,719
actually managed
to find a fairy like you.

7
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
You have no idea

8
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,959
how he's been acting these years.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,319
He got gray hair so young.

10
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,640
I almost thought he'd become a monk.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,239
That's way too exaggerated.

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,400
You brat.

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,879
You didn't tell me a thing.

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,319
I thought the Xie line
would end with you.

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,000
It's fine.

16
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,280
He's thick-skinned.

17
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,959
Even if you cut off his flesh,

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,200
he wouldn't cry out.

19
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,280
What?

20
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,920
Feeling for him already?

21
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,000
Madam.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,879
Don't you mind that

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,799
I look like...

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
The Grand Princess?

25
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,799
Looking like the Grand Princess

26
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,000
is a blessing many could only dream of.

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,319
But people say that

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,239
she was a threat to the state.

29
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,000
Pah!

30
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,239
Only fools say that.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,400
The Regent Princess
was second only to His Majesty.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,719
What could Qi offer her?

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,280
In my heart,

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,759
she is a true heroine.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
Mother is right.

36
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,199
These are humble gifts
I've prepared for you, Madam.

37
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,000
I hope you'll like them.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,400
As expected,

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,039
girls tend to be more thoughtful.

40
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,120
So pretty.

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
You're such a pretty girl.

42
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,280
And so well-mannered.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,319
Huaiyong is so lucky.

44
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,800
Feel at ease

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,000
and stay here for a few days.

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
Tell me if you need anything.

47
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,919
I'll make sure
everything is perfectly arranged.

48
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,360
Alright.

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,680
Huaiyong,

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,080
aren't you on duty at the palace today?

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,439
I'm afraid

52
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,240
His Majesty is quite occupied today.

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,800
The empress must be gone today.

54
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,560
Come again?

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,039
Congratulations.

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,919
Her Majesty is with child.

57
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
Is this true?

58
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,599
We dare not deceive Your Majesty.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,680
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

60
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,879
I will take great care of myself

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,840
and give birth to our child.

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
I respectfully see Your Majesty off.

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,439
Watch her closely.

64
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,560
Report any unusual activity.

65
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,439
Have you heard, Prince Mu?

66
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,159
Her Majesty is with child.

67
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,240
Her grounding is lifted.

68
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

69
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,120
My buddy.

70
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,560
Calm down.

71
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,000
Chancellor Huo's daughter
carries the royal heir.

72
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,199
Then what about your deal?

73
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,519
It's been so many years.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,959
Why is she suddenly pregnant?

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,920
But you know all her plans.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,399
She won't let you go.

77
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,399
Indeed.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,160
What should I do?

79
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,319
What should I do?

80
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,920
- Out.
- Out.

81
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,000
What a pity.

82
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,759
I'm just a free-roaming martial artist.

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,040
I can't handle such matters.

84
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,360
But

85
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,360
if Her Majesty couldn't
carry this child to term...

86
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,360
You want me to kill that child?

87
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,639
- No, no.
- That's not...

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,360
That's not what I meant.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,120
I'm merely concerned for you.

90
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,519
Think about it.

91
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,040
Who is Chancellor Huo?

92
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
He's the man in power,
second only to His Majesty.

93
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,240
But...

94
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,120
if...

95
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,079
with support

96
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,360
from the top...

97
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,279
Come on.

98
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:20,920
My buddy.

99
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,439
Come on.

100
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,759
My buddy.

101
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,800
If we report this to His Majesty,

102
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,120
he will take care of it himself.

103
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,439
Your safety is what matters.

104
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,920
Cheers.

105
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,360
I have to go.

106
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,319
Go ahead.

107
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,879
This way.

108
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,160
My lord, Chen Can is here.

109
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,560
W-What do you want?

110
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,879
I invited Your Highness here

111
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,920
to reassure you

112
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,279
that regardless of the gender
of Empress' child,

113
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,800
it will not affect

114
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,560
our collaboration.

115
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,240
I don't believe it.

116
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
That child shares your blood.

117
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,720
Your Highness,

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,680
blood ties are the most unreliable.

119
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,600
The Ninth Lord rebelled.

120
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,000
Wasn't Chen Ye blood-related
to the late Emperor?

121
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,639
Yet what happened?

122
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,079
From ancient times,

123
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,319
in royal families,

124
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,160
it's more than common
for fathers and sons,

125
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,800
and brothers to kill each other.

126
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,759
Alliances based on blood tie

127
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,079
face changes at any time.

128
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,360
But those built on shared interests

129
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,279
are the strongest.

130
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,040
If Your Highness continues to waver,

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
don't blame me...

132
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
In that case,

133
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,120
I'll trust you.

134
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,959
Good.

135
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,759
From now on, the Huo family

136
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,279
relies entirely on Your Highness.

137
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,000
Go back there.

138
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,560
Keep watching for me.

139
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,720
Understood.

140
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,360
How could Master do that?

141
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,920
No need to be mad.

142
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,800
He abandoned me,

143
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,079
so I've abandoned him too.

144
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,279
Any progress with the banquet?

145
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,000
Your Majesty,

146
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:56,160
invitations went out
to all senior ministers'

147
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,480
ladies and daughters,

148
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,920
including Xie Fei's fiancée.

149
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:02,959
Good.

150
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
When the time comes,

151
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,439
let's enjoy the show.

152
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,680
Mother,

153
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,000
Her Majesty

154
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:19,199
invites you and Yunfei

155
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,079
to the palace banquet
on the fifteenth next month.

156
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:24,639
(Invitation)
Yunfei is invited, too?

157
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,079
Yes.

158
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,360
Clearly, she's up to no good.

159
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Yunfei, feel free to stay.

160
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,720
I'll explain to Her Majesty
on your behalf.

161
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,919
I should accept your kindness, Madam.

162
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,000
But

163
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,000
since I have nothing to hide,

164
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I don't mind going.

165
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,320
That's right.

166
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,320
But...

167
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,960
Be it fortune or misfortune,

168
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,639
I must face it.

169
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,720
Don't worry, Madam. I have a plan.

170
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,679
Yeah, and I'll be there too.

171
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,639
Rest assured,
I won't let them bully you.

172
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,720
Huaiyong,

173
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,840
prepare some clothing for her

174
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,879
to attend the banquet.

175
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,240
Remember.

176
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,600
Make sure the clothing
matches her peerless beauty.

177
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,720
Understood.

178
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,759
Alright.

179
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,440
I'll get the clothes.

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,440
Look around.

181
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,357
(Confidential Memorial)

182
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
When I thought you had perished,

183
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,639
these memorials

184
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,360
saw me through night after night.

185
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
No wonder they look

186
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,000
so worn.

187
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,320
I didn't know

188
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,840
you'd be so sentimental, my lord.

189
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,000
Your Highness,

190
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,360
back then, held back by doubts,

191
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,639
I couldn't voice my love.

192
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,840
Tormented by regret every night,

193
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,799
I lay sleepless.

194
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,279
Fortunately,

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
heaven took pity on me

196
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
for my sincere remorse,

197
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
and granted me another chance.

198
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,879
I won't make the same mistake.

199
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,360
Your Highness,

200
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,559
from the moment I saw you,

201
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,000
you've been

202
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,720
my only love.

203
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,799
Your Highness,

204
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,519
have some tea.

205
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,000
Yunfei,

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,360
do you like the clothes

207
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,240
Huaiyong prepared?

208
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,639
I picked some jewelry for you.

209
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:19,799
I hope you like them.

210
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,519
I didn't see anything.

211
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,320
Carry on.

212
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,720
Carry on.

213
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:36,759
Well...

214
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,759
You should change first.

215
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,759
Yeah, get changed.

216
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,159
I'll come later.

217
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,279
