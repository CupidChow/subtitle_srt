1
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:56,128
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:58,982
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,640
In the misty bamboo grove,

4
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,680
she comes with quiet grace.

5
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,359
Yunfei,

6
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,959
I heard there's a temple ahead.

7
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,959
Its divinations are remarkably accurate.

8
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,000
I never expected
the carefree Seventeenth Prince

9
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,400
to believe in Buddha.

10
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,200
Do you believe in Buddha?

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,680
(If gods and Buddhas truly existed,)

12
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,400
(how could they allow
all the evil in this world?)

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,480
(But it matters not.)

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,239
(Someone must dispense justice
in their stead.)

15
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,523
(Divination result)

16
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,280
Yunfei, look.

17
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,480
Master.

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,640
Have you two come seeking marital fate?

19
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,480
No.

20
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,480
How is it not?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,799
We are indeed here
seeking our marital fate.

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,680
Judging by your faces,

23
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,319
you are truly a perfect match,

24
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,560
rare indeed.

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,719
Of course.

26
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,079
Which of you will draw
a fortune stick first?

27
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:03,200
(The fourteenth lot)

28
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,488
Achieve your rightful place.

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,479
This

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,080
is clearly a lucky sign.

31
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:10,879
Master,

32
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,439
interpret it for us.

33
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,000
Are this young lady and I
a match made in heaven?

34
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,879
You harbor affection for the lady.

35
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,560
What a pity.

36
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,120
Really a pity.

37
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,080
What did you just say?

38
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:27,400
I mean

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,439
you two are blessed with a fine match
bestowed by heaven.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,319
Do not hesitate or waver,
lest you lose this destined union.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,560
Yunfei,

42
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,360
do you recall what I mentioned days ago

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
about proposing to you?

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,919
Once peace returns to our lands,

45
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,280
I'll propose with all the honor
of a consort.

46
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,159
Doesn't the fortune we drew today

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,199
clearly signifies

48
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,560
that our bond is ordained by heaven?

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,120
Ordained by heaven?

50
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,759
Or perhaps by fortune?

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,159
I...

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,319
They're here.

53
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,080
Let's go.

54
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,000
It's saltpeter.

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,720
Someone uses the temple as cover,

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,759
making gunpowder and weapons.

57
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,920
Temples do refine elixirs,

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,319
so if discovered,

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,959
they can easily brush it off.

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,959
How did you discover this?

61
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Chancellor Huo sent men
to tail and kill me.

62
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,120
Am I not allowed to tail his men?

63
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,439
Chancellor Huo?

64
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,000
You mean...

65
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,600
He is no longer content

66
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,399
with being second only to the sovereign?

67
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,560
He intends to rebel?

68
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,680
What a pity.

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,279
Grand Tutor Xie isn't here today.

70
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,600
He misses this shattering secret.

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,959
I wonder if his mission goes smoothly.

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Entering the fray alone,
risking everything,

73
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,240
and willing to be your most useful pawn.

74
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
Even I, his rival in love,

75
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,120
feel a sliver of admiration.

76
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,639
But then again,

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,920
am I not also a part of your plan?

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,000
Between us, it's merely
a mutually beneficial arrangement.

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,279
It was before.

80
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,720
Now, it's not.

81
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,600
I wish to become
your more valuable piece.

82
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,040
Alright, Yunfei?

83
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,439
Alright, move dishes.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,560
As expected, I still cannot beat you.

85
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,920
I am filled with trepidation.

86
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,199
Why such words?

87
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,959
Your Majesty,

88
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,920
at first glance, this game seems

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,199
as if I hold the upper hand.

90
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
Yet upon closer inspection,

91
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,160
you have laid a subtle trap,

92
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,879
encircling me.

93
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,920
In chess,

94
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,839
you remain superior.

95
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,639
Since you see through my scheme,

96
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,199
how can it be called superior?

97
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,199
Your move goes straight for the jugular.

98
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,480
Even if I see it,

99
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,120
I can only submit.

100
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,839
Enough.

101
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,920
I concede defeat.

102
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,959
In chess, none surpasses you.

103
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,240
You summoned me today

104
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,839
not merely to play a few games, right?

105
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
I host a banquet at the academy tonight.

106
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,360
Then,

107
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,384
join me for a few drinks.

108
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

109
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,120
Yunfei,

110
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,279
what you promised me is true, right?

111
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,920
You truly wish to always be with me...

112
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,519
Always what?

113
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,319
Always.

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,199
Always?

115
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,000
Winds are strong.

116
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,160
I made you ginger soup.

117
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,560
Remember to drink it.

118
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,319
You're still here?

119
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,399
Sorry,

120
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,519
I didn't prepare ginger soup for you.

121
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,319
It's fine, brother.

122
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,279
Just don't catch a chill.

123
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,480
Yunfei,

124
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,519
don't forget what you promised me.

125
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,040
What a jealous tone.

126
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,560
What did you promise?

127
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,800
What will you always do?

128
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,399
Didn't I tell you before?

129
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,360
You...

130
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,680
What prohibitions do you have

131
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,959
that I am unaware of?

132
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,120
And what else should I not do?

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,959
Tell me.

134
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,439
We've obtained the treasonous letter
forged by Jia Cheng.

135
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,112
Chancellor Huo knows too.

136
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,919
Huo Wan saved Jia Cheng back then.

137
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,960
Next, they'll take the stage.

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,480
We just need to watch the show unfold.

139
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,480
Soon enough, we'll witness

140
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,279
a grand dog-eat-dog spectacle.

141
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,200
Brother,

142
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,759
what exactly happened?

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,720
What happened tonight
isn't for your eyes.

144
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,519
Leave now.

145
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,279
I still feel

146
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,960
it's too risky for you to go personally.

147
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,879
The seeds he sowed that day

148
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,039
are the fruits he reaps today.

149
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,080
Don't worry.

150
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:18,752
I know what I'm doing.

151
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,039
Your Majesty,

152
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,879
it's best to drink less cold wine
at night.

153
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,360
Don't harm your health.

154
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
Greetings, Your Majesty.

155
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

156
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,879
Well, Sheng Yunlin,

157
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,519
guess if the fires of abyss

158
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,480
will turn you to ashes

159
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,919
in an instant?

160
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,120
(It's you?)

161
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,840
(How can there be
such a striking resemblance?)

162
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
(She... She is...)

163
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
By the Seventeenth Prince of Qi
stands a woman

164
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:38,759
of remarkable agility,

165
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,440
who looks just like the Grand Princess.

166
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,039
In my eyes, the woman

167
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,000
beside Grand Tutor Xie

168
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,879
is also quite beautiful.

169
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,639
Thank you for the kind words.

170
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,279
This is my fiancée,

171
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,544
the third daughter of the Sheng family.

172
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,080
Yunnan's customs are liberal.

173
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,720
She enjoys traveling.

174
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,000
She came to Zhuozhou to visit me.

175
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,600
Learning of Your Majesty's
banquet today,

176
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,320
I took the liberty of bringing her
to broaden her horizons.

177
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,120
Sister?

178
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,799
How could you...

179
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,480
She is only nineteen and naturally shy.

180
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,679
Forgive her if she amuses you.

181
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,919
Your Majesty.

182
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,639
Your Majesty!

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Women from the Sheng family
often share similar features.

184
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,440
Had you not generously pardoned them,

185
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,240
how could a Sheng

186
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,440
be worthy of attending this banquet?

187
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,000
How could she
deserve you calling her Sister?

188
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,120
Grand Tutor Xie,

189
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,320
aren't you being too hasty?

190
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,600
After all, she hasn't married you.

191
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,639
How improper to parade her about.

192
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,799
You're right.

193
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,639
Sit.

194
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,328
Thank you, Your Highness.

195
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
Plain wine is dull.

196
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,840
I've arranged some fine entertainment.

197
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,039
Let us enjoy it together.

198
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,159
Your Majesty, may I ask

199
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,440
what kind of entertainment is it?

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,879
So I may know and have fun too.

201
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,559
I heard an amusing tale
circulating recently.

202
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,360
A scholar killed his own retainer,

203
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:11,759
yet claimed his innocence.

204
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,679
Hearing this story,

205
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
my curiosity is piqued.

206
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,440
So I summoned you to this banquet
for personal questioning.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,679
(Why...)

208
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,600
(Why would he personally
interrogate Jia Cheng?)

209
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,360
(Three years ago)
Your Majesty.

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,320
Ruthless and vicious,
with a vulture's heart and talons.

211
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,120
This bears my father's style.

212
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,559
You have given me a second life.

213
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,200
I would give my life for you,

214
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,120
even at the cost of my life.

215
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,320
You write the letter
accusing the Grand Princess

216
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,960
of treason?

217
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,960
You mean...

218
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,559
Answer only yes or no.

219
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,039
Yes, yes.

220
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,840
Yes.

221
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,799
Whether you live through today

222
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,759
depends entirely on your performance.

223
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,279
Master Jia,

224
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,919
please recreate this letter identically.

225
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,879
It truly matches the Grand Princess's
handwriting perfectly.
