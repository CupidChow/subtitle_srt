00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:56,064
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,918
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,519
Bring me the brush.

4
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,760
Cheng.

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,808
What do you think?

6
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,120
(The Reign of Yao and Shun)

7
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,879
Isn't this
the Grand Princess' handwriting?

8
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:32,760
(It's him after all.)

9
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:35,159
(As my personal secretary,)

10
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,879
(he's skilled at imitating)

11
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,760
(my handwriting.)

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,799
All of you, get out.

13
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,799
I want to live.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
I want to live.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,480
Die!

16
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,959
Stay back.

17
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,239
Die!

18
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,480
Jia Cheng.

19
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,799
I have come to see you.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,719
Your Highness?

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,400
Your Highness.

22
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,199
Since ancient times,
beauties and famed generals

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,759
are not meant to show
the toll of years to mortal eyes.

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,719
You are growing old here.

25
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,199
But I have been

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,879
terribly lonely in the underworld.

27
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,080
Jia Cheng,

28
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,599
have you forgotten

29
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,680
who brought you into the palace?

30
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,000
How dare you betray me?

31
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,960
Kill him for me now.

32
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,680
Pay for my master's death.

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Sheng Yunlin.

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,280
Are you a vengeful ghost
from the underworld?

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Lord Jia killed someone!

36
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,840
Help!

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Help!

38
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,080
Lord Jia killed someone!

39
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,240
Help!

40
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:30,919
Let's go.

41
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,759
Blood!

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,159
A body!

43
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,319
Why would he kill his own retainer?

44
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,319
Stop staring. Report to the authorities.

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,560
Report it now.

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,240
Report it now.

47
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,080
How am I

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,199
going to run my business?

49
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,080
Oh, my heavens!

50
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,152
Where is the killer?

51
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,719
He already vanished so soon.

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,719
Search. He couldn't have gone far.

53
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,800
To make them fall out,

54
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,120
you must corner them first.

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,479
Once they fall out,

56
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,112
the mastermind shows up.

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,079
To spare a rival invites a future doom.

58
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,000
Lure the snake, and seal its tomb.

59
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,199
The Ghost Fire killed
his retainer today.

60
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,519
What a great show.

61
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,560
They're after you.

62
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,800
Our cooperation ends here.

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,759
Leave.

64
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,560
I disagree.

65
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,560
(Chancellor, Huo Chengyun)

66
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,480
The assassination failed.
I await punishment.

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,959
The Prince of Qi
had a woman by his side.

68
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Great martial artist.

69
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
She looks exactly like
the Grand Princess.

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,040
(The Grand Princess?)

71
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,165
(Wedding of the New Emperor Chen Yu)

72
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,519
Yuan!

73
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Sheng Yunlin!

74
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,560
Mark my words.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,360
I'll kill you with my own hands.

76
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,040
It's His Majesty's wedding.

77
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,959
Chancellor Huo's son, Huo Yuan,

78
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,839
harassed me first

79
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:23,480
then attempted to murder me.

80
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,399
To protect myself,

81
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,279
I executed him on the spot.

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,279
Should anyone object,

83
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,040
it would be disloyalty
and disrespect toward

84
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,639
His Majesty.

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,920
I failed to discipline my son.

86
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,439
I am guilty.

87
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,800
I beg Your Highness for forgiveness.

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,399
Really?

89
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,319
Absolutely.

90
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,800
It's all because of

91
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,759
that woman...

92
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,519
Chancellor, he mentioned
the Grand Princess.

93
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,480
The Grand Princess

94
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,240
simply wouldn't let go.

95
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,040
Is there something behind it?

96
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,879
Recently,

97
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,360
several murders have occurred.

98
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Feng Yuan and Xue Ruoliu

99
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,560
perished in phosphorescent flames.

100
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,439
Su Wei died in a fire
caused by lightning.

101
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,920
All fire-related.

102
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,959
History is written by the victors.

103
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,120
In this lifetime's chess game,

104
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,959
I have narrowly won by half a move.

105
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,519
But I respect an opponent like you,

106
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,199
who made the game more satisfying.

107
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,160
Enjoy the wine

108
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,439
on your way

109
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,040
to the underworld.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,160
It seems someone is plotting

111
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,879
to do the Grand Princess justice.

112
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,720
Fine.

113
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,919
Then I will

114
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,799
take you all down.

115
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,039
Sheng Yunlin,

116
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,720
how many lives do you think you have?

117
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,240
Bear with it.

118
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,159
Your medicine

119
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,720
works remarkably well.

120
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,879
Why haven't you ever shared it with me?

121
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,480
The medicine wasn't ready yet,

122
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,480
and you were already gone.

123
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,279
I've stirred the court

124
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,919
and was in grave danger

125
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
due to the schemers.

126
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,320
I've also drawn the bow,

127
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,720
fought on battlefields,
and survived against all odds,

128
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,159
expecting only to die
wrapped in horsehide.

129
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,399
But I have never been

130
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
as afraid

131
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,399
as I am now.

132
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,399
All this...

133
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,559
I was consumed by fire,
but it felt like a dream.

134
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,240
When I awoke,

135
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,440
I was in a performance troupe.

136
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,639
The manager beat me at will.

137
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,960
Then, I tried to seek refuge

138
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,399
at the Chaohuang Academy,

139
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,879
only to find everything had changed.

140
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,679
I've been wandering around.

141
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,759
It's only normal to have some wounds.

142
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,200
You didn't

143
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,440
come find me

144
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:37,088
because you didn't trust me?

145
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,759
This is the path I must walk,

146
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,639
even if it's paved with thorns,

147
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,919
even if demons block the way.

148
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,600
I will tread over them all.

149
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,799
Since Heaven has granted me
a second chance at life,

150
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,879
I swear I will

151
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,840
discover the truth on my own.

152
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,559
How is she?

153
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,360
She's fine.

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,919
Go back and rest.

155
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,159
Is she badly hurt?

156
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,639
If you could defend yourself,

157
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:51,840
she would...

158
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,360
I'm fine.

159
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,360
Sit.

160
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,720
We need to talk.

161
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,584
Why did you risk your life for me?

162
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,600
Aren't we partners?

163
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,679
Besides,

164
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,360
I saved the Seventeenth Prince of Qi.

165
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,399
This deal

166
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,559
is hardly a loss, right?

167
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,960
My people reported that

168
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,120
the assassins were
Chancellor Huo's shadow guards.

169
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,200
So they were after you,
Seventeenth Prince.

170
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,559
Quite popular with assassins, huh?

171
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,159
My lady,

172
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,799
if you want to talk about this,

173
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,639
then I won't hide anything.

174
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
Qi State faces internal strife.

175
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,000
King Liang and the Crown Prince
are locked in conflict.

176
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,799
So, you...?

177
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,679
I side with the Crown Prince.

178
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,759
Otherwise, why would

179
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,720
King Liang's lackey,

180
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,679
Chancellor Huo, send assassins?

181
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,519
So the traitor

182
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,519
is him.

183
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,200
That's right.

184
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,399
Can the Chen State

185
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,279
truly withstand the Qi State?

186
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,399
Your Crown Prince advocates peace.

187
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,159
Only King Liang

188
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,840
lusts for power and war.

189
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,320
Seventeenth Prince,

190
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,720
you support the Crown Prince.

191
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,120
Surely you don't want wars, right?

192
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,000
Of course not.

193
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,159
After all, my fair Grand Princess

194
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,960
has returned.

195
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,799
Since you know that she's

196
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,039
the Grand Princess,

197
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
address her respectfully as

198
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,159
"Your Highness".

199
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,559
Hands off me.

200
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,879
My lady, look at him.

201
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,679
I hate schemes and court politics.

202
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,440
I'd even marry into Chen
as Prince Consort,

203
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,679
and never attend court.

204
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
I just don't get it.

205
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,399
Some people

206
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,200
rejected the marriage proposal. Huh?

207
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,399
So curious.

208
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,039
I don't think you're badly injured

209
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:13,759
since you're so talkative.

210
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,279
I could totally

211
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,440
administer some poison to the dressing
you need to change every three days.

212
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,639
Let go.

213
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,759
Since you treated my lady's wound,

214
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,039
I'll tell you

215
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,159
what truly caused
the Chen State's defeat back then.
