00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:56,189
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,043
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,439
I heard

4
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,840
following today's court,

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,079
Duke Ying and Grand Tutor Liu

6
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,200
were both assassinated.

7
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,599
The Empress did it.

8
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,239
Yes.

9
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
Now, the palace

10
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,319
is heavily guarded.

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,439
Even a master thief like me
couldn't sneak in.

12
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,280
She had co-opted
the Imperial Guard commander.

13
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,719
With His Majesty's illness,

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,840
she tightened palace security,

15
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,159
and controlled the Imperial Guard.

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,200
And you're playing chess?

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,560
If we don't stay calm now,

18
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,599
we'll never find a solution.

19
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,920
This Empress's ruthlessness is no less

20
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,040
than Chancellor Huo's.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,359
News came from Qi State.

22
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,319
It says she has long colluded
with King Liang.

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
The Qi envoy will arrive
in the capital soon.

24
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,760
It seems King Liang

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,519
has deep ties with the Empress.

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,319
Now the Sheng army's name is cleared.

27
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,919
The pieces we planted

28
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,400
can finally be put to use.

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,879
When the Qi envoy enters Chen,

30
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,639
I need you

31
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,759
to use every means possible

32
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,479
to delay the envoy
King Liang sends to the city.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
Seventeenth Prince,

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,479
the envoy entering Chen from Qi State

35
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,080
must be you.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,759
I will not fail.

37
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,199
If I guess it right,

38
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,360
the palace will soon issue
a lockdown order.

39
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,439
A lockdown order?

40
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,280
The Empress took
all officials' families into the palace.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,680
Her wolfish ambition
is now plain to see.

42
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,960
Get into the palace
before the lockdown order is issued.

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,319
Don't worry.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,000
Return to me alive.

45
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,840
(Your Highness,)

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,120
(take care of yourself.)

47
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,800
(Once this is over,)

48
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,639
(we'll never be apart again.)

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,960
Where are you?

50
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,599
Lady Yunfei.

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,879
With heavy guard everywhere now,

52
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,319
how do we escape this tightly

53
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,439
surrounded place?

54
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:27,840
Yes.

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,400
Yeyou Court is where servants live.

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,319
No one guards it.

57
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,520
I must ask you all to bear
with this for now.

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,080
Follow me!

59
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,280
Go!

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,080
I deserve death.

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,599
The Empress threatened
His Majesty's life,

62
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,120
forcing me to surrender
the Imperial Guard token.

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,319
Huo Wan burned her bridges.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,120
Such a brazen move
was beyond expectation.

65
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:50,944
Not your fault.

66
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,240
Take me to see Yu now.

67
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:52,960
Yes.

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,439
Your Majesty, I advise you

69
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,759
to obediently draft the edict,

70
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,960
appointing me as regent.

71
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,879
We are husband and wife.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,479
Moreover, within my womb

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,840
already lies your flesh and blood.

74
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,879
What is there to worry about?

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,680
Whether you draft this edict or not,

76
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,240
the throne will belong
to the child in my womb.

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,519
Oh, right.

78
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,800
The imperial physician has checked it.

79
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,279
It's a boy!

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,480
Yu.

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,199
Get up.

82
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,839
What did she make you drink?

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,040
Spit it out!

84
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:19,600
Sister,

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,920
you are here.

86
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,040
In the end, you still

87
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,480
couldn't let go of me.

88
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,519
Isn't that right?

89
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,040
Don't worry.

90
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,040
I've made all the arrangements.

91
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,360
I once served in the Sheng army.

92
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,959
I entered the Imperial Guard
by the Grand Princess's grace.

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,439
For years, I've enjoyed
the imperial favor.

94
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I am willing
to sacrifice everything for you.

95
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,199
Sister,

96
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,600
I have long prepared an edict,

97
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,680
appointing you

98
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,600
to act as regent.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,680
Even if...

100
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,040
Even if I die one day,

101
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,839
in my heart...

102
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,360
In my heart,

103
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,639
I have no regrets.

104
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,839
You won't die.

105
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,199
You won't die.

106
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,680
I will protect the Chen State

107
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,279
and you,

108
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,800
just like in the past.

109
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,920
Yu, lie down.

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,519
Commander Wei.

111
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:00,439
Here.

112
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,680
Go spread the word.

113
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,600
Say that

114
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
the Grand Princess did not die,

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
but the injuries stole her past.

116
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,120
The Lady Yunfei today

117
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,000
is the Grand Princess.

118
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,360
This is

119
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,560
far too risky, isn't it?

120
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,399
The Empress...

121
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
Just go spread the word.

122
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,639
The faster, the better.

123
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,199
Yes.

124
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,360
(Only by drawing
Huo Wan's attention to me)

125
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,079
(will the ministers' family)

126
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,040
(stand a sliver of a chance.)

127
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,519
- Greetings, Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

128
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,720
- Long live the Grand Princess.
- Long live the Grand Princess.

129
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,199
I got hurt and lost my memory for years.

130
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
I appreciate you remembering me.

131
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
From today onward,

132
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,199
you will remain by my side.

133
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,279
The Grand Princess perished

134
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:22,079
in the fire of Weiyang Palace years ago.

135
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:23,720
Lady Yunfei,

136
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,920
how dare you impersonate her?

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,600
Someone.

138
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,040
Seize her!

139
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,160
What?

140
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,000
That fire back then
didn't burn me to death.

141
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,399
I crawled back from the abyss.

142
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,159
You're scared now?

143
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,919
Nonsense!

144
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,559
I saw you with her own eyes...

145
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,039
Saw with your own eyes?

146
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,679
Then you must surely remember

147
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,000
how that fire started.

148
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,200
Now, it's time for you
to taste that same bitterness.

149
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,480
Why are you waiting?

150
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,879
Kill this impostor

151
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,399
for me.

152
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,720
His Majesty is weak,

153
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,600
granting me the authority of regent.

154
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,240
The Imperial Seal

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,399
carries His Majesty's authority.

156
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,200
- Long live the Emperor!
- Long live the Emperor!

157
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't care if you're Lady Yunfei
or the Grand Princess.

158
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,440
This realm is already mine.

159
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,639
What use are your
most devoted subjects now?

160
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,519
Aren't you all kneeling
at my feet this very moment?

161
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,240
Your life

162
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,559
is also in my hands right now.

163
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:43,279
Sheng Yunlin,

164
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,960
did you think living a second life
would let you turn the tables?

165
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,799
She defiled the dead
and offended the regent.

166
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,879
She merits death.

167
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,279
Imperial Guards!

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,159
- Here!
- Here!

169
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,559
Execute this sorceress
by a thousand cuts!

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,879
Report!

171
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,039
Qi envoy wants
to see the Grand Princess.

172
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,039
I was unaware

173
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,399
that the Qi envoy
was the Seventeenth Prince.

174
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,639
Pardon the delay.

175
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,279
Grand Tutor Xie.

176
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,879
It has been many days.

177
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,440
I hadn't expected you

178
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,840
to have gone to welcome
the delegation on my behalf.

179
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,519
It was my duty.

180
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:50,720
I only did my utmost.

181
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,240
Years ago, I heard

182
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,240
that the Grand Princess died.

183
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
My heart was deeply grieved.

184
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,399
Now, seeing the Grand Princess safe,

185
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,799
I am overjoyed.

186
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,039
The Grand Princess's grace today
surpasses even before,

187
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,000
like a celestial maiden
descending to the mortal realm.

188
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,759
You flatter me, Your Highness.

189
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,240
You yourself are a young hero,

190
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,639
remarkable in bearing.

191
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:26,159
News travels remarkably fast
in your Qi State.

192
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,159
The Grand Princess had barely returned

193
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,159
and you rushed to seek an audience.

194
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,200
Back then,

195
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,639
when the Seventeenth Prince
came from Qi to Chen,

196
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,960
I vaguely recall it was to seek the hand

197
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,720
of the Grand Princess in marriage.

198
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,600
Who could have imagined

199
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,639
that a fire in Weiyang Palace

200
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,840
would ruin that splendid match?

201
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,639
How about this?

202
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,360
Why not today?

203
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,919
I'll play matchmaker

204
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,120
and let you rekindle
your past romance, okay?

205
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,080
Since when did my marriage

206
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,320
become the Empress's place to decide?

207
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,679
You couldn't possibly think

208
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,720
that you're still ruling
behind the screen, do you?

209
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,679
Open your eyes and see.

210
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,519
In today's Chen State,

211
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,200
who's really holding the reins of power?

212
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,320
The Empress

213
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,480
governs the Chen State now.

214
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,200
Your word is sacred.

215
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,240
You can't jest with me.

216
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,840
My visit this time

217
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,159
brings only gifts.

218
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,559
But if someday

219
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,240
I engage to the Grand Princess,

220
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:45,879
within ten days

221
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,159
I'll return
with a grand dowry procession

222
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,600
delivered straight
to the Chen royal family.

223
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,080
Since the Seventeenth Prince

224
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,799
wishes to show sincerity,

225
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,399
how about

226
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,600
returning the lands
Chen State ceded three years ago

227
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:03,759
as betrothal gifts?

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,440
One matter at a time.

229
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,639
Her Highness has now agreed

230
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,279
that if war resumes this year,

231
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,480
you must cede territory

232
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,080
before ceasing fire.

233
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,679
I

234
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,759
intend to reconcile with Qi State

235
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,039
and restore friendly relations.

236
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,519
Specific terms

237
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,039
will be discussed another day
at Qinian Hall.

238
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,320
Today, let's first welcome
the Seventeenth Prince

239
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,279
and his delegation.

240
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,080
May Chen and Qi States
foster amicable relations,

241
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,679
and may their people
live in peace and prosperity.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,960
Lord Xie has instructed

243
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,399
time is limited. Act swiftly.

244
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes.

245
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,559
I know some antidote techniques.

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,159
For Your Majesty...

247
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,120
Well...

248
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,639
Your Majesty, you enjoy robust health.

249
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,000
There are no signs of poisoning.

250
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,559
The sovereign's word is law.

251
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,759
I've been severely unwell
these past days.

252
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,399
Are you suggesting
there's nothing wrong with me?

253
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes.

254
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:42,879
Yes.

255
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,240
It's merely my limited knowledge.

256
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,840
How is His Majesty?

257
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,720
Your Majesty...

258
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,600
The poison afflicting His Majesty
is exceptionally rare.

259
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,679
I need time to study it carefully.

260
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,320
Your Highness,

261
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,080
Imperial Guard informants report.

262
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,639
The ambassador sent
by Qi State's King Liang

263
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,320
is not the Seventeenth Prince.
