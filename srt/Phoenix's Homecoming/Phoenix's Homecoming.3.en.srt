00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:56,154
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:59,008
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,480
Where did you go

4
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,040
so early, my lord?

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,719
I meant to buy some snacks for you,

6
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,239
but heard that Zhuozhou's

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,519
400,000 taels of relief fund was stolen.

8
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,000
Everything is in chaos.

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,280
Really?

10
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,439
What a shame.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,480
So it was Your Highness's scheme.

12
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,519
It's such a heinous crime.

13
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,079
How could you pin it on me, my lord?

14
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,599
I couldn't bear such blame.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,239
You're not a good student.

16
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,239
Lying isn't a good habit.

17
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,120
If you returned

18
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,239
to be the schemer,

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,840
I'll be your pawn,

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,879
at your command.

21
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,960
(I want you to meet Su Wei)

22
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,919
(and tell him what to do.)

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,719
(Will you do it?)

24
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,240
Grand Tutor.

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,879
I didn't

26
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,680
expect that

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,159
only you would come to see me.

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,240
I'm deeply moved.

29
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm just a commoner.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,960
I can't accept
so grand a gesture, Governor.

31
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,879
Are you alright?

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,280
Though you have resigned,

33
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,719
everyone at court knows that

34
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,520
His Majesty values you most.

35
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,400
Besides,

36
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,199
the Xie family has always

37
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,759
held great influence
in the court thanks to its reputation.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,080
I'll keep your secret

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,560
with that handsome young man.

40
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,759
You should know

41
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,960
that I'm here for the millions
of common people

42
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,280
and disaster victims.

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,560
Yeah, I understand, my lord.

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,680
The victims can't wait.

45
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,960
Indeed.

46
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,919
Money is such a marvelous thing.

47
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,800
Everyone craves it.

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,759
I understand, my lord.

49
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,280
As long as you help me get over this,

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,560
I'll offer you 50,000 taels of silver.

51
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,599
You're so generous.

52
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,520
In that case,

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,560
I'll inform my family members

54
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,719
to suppress the news at court.

55
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,520
However,

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,000
400,000 taels isn't a small sum.

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,879
No one could have smuggled it

58
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,520
out of Zhuozhou undetected overnight.

59
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:16,800
Zhuozhou is your territory, Governor.

60
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,079
You'll surely recover the money
sooner or later.

61
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,079
Why don't you

62
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,560
raise 400,000 taels of silver
and deliver it to the disaster zone

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,839
for now?

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,720
But...

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,319
As things stand,

66
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,720
take your time to consider, Governor.

67
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,439
I'll take my leave.

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,360
Thank you for the guidance, Grand Tutor.

69
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,000
I bet Su Wei will have the money

70
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,959
by tomorrow
with his wealth-amassing skills.

71
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,399
Not tomorrow.

72
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,439
He'll have it ready today.

73
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,160
He may even

74
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,879
send you a generous gift.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,839
Would you care to wager with me?

76
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:16,959
No need.

77
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,160
I believe whatever

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,279
Your Highness says.

79
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,279
I-I misplaced it.

80
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,560
I take it back.

81
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,079
When you taught me chess years ago,

82
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,560
didn't you say

83
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,680
that a gentleman
never regrets his moves?

84
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,199
Why did you let me retract that move?

85
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,720
When playing against me,

86
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,199
you always have that privilege.

87
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:12,879
Who is it?

88
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,120
Governor Su sent me
to deliver something, Lord Xie.

89
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,839
I'm deeply impressed, Your Highness.

90
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,639
Su Wei is so generous.

91
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,959
But Grand Tutor,

92
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
are you accepting these?

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,839
When it comes to money,

94
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,680
no one ever feels they have enough.

95
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,560
You'll know in due time

96
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,680
how I will spend the money.

97
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,839
I imagine Su Wei

98
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,560
is nursing his financial wounds at home.

99
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:58,879
My lord.

100
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,800
It took us years to accumulate these.

101
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,439
Giving them away

102
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,000
is like cutting our flesh.

103
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,600
You fool.

104
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,279
Short-sighted.

105
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,759
Do you know how many censors
have impeached me?

106
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,160
Without Lord Xie,

107
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,399
who could shield me from condemnation?

108
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,160
Then why don't we just

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
ask the wealthy for a donation

110
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,120
or impose taxes on commoners?

111
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,959
Why cover the gap with our money?

112
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,480
Do you know why
the Censorate impeached me?

113
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,319
For inadequate disaster relief

114
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,079
and oppressing the people.

115
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,480
Don't worry, my lord.

116
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
As long as we're around, there's hope.

117
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,079
As you instructed,

118
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,279
we bought rice

119
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,680
from farmers at market price.

120
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,560
Tomorrow we'll buy more

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,199
in neighboring towns
to cover the shortage.

122
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,399
Good.

123
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,680
Good.

124
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,279
Tie the red ropes and send the supplies

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,399
to the disaster-stricken areas.

126
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,920
Let every commoner know

127
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,920
that I'm devoted to serving the people.

128
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,680
Understood.

129
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,639
Spare some change.

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,279
Please.

131
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,160
Spare some change.

132
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,600
Show mercy.

133
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:07,839
Thank you.

134
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:08,560
Thank you.

135
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,680
You should understand

136
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,639
the people's suffering.

137
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,639
Commoners have no land to farm.

138
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,040
Merchants profit nothing
under heavy taxes.

139
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,399
Spare some change.

140
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,279
Yet officials sell positions for profit.

141
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,600
I have been busy half my life,

142
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,759
claiming

143
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,759
to serve the state and the people.

144
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,360
But in fact, I'm utterly powerless.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,879
This state belongs

146
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,639
to the Chen family.

147
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,879
My mother was also a Chen.

148
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,240
Thus I see the Chens

149
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,399
as my own kin.

150
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,080
For years, I worked for the Chen State

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,000
only to end up

152
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,000
losing my own life.

153
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
Chancellor Huo holds power now.

154
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,240
What ambitions can you have?

155
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,080
I just wonder how much
my dear brother knew

156
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,519
about what happened

157
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,799
and how much

158
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,919
he was involved.

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,919
His Majesty...

160
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,399
His mind is unfathomable.

161
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,639
There will be time.

162
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,720
We'll uncover the truth.

163
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,519
Is there anything else

164
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,039
I can do for Your Highness?

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,399
I never expected

166
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,480
that you'd grow accustomed so quickly

167
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,159
to being my pawn.

168
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,559
As a pawn,

169
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,200
I naturally obey my master.

170
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,000
Didn't you

171
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,320
want to know how I would

172
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,399
spend the money?

173
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,679
Let me show you.

174
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,424
(Chaohuang Academy)

175
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:24,576
(Chaohuang Academy)

176
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,080
You wrote "Chaohuang Academy"

177
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,679
in person.

178
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,039
Every woman in the Chen State

179
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,120
should be educated

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,480
and enlightened,

181
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,240
regardless of status.

182
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,000
Lord Xie, you've finally come.

183
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,120
You've no idea how much I missed you.

184
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,519
(Hua.)

185
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:04,559
Do you miss me

186
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,679
or the money?

187
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,679
You got me wrong.

188
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,360
Money can't compare to feelings.

189
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,320
You've cared for the Grand Princess

190
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,279
and supported our academy for years.

191
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,759
We are deeply grateful to you.

192
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,480
I did that

193
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,759
for you girls

194
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,840
who, I believe, deserve an education,

195
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,159
not the Grand Princess.

196
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,879
Love-struck fool.

197
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,200
If not for Her Highness,

198
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,960
why would you resign

199
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,200
as Grand Tutor?

200
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,200
When the hare is dead,
the hound is boiled.

201
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,000
His Majesty is ruling now.

202
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,320
Isn't it the wisest move for me to quit?

203
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,120
Then why are you roaming the land,

204
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,679
hunting corrupt officials?

205
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,159
As subjects of the Chen State,

206
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,799
shouldn't we safeguard

207
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,080
the state?

208
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,799
Then why do you fight
those who gossip about

209
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,159
the Grand Princess?

210
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,240
You...

211
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,159
Was that for the people, too?

212
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
Absolutely love-struck.

213
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,279
You said you needed money

214
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,720
to repair the academy.

215
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,840
Well?

216
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,919
Are you going to

217
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,279
slack off now?

218
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,759
Nonsense.

219
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,120
If you're not in a hurry,

220
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
I'll take it back.

221
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,480
You set up the Chaohuang Academy.

222
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,919
I've maintained it,

223
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,240
merely to keep something

224
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,120
that belongs to Your Highness.

225
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,799
Now that

226
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,080
you're back,

227
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,480
the Chaohuang Academy
is restored to its rightful owner.

228
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,759
Why did you come?

229
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,879
My fair lady is so cold-hearted,

230
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,840
not missing me one bit.

231
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,159
Not like me, so devoted,

232
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,679
always thinking of you.

233
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,919
You are loaded.

234
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,480
So you can find romance

235
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,039
at any pleasure house.

236
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,360
And you're handsome.

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,240
Even if short on funds,

238
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,759
you could earn some money

239
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,960
with that face of yours.

240
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,039
With your notorious reputation,

241
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,440
how can you claim devotion?

242
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,000
Fine tea.

243
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,840
This is Chancellor Huo's network

244
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,480
you asked me to investigate.

245
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:51,480
Impressive.

246
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,519
But I've also

247
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
completed the task

248
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,200
you entrusted to me.

249
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,799
That 400,000 taels of silver

250
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
is now in the Chaohuang Academy library.

251
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,559
Early tomorrow morning,

252
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,320
someone will surely see it.

253
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:04,879
I am rather curious.

254
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,759
How will Su Wei explain it?

255
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,639
But my lady,

256
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,120
I'm more curious about something else.

257
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,360
Why do you know Chancellor Huo so well?

258
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,759
We are using each other

259
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,720
and know each other's hidden thoughts.

260
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,440
Some things

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
don't have to be spoken openly.

262
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,600
Well, I merely admire Chancellor Huo.

263
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,919
So I'm observing and learning.

264
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,080
My lady,

265
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,200
I just love

266
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
how you speak riddles.

267
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,000
You were attracted

268
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,120
to Lord Xie last time.

269
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:46,919
And now, to Chancellor Huo.

270
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,279
Your tastes are quite varied.

271
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,039
You're not sincere.

272
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,679
I'm absolutely sincere.

273
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,200
My heart

274
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,200
is always with you.

275
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,240
So my lady,

276
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,919
will you

277
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,279
have me as your beloved?

278
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,759
No, she won't.
