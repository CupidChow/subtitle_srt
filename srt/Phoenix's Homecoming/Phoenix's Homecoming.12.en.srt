00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,096
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:58,950
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,320
Your Majesty.

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,840
I wouldn't dare.

5
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,079
With me here,

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,120
you can do anything.

7
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,000
Your Majesty.

8
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,359
Having watched the show you organized,

9
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,879
I suddenly recall an urgent matter.

10
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:29,840
Speak.

11
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,760
This concerns state secrets.

12
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,159
Unrelated personnel should...

13
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:47,840
Understood.

14
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,359
I thought you had lost all interest

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
in court affairs.

16
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,719
You worthless fool.

17
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,919
Had you not neglected me, Father,

18
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,360
why would I ask

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,159
Jia Cheng to forge
officials' handwriting

20
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,520
to gain leverage

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,479
and secure my position?

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,680
You took in Jia Cheng

23
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,759
and Lu Chengfeng

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,719
to threaten me

25
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,879
when you're cornered.

26
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,759
Did you think you could deceive me?

27
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,400
Plotting to betray me?

28
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,120
Do you remember
that you bear the Huo name?

29
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,120
The Huo name?

30
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,199
Ever since I became Empress,

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,560
have you helped me the slightest?

32
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,800
Search your conscience, Father.

33
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
Do you see me as your daughter?

34
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,319
I'm nothing but a pawn to you.

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,080
A pawn?

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,879
Have I ever held a useless pawn?

37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,879
I've always been sharp.

38
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,719
How did my daughter end up being a fool?

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,039
If you could conceive an imperial heir,

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,400
why would I need

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,280
to support that idiot Prince Mu?

42
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,879
If Yuan were still here...

43
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,639
That's right!

44
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,759
I'm no match for my brother, anyway.

45
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,080
His death serves me well.

46
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,360
Now I'm the only pawn you have left.

47
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,680
What can you do to me?

48
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,159
Jia Cheng is still

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,759
locked up at the academy.

50
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,879
Find a way to kill him.

51
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,280
This isn't a negotiation.

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,479
I'm giving you an order.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
Fail me again,

54
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,639
and you'll cease

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,479
to be Empress.

56
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, Father.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,560
Never forget I'm your daughter.

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,439
I inherited your cruelty.

59
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:29,216
(Lu Chengfeng lost.)

60
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:35,072
(Jia Cheng defected.)

61
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,439
When the Sheng army's name is cleared,

62
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,759
Jia Cheng will face his doom.

63
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,519
I've informed His Majesty

64
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,000
of Chancellor Huo's treason.

65
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,040
His Majesty will feign ignorance

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
and let me gather evidence first.

67
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,759
For convenience,

68
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,720
he reinstated me as Grand Tutor.

69
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,639
Is something wrong?

70
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,920
He still can't let you go

71
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,519
and wants you back at the palace.

72
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,439
This aligns with our plan.

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
Don't worry about it.

74
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,680
But after tomorrow,

75
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,079
you'll walk on thin ice every day.

76
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,439
I truly can't bear...

77
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,160
My decision is final.

78
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,040
Say no more.

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,199
I made this fan for you.

80
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,560
Fiddle with it at leisure,

81
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,240
or wield it

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
as a weapon in danger.

83
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,000
The palace is fraught with danger.

84
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,879
I won't be there...

85
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:03,968
Take care.

86
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,319
Alright.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,240
I'll be careful.

88
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,279
Take care.

89
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,759
Tracking the explosives is critical.

90
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,439
I'm sure it's going to be risky.

91
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,959
We'll fight separately

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,639
once we part ways.

93
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,279
Huaiyong.

94
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
Take good care.

95
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,160
What did you call me?

96
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,480
Huaiyong.

97
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,199
(By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees.)

98
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,680
(I sorely miss my sister,
the Grand Princess,)

99
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,920
(and summon Sheng Yunfei,
the third daughter of the Sheng family,)

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,240
(to the palace.)

101
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,759
(She shall chant sutras
for the Grand Princess's blessings)

102
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:59,079
(and reside in the Weiyang Palace,
the Grand Princess's former abode.)

103
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,000
(By Imperial Decree.)

104
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,920
Set my sovereign above Yao and Shun,
and restore customs to purity.

105
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,600
Upon my ascension today,

106
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,519
I appoint Princess Changyi

107
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,519
as Grand Princess of the Chen State.

108
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,000
She shall act as regent.

109
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,000
(Chancellor Huo plots treason.)

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,199
(So the traitor)

111
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,319
(is him.)

112
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,920
(He framed the Sheng army of treason.)

113
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,879
(Now, I shall settle)

114
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,079
(all scores together.)

115
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,160
I am guilty.

116
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,120
(Since Heaven has granted me
a second chance at life,)

117
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,480
(I will uncover the truth on my own.)

118
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,200
(With my own hands,)

119
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,080
(I shall drag every last one of them)

120
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,879
(down to the underworld
to suffer for eternity.)

121
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,080
Go away.

122
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,279
Get lost.

123
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,279
(For ten years,
fire burned unceasingly.)

124
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
(Red walls and golden tiles
remain the same.)

125
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
(I'll make you repay a hundredfold)

126
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,399
(of the bone-deep agony
from those flames.)

127
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,559
(I, Sheng Yunlin,)

128
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,559
(have returned.)

129
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,879
What brings you here?

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,159
I have sinned and hereby

131
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,200
present my plea for death.

132
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,720
Your Majesty.

133
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,759
(Plea for Death)

134
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,960
Please grant me death.

135
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,360
The world praises you for your virtue

136
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,120
and benevolence.

137
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,440
How have you sinned?

138
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,039
I didn't save the Grand Princess

139
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,440
from the fire at the Weiyang Palace.

140
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,200
Though I copy scriptures and pray,

141
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,639
I can't free myself
from the insufferable guilt.

142
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,320
Rest assured.

143
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,519
During the Weiyang Palace fire,

144
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,480
you broke three ribs

145
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,600
trying to save the Grand Princess.

146
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,480
Had I suspected you,

147
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,080
the Huo family wouldn't have remained.

148
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,879
If you're still haunted by guilt,

149
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,440
pray more often for the Grand Princess.

150
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,480
Thank you for your compassion,

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,039
Your Majesty.

152
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,519
I shall copy Buddhist scriptures

153
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,519
five hundred times
for the Grand Princess.

154
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,000
Yunfei.

155
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,879
The hairpin you wear bears a resemblance

156
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,559
to one belonging
to the late Grand Princess.

157
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,399
What a pity.

158
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,960
She passed away long ago.

159
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,759
Those who look like her

160
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,320
are nothing but substitutes.

161
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,360
You remind me of my sister.

162
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,519
So that's why.

163
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,720
Thank you for your affection.

164
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,399
I bet your sister

165
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,559
must have loved you dearly.

166
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,720
Indeed.

167
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
When I was young,

168
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,480
she sheltered me beneath her wings.

169
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,960
I thought ascending the throne

170
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,360
would ease her burdens.

171
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,919
I aspire to be the great ruler
she had in mind.

172
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,039
You are a great ruler.

173
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,639
No doubt, you are now everything

174
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,559
your sister hoped you would become.

175
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,840
But my sister

176
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,440
is gone forever.

177
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,320
It's all my fault.

178
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,600
I caused her death.

179
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,120
Sister.

180
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,759
Do you know

181
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
how much I miss you?
