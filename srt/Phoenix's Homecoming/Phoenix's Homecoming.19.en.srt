00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:56,094
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,094 --> 00:00:58,948
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,560
What's wrong?

4
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,040
Is your back still sore?

5
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,400
I saw you rubbing it all day.

6
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:20,040
It's nothing.

7
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,519
Xie the ice block.

8
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,319
Whose family leaves a water vat
by the wall?

9
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,879
I've searched all morning for Yunfei.

10
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,040
How did she end up in your courtyard?

11
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,359
This will teach you, you libertine.

12
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
Don't go climbing
over young ladies' walls.

13
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,040
And don't sleep in their beds.

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,599
I...

15
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,079
Have a seat.

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,599
You're a guest here.

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Try these dishes.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,599
See if they're as good as Qi's.

19
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
Yunfei cares for me most.

20
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,680
I've been busy all night.

21
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,560
Didn't sleep a wink. I'm exhausted.

22
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,319
How did things go?

23
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,400
Of course, it's done.

24
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,359
Now the whole capital is saying

25
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,039
the Sheng's third daughter
was possessed by the Grand Princess

26
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,879
and ended Prince Mu's
womanizing permanently.

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,039
Though his life isn't in grave danger,

28
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,960
it's just that

29
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,159
he can't father children.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,159
Yunfei, you're beautiful yet ruthless.

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,280
It even makes me a little scared.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,800
Of course.

33
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,560
For anyone who dares
attempt impropriety with me,

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
I will show no mercy.

35
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,120
Relax.

36
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,800
In this life, I will never betray you.

37
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,120
Nor will I.

38
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,319
How is Chancellor Huo?

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
As for Chancellor Huo,

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,080
here's the thing.

41
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:57,376
Prince Mu has personally admitted

42
00:02:57,376 --> 00:02:59,360
that Chancellor Huo
would make him Crown Prince.

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,400
His ambition is as plain as day.

44
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,159
And the ladies of the capital

45
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,319
love gossip the most.

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,080
Such explosive news

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,240
has spread throughout the entire city.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,439
So now the whole capital knows
he wants to...

49
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,400
Chancellor Huo entered the palace early
to meet His Majesty.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,280
I am guilty.

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,919
Prince Mu secretly operates
28 gunpowder workshops.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,360
All are marked on this map.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,360
A pillar of three dynasties.

54
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,199
Why such a grand gesture?

55
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,240
I was foolish.

56
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,919
How dare I claim to be such a pillar?

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,240
Months ago, I discovered Prince Mu
smuggling gunpowder.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,479
Fearing I might startle him,

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,240
I held my forces back,

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,280
allowing him to run rampant.

61
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:54,439
How...

62
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,560
How could I expect him to turn on me

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,560
and slander the Huo family's honor?

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,719
This foolishness of yours

65
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,719
is more riveting
than Grand Tutor Xie's lectures.

66
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Do you know

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,920
this crackled-glaze teacup

68
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,519
was presented by envoys

69
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,120
from Qi State while the Grand Princess
was still alive?

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,238
I claimed the throne
after the Ninth Lord's Rebellion.

71
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,639
Chancellor Huo single-handedly
stabilized the realm.

72
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,839
I was inexperienced then.

73
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,399
But the gunpowder case now...

74
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,600
You want me to atone
through meritorious service?

75
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,319
Three days.

76
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
Within three days,

77
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,600
I will ensure Prince Mu's

78
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,079
entire saltpeter stock becomes smoke
for the worship.

79
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,959
Your gray hair should be dyed red
with traitors' blood.

80
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:03,600
The Imperial Guard awaits your orders.

81
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,000
Agreed?

82
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:15,079
I would do whatever it takes
to eradicate the traitors.

83
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,240
Someone!

84
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,279
Tell my daughter
that I haven't seen her in a long time

85
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,720
and wish to drink tea made by her.

86
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,639
Yes.

87
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,120
Apologies for keeping you waiting.

88
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,319
It's fine.

89
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,639
It's just that yesterday,

90
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,519
I suffered quite a fright.

91
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,680
The calming tonic kept me awake
half the night.

92
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,879
I only just managed a short nap.

93
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,600
You should prioritize the royal heir.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,079
Focus on resting well.

95
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,680
Only then,

96
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,120
can we unite our hearts
and rely on each other

97
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,439
to achieve our great undertaking.

98
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,160
What happened?

99
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,160
You remember me now?

100
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,959
Look at your weary face, Father.

101
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,240
You must have stayed awake
all last night

102
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,040
and feel exhausted.

103
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,839
You're insane!

104
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,879
I'm insane.

105
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,319
Only if I were insane
would I conspire with a traitor.

106
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:46,528
(For King Liang Only)

107
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,839
Tomorrow morning,

108
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,720
if anyone impeaches Chancellor Huo
for colluding with enemies,

109
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,480
then this letter you sent to King Liang

110
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,240
might just appear on His Majesty's desk.

111
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,319
Beast!

112
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,160
The Huo family's century of glory

113
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,480
can't be destroyed by you alone!

114
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
If not for the parental affection,

115
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,959
I would have...

116
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,800
What would you do?

117
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,199
Parental affection?

118
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:23,519
Father,

119
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,399
let's not mention things
that never existed between us.

120
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,919
However, I will,

121
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,480
out of gratitude for giving me life,

122
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,919
forgive your earlier act of treason.

123
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,399
Father, I am now the ruler,

124
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,519
and you are the subject.

125
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,120
Before you take action next time,

126
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,799
think very carefully.

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,080
But there is one thing

128
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,360
I must discuss with you properly.

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,200
Speak.

130
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,776
Prince Mu has lost his ability
to father children,

131
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
becoming Chancellor Huo's
discarded pawn.

132
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,759
King Liang of the Qi State
is deeply disappointed in you.

133
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,519
He has already found
a more suitable ally.

134
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,679
My child

135
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,320
will surely be the Crown Prince
of Chen State.

136
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
I will have him restore
our former goodwill.

137
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,519
As for former allies,

138
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,200
they can only meet the fate
of being discarded.

139
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,320
Discarded?

140
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,240
Huo Wan,

141
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,759
don't forget.

142
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,919
The child in your womb

143
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,240
carries Huo blood.

144
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,679
If our entire clan is executed,

145
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,919
what then will be your fate?

146
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:07,519
You...

147
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
From this day forth,

148
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,679
the bond between us is severed.

149
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,559
My child will bear the Chen surname.

150
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,799
None of your business!

151
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,759
The pain you inflicted upon me,

152
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,399
I will return

153
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,679
every bit of it to you.

154
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,440
You will watch with open eyes

155
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,519
as I bring the Huo family to ruin

156
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,399
and overturn this court!

157
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,159
You...

158
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,519
Insane.

159
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,600
All gone insane.

160
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,039
The Huo family is finished.

161
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,279
Finished.

162
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,840
Insane?

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,559
No.

164
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,519
I am finally clear-headed.

165
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,519
Rather than groveling

166
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,639
before you pathetic men,

167
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,399
I will seize the realm for myself,

168
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,399
trampling you all underfoot!

169
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,240
When that time comes,

170
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,480
this world

171
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,279
will bow to me alone.

172
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,519
The Chief Justice
was replaced yesterday.

173
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,639
(By the Emperor's Decree)
Evidence of Finance Minister's crime

174
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,840
was sent to His Majesty.

175
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,440
Besides,

176
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,759
the falsely charged
former Vice Revenue Minister

177
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,679
has been reinstated.

178
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,480
His Majesty offered him solace.

179
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,240
The Vice War Minister
was secretly executed at Mou hour.

180
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,879
Secretly executed?

181
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,840
Chen Yu!

182
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,799
For 30 years,

183
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,519
I smoothed over countless wounds
for your Chen family.

184
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,320
And you?

185
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:59,279
You're nothing but a fool

186
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,879
who climbed the throne
on your sister's coattails!

187
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,039
Pah!

188
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,440
I spit on you!

189
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,120
My lord,

190
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,960
His Majesty surrounded the residence
with the Imperial Guard.

191
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,759
Surrounded?

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,720
Yes.

193
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:10,519
Traitor!

194
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,639
- Kill him!
- Colluding with the enemy!

195
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,559
- Deserves death!
- Traitor!

196
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,840
- Traitor!
- Treacherous minister!

197
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,080
- Dog Chancellor!
- Traitor!

198
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,840
Traitor!

199
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,320
- Kill him!
- Traitor!

200
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,560
Treacherous minister!

201
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,759
Grand Historian.

202
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,960
Mark my words.

203
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,639
This realm now exists in the Jinghe era.

204
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,159
Your Feibai calligraphy style

205
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,200
appears more forceful
than the late Emperor's final edict.

206
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,279
Treacherous fool!

207
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,519
Had it not been
for my support back then,

208
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,759
could you have ever secured the throne?

209
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,559
This realm

210
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,559
rightfully belongs to the Huo family.

211
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,879
The Huo family alone
steers this empire's course.

212
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,120
The traitor Huo Chengxuan
secretly crafted imperial robes,

213
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,960
framed the princes,

214
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,840
hoarded gunpowder,

215
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,879
colluded with enemies,

216
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,799
and plotted rebellion!

217
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,519
- Kill him!
- Kill the traitor!

218
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,759
- Traitor!
- Treacherous minister!

219
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:19,639
Traitor!

220
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,639
- Usurper!
- Kill him!

221
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,799
Traitor!

222
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,879
Kill him!

223
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,120
Traitor!

224
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,639
I am the true ruler!

225
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,039
How dare you not kneel?

226
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,840
You once said,

227
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,399
"Hunting boars requires
three-edged arrows."
