1
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:56,058
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:58,912
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,120
On this private visit
to Chaohuang Academy, His Majesty

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,879
took only the Imperial Guards,
a few attendants,

5
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,280
and Huo Wan.

6
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,120
All affairs were entrusted
to Chancellor Huo.

7
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,200
This clearly shows
the Huo family's prominence at court.

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,079
No family remains powerful
in the court forever.

9
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,616
One rises, another falls.

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,920
It's just the Emperor's art
of maintaining balance.

11
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,799
The last disciple
has surpassed his teacher,

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
seeing through affairs
with piercing clarity.

13
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,879
But as for this Empress,

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,079
is she truly the Huo family's treasure?

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,120
Or is she just a pawn in their game?

16
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,200
She follows His Majesty's
every step dutifully,

17
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,439
exhibiting virtue.

18
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,799
Yet deep down,

19
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,719
how much genuine feeling exists?

20
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:49,114
(Huo Wan, The Empress)

21
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:52,672
(Chen Yu, The Emperor)

22
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,439
Your Majesty,

23
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,280
this is the courtyard
where the late Grand Princess resided.

24
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
Thanks to careful upkeep,

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,239
everything here
remains as it was in her time.

26
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,200
Grand Tutor Xie's been thoughtful.

27
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,439
Though the place remains,
she is gone now.

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,719
It only deepens the sorrow.

29
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,840
If I hadn't confined her
in Weiyang Palace back then,

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,479
how could she...

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,360
Wan.

32
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,719
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,840
Tell me, did that fire back then

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
carry away some secrets with it?

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,319
I dare not speculate.

36
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,199
With no one else,

37
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,960
cease your performance.

38
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,639
I'm weary.

39
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
I wish no disturbance.

40
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,719
You will keep kneeling in the yard

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,719
to appease my sister's spirit.

42
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,159
Your Majesty!

43
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,319
I don't know
what wrong I have committed.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,080
Ever since the Grand Princess' passing,

45
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,520
you have humiliated me like this.

46
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,080
Humiliated?

47
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,560
If you weren't a Huo,

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
you wouldn't be worthy
to appease her soul.

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,520
How could you compare to her?

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,479
Your Maj...

51
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,088
(Chaohuang Academy)

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,080
In the case of Su Wei's corruption,

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,000
I borrowed the Grand Princess' name.

54
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,360
This was disrespectful to the royalty.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,039
I came specifically
to beg for punishment.

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
How rare.

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,479
You still hold reverence
for the Grand Princess.

58
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,759
Your plan

59
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,159
exposed the corrupt official's crimes

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,879
and cleared my sister's name.

61
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,400
What a brilliant scheme indeed.

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,439
I dare not accept such praise
from Your Majesty.

63
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,560
It was all due
to your skillful arrangements

64
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,079
and masterful strategy.

65
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,959
With you successfully out of the palace,

66
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,439
acting naturally becomes much easier.

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,959
I see far fewer spies around you now.

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,639
Now that I'm out,

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,759
it's time I truly see

70
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,160
the Chen State my sister left me.

71
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,759
Your foresight

72
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,279
is beyond what I can achieve.

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,319
If I truly had such foresight,

74
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,360
how could I fail to keep my sister?

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,319
(Young Chen Yu)
Sister, are you hiding well?

76
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,160
If you are, I'm coming to find you!

77
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:10,680
Sister!

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,120
Sister!

79
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,720
Oh, no!

80
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,279
It's the rebels!

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,040
(Back then, Ninth Lord rebelled.)

82
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,839
(Without my sister taking me,)

83
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
(I would have died in the garden.)

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,680
It's okay. Follow me.

85
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,480
Hiding in the woodshed,

86
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,720
it was because my sister
kept encouraging me

87
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,800
that I endured for nine days.

88
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,040
Be good.

89
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,759
Hold on a little longer.

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,800
Listen!

91
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,000
The sounds of fighting have stopped.

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,759
Maybe the rebellion

93
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,920
has been quelled out there.

94
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,680
In a few days...

95
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,720
In a few days, we can go out.

96
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,079
But, Sister,

97
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,759
where should we go?

98
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,160
Where?

99
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,319
To...

100
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,399
To hide our tracks,

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,000
she took me into Yeyou Court,

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,399
where disgraced officials' children
were force into labor.

103
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,439
Don't you sleep!

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,439
It hurts!

105
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,079
Madam.

106
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,319
You were born a son of Yeyou Court.

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,199
And now you're acting all precious!

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,560
I'll beat you to death!

109
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,319
Trash! You shameless fool!

110
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,519
Sister,

111
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,519
what is the point of living?

112
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,600
I'll kill you!

113
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,759
People live

114
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,720
for a reason.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,399
I will tell you later.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,600
(History as a Mirror)
Yu,

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,720
we can't go on drifting

118
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
aimlessly in Yeyou Court like this.

119
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,720
Starting today,

120
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,199
I will teach you to read every day.

121
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,759
Look.

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,000
History as a Mirror.

123
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,560
Reading enlightens the mind.

124
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,120
(Thrown into hardship,)

125
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,079
(Sister still urged me
not to lose heart)

126
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,240
(and learn the art of emperors.)

127
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,000
(It was her who taught me
how to be an emperor.)

128
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,920
(But when I became emperor,
I killed her.)

129
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,720
(If I hadn't been selfish)

130
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,279
(back then,)

131
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,720
(would she not have died?)

132
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,360
Sister,

133
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,279
let's go see a play.

134
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,000
That piece you placed earlier

135
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,319
is about to act.

136
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,040
Please.

137
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,639
Please.

138
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,079
Manager.

139
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,639
What a rare guest!

140
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,839
What a rare guest!

141
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,120
Lord Jia,

142
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,959
you've left Zhuozhou in three years.

143
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,040
Yes, yes.

144
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,000
What

145
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,160
brings you here this time?

146
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,360
Keep it low. Low profile.

147
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,600
I heard that there will be several
great scholars from Qi tomorrow.

148
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,680
That's truly rare to see!

149
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
Although Chen and Qi
are not on good terms,

150
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,440
literature is innocent!

151
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes.

152
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,600
If we miss this opportunity,

153
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,240
it will be the regret of a lifetime.

154
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,480
Look.

155
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,720
Your attire today

156
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,440
is quite ingenious.

157
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,600
Of course.

158
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,000
This time, we invited
great scholars from Qi here.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,519
I can't afford to be impolite, right?

160
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,679
Yes.

161
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,679
The prey is hooked.

162
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,320
You deserve the chief credit.

163
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,360
Then tell me.

164
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,480
Compared to Xie the ice block,

165
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,399
am I more formidable?

166
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,519
If you are asking about fashion sense,

167
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,279
it will be you, of course.

168
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,639
That's not what I'm talking about.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
Who would ask you

170
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,120
such an obvious thing?

171
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,519
Back to business.

172
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,840
Jia Cheng, the Ghost Fire,

173
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,120
is little known in daily life
and rarely comes to the capital.

174
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,799
However, he has some special hobbies.

175
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,039
He likes to take in
down-and-out guests as retainers.

176
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,600
His reputation is quite good.

177
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,039
Back then, shortly after Jia Cheng
was imprisoned,

178
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,399
he disappeared.

179
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,679
Now, there comes

180
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,759
the Ghost Fire.

181
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,279
And,

182
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,279
the Ghost Fire retainer Cheng Qianzhi
specially invited by you.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
Meeting an old acquaintance again,
are you pleased?

184
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,200
(Back then, Lu Chengfeng)

185
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,639
(led the border army to attack Qi.)

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,879
(The Sheng army assisted
with elite troops.)

187
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
(Chancellor Huo claimed)

188
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,399
(To the Emperor of Qi)
(that the Sheng army defected,)

189
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,320
(leading to the border army's
total defeat.)

190
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,679
(Lu Chengfeng even
committed suicide in court to atone.)

191
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,879
But do you believe such a person

192
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,120
would willingly kill himself?

193
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,639
Please.

194
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,440
Please, please.

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,759
- Please.
- Come on. Let's go.

196
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,600
Cheng, how is the meal?

197
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,759
Good.

198
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,039
Really good.

199
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,559
Cheng, fill it up.

200
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,480
Cheng, please.

201
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,559
Jia, please.

202
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,639
Cheng,

203
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,840
today, let's drink and chat merrily.

204
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,879
I will tell you a palace secret.

205
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,879
The Empress is finally pregnant?

206
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,840
That'd be all over the streets

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,879
if such joyous news were true.

208
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,000
I am talking about His Majesty,
the current emperor.

209
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,440
I heard that
after the Grand Princess' death,

210
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:45,039
he has been wandering in a daze
all day long.

211
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,720
He doesn't even visit
the imperial harem.

212
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,799
The relationship between His Majesty
and the Grand Princess is a bit...

213
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,120
His Majesty and the Grand Princess

214
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,799
aren't even blood-related.

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,399
Jia, you really have eyes

216
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,000
and ears everywhere.

217
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,320
You flatter me.

218
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,279
Come on. Drink up!

219
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,799
- Come on...
- (This Drunken Stupor works wonders.)

220
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,279
(It's making people
babble nonsense so fast.)

221
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,159
I've long heard of you, Lord Jia.

222
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,559
(The Reign of Yao and Shun)
I toast you.

223
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
This calligraphy piece...

224
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,159
What should we do now?

225
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,679
Calligraphy piece?

226
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,039
What a pity!

227
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,120
Just let it be.

228
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,840
Jia is a master forger.

229
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,679
It's not difficult at all.

230
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,600
Just create another masterpiece
for the beauty.

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,279
I've long heard

232
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,960
that someone can easily imitate
countless handwriting styles.

233
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,120
No one can tell.

234
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,399
Now, this masterpiece is ruined.

235
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,799
I've become the culprit.

236
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,519
I only hope to meet someone

237
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,519
who can absolve my guilt.

238
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,600
I'll spare no effort

239
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,240
and never betray my word.

240
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,159
It's not difficult at all.

241
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,720
Bring me the brush.

242
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:45,519
(The Reign of Yao and Shun)

243
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,200
Cheng,

244
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,240
what do you think?

245
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,519
It's indistinguishable.

246
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,159
Truly remarkable.

247
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,559
Isn't this
the Grand Princess' handwriting?

248
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,360
Indeed.

249
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,000
Why is it written identically?

250
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:58,919
Exactly!

251
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,279
It seems really authentic.

252
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,879
Go! Go!

253
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Get out!

254
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,879
Get out!

255
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,080
All of you!

256
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,240
You...

257
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,919
Why are you wearing these clothes?

258
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,039
Take them off now.

259
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,679
This is a capital offense!

260
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,840
The Grand Princess is dead.

261
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,440
I, the false witness,

262
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,679
should be silenced too.

263
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,559
Cook the dog once it catches the hare.

264
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,200
Are you going to...

265
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,639
Those who know secrets in this world

266
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,279
never keep silent forever.

267
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Only the dead....

268
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,120
Only the dead can keep secrets.

269
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,200
You... shut your mouth!

270
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,799
Don't mention this again.

271
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
If you want to die, don't drag me down!

272
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,200
I want to live, so you must die.

273
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,759
- What is this?
- You must die.

274
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,679
I want to live.
