00:00:51,459 --> 00:00:56,125
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,979
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,560
Don't worry.

4
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,239
Maybe His Majesty

5
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,120
just remembered the Sheng family

6
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,799
and has some instructions.

7
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,560
This was my mother's dowry back then.

8
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,079
She always cherished it.

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Now, it's yours.

10
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,319
Consider it as the Xie family's
betrothal gift.

11
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,719
Look good?

12
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,680
Yes.

13
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,680
This is my betrothal gift.

14
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,840
Grand Tutor Xie, this time,

15
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,719
you won't be able to escape.

16
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
No matter how long you go,

17
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,200
or if the gates are closed,

18
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,560
I'll be waiting for you.

19
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,240
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,400
Sister.

21
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,719
Tell me.

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,360
Why do people live?

23
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,639
Sister,

24
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,479
why do people live?

25
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,280
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,080
why do you say that?

27
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,479
I don't know.

28
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,759
Looking at you,

29
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,840
I truly miss my sister.

30
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,800
How about this?

31
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,800
You'll compose a poem

32
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,360
for your own sister.

33
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,280
Your Majesty, please speak plainly.

34
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,960
Why speak in riddles with me?

35
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,759
Right now, a document written
by the Grand Princess

36
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,599
should be reaching Grand Tutor Xie.

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,352
Write another letter

38
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,560
in the Grand Princess's hand.

39
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,240
And in her name,

40
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:28,159
accuse the Xie family
of colluding, harming loyal subjects,

41
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:29,568
and killing the Grand Princess.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,280
They bear responsibility
for the Weiyang Palace incident.

43
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,719
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,720
(Grand Princess's Letter)

45
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,319
Are you saying

46
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,560
this letter

47
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
was left by the Grand Princess
before her death?

48
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,240
It claims I colluded with Chancellor Huo

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,039
to kill the Grand Princess.

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,919
I only deliver it.

51
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,720
I know nothing else.

52
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,839
But His Majesty said

53
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,040
you are clever.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,120
You'll understand
what this letter implies.

55
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,720
Back then, this secretary
in my sister's palace

56
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,680
copied my sister's
excellent handwriting.

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,600
She usually skipped

58
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,399
the routine memorials

59
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,800
and had him draft responses.

60
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
But only Grand Tutor Xie's memorials

61
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,279
did she handle personally.

62
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,079
Unless my sister comes alive

63
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,480
and personally denies
writing this secret letter,

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,839
Grand Tutor Xie's crime

65
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,800
can't be cleared.

66
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,759
Your Majesty, don't act impulsively

67
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,959
and hurt a loyal minister.

68
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,839
Won't you admit who you really are?

69
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,079
Sister,

70
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,720
Xie Fei could be sentenced
to death this time.

71
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,319
Your Majesty,

72
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,839
if Grand Tutor Xie is convicted,

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,199
I'll follow him in life or death.

74
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,319
There's another way
to exonerate Grand Tutor Xie.

75
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,000
I also have deep ties
with the Sheng family from Yunnan.

76
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,759
If you change your mind now

77
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,639
and marry me in the palace,

78
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,959
this joyful union between families

79
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,839
could warrant a general pardon.

80
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,480
You're insane!

81
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,839
Yes.

82
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,959
I am insane.

83
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,399
I've gone mad.

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,920
Only madness explains how you all

85
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,199
could manipulate me so easily.

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,319
Even now,

87
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,720
I'm still speaking calmly to you.

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,720
Instead of deposing the empress
and marrying you outright.

89
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,959
I'm still afraid of frightening you.

90
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,360
No.

91
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,720
Not mad enough.

92
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,240
I'm not mad enough yet.

93
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,416
- Your Majesty!
- Sister, don't push me away.

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,079
Your Majesty.

95
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,480
I trapped you

96
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,879
in Weiyang Palace.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,120
I gave them the opportunity.

98
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,399
Back in court,

99
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,199
I echoed their arguments.

100
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,720
I only wanted
to find a scapegoat for you.

101
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,399
I can bring you into the harem.

102
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
I can give you a new identity.

103
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,959
I can make you completely mine.

104
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,040
Sheng Yunlin,

105
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,800
I was the first to fall for you.

106
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,800
I was the one who stayed
by your side all along.

107
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,560
You promised you'd always stay with me.

108
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,439
Why won't you acknowledge me now?

109
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,199
Your Majesty,

110
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,279
Grand Tutor Xie said,

111
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:26,399
he wishes to bear all guilt alone,

112
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,520
- not implicating his family.
- Get lost!

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,560
Sister.

114
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,720
Sister.

115
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Your thoughts are truly
unfathomable today.

116
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,720
If you insist on persisting in folly,

117
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,399
I refuse to let my husband
suffer this unjust calamity.

118
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,480
I will follow him in death.

119
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:56,040
You'd rather die for that man

120
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,879
than acknowledge me?

121
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,079
Your Majesty.

122
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
If I were her,

123
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,800
would you have ever pitied me

124
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,360
for dying once for the Chen State?

125
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,639
If I were not her,

126
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,839
why must you obsess over me,

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,120
neglect state affairs,
and become a tyrant?

128
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,439
But I don't want to be sovereign.

129
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,040
I just want you.

130
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,720
Your Majesty is a wise ruler.

131
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,720
Your sister

132
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,320
is watching over you.

133
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,440
Let this be you

134
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,360
seeing me off one last time.

135
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,840
His Majesty is critically ill.
The palace is on lockdown.

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,559
No one enters without summons.

137
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,639
Seal the palace gates! Now!

138
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,120
(Yu.)

139
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,159
Go.

140
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,960
Your Majesty,

141
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,600
we've been married for long.

142
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,080
Why does seeing me

143
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
make you so bashful?

144
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,759
Viper.

145
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,200
Viper?

146
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,120
Your Majesty, have you ever considered

147
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,120
who turned me into what I am today?

148
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,639
I was also once a noble lady
famed throughout the capital.

149
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,840
In my youth,
I fell for you at first sight.

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,879
Do you know

151
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,960
how overjoyed I was when I learned

152
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,879
I could marry you?

153
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,600
Yet on our very wedding night,

154
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,919
to seize control of the Imperial Guard,

155
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,240
you schemed and murdered my own brother!

156
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,679
Though I am the Empress,

157
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,000
all authority

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,039
was handed entirely
to the Grand Princess.

159
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,399
My father used me as a pawn.

160
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,639
Even you did the same.

161
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,559
Your Majesty.

162
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:00,919
Your Majesty.

163
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,919
Your Majesty.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
In your heart,

165
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,519
was there ever a single moment

166
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,159
where there was me?

167
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,200
You...

168
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,879
As long as you nod

169
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,120
and say yes,

170
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,639
I can...

171
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,200
I can spare your life.

172
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,480
Nod.

173
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,080
Your Majesty.

174
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,679
Nod.

175
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,440
Nod!

176
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,480
Say yes!

177
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,480
(Sheng Yunlin,)

178
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,000
(everything you once possessed,)

179
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,200
(now belongs to me.)

180
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,639
(I will stand higher than you ever did,)

181
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,240
(looking down upon all.)

182
00:12:58,912 --> 00:12:59,840
Your Highness,

183
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,960
the harem must stay out.

184
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,080
How can you usurp authority?

185
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,279
Much less sit upon the Dragon Throne.

186
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,240
This violates the rules of Chen State.

187
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,879
Indeed.

188
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,664
When the Grand Princess acted as regent,
it was by His Majesty's decree.

189
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,799
Now, you lack

190
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,200
any legitimate authority!

191
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,480
My actions today

192
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,519
are ordained by Heaven.

193
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:29,879
To voice dissatisfaction

194
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,600
is to defy Heaven's will.

195
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,200
Heaven's way is clear.

196
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,960
Gentlemen,

197
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,120
be cautious.

198
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,679
- We are at your command.
- We are at your command.

199
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,320
State your business.

200
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,759
Jinxiu.

201
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,039
Jinxiu.

202
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,679
Earlier in the court,

203
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,360
do I look imposing?

204
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,799
You have finally reached this point.

205
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,600
I am overjoyed for you.

206
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,519
Throughout the land,

207
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,759
no one dares question you anymore.

208
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:12,559
Come.

209
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,279
Come.

210
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,559
Only you...

211
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,919
Only you truly rejoice
for me from the heart.

212
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,159
Having you by my side

213
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,279
is truly wonderful.

214
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,679
Your Highness,

215
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,279
you have treated me so kindly.

216
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,120
You have never punished me.

217
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,639
Since following you in my youth,

218
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,679
I've known warm clothes in winter,

219
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,000
and ice in summer cellar storage.

220
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,759
If there is a next life,

221
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,720
I will still serve you.

222
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,200
Good.

223
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,519
However, these old ministers

224
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,600
are masters of paying lip service

225
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,679
and standing by idly.

226
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,159
Jinxiu,

227
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,720
go help me keep an eye

228
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,360
on their families
detained in the palace.

229
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,720
If anyone causes trouble,

230
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
show no mercy.

231
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,799
