00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:56,192
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:59,046
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,280
It truly matches the Grand Princess's
handwriting perfectly.

4
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,239
Your Highness, I beg you to accept me.

5
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,920
I can prove greatly useful
in the future.

6
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,480
But you work for my father.

7
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,359
From now on, I acknowledge only you,

8
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,592
not Chancellor Huo.

9
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,640
Your Highness,

10
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,120
I

11
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,040
am willing to entrust
my entire family's lives to you.

12
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,560
Thank you for sparing my life.

13
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,519
Indeed, a talent like you

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,120
would be a waste to lose.

15
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,359
Jinxiu.

16
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,680
Make arrangements for Master Jia.

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,319
Proceed with caution.

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,599
Don't return to the capital
without summons.

19
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,400
Yes.

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Thank you, Your Highness! Thank you!

21
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,680
I am filled with trepidation.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
Today, I get the nerve

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
to see Your Majesty

24
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,639
and present my grievance on injustice.

25
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,840
I hear you are accomplished
in both literature and painting,

26
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,919
with great calligraphy.

27
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,000
The common folk call you Ghost Fire.

28
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,400
Yet I found you

29
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,719
strangely familiar.

30
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,800
Or rather, I should call you
by your old name,

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,400
Jia Cheng.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,039
I dare not! I dare not!

33
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,960
My lowly name is unworthy of utterance.

34
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,599
The Grand Princess
was accused of treason.

35
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
You should have been executed.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,479
So,

37
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,599
who defied the law

38
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,360
to let you survive?

39
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,919
Now you feel wronged?

40
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,744
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,599
I have always been utterly loyal
to the Chen State.

42
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,800
I hold my resolve in silence,

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
bearing my wrongs.

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,680
I committed the crime of murder.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,759
There... There were
truly hidden circumstances!

46
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,759
Your Majesty!

47
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,800
Your Majesty!

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,680
Back then,

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,759
before the Grand Princess
died in the fire,

50
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,080
she rescued me from the imperial prison.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,280
She suspected the defeat
of our border army was no accident,

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,560
so she commanded me
to investigate this matter in secret

53
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,000
to atone for my sins!

54
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,479
Jia Cheng,

55
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,080
how dare you deceive me?

56
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,919
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty!

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,520
Your Majesty.

58
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,319
Your Majesty.

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,400
It's the Eliminate Evil Order

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,840
that the Grand Princess
gave me back then.

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,680
Every word in it

62
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,240
is enough to prove
there is truth behind my claim.

63
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,240
Please report back
to the Empress for me.

64
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,560
The situation is volatile now,

65
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,240
and frequent meetings
could invite unforeseen trouble.

66
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,080
Deliver this letter to her for me.

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,839
Remember,

68
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,800
be cautious.

69
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,279
Don't be seen.

70
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,240
Yes.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,319
My Lord,

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,199
you were acting
under the Grand Princess's orders.

73
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,519
To uncover why
Chen's forces lost to Qi's,

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,639
you approached Cheng Qianzhi.

75
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,639
You mean...

76
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,079
I understand.

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,519
You mean

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,959
His Majesty will recall his bond
with Grand Princess.

79
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:56,199
Not only will he not punish me,

80
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,199
he might even reward me!

81
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,879
Th-Thank you for saving my life.

82
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,839
Thank you for saving my life.

83
00:05:10,432 --> 00:05:12,192
(Eliminate Evil Order to Jia Cheng)

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,040
(It's Sister's handwriting.)

85
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,759
I never imagined

86
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:35,399
the Grand Princess would perish
before seeing the outcome.

87
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,639
(The right to report)

88
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,079
Afterward, I toiled day and night,

89
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,839
hiding across Chen State
to uncover the truth.

90
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,600
I discovered

91
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,959
that the so-called philanthropist,
Cheng Qianzhi,

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,600
is none other

93
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,560
than Lu Chengfeng,

94
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,720
the general who died to atone
at the court three years ago.

95
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,279
He is the true traitor
who colluded with the enemy.

96
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,680
You have remarkable skill

97
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,120
to unearth Lu Chengfeng.

98
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,879
Your Majesty, you flatter me.

99
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,279
Long heard of a wonder
hidden in ancient hills,

100
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,480
mimicking scripts,
with brushwork flowing like water.

101
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,800
But sacrificing wife and child
to appease spirits,

102
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,439
with calligraphy works
cherished across the ages.

103
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
Your Majesty,

104
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,519
you are killing...

105
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:34,279
Your Majesty, the Jia family
has been completely wiped out.

106
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,759
Over thirty members of my family

107
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,160
have perished tonight.

108
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,600
Your Majesty.

109
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,920
Your Majesty.

110
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:21,839
This...

111
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,120
This...

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,920
What do you mean by this?

113
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,399
If this order is genuine,

114
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,920
I would be overjoyed,

115
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,439
and praise your utter loyalty.

116
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,680
But if this order is fake,

117
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,240
then weren't the letters proving
the Grand Princess's treason

118
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,800
forged by you?

119
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,480
(If this silk document
is proven forged,)

120
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,079
(the horrific massacre
at Weiyang Palace)

121
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,199
(must be overturned.)

122
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
(If this silk document is proven true,)

123
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
(Lu Chengfeng's treason case
will implicate our Huo family.)

124
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,439
(Well, Huo Wan,)

125
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,759
(look at the mess you've made.)

126
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,279
(Utterly foolish.)

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,399
Over a decade of diligent study

128
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,639
only makes me end up

129
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,040
as someone else's scapegoat.

130
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,879
Your Majesty,

131
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,279
I did

132
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,799
forge the Grand Princess's

133
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,279
treasonous letters.

134
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,240
But,

135
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,799
I was powerless and alone.

136
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,919
How could I dare harm
the Regent Princess?

137
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,399
It was...

138
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,000
It was Huo...

139
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,759
How dare you!

140
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,320
Your Majesty,

141
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,559
this man has had evil intentions

142
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,759
and made wild accusations
before his death.

143
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,159
Jia Cheng,

144
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,840
your crime alone

145
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,559
will drag your entire family
down with you?

146
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,519
I wonder if in the future,

147
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,759
anyone will visit your grave

148
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,960
to offer you a bowl of rice.

149
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,279
(I have an illegitimate son,)

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,440
(hidden in the Empress's
private residence.)

151
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,799
Your Majesty,

152
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,440
I admit my crime.

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,039
I

154
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,799
will atone with my death.

155
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,399
Chancellor Huo,

156
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,519
what do you think?

157
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,720
Your Majesty,

158
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
our Huo family have served

159
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,960
the Chen State
with utmost devotion and loyalty

160
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,559
for three generations.

161
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,399
Back then,

162
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,600
we were asked to investigate
the Grand Princess's case.

163
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,639
Its complexity was immense.

164
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,200
I never expected this fool

165
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,552
could escape the imperial prison.

166
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,519
Now, he tells lies before Your Majesty,

167
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
distorting truths.

168
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,519
If you distrust me

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,279
and our Huo family,

170
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,679
I am willing to resign as Chancellor

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,480
to express my remorse.

172
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,919
Chancellor, what are you saying?

173
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,960
I would not punish loyal officials

174
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,440
over Jia Cheng's slander.

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,080
Please sit.

176
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,559
These performances arranged by outsiders

177
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,480
are just cliches.

178
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,600
Empress, how about a dance with me?

179
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,399
Your Majesty,

180
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,799
I am the Empress.

181
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,720
I am not a performer for entertainment.

182
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,279
Do you recall

183
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,639
that I am also appointed Empress
by the Grand Princess?

184
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,919
Empress,

185
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,120
return to the palace and stay there.

186
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,000
Do not wander about freely.

187
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,360
Understood?

188
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,688
I understand, Your Majesty.

189
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,720
Boring.

190
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,399
I had intended

191
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,159
to liven things up for everyone.

192
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,039
But this ends now.

193
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,720
Step forward.

194
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:18,464
Sever Jia Cheng's
achilles tendons for me.

195
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,519
Your Majesty,

196
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:24,679
Yunfei is a lady.

197
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,000
I fear...

198
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,720
Don't fear.

199
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,399
I am here.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,679
Your Majesty,

201
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,240
my family is destroyed.

202
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,200
Let me die quickly.

203
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,519
Die quickly?

204
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
Do you know how my sister died?

205
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,360
Did you see the day will come
when you hurt her?

206
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,399
Well done.

207
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,879
Name your reward.

208
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:56,440
Your Majesty,

209
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,000
I wouldn't dare.

210
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,399
With me here,

211
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,399
