00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:56,090
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,944
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:02,095
(Weiyang Palace)

4
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,319
Grand Tutor Xie, how come
you're in the mood

5
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,000
for playing the zither for a "traitor"

6
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,280
like me

7
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,840
(Grand Tutor, Xie Fei)
instead of attending to state affairs?

8
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,400
(Grand Princess, Sheng Yunlin)
Do you also wish to warm my bed?

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,359
You have already

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,280
declined the imperial marriage proposal.

11
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,239
Your Highness,

12
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,040
I see you as my soulmate.

13
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,480
Are you trying to be my soulmate,

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,079
defying all convention?

15
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,879
Are you really trying to be my lover

16
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,239
after what you've done today?

17
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,400
I came to present

18
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,719
tonic for your health, Your Highness.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your Highness,

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,120
do you know what I truly want?

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,319
Do you want me,

22
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,560
the convicted Princess,

23
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,960
to die?

24
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:16,639
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
the Grand Princess secretly

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,639
(Sheng Yunlin)
corresponded with King Liang of Qi.

27
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,960
When did I ever correspond with him?

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,800
Utter nonsense!

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,039
It is indeed her handwriting.

30
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,520
Grand Tutor Xie,

31
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,400
what should we do about it?

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,719
In my opinion,

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,319
the crime of treason

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,759
calls for

35
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,039
confinement within Weiyang Palace.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,639
(If not for your blunt words
this morning,)

37
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:47,039
(how would I bear the charge of treason)

38
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,800
(and be grounded?)

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Rest assured.

40
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,080
If you die,

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,759
I will die with you

42
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,520
today.

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,400
I won't drink it.

44
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,439
(If this tonic is poisoned,)

45
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,199
(then I will die)

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,879
(with Your Highness.)

47
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,919
(The court situation is complex.)

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,376
(You must withdraw from the fray)

49
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,719
(and bide your time.)

50
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:51,919
(Bide my time?)

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,639
(Will I even survive this?)

52
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:58,599
(Remnants of the Sheng army are in Qi)

53
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,759
(Her life and the honor)

54
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,719
(of the Sheng family)

55
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,280
(all rest upon me.)

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Get my horse.

57
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
I'm heading to Qi right now.

58
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,479
(Wait for me.)

59
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,759
By the Mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees:

60
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,439
The Regent Princess Sheng Yunlin

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,199
colluded with enemies,
harmed the state and its people,

62
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,920
(Chief Eunuch, Feng Yuan)
and shall be executed.

63
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,439
Are you looking for me, Your Highness?

64
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,639
What a pity.

65
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,439
You are no longer

66
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,439
(Imperial Guard, Su Wei)
my master.

67
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,199
Su Wei.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,839
You traitor.

69
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,639
How dare you hurt

70
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,120
Her Highness?

71
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:04,399
Madam.

72
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,839
Your Highness.

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,920
You must live well.

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,639
Madam.

75
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,120
You are no longer

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,360
the lofty Regent Princess above us all.

77
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,560
A traitor deserves to die.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,399
Who drugged me?

79
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,120
I did, Your Highness.

80
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,120
How did the wine taste?

81
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,560
(I've devoted myself to the Chen State.)

82
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,759
(Is this... how it ends?)

83
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,639
(Huaiyong, where are you?)

84
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,560
(The Regent Princess Sheng Yunlin)

85
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,240
(was convicted of treason)

86
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,199
(and committed suicide by fire
in the Weiyang Palace.)

87
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:31,879
(Grave of the Grand Princess
Sheng Yunlin)

88
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,720
(Why?)

89
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,000
(Why must fate toy with us?)

90
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,799
(I'm sorry.)

91
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,960
(I'm sorry, Your Highness.)

92
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,000
(I arrived too late.)

93
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,720
(I'm always one step behind.)

94
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,799
(Your Highness.)

95
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,360
(Your Highness.)

96
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,639
Your Highness.

97
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:04,496
(Grave of the Grand Princess
Sheng Yunlin)

98
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:07,631
(Three Years Later)

99
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:11,440
(Chengfeng Pavilion)

100
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,399
You said that
the Grand Princess had colluded

101
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,200
with the enemies,

102
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,639
and no one would want her belongings.

103
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,679
Why are you here?

104
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,120
She was a real beauty.

105
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
Many covet

106
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,200
her jade pendant.

107
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,039
She lured His Majesty with her beauty.

108
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,919
Otherwise,

109
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,559
why had His Majesty entrusted her

110
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,000
with all that power?

111
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,200
Not only that,

112
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,559
she also abducted
common men for her harem.

113
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,919
Every night, she would

114
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,679
absorb yang energy to nourish her yin.

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,080
Who dares attack me?

116
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,399
Who dares attack me?

117
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,679
Grand Tutor Xie.

118
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,519
What are you doing here?

119
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,799
Grand Tutor Xie.

120
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:04,960
Wait.

121
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,399
Now you're just a commoner.

122
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,879
You're also here
for the Phoenix Pendant?

123
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,440
Speaking of which,

124
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,080
the Princess was once your student.

125
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,080
Truly,

126
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,759
a master makes a fine disciple.

127
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,720
Speaking of the past,

128
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,039
wasn't the Grand Princess
your master, Lord Su?

129
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,080
Now that your master is gone,

130
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,759
how come you're
clinging to life, Lord Su?

131
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,039
You...

132
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,480
Her bones rest beneath the earth.

133
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,840
Her spirit lingers in her old chamber.

134
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,039
My sister, the Grand Princess,
has passed away.

135
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,519
I implore you to stop arguing.

136
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,080
Do not disturb her over an object.

137
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,919
This Phoenix Pendant
is a relic of the Grand Princess.

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,879
Those who bear grudges against her

139
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,000
should not covet this item,

140
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,679
lest they bring disaster
upon themselves.

141
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,639
No way.

142
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,600
Are we seeing a ghost?

143
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,559
Don't panic.

144
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,960
We saw her die with our own eyes.

145
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,320
This can't be her.

146
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,240
I have work to do.

147
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Count me out.

148
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,360
Please have fun.

149
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,480
Lord Su.

150
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,639
Aren't we going to drink together?

151
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,200
Why are you leaving so soon?

152
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:50,840
She has to die.

153
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,639
Send someone to kill her.

154
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,080
My lord.

155
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,879
My lord, what should we do?

156
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,600
Find a way to bring her back

157
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,080
and finish her off.

158
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,240
What?

159
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:10,879
You...

160
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,320
My lord.

161
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,240
Are you trying to seize it

162
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,600
without placing the bids?

163
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,120
Fine.

164
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,919
One thousand taels of gold.

165
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,120
Three thousand.

166
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,799
And I want you to come with me.
