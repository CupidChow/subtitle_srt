1
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:56,090
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,944
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,960
I heard the Princess
fancied the Top Scholar

4
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:02,840
at the banquet.

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,920
Soon he'll be summoned
as Prince Consort.

6
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,519
So he's marrying into royalty?

7
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,640
So it seems he won't

8
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,200
pursue an official career, right?

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,239
That is truly a match made in heaven.

10
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,760
Unless, he has studied himself
into a fool,

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,200
- or he's bound to admire the Princess.
- Exactly.

12
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,040
My lord.

13
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,480
Why do you request

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,120
this audience with me?

15
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,200
Your Highness,

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,799
I...

17
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,000
I...

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,280
Marrying into royalty
was never my intention.

19
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,159
You need not worry excessively.

20
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,719
I know your heart lies with the realm

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,120
and don't want to be trapped
in the palace.

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,240
However, my lord,

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,520
I have another request

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,719
for which I need your assistance.

25
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:40,864
For a woman,

26
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:42,960
mastering this blade technique
is no small feat.

27
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,319
If you can't keep up,

28
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,439
don't force it.

29
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,439
What of being a woman?

30
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,439
Whether in letters or arms,

31
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,199
I aim to be the best.

32
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,159
Thank you, Master.

33
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:19,232
You asked me to persuade His Majesty

34
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:22,040
that you shouldn't be bound
by the training of a noble lady.

35
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,480
Why endure

36
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,920
such hardship?

37
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,319
To learn for insight,

38
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
to know the world,

39
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,240
not to be tied down by romance.

40
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:40,064
We train to protect ourselves

41
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,410
and our loved ones.

42
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,399
Is that not also true for you?

43
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,120
It was you who proposed
rejecting the marriage.

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
It was also you who suggested
confining the Grand Princess

45
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,040
in Weiyang Palace.

46
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,519
And now, it is still you who reveal
your true feelings.

47
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,360
Your heart is truly fickle.

48
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,720
Without facing life and death,

49
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
how could one see their true heart?

50
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,160
After the fire at Weiyang Palace,

51
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,160
I regretted every day.

52
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,639
I regretted why I wasn't
in the capital at that time.

53
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,480
I regretted why I wasn't
in Weiyang Palace at that time.

54
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
I regretted why it wasn't me
who perished in the flames.

55
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,480
If it had been me,

56
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,600
I would have ended this torment sooner.

57
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Lest I grow gray

58
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
too soon and be ashamed

59
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,240
to face the beloved.

60
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,519
The person standing before you now

61
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
harbors not a shred
of romantic sentiment.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,240
Only the flames of vengeance
burn within.

63
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
My feelings toward you

64
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,560
contain not the slightest trace
of affection.

65
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
I merely wish to use your influence

66
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,279
to make things more convenient.

67
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,440
What are you doing?

68
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,600
Don't worry, Your Highness.

69
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,079
For the pain you endured,

70
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,399
I will make them pay

71
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,319
a hundredfold, a thousandfold.

72
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,496
(Chaohuang Academy)

73
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,199
I heard the relief funds came by magic,

74
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,480
cast by the late Grand Princess's spirit

75
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,720
for the people.

76
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
It was the ill-gotten wealth of Su.

77
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,360
Watch your words.

78
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,959
If that were true,

79
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,480
then the Grand Princess
could not abide corruption.

80
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,959
The Grand Princess's spirit

81
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,519
still cares for the realm.

82
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:47,810
(Elegy)

83
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,160
The fourth year of the Jialin era,

84
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:00,079
the first day
of the tenth month, at noon.

85
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
I, Xie Fei, together with the Governor
of Zhuozhou and its people,

86
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
offer sacrifice to the Grand Princess
of the Sheng clan.

87
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,279
In these turbulent times,

88
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,879
you set order amidst chaos,

89
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,519
supported the new Emperor,

90
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,560
bestowed grace upon the new reign,

91
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,600
worked night and day,

92
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,279
remained vigilant until dawn,

93
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,000
devoted to the nation and duties,

94
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,839
upheld the law to this day,

95
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,600
and loved the people as your own,

96
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,759
treating their suffering as yours.

97
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,319
The realm turned its gaze to you,

98
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,279
and the court held you
in solemn reverence.

99
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,840
We humbly offer this sacrifice.

100
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
Well, Your Highness,

101
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,679
I perform rites for you,

102
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,080
burning offerings.

103
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,080
In your magnanimity,

104
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,399
may you now rest in peace.

105
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,399
Don't come for me anymore.

106
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
Don't come for me.

107
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,519
Don't come for me.

108
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,559
Everyone,

109
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,919
the four hundred thousand silver taels
from Chaohuang Academy

110
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,559
were summoned
by the late Grand Princess's spirit,

111
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,360
using otherworldly forces

112
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,440
to aid the displaced.

113
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,440
The Grand Princess's love for the people

114
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,039
is witnessed by heaven and earth.

115
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,080
Your Highness,

116
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,120
you are the very source
of our livelihood!

117
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,519
Without the Grand Princess,

118
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,200
there'd be no land for grain.

119
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,360
Without grain,

120
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,480
the people would suffer.

121
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
The Grand Princess
promoted women's education.

122
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,759
Who says women are inferior?

123
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,399
Because women's education thrived,

124
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,799
we avoided the decline into moral decay.

125
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
May the spirits bless me.

126
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:34,919
Please, bless me!

127
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,879
What...

128
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,960
W-What's happening?

129
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,879
Oh, my! An omen from the sky!

130
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,320
Is it the Grand Princess's
wronged spirit crying out?

131
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
Someone! Everyone, look!

132
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,480
The Grand Princess is enraged!

133
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,759
Why would it burn us?

134
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,399
The Grand Princess punishes the evil.

135
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,399
She cherishes us common folk the most.

136
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,639
May the spirits bless me.

137
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,799
Ghosts!

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,120
Ghosts!

139
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,440
The Grand Princess's manifested!

140
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,519
She's manifested!

141
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,240
She's manifested!

142
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,159
Your Highness, calm your wrath!

143
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,879
I will use all four hundred thousand
silver taels

144
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,639
solely for the disaster victims

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,080
in the Grand Princess's name.

146
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,440
(Flames that can't kill me)

147
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,919
(shall become my sharpest weapons.)

148
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,960
(Grudges from my past life)

149
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,519
(will be paid back with blood.)

150
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,159
(The innocence of the Sheng clan)

151
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,480
(shall see the light of day.)

152
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,519
(I, the fierce ghost,)

153
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,120
(will grant you no peace.)

154
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,039
This is Su Wei's lightning rod
disguised as a ritual vessel.

155
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,879
I'll have someone destroy it shortly.

156
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
I'll handle it myself.

157
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,120
Actually, you could leave
these matters to me.

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,679
I don't wish you to dirty your hands

159
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,960
over these things.

160
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,799
(I chose vengeance myself.)

161
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,080
(I have to kill them myself,)

162
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,399
(not anyone else.)

163
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,759
I am not afraid!

164
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,240
These hands of mine

165
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,840
once shielded the Chen State.

166
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,399
Now, they crawl only through mud.

167
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,200
I will drag those who deserve death

168
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,480
back to the underworld

169
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,200
one by one.

170
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,559
I will walk this path with you.

171
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,480
If you wish to send those fiends
to the underworld,

172
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,440
I will carve

173
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,559
a bloody path
straight to the underworld for you.

174
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,840
If you wish to end them yourself,

175
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,960
I will sharpen

176
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,240
your blade.

177
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Once this blade is drawn,

178
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,639
blood must flow.

179
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,759
Your Highness,

180
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,919
I never dreamed
I'd see you again in this life.

181
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,960
When the news came,

182
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,200
we all thought...

183
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,440
If not for Grand Tutor Xie,

184
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,720
we would have followed you in death,

185
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,759
so you wouldn't be alone
on the road to the underworld.

186
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,320
The Grand Princess committed treason.

187
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,480
She deserves deaths.

188
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,159
Why do you cling to her memory so?

189
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,600
We all know

190
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,559
you would never commit treason.

191
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Your reign saw

192
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,159
thriving farms, a strong economy,

193
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,160
and schools for women,
earning wide praise.

194
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,159
You were a pillar of Chen State.

195
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,639
If not for you back then,

196
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
we'd have perished years ago.

197
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
Guarding your academy

198
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,360
is our future.

199
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:21,720
Hua,

200
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,279
the path I tread now

201
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,960
is never easy.

202
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,879
We are willing to follow you.

203
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,320
Through fire and fury,
I'll never regret.

204
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,679
(Su Wei betrayed his master.)

205
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,360
A blood feud can be avenged in time.

206
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Wronged souls rest in peace
at Weiyang Palace.

207
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,759
The silver case is just a start.

208
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,159
Su Wei was struck dead by lightning.

209
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,980
People sought justice
for the Grand Princess.

210
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,039
These reports will soon
reach the palace.

211
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,600
The Ministries of Revenue and Rites
will petition tomorrow

212
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,080
for His Majesty to enshrine
the Grand Princess at Chaohuang Academy

213
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,879
to soothe the people.

214
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,639
The emperor attends himself.

215
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,759
The storm of blood has only just begun.

216
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,200
Everything proceeds as planned.

217
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,960
Sister...

218
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:44,448
(Memorial, Grand Princess)

219
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,152
Sister,

220
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,720
