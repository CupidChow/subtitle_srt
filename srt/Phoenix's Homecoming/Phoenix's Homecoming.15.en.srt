1
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:56,090
=Phoenix's Homecoming=

2
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,944
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,880
Are you trying to turn my imperial study

4
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,519
into a football field?

5
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
I miss you, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,760
I just wanted to see you.

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,000
Is that wrong?

8
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,519
Where is Yunfei?

9
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,480
I sent someone to check on her,
but she wouldn't open the door.

10
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,920
Get to the point.

11
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,519
Emperors from the Chen family

12
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,560
are all the same, after all.

13
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,079
You're all obsessed with your sisters

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,319
and crave substitutes.

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
But honestly, Lady Yunfei
appeared out of nowhere.

16
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,400
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,000
don't you find it suspicious?

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,120
If you can't watch your tongue,

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,439
I won't hesitate to make you a mute.

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,639
Yunlin wasn't my sister by blood.

21
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,280
Had she wanted to be the empress,

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,879
no one could have stopped her,

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
and I wouldn't have married you.

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,159
I see Your Majesty

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,120
is quite taken with Lady Yunfei.

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,520
What a pity that such a beauty

27
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,560
is already engaged.

28
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,039
It's none of your business.

29
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,919
Seeing her face,

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,000
Your Majesty,

31
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,800
your mind must be

32
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,879
racing with thoughts.

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,719
I know Your Majesty

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,199
hasn't let go of the Grand Princess.

35
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,879
So you've been planning

36
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,719
to keep Lady Yunfei

37
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
by your side.

38
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,000
Your Majesty.

39
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,879
Reluctant as I am,

40
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,280
I will help fulfill your desire

41
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,080
and mend your regrets.

42
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,080
I've been alone in Zhuozhou for so long.

43
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,240
I wrote you 26 letters in total.

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,479
Yet Your Highness only

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,360
sent one reply.

46
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,639
The dignified Grand Tutor,

47
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,120
only after a few days,

48
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,399
has started writing nonsensical letters.

49
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,279
Now you can't even

50
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,240
watch your tongue.

51
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,079
Heaven bears witness.

52
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,879
Every word I say is true.

53
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,360
Day and night,

54
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,439
I yearn for Your Highness alone.

55
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,120
Zhuozhou is freezing.

56
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,519
I hold onto your letters for warmth
to sleep every night.

57
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,439
You should've burned them.

58
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,439
You've overstepped.

59
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,600
There are people...

60
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,759
I learned a trick in Zhuozhou.

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,160
Just interlock our fingers.

62
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,079
And our voices
won't carry beyond these walls.

63
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,680
Why not just sew your mouth shut?

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,040
I couldn't.

65
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,160
If I sewed my mouth shut,

66
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,680
how could I express my feelings
for Your Highness?

67
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,639
You have plenty of other ways.

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
With your mouth shut,

69
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,800
you could still do it
with your hands and eyes.

70
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,160
So you're saying

71
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,519
that my feelings

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,959
are perfectly clear to Your Highness.

73
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,680
Don't forget.

74
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,399
You're merely my pawn.

75
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,160
Do not overstep.

76
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,639
(Your Highness.)

77
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,000
(Since you're using me,)

78
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,800
(why not use me more thoroughly?)

79
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,120
Your Majesty has been busy.

80
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,000
Why don't you rest early?

81
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,959
I'll pay my respects to you tomorrow.

82
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,160
Your Majesty.

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,839
I'm afraid I've overstayed my welcome.

84
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,759
I'd rather go home soon.

85
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:13,800
Why is that?

86
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
Because of the empress?

87
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,319
I promise

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
she won't dare approach you again.

89
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,560
Your Majesty.

90
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,279
Somebody.

91
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,240
Pass on my decree.

92
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,959
If the empress trespasses
on the imperial study again,

93
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
I'll remove her from her position.

94
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,000
Understood.

95
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:31,879
Your Majesty.

96
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,120
I shall take my leave.

97
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,759
(Her clothes already)

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,360
(carry the agarwood scent.)

99
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,199
(If she stays more...)

100
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,040
You're back.

101
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,199
My lady.

102
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,600
The weather is dry.

103
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,040
You've even got chapped lips.

104
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,240
Have some water.

105
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,480
Stop nagging.

106
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,480
Why are you dressing your wound here?

107
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,720
What do you think?

108
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,480
I've been waiting

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,839
for you all day.

110
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,480
I've treated the wound on my arm.

111
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,120
But my lady,

112
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:31,920
here.

113
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,960
What should I do

114
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,120
about the wound on my shoulder blade

115
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
without your help?

116
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,759
No need to change the dressing

117
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,440
as often in this dry weather.

118
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,279
I treat you wholeheartedly.

119
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,240
But you play mind games with me.

120
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,320
If you were to cast me aside,

121
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,799
I might as well die.

122
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,159
No, no.

123
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Fine, I'll do it.

124
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,399
Stop howling.

125
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,279
You smell so nice.

126
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,080
Do me a favor, my lady.

127
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:22,624
Don't use Xie Fei's medicine.

128
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:25,000
It hurts too much. I can't bear it.

129
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,480
So it hurts, huh?

130
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,080
Still running that mouth?

131
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,000
Save your energy for healing.

132
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,080
Your Highness.

133
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,279
You're still here?

134
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,679
I was concerned

135
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,279
that some scoundrel might disturb you.

136
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,360
So I came to check on you.

137
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,200
Grand Tutor Xie

138
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,519
shared a bed with me just days ago.

139
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,960
Everyone in the Chen State knows.

140
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,320
And now,

141
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,399
he's changing my dressing in person.

142
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,399
Is he really obsessed with me?

143
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,799
Are you really obsessed with me?

144
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,639
Done.

145
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,559
My lady.

146
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,159
You just sat there and watched him

147
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,320
bully me?

148
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,840
You are the Seventeenth Prince of Qi.

149
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,759
If you weren't practically
begging to be bullied,

150
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,159
who would dare bully you?

151
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,240
What is this?

152
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
I've never seen it.

153
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:48,200
Xuzhou pastries.

154
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:01,080
I tasted them once
when I practiced martial arts as a kid.

155
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,120
Your master bought them for you?

156
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,919
See if it tastes the same.

157
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I haven't had one

158
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,759
for so many years.

159
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm from the Qi State.

160
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,679
My lady,

161
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,039
I've never tasted them.

162
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,799
Makes sense.

163
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Qi pastries must differ from ours.

164
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,159
Try it.

165
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,159
Don't you have hands?

166
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,200
My lady, it's so sweet.

167
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,720
Tea from Jigu Mountain in Jiangcheng?

168
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,759
Yes.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,320
It's the only pouch of new tea.

170
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,919
I kept it with me,

171
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,559
hoping to give it to you myself

172
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,159
when I see you.

173
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,559
You remember that I love
new teas from different places.

174
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,039
He's so thoughtful.

175
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,320
Although he only brought a pouch of tea,

176
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,639
it's enough

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,320
for me to share with you.

178
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,559
(Xie Fei.)

179
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,679
(You despicable man.)

180
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,879
But the jade hairpin
is taking a long time to polish.

181
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,399
I wanted

182
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:32,399
to carve it meticulously.

183
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,720
You'll outshine

184
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,440
the spring with it.

185
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,000
Spring's beauty

186
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,440
pales before our love.

187
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,120
Spring fades. But you must not.

188
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,159
(Oh, no.)

189
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,480
(My lady has fallen for a scoundrel.)

190
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
It's getting late.

191
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,679
I'll leave now.

192
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,440
Tomorrow, I'll guide Zhuozhou officials

193
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,000
to discover the gunpowder.

194
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,120
Chancellor Huo will surely panic

195
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,120
and check on the gunpowder
in the capital.

196
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,240
We'll catch him in the act.

197
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,600
Be careful.

198
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,840
Stay safe.

199
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,519
The matter is grave.

200
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,720
I'll take Feng Wuhen with me.

201
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,399
He's staying by your side,

202
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,639
clearly up to no good.

203
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,120
It's a precaution.

204
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,759
(Who gave you the right)

205
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,559
(to speak ill of me?)

206
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,240
They found those spots?

207
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,360
Seven out of thirteen.

208
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,639
Caught you.

209
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,080
Move them.

210
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,519
The hounds

211
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,559
chase the blood scent relentlessly,

212
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,960
unaware they're charging
blindly towards a cliff.

213
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
Time to end the game.

214
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,279
It's fishy.

215
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:30,759
Take a look.

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,500
Understood.

217
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,320
