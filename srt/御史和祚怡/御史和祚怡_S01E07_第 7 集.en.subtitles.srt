1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,703
This looks so good!

4
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,875
It's specially seasoned
with sesame seed oil and soy sauce…

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,085
It's even seasoned.

6
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,467
Her eating habits are rather rough.

7
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,553
By the way, how could you do that?

8
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:55,221
I get it was to fool them,

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,266
but how could you not tell us
about the crown prince's guards?

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,894
If I had told you in advance,
it would've been obvious.

11
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,063
Even so.

12
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,940
I was scared to death, you know.

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,448
I apologize.

14
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,700
Are you all right?

15
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,287
That's why I told you
to chew thoroughly and eat slowly.

16
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:20,789
Instead of that,

17
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,626
can you just stroke my back?

18
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,963
Stroke your back?

19
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,423
Yes.

20
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,134
In a downward motion.

21
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,512
Downward…

22
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,066
What are you doing? Are you even doing it?

23
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,025
Yes…

24
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,485
I am.

25
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,794
They say those who have
eaten meat before know how to.

26
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,006
You gobbled it up
as if you've never seen meat before.

27
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,048
Look at you now!

28
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,427
I worked so hard to cook it.

29
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,097
When would a commoner like me

30
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,433
ever have had a chance
to eat lean meat like this?

31
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,314
I've never seen this much meat in my bowl.

32
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,484
Even so!

33
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,113
How could you spit out
the food you chewed?

34
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,657
I can't eat any of my food
because it's everywhere!

35
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,371
You eat it.

36
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,346
What are these?

37
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,063
Taffy.

38
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,533
Taffy?

39
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,476
Has he gone insane?

40
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,688
Why did he put taffy on sticks?

41
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,534
He's not here.

42
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,620
Damn it.

43
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,294
Goodness.

44
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,963
Where's Hong Seok-gi?

45
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,177
Tell the Chief of Maritime Transport
to come out now.

46
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,805
The Chief is not here.

47
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,725
Did he leave for the day?
Where is his house then?

48
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,934
No, that's not it…

49
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,688
He was arrested and dragged away
by a secret royal inspector.

50
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,400
A royal inspector?

51
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,861
He's locked up at Soyang Trading Group.

52
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,866
Why didn't you tell me?

53
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,660
I've told you several times.

54
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,414
You have?

55
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,627
Let's go.

56
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,528
My lord, are you all right?

57
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,238
Shut it!

58
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,790
Guys.

59
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,710
Have you been well?

60
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,142
What are we going to do about this?

61
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,811
Our dear entertainers

62
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:21,107
came all the way to celebrate
the boss' birthday.

63
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,070
-That's right!
-But a stubborn scholar from Hanyang

64
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,407
used them as bait
for his boisterous scheme!

65
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,408
-That's right!
-That's right!

66
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,036
My goodness. If you succeed, you live.

67
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,831
If you don't, you're dead.

68
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:42,336
To see if we're meant to live or die,
we put on a show.

69
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,337
-That's right!
-That's right!

70
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:49,177
The birds sing in the morning
Because they're hungry

71
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:55,266
They sing in the evening
Because they miss their lovers

72
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,269
You must be a happy lady

73
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,355
You really must be a happy lady

74
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,483
Because the men are strong

75
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,487
-That's right.
-You must be a happy lady

76
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,780
-You and I
-You and I

77
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:13,618
-Bounce around and play
-Bounce around and play

78
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,120
-Day or night
-Day or night

79
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,373
-We'll always be in love
-We'll always be in love

80
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,126
-You and I
-You and I

81
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,044
Those bastards…

82
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,631
I hear they're having a party
at our mountain base.

83
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,966
They're having a wonderful time.

84
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,846
How dare they celebrate someone else's
birthday at someone else's house?

85
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,516
Let them enjoy themselves
while they still can.

86
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,643
I'll kill them soon enough.

87
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,232
Tae-seo, what are we going to do
about your arm?

88
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,864
There won't be a problem killing them.

89
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,869
Go fetch the mine.

90
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,579
I'll lay the fuse.

91
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,376
You're not going to use it here, are you?

92
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,585
Hey, punk.

93
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,421
You might end up
blowing up all of Baekgwiryeong.

94
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,758
I could blow up something even bigger
to catch the inspector.

95
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,426
Hurry.

96
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,520
Is there anything I can't do?

97
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,147
I wonder who will be
lucky enough to marry me.

98
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,066
My goodness.

99
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,068
Hang on.

100
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,156
She laughs at just about anything.

101
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,663
Do you see this?

102
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,456
Do you?

103
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,041
-My lord.
-Do you see this?

104
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,002
You need to learn how to have fun too.

105
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,920
What do you mean?

106
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,302
-What do you want me to do?
-Look at everyone.

107
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,220
Let's join them.

108
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,559
Come on now.

109
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,582
My lord, try doing it like this.

110
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,462
Come on. Wave your hands more.

111
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,425
Like this.

112
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,773
Are you all right?

113
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,660
Goodness. That was close.

114
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:05,039
These two pairs of lips almost met.

115
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,752
Seriously, what would you do without me?

116
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:13,214
-You must be relieved, right?
-Yes… Thank you.

117
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,965
Thanks.

118
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,762
As if you ever cared about me that much.

119
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,349
Goodness.

120
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,038
My lord.

121
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,957
My lord?

122
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,802
My lord.

123
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,763
My lord. I'm here too.

124
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,348
My lord?

125
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,436
Don't do anything stupid.

126
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,271
Do you even know how to use that?

127
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,605
Did I not mention

128
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,607
that I used to be a bandit?

129
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,067
A former outlaw

130
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,778
and a current scamming shaman,
you're really something else.

131
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,907
Not much different
from corrupt officials like you two.

132
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,830
You brat.

133
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,154
Sir, you shouldn't have…

134
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,282
This is Hong Seok-gi, right?

135
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,783
He needs to die

136
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,077
if my father is to sleep well.

137
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,165
I killed the right person, right?

138
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:18,839
Yes. You did.

139
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,925
The Chief of Maritime Transport.

140
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,558
Who are you?

141
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,187
I'm…

142
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,064
a nobody.

143
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:39,777
I don't know why,
but I'm locked up here as you can see.

144
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,363
I have no connection to them, whatsoever!

145
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,617
That brat tried to harm
the Chief of Maritime Transport.

146
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,496
She must hold a serious grudge!

147
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,292
Her?

148
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,752
Yes!

149
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,680
What are you doing?

150
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,722
Get her!

151
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,402
Damn it.

152
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,154
Get her now!

153
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,490
Hey.

154
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,245
Wait.

155
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,417
Take your time.

156
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,087
Let's have some fun.

157
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:47,970
There we go.

158
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,513
Ma'am.

159
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,602
Should we take the leftover backbones
and make a stew with some perilla leaves?

160
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,729
The kids will be hungry soon.

161
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,859
-What is it?
-Gokdu…

162
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,862
asked for a five-day payment extension.

163
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,452
Hunger leads to humiliation.

164
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,663
You shouldn't have to stoop
so low to make a living.

165
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,793
I'll come with you.

166
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,712
Feed the kids something for me.

167
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,354
You'd better not cross that line.

168
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,653
All right then.

169
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,004
What are you doing?

170
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,423
If you take the goods,
you either pay for them

171
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,344
or pay the consequences.
That is how we conduct our business.

172
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,514
Baekgwiryeong has issues.
So we asked for a five-day extension.

173
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,599
We'll pay.

174
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,184
Five days?

175
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,104
I don't live my life
thinking that far into the future.

176
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,732
You have until tomorrow to pay up.

177
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,735
If you don't,
I'll consider our deal off the table.

178
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,533
Are you going to sell
all that gunpowder out in the marketplace?

179
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,535
Or…

180
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,121
to the Ministry of War?

181
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,001
If that's not it,
you should show me some respect.

182
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,211
Besides Gokdu,

183
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,631
no merchant in Joseon
will buy gunpowder in bulk.

184
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,718
You shouldn't take me too lightly either.

185
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:55,305
The only one that can supply Gokdu
with the amount of gunpowder they desire

186
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,516
in all of Joseon is me.

187
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,770
I'll give you three more days.

188
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,689
Wait.

189
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,358
You destroyed our goods,

190
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,194
so you should compensate us!

191
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,322
I'm sure you learned a lesson
about how we do business.

192
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,409
That wasn't free, either.

193
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,380
Ma'am, the interpreter has sent a letter.

194
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,434
EAST INDIA TRADING CO.
PORTUGAL

195
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,022
A ship sailing from Portugal to Nagasaki

196
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,107
is loaded with rifles.

197
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,201
How many murder cases
have there been in just one month?

198
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,037
Maybe I should turn myself in now.

199
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,873
This is exactly why
you should live an honest life.

200
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,589
You must be tired.

201
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,758
Why don't you leave tomorrow?

202
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,677
Stepping in and bowing out
on a timely basis

203
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,096
is our way of life.

204
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,518
We had great fun,
so it's time to leave to find another one.

205
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,230
-Go on, Clown!
-Yes, sir.

206
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,079
My lord.

207
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,124
We shall take our leave.

208
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,416
So soon?

209
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,044
Once they hear
about the commotion in this region,

210
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,839
the local government
will send someone to investigate it.

211
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,259
We'll leave quietly before that happens.

212
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:58,762
You always save me when I'm in danger.

213
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,222
It's reassuring,

214
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,266
but I also feel bad.

215
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,227
I find it difficult to put into words.

216
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,980
The crown prince beseeched us

217
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,941
to protect you no matter what.

218
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,659
How are you living?

219
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,829
We manage to get by.

220
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,122
Please do not worry.

221
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,331
Why don't you…

222
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,917
return to the palace?

223
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:29,835
We won't.

224
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,672
We are alive when the crown prince isn't.

225
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,884
We don't deserve a government position.

226
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,930
As long as we're alive,

227
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,308
our final duty

228
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,185
is to protect you, my lord.

229
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,103
That is…

230
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,064
the very least we could do to atone

231
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,483
and show our devotion to His Highness.

232
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,447
And the royal medical records
you asked about last time…

233
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,573
Did you look into them?

234
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,992
The records from the time
around the Crown Prince's death

235
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,537
have all disappeared,
so we couldn't find out anything.

236
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,043
Luckily, we were able to obtain
his prescription through a court lady

237
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,836
who worked for him.

238
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,845
Ampelopsis radix and rhinoceros horn
should never be taken with aconite.

239
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,765
ACONITE

240
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,311
About six grams of aconite…

241
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,315
That's simply too much
to take with every meal.

242
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:38,695
Yes, so please get to the bottom
of this mystery, my lord.

243
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,407
I promise I will at all costs.

244
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,327
That is

245
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,413
the least I could do to show my devotion.

246
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,473
What is this?

247
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,183
Is it over already?

248
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,979
That's not fun.

249
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,106
Again.

250
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,817
Run.

251
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,194
Run!

252
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,121
Let's catch her again.

253
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,080
Go!

254
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,596
Why are you here alone? Where's Yook-chil?

255
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,182
I have no idea.
I haven't seen him in a while.

256
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,855
Why are you here alone?
Where's Gwang-soon?

257
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:59,067
I have no idea.
I haven't seen her in a while, either.

258
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,792
Gu-pal, you should go to bed.

259
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,170
I'm going to look through
these ledgers a bit more.

260
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,005
All right, then.

261
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,633
Geez. What a long day.

262
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,511
-Good night.
-Night.

263
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,342
Who's there?

264
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,638
Is someone out here?

265
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,375
Who is that?

266
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,418
Is it Gwang-soon?

267
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,964
Gwang-soon?

268
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,272
It's…

269
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,274
It's my mother-in-law.

270
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,571
You must be tired,
but you must stay alert through the night.

271
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,905
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

272
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,620
Where is she going?

273
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,374
Why is she…

274
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,545
Where is he going?

275
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,854
Where are you going?

276
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,314
There's no path that way!

277
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,653
No light, either.

278
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,281
What if she gets lost?

279
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,076
Stop right there!

280
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,706
Did you not hear me?

281
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,090
These are…

282
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,092
aconite.

283
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:18,516
Ampelopsis radix and rhinoceros horn
should never have been taken with aconite.

284
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,279
Mother!

285
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,201
-Mother?
-Mother! It's me, Jo-yi!

286
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,453
Jo-yi?

287
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,041
Don't step on that!

288
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,587
Mother!

289
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,052
Mother!

290
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,638
I told you not to step on them!

291
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,029
Got you.

292
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:25,750
Please spare me.

293
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,464
It's over now.

294
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,567
My goodness.

295
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,695
Talk about meeting your enemy
on a single log bridge…

296
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,991
That relentless brat.

297
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,161
How did she find me here?

298
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,875
My goodness.

299
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,712
Gosh.

300
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,214
Darn it.

301
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,800
Mother!

302
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,510
Got you!

303
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,804
Let go of me!

304
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,603
My goodness. It cracked because of you!

305
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,521
It cracked.

306
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,523
What happened?

307
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,360
Oh, no. What do I do?

308
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,652
It's all ruined.

309
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,029
Are you all right?

310
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,325
Oh, my…

311
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,827
You're the secret royal inspector.

312
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,373
Don't tell me you came
all this way for another inspection.

313
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,291
Inspection?

314
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,296
What are you doing here?

315
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,392
Why are you doing this?

316
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,896
You won't even let me
get my own child some food.

317
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,273
Why are you doing this?

318
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,025
Your child?

319
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,654
Tell me the truth.

320
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,203
Chu-han is here.

321
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,458
What is he doing here?

322
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,210
Mother.

323
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,712
Do you even know what this place is?

324
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,548
Do you know how dangerous--

325
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,967
We're in debt. What choice did we have?

326
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,302
Do you think Chu-han wanted to be dragged

327
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,013
to the middle of the mountains
and work like a slave?

328
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,766
Goodness.

329
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,564
Are you saying that
he's been working at the mountain base?

330
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,649
I wouldn't really call it work.

331
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,318
Anyway, I don't know anything.

332
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,822
I…

333
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,869
I heard that there are a lot of
leopards and foxes in this region.

334
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,830
Boars too!

335
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,916
We should get back.

336
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,626
Follow us.

337
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,504
I don't want to. I can't.

338
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,589
It's dangerous here!

339
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,507
My goodness, I can't.

340
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,218
It's pitch dark here.
What are you going to do

341
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,095
if you get attacked by a wild animal?

342
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,472
My Chu-han…

343
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:26,639
Be quiet!

344
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,400
Did you sleep well?

345
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:54,459
I'm sure I don't have to tell you
where you are.

346
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,170
Start talking now.

347
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,464
How do you know Chief Hong Seok-gi?

348
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,090
What were you doing there?

349
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,176
We don't know each other at all.

350
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,970
I really have nothing to do with this.

351
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,015
Then why were you guarding them?

352
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,395
The secret royal inspector
was the one who caught Hong Seok-gi…

353
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,317
Does that make you the inspector's minion?

354
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,486
The inspector's minion?

355
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,490
I don't know anything about that.
I've never even met an inspector.

356
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,162
Then why are you here when you don't know
the inspector or Hong Seok-gi?

357
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,843
So tell me.

358
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,511
Who are you?

359
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,514
Damn it.

360
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,522
Who are you?

361
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,901
You work for the inspector, right?

362
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,198
Do it.

363
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,659
It was an order from Lord Park Tae-seo!

364
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:21,713
Park Tae-seo is a lord
who has command over this whole region.

365
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:27,552
He caught the chief before
the inspector did and locked him up there.

366
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,471
And I was there on his orders.

367
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,099
Tae-seo did?

368
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,190
He should've just killed him
when he caught him.

369
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,151
I had to come here because he didn't.

370
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,905
He's useless.

371
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,871
Then…

372
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,457
you must know where the mountain base is.

373
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,880
Lead me there.

374
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,050
But Lord Yi-eon and Jo-yi
are at the mountain base right now.

375
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,886
You don't want to?

376
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,638
I will show you the way.

377
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,600
I know where Park Tae-seo's base
with the mine is.

378
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
Mine?

379
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,728
Yes.

380
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,147
I will lead you there.

381
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,400
There was a mine?

382
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,404
That's our Tae-seo…

383
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:32,700
Pull her up.

384
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:54,847
Goodness.

385
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,212
Why are they so dirty?

386
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,840
If I had known,
I would've washed them too.

387
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,134
Take them off.

388
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,929
If I wash and hang them now,
they should dry by tomorrow morning.

389
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,265
I don't think we're close enough

390
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,393
to reveal the smell
of each other's feet yet.

391
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,562
It's too early for that.

392
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,149
Let go of me, please!

393
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,984
Where are you taking me?

394
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,862
I'm talking right now. Who is that?

395
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,989
I can't go there.

396
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,034
Isn't that Lord Yi-eon and Jo-yi?

397
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,326
-What's going on?
-Let go!

398
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,913
In my experience,
the wisest thing to do in this situation

399
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,373
is to not check up on it.

400
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,835
They're probably
conducting official business.

401
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,382
He wouldn't kill her.
He is an educated lord, after all.

402
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,305
I guess he's killing her.

403
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,559
Kill her, as you wish.

404
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,353
-Take your socks off.
-I want to die right now.

405
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,147
-Hurry up and take them off.
-Wait…

406
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,273
Take them off.

407
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,818
I'm sorry, I pulled too hard.

408
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,448
My goodness.

409
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,034
Just kill me.

410
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:39,035
Goodness.

411
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,913
Goodness.

412
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,419
What does your son do
in the middle of the mountains?

413
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,090
Manual labor or chores,
everything he's told, I'm sure.

414
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,469
He was sold off
because of gambling debts, after all…

415
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,138
Then what about you?

416
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,973
Why were you dragged here with him?

417
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:06,229
Goodness. My Chu-han was being
dragged off by strange men.

418
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,397
I couldn't let him go alone.

419
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,110
I told them I'd help out in the kitchen.

420
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,028
I came here of my own will!

421
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,572
So you were secretly…

422
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,913
When is that fool
going to pull himself together

423
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,582
and stop making you suffer like this?

424
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:43,850
So,

425
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,102
what's up there?

426
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,439
I honestly don't know that much.

427
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,819
I hear there's a mine there
and they're digging something up.

428
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,490
But I'm not allowed to go up there.

429
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,410
No one can enter without permission.

430
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:11,085
I hide a ball of rice
around the middle of the mountain…

431
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,505
What Ji Maeng-su embezzled
with the base by colluding

432
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,549
with the officials are all there.

433
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,302
They sell all those goods
and the moonshine they make there

434
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,678
to the eight provinces.

435
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,306
I hear they make a lot of money from it

436
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,309
and use it to run Park Tae-seo's
smelting plant in Baekgwiryeong.

437
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,145
-A smelting plant in Baekgwiryeong?
-Yes.

438
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,439
I hear they dig up
the silver ores from the mines

439
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,859
and extract silver from them
in the smelting plant in Baekgwiryeong.

440
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,487
-A smelting plant…
-Then My Chu-han comes down

441
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,364
and takes it. That's all.

442
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,410
So that's why you were hiding there,
even when that mess was going on earlier?

443
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:49,207
But now he's going
to have to starve tonight.

444
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,419
My goodness.
My baby is probably waiting for me.

445
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,421
Your son is being held captive there,

446
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,757
so you must've heard
something from someone.

447
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,968
Tell me everything you know.

448
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,764
Well, Chu-han…

449
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,808
told me they make a fire.

450
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,519
They make a fire?

451
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:16,192
He told me they take the ores collected
from the mines and melt them with fire

452
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:20,738
at the smelting plant
in Baekgwiryeong all day long.

453
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,258
Let's go.

454
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,518
There's a guard post
overlooking the smelting plant,

455
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:55,690
and I heard the boss
of that place frequents there.

456
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,795
How many are stationed there?

457
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,464
The thugs that guard the place.

458
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,094
I doubt they even need
to guard that place.

459
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,723
The mountains around them
basically create a fortress.

460
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,725
Also,

461
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,937
I heard there's something
that explodes when you step on it.

462
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,825
What are they hiding that led them

463
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,454
to tribute embezzlement and even aconite?

464
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,709
What could their ultimate goal be?

465
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,213
Leave this place immediately.

466
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,298
Pardon?

467
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:06,218
Even with a gambling debt,
it's illegal to abduct and detain someone.

468
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,637
I'll take care of them.

469
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,527
Please save my Chu-han.

470
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,487
Yes.

471
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,030
I'm counting on you.

472
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,368
Goodness.

473
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,494
Mother.

474
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,927
Take this.

475
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,307
What about you?

476
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,811
Even if I want to,

477
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,188
I don't have a mother to provide for.

478
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,735
Get back safely.

479
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,822
The road is rough,

480
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,533
so walk slowly.

481
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,039
Why are you giving me more money?

482
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,091
You gave me more than enough last time.

483
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,930
Save it for later.

484
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,976
You should give it
to your mother when you meet her.

485
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,398
You take care of yourself, too.

486
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,027
Well, not that I need to tell you
since you're shrewd.

487
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:57,246
I feel so bad for my poor Chu-han.

488
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,167
I'm such a bad mother.

489
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:07,089
My goodness. This wretched fate of mine.

490
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:12,595
When March comes back around next year

491
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:19,226
The dead tree on the back hill

492
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:25,274
Will grow new leaves
And flowers will bloom

493
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,942
-My lord.
-Are you finally up?

494
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,031
Where are you going?

495
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,115
Morning has broken.

496
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,909
I must figure out where
the entrance to Baekgwiryeong is.

497
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:20,704
I must at least know where
the mine is if I'm to call soldiers over.

498
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,831
But it's so early…

499
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,250
We'll get ready quickly.

500
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,584
No.

501
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,461
It'll be faster if I go alone.

502
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,046
No, you shouldn't go alone.

503
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:32,049
What if there's a trap?
That's too dangerous.

504
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:36,428
A trap or whatever,
it's just what Jang Pat-soon overheard.

505
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,847
She didn't see it for herself.

506
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,267
It's highly likely
they're just baseless rumors.

507
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,105
No, you can't.
Where do you think you're going alone?

508
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,983
I'll run over to the provincial office
and ask for help.

509
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,234
Just write me a letter--

510
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,570
It's no use.
The officials are also in on it.

511
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,363
Then take Yook-chil and Gu-pal…

512
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,491
No. They'll just get in the way.
I'll be fine on my own.

513
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,910
Don't be like that.
Let's find a safer way--

514
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,287
Come on now.

515
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:04,248
Stop making a fuss.
I'll return once I find where it is.

516
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,586
What is it? Are you that worried about me?

517
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,545
Yes. No.

518
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,381
It's not that…

519
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,092
About me!

520
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,094
It's because I'm worried about myself.

521
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,764
Ever since I met you, I've gone
through a lot of dangerous things.

522
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,726
I almost died countless times.

523
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,769
That's why I'm going alone.

524
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,940
If you insist on going,
then I'll come with you.

525
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,526
No.

526
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,362
Stay here and look
for more ledgers with Gwang-soon.

527
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,448
That's helping me.

528
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,742
I told you, you can't!

529
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,913
My lord, then what about us?

530
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,044
I have something else for you two.

531
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,467
I need to submit a report
regarding this illegal enclosure soon.

532
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,510
-I need you…
-He wouldn't ask us to measure…

533
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,845
to measure the size of it.

534
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,015
From all the way over there

535
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,351
to that point.

536
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,770
This is nonsense.

537
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,396
I almost cursed just now.

538
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,856
-I did.
-What?

539
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,359
-What? What is it?
-Did you just speak down to me?

540
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,987
No, he just cursed you out.

541
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,239
You just spoke down to me, too,
didn't you?

542
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,158
No.

543
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,576
So…

544
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,702
what are we doing?

545
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,579
We need to measure the size of it.

546
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,096
Hey.

547
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,727
Are you sure we're going the right way?

548
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,855
We're almost there.

549
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:00,531
What is this?

550
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,621
If we go there,
we'll run into Lord Yi-eon.

551
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:11,542
This way.

552
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:15,879
Hey!

553
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,139
What are you doing?
Why did you suddenly change direction?

554
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:27,891
Is this really the way?

555
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,813
Yes, I must've gotten confused.
This is the side path.

556
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,129
This must be the way.

557
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,672
Let's go.

558
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,489
ALCOHOL

559
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,283
Goodness.

560
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,706
Wait…

561
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,333
Officer!

562
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,462
Pat-soon?

563
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,130
It is you!

564
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,466
My goodness. Officer!

565
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,010
What are you doing in this town?

566
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,389
My goodness…

567
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:54,186
You embrace me like this
every time you see me.

568
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,657
"Officer"?

569
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,160
What if someone hears you?
You shouldn't call me that!

570
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,495
Why not?

571
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,248
If I don't call you Officer,

572
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,959
-then what should I--
-Quiet.

573
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,171
What are you doing here?

574
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,217
I heard you and your son
were sold off due to debts.

575
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,177
This is where you ended up?

576
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:30,222
Don't even get me started on that.

577
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:33,767
I just got caught by that inspector,

578
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,395
so I got myself out first.

579
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,313
Inspector…

580
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:39,982
Which inspector?

581
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,777
The one who made my Chu-han a divorcee

582
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,530
and turned Gaehwa Valley upside down.

583
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,991
What…

584
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,578
Where…

585
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,997
is he right now?

586
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:55,956
Here?

587
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:59,126
Is he near here?

588
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,210
No, not here.

589
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,797
He's up in the mountains by the base…

590
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,141
We crossed paths again
because we stayed alive.

591
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,018
As long as we're alive,

592
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,605
we'll meet again someday, right?

593
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,241
When will that be?

594
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,340
The inspector is at the mountain base?
Then what do I do now?

595
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,009
The Chief of Maritime Transport is dead.

596
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,720
Why do I need to go this far
and risk my own life?

597
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:56,016
I might even end up
being framed for murder.

598
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,228
Should I…

599
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:02,773
just report it?

600
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,222
Men like him are the worst.

601
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,183
He's stubborn, doesn't listen to anyone,
and makes others worry.

602
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,185
Why are you huffing and puffing?

603
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,020
You sound like his wife or something.

604
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,189
Wife? Please.

605
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,692
I'm just…

606
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:50,153
Well…

607
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,908
Right.

608
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,204
I just want to catch the bad guys
that killed Bo-ri and punish them.

609
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,915
And to do that, I need the inspector.

610
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,960
That's why I'm just angry at him
because he doesn't listen!

611
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,294
Sure. Fine.

612
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,130
Let's find the ledgers first.

613
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:11,591
We need to find them if we want
to catch the culprit or whatever, right?

614
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,511
I simply hate that time is being wasted.

615
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,764
I hate being misunderstood
like this even more!

616
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,226
And the inspector acting like this
just makes me livid!

617
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,061
-I'm getting livid!
-Right?

618
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,063
He's just so stubborn!

619
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,903
Focus on the goods dealt with the most,

620
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:35,490
the locations of the transactions,
the ones involved, and an official seal.

621
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:38,535
And see if you recognize any of the names.

622
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:48,545
These are the deals
involving goods meant for the king.

623
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,005
This must be a tribute ledger.

624
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,926
This must be a slave trade ledger.
The kids' names are in it.

625
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,720
Those bastards.

626
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,473
They did every bad thing they could
by colluding with government officials.

627
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,267
It names all the officials
and the offices involved, right?

628
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,185
Yes.

629
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,563
With this, we could arrest Cha Mal-jong
and all those that colluded with him.

630
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,399
Can you look over
the ledgers written in Chinese?

631
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,276
I'll look over the ones in Korean.

632
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,295
How did you learn to read?

633
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,547
I couldn't even get my hands
on the Thousand Character Classic.

634
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,219
Right. Well…

635
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,721
Anyway, it's amazing you've mastered it.

636
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,557
Well, sure…

637
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,143
By the way, where are you from?

638
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,271
You don't sound like
you're from Chungcheong.

639
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,233
Well, I…

640
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:56,029
My hometown is in Gyeongsang Province,
but I lived in Hanyang before I came here.

641
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,741
Hanyang?

642
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,744
Then you must know well about Hanyang.

643
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,955
I've never been there in my whole life.

644
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,416
Is it true you get robbed
in the blink of an eye there?

645
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,418
Even if you keep your eyes open like this?

646
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,716
If you're from Gyeongsang Province,
how did you end up here after Hanyang?

647
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,263
Right…

648
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,478
Then again,

649
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,481
I don't even know
how I ended up here, either.

650
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,859
I was planning
on going to Hanyang after my divorce,

651
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,443
but after I met the inspector…

652
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,946
What am I doing
in the middle of the mountains?

653
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:42,409
But still, when I think of Bo-ri,
I can't just leave.

654
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,621
What can you do when
life is simply unpredictable?

655
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:47,581
Right?

656
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,635
-The grain tribute ledger.
-Yes, that.

657
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,847
We need that ledger
if we want to find Bo-ri's real killer,

658
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,764
but…

659
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,558
But…

660
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,397
I can't find any ledger
related to the grain tributes.

661
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,234
Did Cha Mal-jong manage
to snatch it away already?

662
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,404
No. It could be among the other ledgers.

663
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,491
Let's first go through everything here
and then search the base if we need to.

664
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:24,993
Right. Let's do that.

665
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:27,162
This is in Chinese. You look through it.

666
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,290
I have so much more
to look through, Jo-yi.

667
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,250
I know. This is in Chinese, too.

668
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,960
How far are we going?

669
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,211
Darn it.

670
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:40,944
Don't touch me!

671
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,618
Darn it.

672
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:04,509
There isn't even a path here.

673
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,928
Why are we setting a trap here?

674
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,471
The inspector is down there.

675
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,307
A path or not,
set a trap on every possible route up here

676
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,934
so that he can't set foot here.

677
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,353
We must buy time until the silver hardens.

678
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,315
You're so thorough.

679
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:22,360
I mean, it is better to bury it
than let someone else have it.

680
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,237
When I think about all the trouble

681
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,906
you went through
to dig up those silver ores…

682
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,253
You bastard!

683
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,755
It works pretty well.

684
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,924
Install as many as you can,
as tightly as possible.

685
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:49,179
So that as soon as
he sets foot in here from any direction,

686
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:51,431
he ends up looking like a hedgehog.

687
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,143
You…

688
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,646
I'll make you a hedgehog first. Come here.

689
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,398
I'll make you…

690
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,983
You come over here.

691
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,698
If you're busy, go do what you need to do.

692
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,033
I'll take care of this.

693
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:12,243
Maybe you could dip
the arrowheads in aconite.

694
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:16,873
Our Tae-seo…

695
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,126
is so sincere when
it comes to killing an inspector.

696
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,047
But wouldn't it be better to capture him?

697
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,175
It's not like we're inspector hunters.

698
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,260
Why are we killing people like this?

699
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,670
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

700
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:47,922
THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD ACTORS
IN THIS EPISODE WAS PROPERLY ENSURED

701
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:06,983
It's surprising.

702
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,029
There are so many people going
to the top of the mountain today.

703
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,490
Is this my fault? Is this really my fault?

704
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,201
You will regret this.
You should send someone to check.

705
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,077
Isn't that gunpowder?

706
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,079
They don't sound like your common thieves.

707
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,998
The wrong guests have arrived.

708
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,959
How do we receive
troubling news every day without fail?

709
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,336
How dare you!

710
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,255
How dare a filthy lowborn
like you talk to me?

711
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,799
This is what you get for coming after me.

712
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,843
My lord!

713
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,763
