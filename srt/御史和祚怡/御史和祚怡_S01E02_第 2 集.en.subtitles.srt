1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,772
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,118
Park Moo-kyung.

4
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:39,039
He was definitely taken care of
with the sunken freighter.

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,833
But my lord, we still have the ledger.

6
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,377
We should be fine as long
as we take care of this body.

7
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:45,920
Damn it!

8
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:51,342
You must know where it's hidden.

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,970
I was in a rush,

10
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,473
so I didn't get a chance to hear…

11
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,105
Where is the ledger?

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,106
Tell me!

13
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,457
Quickly!

14
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,294
Move aside!

15
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,547
Bow down!

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,906
Sir.

17
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,991
Did you just see that?

18
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,910
The dead body just…

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,954
A horse plaque.

20
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,414
A horse plaque…

21
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,667
Does that mean he was also…

22
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,960
He must have been

23
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,963
one of those secret royal inspectors
reported missing or dead.

24
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,591
Inspector Park Moo-kyung
who went to Chungcheong…

25
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,761
They don't know if he's dead alive.
No one has heard from him.

26
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:19,848
-Yook-chil.
-Yes?

27
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,599
I need you to get dressed properly.

28
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,017
Pardon?

29
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,030
Come!

30
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,827
Come!

31
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,415
Come…

32
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,878
Who dares make such a commotion

33
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,590
outside office hours
in front of a government building?

34
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,799
Come now.

35
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,385
Show some respect.

36
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,888
-What?
-Let me tell you who I am.

37
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,723
I'm the Chief of Wood from Hanseongbu.

38
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,850
-Chief of Property and Farmland.
-Chief of Property and Farmland.

39
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,727
Oh Dong-yip.

40
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,354
As in paulownia leaves?

41
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,235
That's correct.

42
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,906
I was just on my way back to my hometown
after being granted respite.

43
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,325
But on the hill by the waterway,

44
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,369
I crossed paths with bandits
and was robbed blind.

45
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,163
So I came here,

46
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,583
hoping that the magistrate
could offer me some soup and rice,

47
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,003
along with a place to rest for a bit.

48
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,463
I'm not sure.

49
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:38,176
Why don't you go and ask the tavern
or a private residence for help?

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,845
This is a government office.

51
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,013
How dare you!

52
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,226
How could a man of noble birth like me
be seen begging for handouts

53
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,518
for everyone to see!

54
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,521
Yes, it is quite unfortunate,

55
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,858
but we cannot due to
an urgent matter we're dealing with.

56
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,527
Our master is

57
00:03:57,028 --> 00:04:00,198
first cousins once removed
with Lord Oh of Saheonbu.

58
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,785
Bang-deuk, you fool!

59
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:08,289
How dare you mention the name of
Lord Oh of Saheonbu, my uncle?

60
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,249
Blood relations…

61
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,458
Resorting to such things

62
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,544
just to get myself a measly meal
would be such an ignoble act!

63
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,380
You just made me an ignoble man.

64
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,968
How will I face my uncle,
Lord Oh of Saheonbu, later on?

65
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,137
Forget my uncle's name,
Lord Oh of Saheonbu.

66
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,140
Sir, think about your bad knees!
Where are you going?

67
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,642
Just imagine how your uncle

68
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,978
would react
if he saw you suffering like this!

69
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,397
He'd be furious.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,108
Did we walk all this way
just to suffer like this?

71
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,609
Talk to him once more. Please.

72
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,778
Stop! That's enough!

73
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,489
If I die while walking down the road,

74
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,493
that's just my fate
as a fifth-rank chief of Hanseongbu.

75
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,412
Do not mind me.

76
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,706
My lord, please.

77
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,792
My lord! There's been a misunderstanding.

78
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,876
Let's go.

79
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,086
Let's be on your way.

80
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,463
Let's get to my hometown quickly

81
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,425
and meet my uncle, Lord Oh of Saheonbu…

82
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,511
Rise, my knees!

83
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,516
Wait, my lord!

84
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,978
Just a moment.
Please wait here for just a moment.

85
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,824
It is true!

86
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,784
How can we believe that?

87
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,953
So many officials
have extorted local officials

88
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,039
pretending to be related
to senior officials.

89
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,624
What if we send him away

90
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,335
and it turns out he was telling the truth?

91
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,298
Still, how can we let an outsider in
while we're dealing with this mess?

92
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:45,303
Just give him some gukbap
and send him on his way.

93
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,638
Are you risking your life
over a bowl of rice?

94
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,312
In the meantime,

95
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,773
I'll go fetch the ledger.

96
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,234
Where is the ledger?

97
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,861
I told you, I don't know.

98
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,323
Bo-ri must have hidden it well as I said.

99
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,915
So you must go and find it.

100
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,542
You must find it. Go on.

101
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,504
Go on. Now.

102
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:25,259
BO-RI'S

103
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,620
Damn brat.

104
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,544
You'll sort out everything for me,
won't you?

105
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,171
I don't know.

106
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,215
Why should I clean up after you?

107
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,010
I don't have any family besides you.

108
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,554
There you go again.

109
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,349
Why did you have to die so young
and cause me trouble?

110
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,854
You always complain like this
when you'll do it anyway.

111
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:24,110
Jo-yi, clean this room up for me,
so it sparkles.

112
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,571
And as for my things,

113
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,116
send them by carefully burning them.

114
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,494
All right?

115
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,664
As if.

116
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,416
Dummy.

117
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,279
You never even got a chance
to put your baby in this…

118
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,460
You were too sweet for this world
and never even had a chance to enjoy life.

119
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,671
You're really something else, Hwang Bo-ri.

120
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,301
You moron, halfwit,
dummy, fool, blockhead.

121
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,142
At least this…

122
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,063
I'll carefully bury it for you, Bo-ri.

123
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,462
BO-RI'S

124
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,312
What's that brat doing
in someone else's house?

125
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,106
If she finds the ledger…

126
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,942
No, even if she did,
she wouldn't know what it is.

127
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,485
Should I just kick her out?

128
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,029
No. Let sleeping dogs lie.

129
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,824
Excuse me, sir!

130
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,581
Have you seen my daughter-in-law
by any chance?

131
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:46,836
She scurried off
while I was in the outhouse again.

132
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,173
I was worried this might happen,
so I even did it with the door open.

133
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,384
I'm not interested in such details.

134
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,929
That wench is at Bo-ri's again…

135
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,729
Let her be.

136
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,398
She's mourning her friend.

137
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,447
Did you have dinner?

138
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,579
If you didn't,

139
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,457
why don't you come to my place?

140
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,587
You can have dinner
and listen to my story.

141
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:34,717
I feel so wronged and angry
that I might even die.

142
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,305
I'm not hungry.

143
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,025
Then why are you,
in the middle of the night,

144
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:56,155
aimlessly sauntering in front of a tavern?

145
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,034
A widow understands a widower's plight.

146
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:04,622
When you go home after work,
you must feel lonely, right?

147
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,293
My goodness, why you…

148
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,049
But I feel so bad for the magistrate
after what happened to Bo-ri.

149
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,677
Hold on! Let's go.
Let's go to your place and chat.

150
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,305
So were they really a thing?

151
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,432
Come on now. Let's get going.

152
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,525
Welcome, my lord.

153
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,862
If you hang a bell around his neck
and watch him jump when surprised,

154
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,781
you'll be entertained for hours.

155
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,659
-He doesn't even cost that much.
-Do you have any white doves?

156
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,328
Well, white doves are so rare.

157
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:48,457
I could try to get one
through a merchant in Nagasaki.

158
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,627
However, it will cost you
the price of a whole deer antler.

159
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,422
Get me one.
I'll give you enough for two deer antlers.

160
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,589
Yes, my lord.

161
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,467
A slippery loach…

162
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:04,140
I came by because I heard
this place sold them as crane feed.

163
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,100
And here you are.

164
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,854
You went to the trouble of coming here
to buy some loaches?

165
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:14,525
It's because my crane has eaten up
all the pests it could possibly find.

166
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,487
I heard you've been managing
some slippery loaches yourself.

167
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,072
Be careful

168
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,158
not to let a crane catch them.

169
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:31,041
Do you believe yourself to be a crane?

170
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,420
The way I see it,
you and I are both mere loaches

171
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,006
in front of the real crane,
His Majesty the King.

172
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,632
Raising a crane taught me

173
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,136
that when its clipped feathers
grow back, it flies away.

174
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:49,185
Don't be so sure that
he'll remain in your birdcage forever.

175
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,022
Even if my crane flies away,
why would it go to you?

176
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,900
Why don't you buy loaches

177
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,652
and go feed your crane at home?

178
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,156
Take care, my lord.

179
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,372
How could he not take care
of a single secret royal inspector

180
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,707
and create this mess?

181
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,127
Where's Tae-seo and what's he doing?

182
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:09,557
Tae-seo! There you are.

183
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,601
What are you doing here at this hour,
Chief of Maritime Transport?

184
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,562
Well, the thing is…

185
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:15,896
I'm glad that you're here.

186
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,149
Take a look at this.

187
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,568
It's silver.

188
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,696
What?

189
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,991
Have you finally succeeded in Cupellation?

190
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,868
CUPELLATION: THE EXTRACTION
OF PURE SILVER FROM IMPURITIES

191
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,661
What did I tell you?

192
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,288
I told you I could, didn't I?

193
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,165
With two geuns of lead,
I extracted two dons of silver.

194
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,794
This means that we can trade with nations
that use silver as currency.

195
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,421
We should buy some weapons.

196
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,757
Enough to overturn Joseon.

197
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,386
Great. Congratulations.

198
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,264
However, this is not the time
for all this.

199
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,976
They couldn't find the ledger.

200
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,606
Thanks to a Gaehwa Valley officer,
I found the magistrate's mistress,

201
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,441
but she refused to open her mouth.

202
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,694
So I tried to scare her a bit,
but she fell into the valley.

203
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,405
What on earth
is the chief state councilor doing?

204
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:10,576
They sent another
secret royal inspector from Hanyang--

205
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,457
You should've told them to find it
even if they have to burn Gaehwa Valley!

206
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,926
Rip him or skin him to death,

207
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,511
I'll leave that up to you.

208
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,723
It doesn't matter
if it's the magistrate or the inspector.

209
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,934
What I need is the ledger.

210
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,102
Understood?

211
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,440
Get the ledger. I understand.

212
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,358
The ledger…

213
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,782
My goodness. Thank you
for the generous hospitality.

214
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,663
I've been suffering
from hand tremors recently.

215
00:15:56,163 --> 00:16:00,793
Would you mind if I ask my servant
for some assistance?

216
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,170
Be my guest.

217
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,630
Thank you.

218
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,591
Bang-deuk!

219
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,219
Come in and attend to me.

220
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,728
Your knees.

221
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,151
Water. Pour me some water.

222
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,195
Yes, sir.

223
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,454
If he truly is the nephew
of Lord Oh of Saheonbu,

224
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,164
why is he here now, of all times?

225
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,875
Please save me.
Do I really have to do this?

226
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,043
Begin.

227
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,462
He's so mean.

228
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,547
That's right.

229
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,176
It seemed on my way here
that someone had died.

230
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,930
Died? Who died?

231
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,599
My goodness. That's absurd.

232
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,893
Wait. Why are you so surprised?

233
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,563
I believe it was a maiden from this town.

234
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:04,815
A maiden?

235
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes, that's right.

236
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,237
It seems that she went up
the mountain for a bath

237
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,281
but ended up slipping and falling.

238
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,159
The terrain of this town is quite rough.

239
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:19,830
We are discussing ways
to avoid such tragedies in the future.

240
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,709
It must be very tough for you.

241
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,380
Another yukjeon. Quickly.

242
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,007
Ask him first.

243
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,428
By the way,

244
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,557
I am not very well-versed
in the penal code,

245
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,684
but isn't it customary

246
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:44,104
to conduct an autopsy when someone dies?

247
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,486
Why would we perform an autopsy
when it wasn't even a murder case?

248
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,113
The maiden's death was accidental.

249
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,701
I see. I wasn't aware.

250
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,329
It's fine.

251
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,997
It's understandable.

252
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,710
She had quite a knack for cooking.

253
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,967
Dig deeper.

254
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,348
But isn't it quite odd?

255
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,186
A pregnant woman going all the way
to take a bath in cold creek water?

256
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,270
Besides,

257
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:29,775
how did she manage to climb
to the top of the mountain in her state?

258
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,945
Hold on there.

259
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,156
How did you know she was pregnant?

260
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,701
I just…

261
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,372
I heard people whispering
outside the building.

262
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,709
Then how did you find out about that?

263
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:50,838
Well.

264
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:56,009
She lived in this town,
and I heard people talking about it.

265
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,390
It seemed she didn't even have a husband.

266
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,602
By any chance,

267
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,106
could someone have murdered her
and disguised it as an accident?

268
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,278
How could you say such a thing?

269
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:15,904
A murder?

270
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,326
Then again, I'm sure that's not the case.

271
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,372
Who would hold a grudge against a maiden
who ran the local tavern?

272
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,459
That is, unless illicit love was involved?

273
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,390
Ask about the royal inspector.

274
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,685
I heard

275
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,898
a secret royal inspector
dispatched to Chungcheong

276
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,150
recently returned looking like a beggar--

277
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,569
That's impossible.
What do you mean he returned?

278
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,365
You must have been misinformed.

279
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,201
There's no way he could have returned.

280
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,413
Perhaps it was not Chungcheong,
but Gyeonggi.

281
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,248
It must have been Gyeonggi.

282
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,377
If you're done eating,
perhaps you should be on your way.

283
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,879
It's getting quite late.

284
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,339
Our guests are leaving.

285
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,468
Wait, just one yukjeon.

286
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,473
Gosh, I feel tipsy.

287
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,185
Was it nice eating by yourself?

288
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:31,230
All you had to do was ask him
to set another table for me.

289
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,565
Was that so difficult?
I'm starving to death.

290
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,652
You think acting is easy?
I couldn't think of anything else.

291
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,362
My…

292
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,202
I wasn't bad as Chief of Wood, I mean,

293
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,704
I wasn't bad as
Chief of Property and Farmland, right?

294
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,749
I must go and find evidence.

295
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,418
Where?

296
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:58,674
The ledger…

297
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,677
Where is the officer?

298
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,470
What is he doing?

299
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,723
That wench. That tiny little thing.

300
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,227
She's rambunctious and wicked.

301
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,897
I didn't want her to choke on the rice,
so I gave her some soy sauce.

302
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,442
I gave all the greasy meat to my son.

303
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,320
I was always worried about her health.

304
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:24,408
You don't know
how many fresh vegetables I fed her.

305
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,618
Here.

306
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,374
I have to go and find the ledger.

307
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,836
But, sir…

308
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,508
You've been deep in thought for a while.

309
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,931
If you have something to say,
go on and say it.

310
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,849
What?

311
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:52,602
Do you want something from me?

312
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,900
No, not at all.

313
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,195
Be honest.

314
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,365
Why would you agree to come over
if you didn't want something?

315
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,076
My goodness, men.

316
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,247
Why must they all be so sly?

317
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:28,513
You used to always chant
that Joseon was hell on earth.

318
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,683
Good for you. You managed to escape.

319
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,436
I hope in the afterlife

320
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
that you live in a palatial mansion,

321
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,982
wear only the finest of silks,

322
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,569
eat meat soup with seven side dishes,
and find happiness there.

323
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,363
Don't bother wandering around
like a lost soul.

324
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,921
Look at this. Look.

325
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,006
What are that man and woman doing?

326
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,718
-These are things you need to know later.
-No, I don't.

327
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,596
See how detailed this picture is.

328
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,433
Jo-yi, how could you enjoy
reading such vulgar things?

329
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,851
-Look at this.
-Goodness!

330
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,769
Look at that.

331
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,355
Playing around with love. Like this.

332
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,440
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

333
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,214
What?

334
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:46,883
What is that?

335
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,249
Hello? Is someone back there?

336
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,506
Who is it?

337
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,758
This tavern is closed for business.

338
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,761
I'm the Chief of Wood from Hanseongbu…

339
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,305
Can you just open this gate?

340
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,307
Just go on your way.

341
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,224
How dare you?

342
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,310
I'm speaking to you.

343
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,854
"How dare you?"

344
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:42,772
How dare a lowly servant…

345
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,401
What? You are…

346
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,321
You're the beggars from earlier.

347
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,530
We're not beggars!

348
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,827
You should've just left.
How dare you raise your voice!

349
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,496
Stop! Don't glare at me!

350
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,207
Come now, Bang-deuk, you fool.

351
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,666
-Stop glaring.
-Look down.

352
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,710
I'm the nobleman. I'll take care of this.

353
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:08,882
I am a fifth-rank chief of Hanseongbu.

354
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,051
I'm not some strange or bad man.

355
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,682
You're not fooling anyone.

356
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,018
Do you think
you're the only ones going around

357
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,438
pretending to be someone important
from Hanyang to con people for a meal?

358
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,941
You must think of the countryside
as a joke.

359
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,985
If you get caught doing that,
you'll get whipped and flogged.

360
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,154
Your lives can be ruined, you know!

361
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,366
Get it together!

362
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,827
You're perfectly healthy,
so go do some manual labor!

363
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,581
How dare young punks like you
try to freeload for a meal?

364
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,043
The world's a damn mess.

365
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,422
Did I just…

366
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,509
Did I just get hit on the head?

367
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,178
I told her I was a fifth-rank chief,
and she still hit me.

368
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,554
My lord, we should just go.

369
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,765
We'll end up dying
before we find the evidence.

370
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,517
We should stop provoking her.

371
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,851
-Hey!
-What?

372
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,395
You…

373
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,690
What if I'm actually
a high-ranking nobleman?

374
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,944
Bang-deuk, you fool. Have you gone mad?

375
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:15,573
What I meant was…

376
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:20,203
What would you do if my lord here
was actually a high-ranking nobleman?

377
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,622
Ma'am.

378
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,083
Ma'am!

379
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,545
High-ranking? Please.

380
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,221
By the way,

381
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,683
did you really come from Hanyang?

382
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,601
My lord?

383
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,780
There's not much to eat
because it's not my place.

384
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,240
My lord.

385
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,617
-Do not worry, ma'am.
-Pardon?

386
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,162
Do not… I mean.

387
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,997
Do not worry.

388
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,339
A chief in Hanseongbu must be
a very high-ranking position.

389
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,924
Then, you must have
passed the state exams.

390
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,761
Of course, I did.

391
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:18,845
I passed.

392
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,263
I passed on the first try.

393
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,850
My lord was never interested
in taking a government post,

394
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:27,062
but the elders kept
pestering him to take the exam.

395
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,813
So he just took it

396
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,483
and passed with the highest mark.

397
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,447
-The highest mark?
-That's right.

398
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,741
What was the sije?

399
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,911
SIJE: THE THEME OF THE STATE EXAM ESSAY

400
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,663
Sije…

401
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,417
Let's see here…

402
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,796
The sije…

403
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,506
What was the sije?

404
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,178
Do you even know what that word means?

405
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,347
You're beggars, aren't you?

406
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,848
Gwan-eo-hae-ja-nan-wi-su.

407
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:08,645
"Those who have seen the ocean
do not consider the river water."

408
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,190
"Those who dealt with important matters
don't be affected by trivial ones."

409
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,363
It's from volume one
of Mencius' The Heart.

410
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,532
The subtheme was gwan-eo-dae-bu.

411
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,784
A piece of text by Mogeun.

412
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,955
Do you remember now, my lord?

413
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,375
That's right! It was The Heart by Mencius.

414
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,377
I remember it now!

415
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,753
Teaching you is paying off.

416
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,297
Then…

417
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,718
Hold on. Hold on for just a moment.

418
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,805
Sir.

419
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,018
Sir.

420
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,396
Sir!

421
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,568
I can see why he lives alone

422
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,237
when he looks perfectly normal.

423
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,284
This is all Jo-yi's fault!

424
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,162
Where did that brat go
in the middle of the night?

425
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,207
Can you take a look at this?

426
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,917
Wait, no. Not this.

427
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,257
This is a petition that I wrote myself.

428
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,426
Maybe it's because I lack writing skills,

429
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,678
but I'm about to lose my trial.

430
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,638
Trial?

431
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,515
You're trying to get a divorce?

432
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,065
I mean, this isn't too bad, is it?

433
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,277
But the thing is, my in-laws tend
to be on the extreme side.

434
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,489
They keep refuting my argument with lies.
How can I win?

435
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,700
Speaking of which,

436
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,619
if you managed to pass the state exam,

437
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,579
you must have pretty good writing skills.

438
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,081
It's a given.

439
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,377
Then could you fix this for me?

440
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,839
Maybe the sentences
can be spruced up a bit?

441
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,966
-Spruce it up?
-Yes.

442
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,178
But why are you trying to get a divorce?

443
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,596
Your age is still…

444
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,932
What about it?
What does age have to do with this?

445
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,644
Can't get a word out
without her biting your head off.

446
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,230
Bang-deuk, this is no place
for you to meddle.

447
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,564
Why you little…

448
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,149
Oh, my! Look at this kid!

449
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,445
How dare you talk back to your master!
Stop that!

450
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,036
Did she just hit me?

451
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,541
Yes! Run that mouth again,
and I'll hit you again!

452
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,209
Again?

453
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,838
-She'll hit me again?
-My lord…

454
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,924
I think my lips were hit.

455
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,510
-Even my grandmother never hit me there.
-I know.

456
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,845
-So…
-Calm down, my lord.

457
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,265
I'd really appreciate it if you could
take a look from here to here.

458
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,183
Please.

459
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,645
She hit someone and doesn't even care.

460
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,024
Young Ma… No, Bang-deuk.

461
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,987
There he goes again with his nonsense.

462
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,824
Goodness. Oh, my.

463
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,159
It seems like
he has quite a serious illness.

464
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,704
It is. He's fine one minute
and like this the next.

465
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,334
This is mine.

466
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,336
Thank you.

467
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,797
Where is that damn sly fox?

468
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,841
Do you know what time it is right now?

469
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,386
How could a daughter-in-law
be out in the middle of the night?

470
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,139
Are you just going to be reckless
from now on?

471
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,351
I'm not your daughter-in-law anymore.
Because I'll be getting a divorce.

472
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,689
How can such a tiny pipsqueak
be so damn stubborn?

473
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,650
What is this? Men…

474
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,861
Those are all men.

475
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,030
Have you gone mad?

476
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,783
Have you been with those men
all this time?

477
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,036
I caught you in the act, you brat.
Let's go.

478
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,038
-Mother!
-What do you think you're doing?

479
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,668
It's none of your business,
so stay out of this.

480
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,755
I'm this brat's mother-in-law!

481
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,881
And he is…

482
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,092
a chief of Hanseongbu.

483
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,345
Wait, what?

484
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,971
You heard him.

485
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,434
He is a chief from Hanseongbu
and he's here to help me with my petition.

486
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,646
What?

487
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:23,900
How could a country bumpkin like you
know a chief?

488
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,986
You're just spewing nonsense

489
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,698
because I caught you
fooling around with men.

490
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,159
If he's a chief,

491
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:36,829
then I'm Her Majesty the Queen, you brat!

492
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,164
But he really is…

493
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,166
Hanseongbu is in charge of the laws.

494
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:48,049
It is one of the three branches
of the judiciary

495
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,759
and mainly deals with civil cases.

496
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,513
Its jurisdiction not only includes Hanyang
but all regional courts.

497
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,473
It also sentences punishments.

498
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:56,975
Punishments?

499
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,228
If you wish to check
if my lord is a real chief,

500
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,270
be my guest.

501
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,482
However, today's insulting behavior

502
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:07,068
will not be easily forgotten by him.

503
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,573
Don't take too long.

504
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,118
Do you understand?

505
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,131
Why do you wish to get a divorce?

506
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,050
You all have seen why.

507
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,390
But my mother-in-law
isn't the only reason.

508
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:39,976
I just…

509
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,980
I want to be happier
than I am now, at least.

510
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,449
I don't want to talk about it.
You'll just scold me.

511
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,826
If Bo-ri were alive…

512
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,290
About…

513
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,417
Bo-ri, that maiden.

514
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,461
Is she the one

515
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,963
that passed away today?

516
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,049
How did you know?

517
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,593
We just happened to hear
about it on our way over here.

518
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,510
Coincidentally.

519
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,475
She was like a sister to me.

520
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,812
She was supposed to be my witness
at my divorce trial.

521
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,317
She said she'd come by 1 p.m.,
but she went for a bath all of a sudden.

522
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,446
And then she died in that accident.

523
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,991
She promised
to come to the trial by 1 p.m.?

524
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,286
She's never one to break a promise.
I just don't understand.

525
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,288
The creek is at least three ris away.

526
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,166
For a woman,
especially if she was pregnant,

527
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,960
it would take at least an hour
to make the round trip.

528
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:48,920
However,

529
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,672
the time her body drifted downstream was…

530
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,467
Bo-ri.

531
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,469
…around 2 p.m.

532
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,763
She would never do such a thing.

533
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,098
It just doesn't make sense.

534
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,475
Unless she was determined
to break that promise,

535
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:05,144
that maiden unexpectedly went out

536
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,854
for some unclear reason.

537
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:12,693
Could she have had another reason?
Perhaps someone was after her.

538
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,029
No. That's impossible.

539
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,991
She had excellent cooking skills,
and everyone in town loved her.

540
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,245
Did she leave any personal effects behind?

541
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,043
This kid and his curt tone again.

542
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,504
Ask politely.

543
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,841
Did she leave
any personal effects behind, ma'am?

544
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,385
No, she didn't.

545
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,344
I burned it all.

546
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,055
What? Why would you burn all that…

547
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,682
That's all evidence!

548
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:46,269
She needs her belongings if she's not
to be ashamed in front of her maker.

549
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,439
But why do you ask?

550
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:55,236
Why are you asking about this
when I'm so sad I lost my friend?

551
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,197
I apologize on his behalf.

552
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,867
We're a bit curious about something.

553
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,537
So there are no personal effects left now?

554
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,292
Let's go, my lord.

555
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,044
Wait.

556
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,046
Hold on. Wait, my lord.

557
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,549
You said you'd help me revise my petition.

558
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,135
Fine, I'll do it for you.

559
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,845
No, not you.

560
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,763
Wait, my lord.

561
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,307
Why that…

562
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,392
Hold on. My lord!

563
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,895
How could she be so thoughtless?

564
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,647
And she's so violent.

565
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,608
On top of that, she's so sly.

566
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,861
She bows down to the nobles
but looks down on the lowly.

567
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,280
That's exactly how we feel
every day in our lives.

568
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,034
Of course, we were lucky enough
to meet a good master

569
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,702
and live spoiled lives.

570
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,959
Let's think.

571
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,087
With the dazzling intelligence
that allowed me

572
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,632
to score the highest after cramming…

573
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:01,886
This case.

574
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,555
The dead secret royal inspector
must be Park Moo-kyung.

575
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,890
Park Moo-kyung?

576
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,019
I heard at Hongmungwan the name of
the inspector dispatched to Chungcheong.

577
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,729
That means…

578
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,233
his body washed up on the beach
a few days after his death.

579
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,901
Unless he was murdered,

580
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,571
the magistrate would have no reason
to try to hide the body.

581
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,075
-Gu-pal.
-Yes?

582
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,285
-You and I need to go somewhere.
-Where?

583
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,245
And Yook-chil…

584
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,622
I mean, my lord.

585
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,250
For this lowly servant,

586
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,544
could you ask around
where the deceased inspector has been?

587
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,714
Especially to the fishermen
who work at the beach.

588
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,716
But the sun set long ago…

589
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,179
You can visit inns where
fishermen and peddlers spend the night.

590
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,348
Yes, I could do that.

591
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,308
You look like a real inspector, my lord.

592
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,852
-I am a real inspector.
-A real inspector that lies.

593
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,146
What happened to visiting
tasty restaurants?

594
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,817
It's just this one case.
Once we're done with this,

595
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,737
we'll go back to touring
tasty restaurants as planned.

596
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,072
You mean that?

597
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,616
Let's move.

598
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,414
Right.

599
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,509
Ma'am.

600
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,928
Four bowls of gukbap with one rice wine.

601
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:26,929
Sure, sit there.

602
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,390
Excuse me. Can I ask you a question?

603
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,766
That boat…

604
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:36,647
It looks as if someone
made a hole on purpose.

605
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,275
-They couldn't find the body.
-Where did you hear it?

606
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,690
She's sleeping like this again.

607
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,525
Not again.

608
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,531
I thought I hid it well.
How did she even find this?

609
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,116
She'll have indigestion again.

610
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,374
I told her to avoid salty foods.

611
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,417
Out of all the tasty snack options…

612
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,595
Mother, on the blanket.

613
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,805
On the blanket.

614
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,432
-On you go.
-So annoying.

615
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,309
That's too far.

616
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,852
Here's your pillow.

617
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,904
Goodness.

618
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,330
Fighting with me has aged you.

619
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,719
What do I do now?
He even took my petition…

620
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,477
Anyway, what is this?

621
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,899
I should've asked the chief earlier.

622
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,861
Wait.

623
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:59,373
This belongs to the government office.

624
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,263
You know Bo-ri, don't you?

625
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,683
You know Hwang Bo-ri, don't you?

626
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,940
You know Hwang Bo-ri, who was
sweet and good at cooking, don't you?

627
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,655
Wait, you're…

628
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,326
What are you doing at this hour?

629
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,912
While organizing Bo-ri's personal effects,

630
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,583
I discovered something
that belongs to this office.

631
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,100
Fine.

632
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,936
That ledger, I mean…

633
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,148
Where is this item you were talking about?

634
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,362
Somewhere only I know.

635
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,405
Bring it to me this instant!

636
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,782
I will.

637
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,076
It is of no use to me.

638
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,370
However…

639
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,206
However?

640
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,879
My divorce case hasn't been concluded yet.

641
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,549
-I told you to bring a witness.
-That witness…

642
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,051
was Bo-ri.

643
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,515
But Bo-ri died out of the blue,

644
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,392
and I have no way of knowing

645
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,562
why Bo-ri had something from this office
in her possession.

646
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:50,192
But I ended up finding out

647
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,361
who entrusted her with it.

648
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,865
What should I do?

649
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,414
How dare you make a deal with me?

650
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,082
What could you possibly want?

651
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,506
A divorce by mutual consent.

652
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,884
How dare you
try to interfere with my judgment!

653
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,595
That is up to me to decide!

654
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,099
Is that so?

655
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,518
Fine.

656
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,023
However…

657
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,867
I shall grant it.

658
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,458
I'll get it done

659
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,919
first thing in the morning.

660
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,088
Then…

661
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,134
wouldn't it be better
to write your judgment in advance?

662
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,510
Hand over the item first!

663
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,180
Once you stamp the official seal
on this tomorrow,

664
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,724
I'll tell you where the item is.

665
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,086
Thank you for your help, my lord.

666
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,050
Come to think of it,

667
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,971
I suppose you have no questions
about Bo-ri for me.

668
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,727
Even after I told you
that I was her closest friend.

669
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,944
If you even have
the slightest intention of repaying her

670
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,821
for genuinely loving you,

671
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,866
shouldn't you at least hold a funeral

672
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,869
for the baby who died in her womb?

673
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,268
Good job, Kim Jo-yi.

674
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,477
You've done well.

675
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:40,279
I'm sorry, Bo-ri,
for only being able to do this much.

676
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,284
But I really want to have a fresh start

677
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,202
even if this is what it takes.

678
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,815
This is a complete mess.

679
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,692
What do they expect me to do?

680
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,116
Stop right there.

681
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:28,952
Do not move an inch.

682
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:29,912
Who…

683
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:30,996
Who are you?

684
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,848
I'm a secret royal inspector.

685
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,186
I will handle this case from now on.

686
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,453
Are you all right?

687
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,498
I thought I was going
to be scared to death.

688
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,875
What are we doing here by ourselves?

689
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,627
It's not just us.

690
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,088
Even with Yook-chil, it's just three.

691
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,550
You can go to the yeokcham
and bring some more.

692
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,842
YEOKCHAM: A PUBLIC OFFICE THAT PROVIDED
TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATION

693
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:26,760
Yeokcham?

694
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,681
Have some taffy.

695
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,599
-Taffy for sale.
-I'll buy some later.

696
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,562
Get your taffy here.

697
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,454
She has no evidence and no witness.

698
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,541
So where does she get
all that confidence from?

699
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,959
-Exactly!
-Exactly!

700
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,461
It'll all be over today.

701
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,590
-Be patient.
-She must have so little respect

702
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,718
for her husband and mother-in-law!

703
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,970
It's too loud. Be quiet.

704
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:22,399
Dragging out a case like this
will only lead to disorder in society.

705
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,817
It'll only harm our town.

706
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,154
Thus, I'll make my judgment quickly.

707
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,155
This is it.

708
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,615
You're right, my lord.

709
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,910
All you need to do is
smack that hussy on the butt a few times

710
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,579
and send her back home, my lord.

711
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,007
Noh Chu-han and Kim Jo-yi, step forward.

712
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:47,966
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

713
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,639
This is my ruling.

714
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,439
TAVERN

715
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,992
-Secret royal inspector
-Secret royal inspector

716
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,048
Let's go to work.

717
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,260
It's quite a regretful situation.

718
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,431
A man and a woman should
respect each other as they grow older.

719
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,892
But as these two have become enemies,

720
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,396
the continuation of their union
is meaningless.

721
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,440
No, you can't, my lord.

722
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,526
Based on her petition
and testimonies from the locals--

723
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,945
-What testimony?
-Shut your mouth.

724
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,614
The officer here is the witness!

725
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:38,201
Everything you told was
about abusing your daughter-in-law.

726
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,296
Of course, it's true that Kim Jo-yi
did not obey her husband or mother-in-law

727
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,715
and misbehaved,
which is one of the seven sins,

728
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,925
-so she needs to pay for that.
-That's right!

729
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,385
Of course!

730
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:58,764
However…

731
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:03,977
certain facts have proven

732
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,732
that Kim Jo-yi is not the only one
to blame for this failed marriage.

733
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,069
Thus, in accordance
with The Great Ming Code,

734
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,908
I order for your marriage
to be terminated.

735
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,662
-What?
-What?

736
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,672
The two of you, part ways.

737
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,467
-Mother.
-My son.

738
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,261
-Yes, sir.
-I have an objection!

739
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,555
It doesn't make any sense.

740
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,933
I might be illiterate,

741
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,602
but I know that
the termination of a marriage

742
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,813
was made to give the husband

743
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,233
the right to kick out the wife
when she has done wrong.

744
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:55,320
That law was not created
to take the wife's side.

745
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,280
I know that much!

746
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,365
-She's right!
-Yes!

747
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,533
That's absurd.

748
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,494
I knew something was wrong.

749
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,290
You said I had no respect
for my husband and in-laws.

750
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,876
You said that I brought shame
upon the whole family.

751
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,795
So according to the law,

752
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:15,382
I'm a wife who deserves
to be kicked out by her husband.

753
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,508
Am I not?

754
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,178
So you should kick me out.

755
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,556
After all, I'm such an insolent brat.

756
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,309
I apologize for everything.

757
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,019
Please disown me.

758
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,189
No, wait. That's not it!

759
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,776
I mean, it's true you're insolent,

760
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:39,322
but you haven't done anything
truly terrible enough to be disowned…

761
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,866
Be clear with your words!

762
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,994
Everyone here saw how furious you were

763
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,912
at Kim Jo-yi's insolence.

764
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:53,128
What I am saying is, my daughter-in-law
didn't do anything terrible enough

765
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,005
to get kicked out…

766
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:58,258
If I didn't do anything so wrong,

767
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,801
why did you mistreat me?

768
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,554
I have been abused for no good reason.

769
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,764
Can I sue my husband and mother-in-law?

770
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,391
What are you talking about?

771
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,851
So what's it going to be?

772
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,770
Will you kick out
your immoral daughter-in-law?

773
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:15,025
Or will you be sued for accusing
an innocent daughter-in-law?

774
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,289
I pity you, Mother.

775
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,749
Even right now,

776
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,795
your son is hiding behind you
without taking responsibility,

777
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,507
waiting for you to clean up his mess.

778
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:47,432
The one who humiliated you
and dragged you into this isn't me.

779
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,269
It's your son, Noh Chu-han.

780
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,695
Mother.

781
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,031
Don't tell me

782
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,159
you're going to ask
your mother to do this for you too?

783
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,035
What the…

784
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,587
Wait, that's…

785
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,715
It's nothing serious.

786
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,187
-The secret royal inspector enters!
-The secret royal inspector enters!

787
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,354
-What?
-What?

788
00:55:59,105 --> 00:55:59,981
Oh, no.

789
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,991
All of you must come out
and show your respect!

790
00:57:44,335 --> 00:57:45,253
What?

791
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,059
I'm on official duty.

792
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,229
Search the place!

793
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,230
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

794
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,163
What's going on?

795
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,498
The secret royal inspector…

796
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,166
What are they looking for?

797
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,671
Why did they
have to come today of all days?

798
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,052
Is it just me,
or do these numbers not add up?

799
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,055
Anyone could tell
the numbers just don't add up.

800
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,182
There's still about three carts' worth

801
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,683
in the storehouse.

802
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,563
Criminals never stick to just one crime.

803
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,785
Listen well, Magistrate Jang Gi-wan.

804
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:01,496
I apologize, but there's something
I must say as well.

805
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,083
I've committed crimes,
and I deserve to die.

806
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:08,419
I've committed acts of corruption
and abused my power.

807
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,425
Why are you confessing to crimes
I didn't question you about?

808
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,596
The crimes are bound to be revealed.

809
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,932
Please punish me right away.

810
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,768
No. Please, just transfer me to Hanyang.

811
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:31,901
Your punishment will be decided
after I review the manipulated records

812
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,570
and report it to His Majesty.

813
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:36,072
It is not something
that can be decided here.

814
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:39,284
Besides, the crime
I want to question you about

815
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,619
is not corruption or abuse of power.

816
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,621
It's murder.

817
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,299
The previous inspector, Park Moo-kyung,

818
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:57,302
was investigating the grain tax
and military provisions from this region.

819
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,805
And after he sent in his secret report,
he suddenly went missing.

820
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,767
However, Magistrate Jang Gi-wan,

821
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,645
you ordered
the disposal of the inspector's body.

822
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,105
Why?

823
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,482
To hide the cause of death.

824
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,401
That's not true.

825
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:18,239
I just had the body transported
to our office to identify him.

826
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,366
Bring him in.

827
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,210
This horse plaque…

828
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,339
was found on his sleeve.

829
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,384
Were you aware he was
a former secret royal inspector?

830
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,512
My lord!

831
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,850
The dead inspector…
They found his body on the beach!

832
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,809
What?

833
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,312
Yes, he was aware.

834
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,564
That is a lie!

835
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,650
I really was not aware!

836
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,985
Bring him in.

837
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,659
Did you hear what he said
in front of the body?

838
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,619
Yes, sir.

839
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,373
He was…

840
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:12,293
definitely taken care of
with the sunken freighter.

841
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:14,587
"Taken care of"?

842
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,882
What did you mean?

843
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,884
Did you sink the freighter

844
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,928
and kill the secret royal inspector?

845
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:22,970
No, sir.

846
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,390
I never murdered anyone!

847
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:27,350
Then you did sink the freighter.

848
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,270
That is not what I meant…

849
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,077
Do you recognize what this is?

850
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,206
No, I do not.

851
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,545
This is made of black pine,
a precious wood.

852
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:56,587
Under the law,

853
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,298
it's only used to make freighters.

854
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,219
And it was found on the beach
where the body was.

855
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,684
It's quite rare
for a freighter to run aground.

856
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:15,732
It looks as if someone
made a hole on purpose.

857
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:17,191
Look at this.

858
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:22,613
You feared that
your corruption would be exposed,

859
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:26,451
so you murdered Park Moo-kyung
who were inspecting the regional office.

860
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,957
And to cover up the murder,

861
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,209
you sunk the freighter.

862
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,130
Despite all that, his body was found.

863
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,966
So you attempted to get rid of it!

864
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,635
I swear I didn't kill him!

865
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,139
Even if you didn't do it yourself,
you must have aided or overlooked it.

866
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,642
It's the same as murder.

867
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:58,858
This is my command.

868
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,778
Lock up the storehouse
and confiscate the seal immediately!

869
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,988
-Yes, sir.
-Confiscate the seal?

870
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,490
This hasn't been sealed yet.

871
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:06,908
How dare you!

872
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,118
Who dares raise their head?

873
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,121
But they can't confiscate it…

874
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:14,999
Imprison magistrate Jang Gi-wan

875
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,128
and don't let anyone enter these grounds
until the investigation is over!

876
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,088
No, you can't!

877
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,806
You're the divorcee who slapped my mouth.

878
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:30,807
You're Bang-deuk!

879
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,064
Royal Inspector, sir…

880
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,400
What I meant was…

881
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,362
I must have been out of my mind.

882
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:46,489
I really thought
you were a beggar back then.

883
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:50,284
But to be fair,
you really looked poor and lowly.

884
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,164
Anyhow, I know
that I committed a grave crime, but--

885
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,541
-Royal Inspector!
-Mother!

886
01:03:57,124 --> 01:04:00,586
Please imprison this brat as well.

887
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,090
This is null and void.

888
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,972
It doesn't even have the government seal…

889
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,185
Here. You eat that.

890
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:23,067
You came at an opportune time, my lord!

891
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:26,654
I wish you a long, healthy life.

892
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:29,824
We shall return home now.

893
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,660
You damn brat.

894
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,620
Your impudence knows no end.

895
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,082
Let her go.

896
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,627
You dare use violence
in a government office?

897
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,969
I hope I am not too late.

898
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,778
The magistrate of Gaehwa is
under arrest for serious crimes,

899
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:12,700
but he has already made his ruling
on the case of Kim Jo-yi's divorce.

900
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,828
With my authority
as the royal inspector in this province,

901
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,831
as of today, May 5th…

902
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,012
your divorce…

903
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,015
is approved.

904
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,920
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

905
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,350
SPECIAL THANKS TO SONG JONG-HO

906
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,316
I'm going to stop
living a life with regret.

907
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,403
Before people hear about
a secret royal inspector digging around,

908
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,697
I shall get to the bottom of this case.

909
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:34,532
You should've at least
stopped the dispatch of another inspector.

910
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,491
Just kill them all.

911
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,034
In order to protect something precious,

912
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,078
you must be prepared
to do whatever it takes.

913
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,122
It could be used as a base for poison.

914
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,165
Coming here was divine intervention.

915
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,209
Why would we ever meet again?

916
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,211
I told you to do it with no loose ends!

917
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:50,256
I regained my life thanks to you.

918
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,799
You regained it yourself

919
01:06:51,882 --> 01:06:52,717
with your courage.

920
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,054
