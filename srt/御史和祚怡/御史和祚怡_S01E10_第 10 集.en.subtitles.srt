1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,316
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,504
Grandmother…

4
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,131
Shut that mouth of yours!

5
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,801
How could you fool me

6
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,679
when you were
clearly alive this whole time?

7
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,559
There are things
one must never do in this world, punk!

8
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,063
Playing with people's lives

9
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,939
and messing with food!

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,075
Now, eat that!

11
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,955
I can't stand the sight of the food,
so you eat all of it, you punk!

12
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,465
If I even find a grain
of rice left behind,

13
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,259
I'll be going in there!

14
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,513
Wait. Grandmother.

15
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,807
Did you have to blow up the mine?

16
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,978
Don't even start.
Just imagine how bad it must have been.

17
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:30,483
All of a sudden, that damn dog
named Do-soo or whatever showed up.

18
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,612
On top of that, that damn inspector
showed up with royal guards.

19
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,030
We had no other choice.

20
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,616
So did you take care of the inspector?

21
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,953
We made him a grave underneath the mine
before we came here.

22
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,707
Tae-seo had to even blow up
his mine to kill him.

23
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,085
He went through all that trouble
to dig up that silver…

24
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,632
He won't snap out of it.

25
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,344
He was furious
and went to confront his old man.

26
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,388
But he won't say what happened.

27
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,726
Anyway,

28
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,479
we even risked our lives
and took care of that inspector.

29
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:13,318
If your old man has a conscience,
he'll take care of us, right?

30
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,779
Even if you're illegitimate,
he's still your father.

31
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,906
Have you lost it?

32
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,159
This is not the time to be picky.

33
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,203
They must have ransacked
the base and the mine by now.

34
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,372
It's just a matter of time
before they catch us.

35
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,707
That's why I'm here.

36
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,252
Let's get ready and leave.
We need to get on a ship to Gapbigocha.

37
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,130
Do you think Gapbigocha
is going to be any safer?

38
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,800
If the mountain base was ransacked,
then it's as if Gapbigocha was, too.

39
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,678
You think the royal forces
won't ransack Gokdu?

40
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,682
So clueless. Seriously.

41
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,644
So what are you going to do?

42
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,564
What are you going to do?

43
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,816
Didn't you say you'd overturn Joseon

44
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,110
and dethrone the King?

45
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,155
Now, how are you going to dethrone him?

46
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,116
The mine is gone
along with the connections.

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,660
Everything is gone!

48
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,204
-Shut it.
-How will you overturn it now?

49
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,497
You crazy bastard.

50
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,166
-Do you have a death wish?
-Let go of me. Fine.

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,835
Just kill me. Kill me.

52
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,964
Kill me. Dying would be better
at this point. Just do it.

53
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,173
We should kill him.

54
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,134
Kill Park Seung?

55
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,055
-The King?
-The King?

56
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,307
Both of them.

57
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,189
You are?

58
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,150
You're going to kill your father?

59
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,485
As if you would.

60
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,697
You're at the beck and call
of your father.

61
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,656
Fine.

62
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,450
Let's say we manage to kill Park Seung.

63
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,537
How are you going to kill the King?
You don't have any weapons.

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,497
Will you attack the palace barehanded?

65
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,293
Let's say
we'll just strangle the King's neck.

66
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,212
We still need to meet the King
in person to do anything.

67
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,883
How are bastards like us going to
even get a chance to see the King's face?

68
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,344
We can.

69
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,099
Up close, at that.

70
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,786
-What do we do now?
-I don't know!

71
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,665
There we go.

72
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,375
This is the Joseon I remember.

73
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,002
What do we do now?

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,469
Once these tears dry,

75
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,847
this beautiful jade marble
you call a face will get very dry.

76
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,308
Here.

77
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,854
I can tell by your demeanor that
some house broker and official colluded

78
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,982
in unjustly raising the rent,
and you lost your deposit.

79
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,068
About 170 yang's worth?

80
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,576
You barely moved
from the countryside to Hanyang

81
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,037
in hopes of turning your life around

82
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,164
only to be robbed by some frauds.

83
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,834
They must have stolen your heart, too.

84
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,002
That's right!

85
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,799
Those rotten bastards.

86
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,593
I see they're still
only going after innocent women!

87
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,596
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

88
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:30,973
Me?

89
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,059
Let me introduce myself.

90
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:37,313
I'm here to save good people like
yourselves in this harsh, cruel Hanyang.

91
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,481
I am

92
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,317
Seung-yul, a lawyer.

93
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,242
You two said
that you were conned by a man?

94
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,243
-Yes.
-Yes.

95
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,332
And you said you were conned by a woman?

96
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,416
Yes.

97
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,481
Those two

98
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,151
are the same the person.

99
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,820
-What?
-What?

100
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,530
He is a master of disguise.

101
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,990
Sometimes, he's a man…

102
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,909
and sometimes he's a woman.

103
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,536
Yes, that's her!

104
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,707
He changes his face and identity to
only con sweet women like yourselves.

105
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,710
He's a notorious conman
with a lot of priors.

106
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,086
This damn bastard.

107
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,505
I can't believe I fell for it!

108
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,677
Of course. I knew you'd rip them up.

109
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,223
If that will at least
help you feel better…

110
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,102
Now. Please calm down.

111
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,981
Here.

112
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,817
There you go.

113
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,236
Take this.

114
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,823
You know
my name Seung-yul means win, right?

115
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,908
-Yes.
-Yes.

116
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,327
Once I file a lawsuit,
I win, no matter what.

117
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,662
Most people who have
been ripped off in Hanyang

118
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,581
eventually make their way to me.

119
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,458
And when I win, people here say

120
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,544
Seung-yul just pulled a Seung-yul.

121
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,674
I believe this time will be no different.

122
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,551
-Please help me.
-Help me too.

123
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,762
You need not worry about anything else.

124
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,599
Tonight, you just need to relax
and have a cup of tea before bed.

125
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,810
What is this?

126
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,188
It's dried dandelion
and atractylodes root.

127
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,443
If you brew hot tea with it,
it will help you soothe your anger.

128
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,154
Your fever will be relieved
and the toxins released.

129
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,366
So you should be able
to get a good night's sleep.

130
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,743
-Thank you.
-What a precious gift!

131
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,662
It's nothing at all.

132
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,415
I give it to all of my clients
as a token of my appreciation.

133
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,044
Then, I wish you all a good night.

134
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,546
-Okay.
-Okay.

135
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,383
No need to get up.

136
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,176
-You're leaving already?
-Stay longer.

137
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,803
Yes, stay a little longer.

138
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,190
-Take care.
-Goodness.

139
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,906
Look at that. It's so shiny.

140
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,116
How pretty!

141
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,663
Yukuijeon sure is different.
It's nothing like the countryside markets.

142
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,666
I mean, the items
are certainly more luxurious.

143
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:47,295
There are a lot of high-ranking officials
around and they supply the palace.

144
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,796
That's why.

145
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,132
Look around.

146
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,759
-Welcome.
-Look at this color.

147
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,303
-It's so pretty.
-Hello.

148
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,263
How much does a roll of this cost?

149
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,472
Five yang.

150
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,684
Five yang?

151
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,022
That's dozens of bowls
of rice and soup in Gaehwa Valley.

152
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,024
Things sure are more expensive in Hanyang.

153
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,404
Then, how much do
garments made out of this go for?

154
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,115
It varies wildly depending
on the needlewoman's skills,

155
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,701
but if it's for a minister's household.

156
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,704
-it can go up to 15 yang.
-15 yang?

157
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,792
Okay. Thank you.

158
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,670
But the selection of silks
is a bit limited, don't you think?

159
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,800
The prices here
tend to be on the high side.

160
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,678
We'll not buy anything here
and go to Chilpae Market.

161
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,763
Near Sungnye Gate,

162
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,349
there are some unauthorized stalls
run by civilians

163
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,391
and they're cheaper.

164
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,519
One roll is
more than enough for two garment sets.

165
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,647
I'll be able to earn a lot
by making clothes.

166
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,442
Plus, he said the prices vary
depending on the needlewoman's skills.

167
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,278
Then where is the busiest part of Hanyang?

168
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,030
I'm going to tell fortunes there.

169
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,658
There's a place called Unjongga
if you go up this way.

170
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,536
That place is always so crowded.
That's where you want to be.

171
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,580
Right behind it, there's Pimat-gil,

172
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,000
an alley commoners use
to avoid high-ranking officials' horses.

173
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,087
There are so many stalls there
with so many tasty things.

174
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,340
Right. That's where you should go.

175
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,133
That's perfect.

176
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,553
By the way,
how do you know Hanyang so well?

177
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,104
My hometown is in Gyeongsang Province,
but I lived in Hanyang before I came here.

178
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,815
If you're from Gyeongsang,
how did you end up here after Hanyang?

179
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,158
What does it matter?
We made it to Hanyang.

180
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,243
That's what matters.

181
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,869
Well, you're right.

182
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,123
We should all go to Unjongga.
We can eat something tasty and--

183
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,126
But we should find a place to live first.

184
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,045
-Ojang-dong, right?
-Yes, Ojang-dong.

185
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,797
Then, let's go there.

186
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,173
It's this way.

187
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,716
What? Oh, this way?

188
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,510
We should find a broker first, right?

189
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,428
Yes, we should.

190
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,180
But we must be very careful.
We're in Hanyang.

191
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,266
-Be careful…
-Not to get ripped off!

192
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,643
Look at that!

193
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:08,811
What?

194
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,159
I'm sure she's worth
a lot more than silver.

195
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,119
Especially for you.

196
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,832
What I need is silver
to ransom POWs from Qing.

197
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,333
I don't need anything else.

198
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,593
Mom…

199
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,684
How could you sew in that state?

200
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,064
After sending her off like that,
you're still able to sew?

201
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,567
I guess Ba-hoe ran his mouth again.

202
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,155
What are you doing here?
We should prepare breakfast for the kids.

203
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,698
Let's go.

204
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,536
Don't push yourself.
You should take the day off today.

205
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,205
I'll take care of the kids.

206
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,916
I won't crumble over something like this.

207
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,921
The inkstone seller sent word
from Hanyang.

208
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,006
The ship arrived in Sanggae Port there.

209
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,385
They arrived safely
and they're currently staying at a tavern.

210
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,016
She'll send word
once they settle down, so don't--

211
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:29,975
Forget it.

212
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,398
Me being in her life as her mother
is only going to put her in danger.

213
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,652
She'll live her life if she's alive.

214
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,571
There's no need for the updates.

215
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,620
I can't even imagine
how heartbroken she must be…

216
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,624
Why don't you just go and pay her a visit?

217
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,459
This is just not right!

218
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,258
The morning paper
of July 8, Year of the Red Pig.

219
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,176
After inspecting Chungcheong Province,

220
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,095
a Hongmungwan busuchan reported…

221
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,223
Park Tae-seo, Cha Mal-jong,
Ji Maeng-su, and Kang Han-gi

222
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,185
set up a base near Soyang Village
to illegally mine silver

223
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,187
and even trade weapons.

224
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,274
Park Tae-seo, the ringleader,
is an illegitimate son of Park Seung.

225
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,485
And Park Do-soo, who murdered
Hong Seok-gi, is his legitimate son.

226
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,946
My lord, the morning papers are here.

227
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,782
That King doesn't do anything.

228
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:32,204
Why do they even write and send out
morning papers every single day?

229
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,127
And I include in my report
findings that point to Park Seung

230
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,170
as the mastermind behind them.

231
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,673
I beseech you to track down
all those involved

232
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,509
and allow us to expose the truth.

233
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,180
And the King replied,
"You have my permission."

234
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,558
Park Seung and his son Park Do-soo

235
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,477
along with Park Tae-seo and his men
are to be arrested.

236
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,274
This King has gone insane…

237
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,860
My lord!

238
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,214
Who dares to arrest me?

239
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,301
I'm the Chief State Councilor!
How dare anybody!

240
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:47,696
Your Majesty. Please, dismiss
Chief State Councilor Park Seung.

241
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,616
-Please, dismiss him.
-Please, dismiss him.

242
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:59,541
Your Majesty. Please, dismiss
Chief State Councilor Park Seung.

243
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,670
-Please, dismiss him.
-Please, dismiss him.

244
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:08,258
Your Majesty. Please, dismiss
Chief State Councilor Park Seung.

245
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,720
-Please, dismiss him.
-Please, dismiss him.

246
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,723
Those young kids,
how do they wake up so early?

247
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,812
Your Majesty. Please, dismiss
Chief State Councilor Park Seung.

248
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,439
Has the Chief State Councilor
come to the court?

249
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:28,404
Your Majesty. Please, dismiss
Chief State Councilor Park Seung.

250
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,281
-Please, dismiss him.
-Please, dismiss him.

251
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,533
All of you!

252
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,411
What is this outrageous atrocity
this early in the morning?

253
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,289
Your Majesty. Please, accept our plea.

254
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,084
-Please, accept our plea!
-Please, accept our plea!

255
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,211
On what grounds?

256
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,548
On what grounds are you punks
going to push me out?

257
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,216
Dismissing people

258
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,261
and then piecing together
the grounds to fit

259
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,888
was always your logic, was it not?

260
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:01,103
You attempted to kill a Hongmungwan
official carrying out the King's order.

261
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,606
You brought distress upon the King
and obstructed his inspections!

262
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,986
A minister, who should be
a shining example of morality,

263
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,780
colluded with malicious racketeers
of the outer provinces

264
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,116
to embezzle tributes and taxes!

265
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,284
What?

266
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,953
Embezzled tributes and taxes?

267
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,915
How dare you accuse me like that!

268
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,002
Are you trying to frame an innocent man?

269
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,795
Colluded with the regional officials?

270
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,173
-Who did? I did?
-That is correct.

271
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,938
The investigation report
I will soon submit to His Majesty

272
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,483
includes many names of those
who exploited the system.

273
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,528
Park Do-soo, Park Tae-seo,

274
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,490
Cha Mal-jong,
Ji Maeng-su, and Hong Seok-gi.

275
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,743
They bought off provincial and
grain tribute officials in Chungcheong

276
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,995
and endlessly exploited
the provincial subjects.

277
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,249
Every district they passed through
was left barren

278
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,169
as if bandits had plundered them.

279
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,589
All the subjects there
desperately wish for their deaths.

280
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,719
Furthermore, Park Tae-seo, along with
Cha Mal-jong, Ji Maeng-su, Kang Han-gi,

281
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,097
set up two trading groups
in Chungcheong and Gapbigocha

282
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,934
and have traded silver
illegally mined and gunpowder.

283
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,436
Here comes His Majesty the King!

284
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,537
The busuchan may rise and continue.

285
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,459
Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,550
Park Do-soo, one of those accountable
and Park Tae-seo's half brother,

287
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,261
murdered Hong Seok-gi,
the Chief of Maritime Transport.

288
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,221
Their crimes are heinous.

289
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,808
These two should be arrested
and interrogated immediately.

290
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,936
Furthermore,
since Park Do-soo and Park Tae-seo

291
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,940
are both Chief State Councilor
Park Seung's sons,

292
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:14,069
so he should be considered
a key man behind the scenes

293
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,115
and arrested to
be thoroughly investigated, Your Majesty.

294
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:22,494
It's not true, Your Majesty.
There must have been an error.

295
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,583
How dare you suggest such a thing
without a shred of evidence?

296
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,795
Do you have any evidence
that my son committed murder?

297
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:37,801
And Chief Scholar, how are you
going to prove I am behind all this?

298
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,263
On what grounds
are you claiming something so absurd?

299
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,144
Your Majesty, I…

300
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,525
I shall step down.

301
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,779
But not because my son Do-soo is guilty.

302
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,284
I will step down to take responsibility
for this as the chief state councilor.

303
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,165
I only ask that you be
magnanimous, Your Majesty.

304
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,959
Stepping down from his position
won't be enough.

305
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,255
Please, have the Uigeumbu investigate
to see if he's guilty, Your Majesty!

306
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,636
Your Majesty, please, grant me permission
to get to the bottom of this case.

307
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,014
Your Majesty, we must investigate.

308
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,807
Please, grant permission.

309
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,517
Please, grant permission!

310
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,561
-Please, grant permission.
-Please, grant permission.

311
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,191
Your Majesty.

312
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,027
Everyone involved…

313
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,367
shall be investigated.

314
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,829
Your Majesty…

315
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,833
Thank you, Your Majesty!

316
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,836
-Thank you, Your Majesty!
-Thank you, Your Majesty!

317
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,714
Your Majesty!

318
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,677
Your Majesty!

319
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,654
This house costs 60 sacks of rice?

320
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,030
Isn't that too expensive?

321
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,574
Well, I did hear
there were no cheap houses anymore

322
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,868
since house prices
in Hanyang have skyrocketed.

323
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,247
But this does seem a bit too expensive…

324
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,926
There are mice.

325
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,429
So this is the real Hanyang.

326
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,973
Does the floor heat up well?

327
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,850
Of course.

328
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,269
Not just near the furnace,
but the entire house.

329
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,356
You will never feel cold
even in the dead of winter.

330
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,860
But isn't the framework
a bit too worn out?

331
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,696
It is not.
It'll be fine even if a typhoon comes.

332
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,741
It blocks the heat in the summer
and the cold in the winter.

333
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,909
And you won't find a single bug.

334
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,125
What the? Damn it.

335
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,886
We'd love to see some other houses, too.
If you could show us some more…

336
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,722
Do you know how many people
are lined up to lease this house?

337
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,141
This listing will
probably be gone tomorrow.

338
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:35,479
But the outhouse is too close by.
I bet it unbearably stinks in the summer.

339
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,730
You're clueless.

340
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,775
Imagine how scary it will be
for women to go to the outhouse

341
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,153
in the middle of the night
if it's far away.

342
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,656
You two will live alone, right?

343
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,951
I have a younger sister, too.

344
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,662
The three of us will be living together.

345
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,791
She's not here
because she's exploring Unjongga today.

346
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,251
-Three ladies.
-But!

347
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,837
But!

348
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,423
But we…

349
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,802
all have husbands.

350
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,180
Once we move in, our husbands will come.

351
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,308
I also have two younger brothers
living in Hanyang.

352
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,351
I see.

353
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,645
Anyhow, are you going
to take this place then?

354
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,857
Rent for a place like this
normally goes for 60 sacks of rice,

355
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,111
but it doesn't seem
you two are very well off,

356
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:28,990
so I'll make you a special deal
and make it 55 sacks.

357
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,870
I also asked other brokers,

358
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,373
and I'm sure the average was
around 40 sacks.

359
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,125
Let's make it 35 sacks.

360
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,293
What are you talking about?
Don't be absurd.

361
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,295
This isn't Bukchon or Hoehyeon-dong.

362
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,464
How could the rent be 60 sacks?

363
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,008
Or should I speak
to the owner of the house myself?

364
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,889
Well, a post station
will be built around here soon!

365
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,643
This area will become very desirable!
You still think it's too expensive?

366
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,232
Forget it. It's all about location!

367
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,943
Take ten steps outside,
and you'll find a market, a tavern,

368
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,820
a well, and even a laundry spot.

369
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,698
How could you expect
this house to be any cheaper?

370
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,534
Some are even taking out loans
to buy it as an investment.

371
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,244
How could you still be so clueless?

372
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,746
Forget it!

373
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,082
Go find another broker!

374
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,667
I just wasted my time!

375
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,505
This is the man.

376
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,343
What? What are you doing?

377
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,429
Let go of me. What are you doing?

378
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,183
I guess you didn't see this coming
while going around conning people.

379
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,935
-Who are you?
-Me?

380
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,562
I am here

381
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,941
to kick you in the shins
on behalf of the victims you've duped.

382
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,278
Do you have a problem with that?

383
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,031
The paperwork is here,
so take him to the agency.

384
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,783
-Take him away.
-Hold on.

385
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,619
You have got the wrong person.

386
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,789
Let's go down to the agency
and have a candid conversation.

387
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,917
-Let's go.
-It's not me. It's not.

388
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,878
Okay. Hold on. I'll go. I will.

389
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,131
Seung-yul?

390
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,091
Aren't you Seung-yul?

391
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,220
Seung-yul, is that you?

392
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,387
Jo-yi?

393
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,556
Jo-yi!

394
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,769
What in the world is going on?

395
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,437
Have you been well?

396
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,730
Of course, I have.

397
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,983
I missed you so much, Kim Jo-yi.

398
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,739
Hey, you're hugging me too tight.

399
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,241
Sorry. Are you okay?

400
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,660
I think you grew even taller.

401
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,205
You're still so tiny…

402
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,252
Let go! Get your hands
off me, you bastards!

403
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,587
I am the Chief State Councilor
of this country!

404
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,130
How could you lock up

405
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,175
a prime minister of a nation
without any evidence?

406
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,343
Let go of me!

407
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,721
You bastards!

408
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,599
Arrest them immediately.

409
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,435
There are four criminals in total.

410
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,604
Park Tae-seo, Cha Mal-jong,

411
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,481
Ji Maeng-su, and Kang Han-gi.

412
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,612
PARK TAE-SEO

413
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,155
CHA MAL-JONG

414
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,740
JI MAENG-SU

415
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:18,034
KANG HAN-GI

416
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,790
Hey, Yi-eon.

417
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,129
How long has it been?

418
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,549
Do you know how happy I was
to hear that you came back alive?

419
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,385
We've all been impatiently
looking forward to your return.

420
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,223
I didn't know you cared
so much about me. Thank you.

421
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,433
Speaking of which,

422
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,770
could you make us
some steamed chicken for lunch tomorrow?

423
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,898
I can't stop thinking
about your chicken soup we had last year.

424
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,150
Me, too.

425
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,068
I feel like I'm pregnant.

426
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:56,156
So tell me, can you do it for three sacks
of rice and five satchels of beans?

427
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,953
I told you I'd only accept

428
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,749
buckwheat flour from Jeju, ginger
from Wanju, or the meat of a pheasant.

429
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,208
We tried to get those for you.

430
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,420
But you arrested all the middlemen,
so it's impossible

431
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,922
to get our hands
on royal offerings like them.

432
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,424
And our stipend's been reduced.

433
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,593
-I can't even face my wife.
-So…

434
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,558
You can have it for free.

435
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,103
In return,

436
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:33,360
thoroughly enjoy it
and work harder for the country.

437
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,654
No funny business.

438
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,078
Look at that rude bastard.

439
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,162
Funny business?

440
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,580
Funny business!

441
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:46,748
He isn't wrong.

442
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,210
What do you do other than sit there
and think about food all day?

443
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,711
What did you say, punk?

444
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,796
Then what about you?

445
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,714
You only think about Myung-wol all day!

446
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:57,217
What is this?
Did you buy it for her again?

447
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,636
You punk! For Myung-wol?
That's absolute nonsense!

448
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,054
Then is it for Yi-eon?

449
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,223
Yes! I bought it for Yi-eon!

450
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,974
I was going to pay for lunch with it!

451
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,267
Why you little pipsqueak!

452
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,185
Pipsqueak?

453
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,728
Then go give it to him!

454
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,813
By the way…

455
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,064
Hey, stop that already.

456
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,234
Don't you think
that punk has changed a bit?

457
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,572
Here. Give me that.

458
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,783
-Yi-eon!
-Hey, why…

459
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,452
Yi-eon!

460
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,579
Yi-eon, hold on a second.

461
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,706
Wait, Yi-eon.

462
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,166
Here. Take this.

463
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,128
This is from all of us.

464
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,673
I hope you can continue
making our lunches for us.

465
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,260
He bought it for you. Right?

466
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,095
You did, right?

467
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,012
I did?

468
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,266
Yes, I bought that to give you.

469
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,103
This?

470
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:54,023
Every woman of Hanyang
is on a waitlist for this.

471
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,317
It's a samjak norigae made in Arabia.

472
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,446
Right? That's it. Right?

473
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,447
Yes, it is.

474
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:02,782
It's fine.

475
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,119
What would a man like me do
with a samjak norigae?

476
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,080
It has a pumpkin and a coral…

477
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:13,668
Look, this butterfly is
even decorated with gold.

478
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,504
A golden butterfly fluttering.

479
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,427
There must be a lady you fancy. Right?

480
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,849
Look at the golden butterfly fluttering.

481
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,649
I was prepared for the worst
when I came to Hanyang,

482
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,527
but I can't believe I almost got conned
by a swindling broker.

483
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,197
What a dog-eat-dog situation…

484
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,701
I thought we've been through
enough hardships and troubles, but no.

485
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,164
Anyhow, thank you
for helping a stranger like me.

486
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,082
-I appreciate it.
-Don't mention it.

487
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,084
A man should help a woman in need of help.

488
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,379
By the way, how do you know Jo-yi?

489
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,049
-We're childhood friends!
-We're childhood friends!

490
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,766
We're the same age and hometown friends.

491
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,530
And then Jo-yi betrayed me
by marrying a man in Gaehwa Valley.

492
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,614
Listen to this guy.

493
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,784
That damn betrayal business again.
How is getting married a betrayal?

494
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,701
Of course, it is.

495
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,246
How? How is it a betrayal?

496
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,374
That temper of yours…
How is it not a betrayal?

497
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,085
Tell me how that's a betrayal!

498
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,849
Take it when your husband enrages you.

499
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,017
According to my mother,

500
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,229
calming herbal medication is
the only thing a bride will need.

501
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,317
Are you worrying about me
or wishing me bad luck?

502
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,320
Of course, it's the latter.
Why would I worry about you?

503
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,450
Why you… Seriously?

504
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,958
Are you really marrying him?

505
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,336
If you ask me once more,
that will make it 100 times.

506
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,592
I don't like that guy.

507
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,011
He's the only one
that benefits from this marriage.

508
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,307
I haven't even seen his face yet.
What's with you?

509
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,101
My father arranged this.
You know that I have no choice.

510
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,856
If my mother was around,

511
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,983
something like this
would've never happened.

512
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,284
Exactly.

513
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,703
So can you just not do it? Please?

514
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,331
Let's just continue hanging out like this.

515
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,917
And who will make money?

516
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,543
Let's earn it together in Hanyang.

517
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,879
I'll become a great lawyer soon,

518
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,715
so you can do that sewing
you love so much.

519
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,717
I'm sure we can make a living.

520
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:16,392
I'm sure two old bachelor and maid
will live happily with their children.

521
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,729
How can a bachelor
and a maid have any children?

522
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,988
If you really want it, I can consider it--

523
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,367
-Get out.
-How are you so strong?

524
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,744
Leave!

525
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,412
-Okay, stop.
-Get out.

526
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,872
-Don't hit me.
-Get out.

527
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,957
I'm really leaving.

528
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,208
Get out.

529
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,292
Don't hit me.

530
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,419
So? Do you make enough
to feed two people now?

531
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,797
Absolutely. I make enough to feed 15.

532
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,925
How dare you
underestimate the young master!

533
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,677
Young master, my foot.

534
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,435
Will this be good enough?

535
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,855
There are only two rooms,
but it's been built recently.

536
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,650
There's a rice and soup place
around the corner.

537
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,527
The vegetable and fabric stores, too.

538
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,278
It's the best listing in the area.

539
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,407
But what is this place?

540
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,409
Your new house, of course.

541
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,286
Rent options are available,

542
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,331
but I recommend you to buy it.
The price is reasonable.

543
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,459
But how did you know about this place?

544
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,922
I move house often.
This is the place I found for myself.

545
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,632
Why do you move house often?

546
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,760
House prices in Hanyang
are always on the rise.

547
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,387
I'm taking advantage of it.

548
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,557
This year's rent prices equal
last year's house prices.

549
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,310
Last year's rent prices equal
this year's house prices?

550
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,562
The other way around.

551
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,274
Wait, why are the prices going up so much?

552
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,067
Children of high-ranking officials

553
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,279
bought up all the houses in Hanyang
and are controlling the prices.

554
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,906
It's basically real estate speculation.

555
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,408
Really?

556
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,743
Is that even possible?

557
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,745
Yes. We're in Hanyang.

558
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,749
I'll talk to the landlord
and get a good deal for you.

559
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,168
I can get it down
to about 30 sacks of rice.

560
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,461
Will that be okay?

561
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,005
Will it be okay with you?

562
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,718
I mean, it's more than okay.

563
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,636
I just don't know if I should accept.

564
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,598
I'm sure Jo-yi will find a way
to pay me back somehow.

565
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,478
Maybe I'll decide
not to pay you back at all.

566
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,771
This is very nice.

567
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,314
I like it a lot.

568
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,400
Pick up some Korean melons
the next time you come by.

569
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:33,112
No good deed goes unpunished.
Look at that ungrateful brat.

570
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:38,326
Jo-yi, you should go
buy your friend a drink at least.

571
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,328
I'll clean this place up in the meantime.

572
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,540
No, there's no need
for such formalities with him.

573
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,000
No, that's not right.

574
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,710
We should show our thanks somehow.

575
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:48,836
Right.

576
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,723
Go and have a drink.

577
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,642
It's fine. You have so much to clean up.

578
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,560
No, don't worry about that.

579
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:07,438
-Go get something tasty.
-No, it's fine. I'm really fine.

580
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,565
I can clean up by myself.

581
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,525
Well,

582
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,235
if you insist.

583
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,237
Sure. Thank you very much.

584
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,822
Let's go.

585
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,243
Follow me.

586
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,286
-Wait. Gwang-soon…
-Go on. Go.

587
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,274
-You got a divorce?
-Yes.

588
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,609
Why you…

589
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:58,447
Then you should've come and found me
first. How could you forget about me?

590
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,284
I knew it. You and I should've…

591
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:02,952
You know.

592
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,787
You know.

593
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,956
What are you talking about?

594
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,292
What I mean is…

595
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,297
I'm such a competent lawyer,
why didn't you look for me?

596
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,719
I had too much on my plate
to even think about you.

597
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,761
And fortunately,

598
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,390
I met someone great,
and it all worked out.

599
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,894
Well, I've been through a lot, though.

600
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:30,897
Someone great?

601
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,399
Yes. Someone really great.

602
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:41,073
Well, you got divorced, so it's all good.

603
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,492
Anyhow, well done, Kim Jo-yi.

604
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,912
And I'm happy for you. Here.

605
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,832
Drink up.

606
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,680
Anyway, I can't believe
you're a successful lawyer now.

607
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,098
You're so cool.

608
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,022
How could you be this cute?

609
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,302
How dare you with your dirty hands…
Do you have a death wish?

610
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,824
Do you…

611
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:06,826
know him by any chance?

612
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,411
What?

613
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,875
Lord Yi-eon?

614
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:22,008
What are you doing here at this hour?

615
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,259
By any chance,

616
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,262
are you here to see me?

617
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,930
No.

618
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,102
Bi-ryeong. I came to see Bi-ryeong.

619
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,688
Bi-ryeong?

620
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,981
Yes, that's right.

621
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,027
I need to talk to her
regarding the investigation.

622
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:45,948
It's the truth.

623
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,701
I see.

624
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,538
She went to check out Unjongga.
I'll run over and fetch her.

625
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,398
There's no need.

626
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,275
Stay here.

627
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,070
Shall I?

628
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,906
When you see her later,

629
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,408
tell her I'm looking for her.

630
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,746
Don't worry. I'll make sure to tell her.

631
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,541
Okay. Have you eaten?

632
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,469
This is my childhood friend.

633
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,764
My name is Choi Seung-yul.

634
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,436
Let's do this later.

635
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,689
As you can see, I'm on my way
to arrest some criminals.

636
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,778
Hello, sir.

637
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,364
Why did you interrupt us
and introduce yourself?

638
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,450
But you were practically lying--
Hey, I'm talking to you!

639
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,119
We'll now go arrest the suspects.

640
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,621
You four, go that way.
The rest of you, follow me.

641
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,164
-Move out!
-Yes, sir!

642
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,925
Right.

643
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,553
He is a lord, after all.

644
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,518
Report it immediately if you see them!

645
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,855
If you see these people,
report them immediately!

646
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,234
Report it immediately if you see them!

647
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,361
There must have been a murder.

648
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,000
This is a royal command.
Arrest the suspect, Park Do-soo.

649
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,001
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

650
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,592
Who are you jerks?

651
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,010
What are you talking about?

652
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:15,014
Park Do-soo, you're under arrest
for murdering Chief Hong Seok-gi.

653
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,017
-Take him away!
-Yes, sir.

654
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,743
What are you talking about?

655
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,836
BUDDHA

656
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,773
Maeng-su?

657
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,275
-Thank you for the food.
-Take care.

658
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:15,658
He must be making the shoes from scratch.
Getting the leather ready and sewing.

659
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:19,203
What's taking him so long?
The boat will be leaving soon.

660
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,121
Damn!

661
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,752
And why isn't Tae-seo
back from Jinin Temple yet?

662
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:30,631
They better come back soon.
We'll be in trouble if you miss the boat.

663
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,067
I went through all that crap
at that damn mine

664
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,528
to get this out safely.

665
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,078
Wait.

666
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,249
How can I trust Tae-seo's old man?

667
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,627
Seeing how he treats Tae-seo…

668
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,035
Cha Mal-jong?

669
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:54,131
You… You're the dead inspector!

670
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,009
How are you still alive?

671
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,845
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

672
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,194
I'm here to catch you.

673
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,159
-Arrest him!
-Yes, sir!

674
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,913
Stay still!

675
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:29,833
Let's go.

676
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,418
I'm coming. My shoes…

677
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,712
-Collect his shoes and the evidence.
-Yes, sir.

678
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,094
-Make one of them fur-lined.
-Yes, sir.

679
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,562
JI MAENG-SU

680
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,607
Here you go.

681
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,984
Have a good day.

682
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,794
Damn it.

683
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,351
Help!

684
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,771
There's a criminal here!

685
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,106
Help!

686
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,025
There's a criminal here!

687
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,193
Do you want to die?

688
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,655
Over here! Here!

689
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,074
-Why you crazy…
-This is the man!

690
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,096
-Get him!
-Yes, sir!

691
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,872
What on earth is this about?

692
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,416
What? Maeng-su.

693
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,753
Where are you taking us?

694
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,006
What about Tae-seo?

695
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,341
Don't mention his name.

696
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,677
Where are you taking us?

697
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,637
Shut it!

698
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,180
Hey.

699
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,193
-Gwang-soon, over here.
-Oh, right.

700
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:09,284
-I think it's shorter than me.
-It's exactly your height.

701
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,791
I think we'll need
to get two new sets of blankets.

702
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,419
Since we're all women,
we'll need a small cabinet.

703
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,129
And we need to eat,

704
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,258
so we need a small table
and three sets of plates and cutlery.

705
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,509
Three sets.

706
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,219
Hey!

707
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,684
Jo-yi!

708
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,480
Oh, my, Bi-ryeong.

709
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,649
You bought new clothes.

710
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:43,318
We just came to Hanyang,
and you're already spending money?

711
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,238
I read the fabric store owner's fortune,
and they gave me this.

712
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,907
-Really?
-Yes.

713
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,243
-Good for you.
-Right?

714
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,662
Maybe we should set up
a fortune teller stall here.

715
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,621
Should we?

716
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,083
Oh, right. Lord Yi-eon
was looking for you earlier.

717
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,418
-Me?
-Yes.

718
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,753
Don't forget,
and go to Yook-chil or Gu-pal later.

719
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,921
I will.

720
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,090
And let me know if you need anything.

721
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,759
I'm going to run over to the market
before it closes.

722
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,679
-I need a stationery chest.
-A stationery chest.

723
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,431
-A lantern.
-A lantern.

724
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,807
What else do I need?

725
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,060
This place is great and all,

726
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,188
but since it's by the road,
people can see into it easily.

727
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,191
Then we should get a bamboo screen too.

728
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,109
Bamboo screen!

729
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,944
-Let's get one of those.
-Yes.

730
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,154
-Bamboo…
-Yes

731
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,864
Wait, but our budget is…

732
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,617
We've had
48 bowls of rice and soup so far,

733
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,119
seven pieces of rice cakes as snacks,

734
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:36,038
14 poon each for the ship fare.

735
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,082
Oh, no. I don't think we can afford that.

736
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,047
I have a good idea.

737
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,175
This one, this one, and lastly, this one.

738
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,387
Instead of a bamboo screen,
we can sew the fabric and put it up.

739
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,561
-Do you want help?
-No, I almost got it.

740
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,564
Gwang-soon!

741
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:09,821
All done.

742
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,093
They're trumpet creeper seeds.

743
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,388
I'll be rooting for you.

744
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,599
Never bend to someone else's will
or give in.

745
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:12,592
HWANG BI-RYEONG, KIM JO-YI, RA GWANG-SOON

746
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,389
My aconite!

747
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,978
Why are you screaming like that
in the middle of the day?

748
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,229
What's with you?

749
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,564
Where did it go?

750
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,357
Where did it go?

751
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,483
Where?

752
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,528
What's going on?

753
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,867
My aconite!

754
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:37,868
Where did it go?

755
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,994
Where did it go?

756
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,203
What?

757
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,165
My aconite flower that was here.

758
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,666
Aconite flower?

759
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,669
The aconite flower that I picked
from that field in the mountains

760
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,962
and carefully dried!

761
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,964
That's what I'm looking for.

762
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,842
Right. The aconite flower
that you brought over.

763
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,678
The one that I stole
to give to Gwang-soon.

764
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,263
That is gone, you jerk!

765
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,806
What?

766
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,642
You took it back, didn't you?
You stole it back, you jerk!

767
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:03,977
I didn't steal it.

768
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,146
Hold on.

769
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,440
You stole the aconite flower
I brought with me.

770
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,609
And now you're asking if I stole it back?

771
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,027
That's not important!

772
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,820
Gwang-soon likes the color purple,

773
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,323
so I barely managed to steal it,
but you stole it back?

774
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,283
Is that how I raised you, you jerk?

775
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:19,659
You should never steal!

776
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,077
Is that how I raised you?

777
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,956
You brat! What are you
going to grow up to be, you jerk?

778
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,000
I didn't steal it!

779
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,627
How did you manage to steal it?

780
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,128
Is anyone home?

781
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,464
Hello?

782
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,383
Of course, someone is home.

783
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:38,887
That little thief…

784
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:46,478
He said it was the biggest house
in the neighborhood, and he was right.

785
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,564
You can really tell
the personality of the homeowner.

786
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,983
Look at how clean
and perfectly aligned it is.

787
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,071
Look who's here.

788
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,989
Here you go.

789
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:01,993
Rice cakes?

790
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:06,081
We just moved. We found
a place to stay for the time being.

791
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:07,999
What? Already? Where?

792
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,334
In Ojang-dong.

793
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,586
We'll invite you over
once we've settled in.

794
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,255
With the lord…

795
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,924
But how did you already find a house?

796
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,511
Finding a house in Hanyang
is no easy feat.

797
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,846
It really was so difficult.

798
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,849
But we lucked out and found one
quickly thanks to Jo-yi's friend.

799
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,891
Friend?

800
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,726
You have a friend in Hanyang?

801
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,228
A childhood friend.

802
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,021
Turns out he's a lawyer in Hanyang.

803
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,232
A lawyer? Then by chance…

804
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,358
Is he a man?

805
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,193
Yes, he is.

806
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:40,949
By the way, I guess the lord isn't in yet.
When does he normally get back?

807
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,827
It's odd. He's usually back by now.

808
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,871
What if something happened to him?

809
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,250
That's just how Hanyang is.

810
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,712
Since it's where His Majesty resides,

811
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,214
it's always heavily guarded and--

812
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,299
That way!

813
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,259
-Yes, sir!
-Has war broken out?

814
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,635
Gu-pal, go and find out.

815
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,762
Get down!

816
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,139
-Okay.
-Gu-pal!

817
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:06,933
What are ghosts doing,
not taking him away?

818
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,727
-Search over there!
-Get down!

819
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,687
-Yes, sir!
-Get down. Gu-pal!

820
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,814
-They wouldn't.
-You're right.

821
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,817
I'm sure ghosts wouldn't want
to deal with this crap, right?

822
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,611
-It's fine.
-Get down!

823
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,570
Stop it!

824
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,490
Get down!

825
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,953
Is it Qing again?

826
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,121
Japanese?

827
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,665
-Gu-pal, go and find out!
-Sure.

828
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,501
Gu-pal!

829
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,516
Park Tae-seo is key.

830
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,104
We've arrested everyone involved,
but we can't seem to find Park Tae-seo.

831
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,984
He and Park Seung
used to be on the same side,

832
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,778
but not anymore, it seems.

833
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,031
Their statements may differ,

834
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,159
and Park Tae-seo won't talk easily.

835
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:10,038
It won't be easy for His Majesty
to question Park Seung, either.

836
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,542
Our only chance of winning is
to gather enough evidence.

837
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:15,961
Speaking of which…

838
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,806
This is aconite.

839
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,225
It's known as a medicinal herb, but…

840
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:31,476
It's also poison.

841
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,186
That's correct.

842
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:37,399
Also, it's prohibited from
being cultivated or utilized by civilians

843
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,900
outside the palace walls.

844
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,738
The one who secretly
mass-produced this aconite is

845
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,825
Park Tae-seo,
Park Seung's illegitimate son.

846
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,452
What…

847
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,248
What are you trying to say right now?

848
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,586
You're not implying that Park Seung
and Park Tae-seo were involved

849
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,672
in the Crown Prince's death, are you?

850
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,553
That is not something
you should say rashly.

851
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,806
The one who set up the temporary pharmacy
to treat the Crown Prince

852
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,891
was Chief State Councilor Park Seung.

853
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,731
What is that, Your Highness?

854
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,691
I have an abscess on my back.

855
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,652
Is this really necessary?

856
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,904
It'll disappear on its own with time.

857
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:29,200
Thanks to someone, my palate
has been refined to enjoy gourmet food.

858
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,786
So I hate tasting
something as awful as this.

859
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,747
The abscess itself may not be serious,

860
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,791
but if it has deep roots,
it could lead to suppuration.

861
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,543
So you shouldn't overlook it.

862
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,798
Perhaps it's because I haven't
been in the palace for too long,

863
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,676
but I don't think
I've met this physician before.

864
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,554
I am a new abscess specialist
for the new pharmacy.

865
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:53,892
The Chief State Councilor set up
a whole pharmacy over a measly abscess.

866
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,979
You know how they can
go overboard for the royal family.

867
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,689
Give that to me.

868
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:00,815
Yes, Your Highness.

869
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,658
A pharmacy was set up.

870
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,119
An abscess specialist was replaced.

871
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:20,418
And aconite was suddenly
prescribed too much and too often.

872
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:24,756
Do you really think
it was a mere coincidence?

873
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,260
I am sure of it.

874
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:34,182
The abscess specialist I saw that day

875
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,435
must have been an impostor.

876
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,690
Regretfully, his face was masked,
so I wasn't able to see his face.

877
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,234
But I'm certain

878
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:47,195
he wasn't the real abscess specialist.

879
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,530
Listen.

880
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,199
I know how intelligent you are, but--

881
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,909
Before the interrogation begins,

882
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:56,287
I will return with evidence that
my claim about the physician is right.

883
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,541
I have people gathering intel urgently,

884
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,626
so please, trust me and wait.

885
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,673
Park Seung and Park Tae-seo…

886
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,926
I will catch them this time.

887
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,238
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

888
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,881
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE JUN-HYUK,
JO KWAN-WOO AND CHA HAK-YEON

889
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,303
Needlewoman Jo-yi.

890
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:55,513
I heard her talent is unrivaled in Joseon.

891
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,974
Are you saying
that physician is still alive?

892
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:01,186
How dare you try to mess with your King?

893
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,687
Why do you have this?

894
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,899
The way to meet the King in person…

895
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,818
I will protect your throne.

896
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:12,280
Does it mean
my mother might be arrested soon?

897
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,908
I, too, am doing my best to survive.

898
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,701
To live as Turukson?

899
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:19,078
Where is it? Where did you hide it?

900
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:23,708
