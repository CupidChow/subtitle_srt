1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,316
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,074
Back then and even now,

4
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,786
the one who failed
to catch or stop me was you.

5
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,959
I was able to acquire
this precious inkstone.

6
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,882
To gift this to Your Majesty,

7
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,800
I rushed over--

8
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,599
Your Highness.

9
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,309
Your Highness!

10
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,645
No… How did this happen?

11
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,898
Let me escort you to your royal chambers.

12
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,857
I'm fine.

13
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,442
I'm fine.

14
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,320
My goodness. Please let me.

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,738
Careful.

16
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,117
Back then and even now,

17
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,827
I am

18
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,497
incompetent…

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,875
and unable to

20
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,045
protect anyone.

21
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,189
Let's go!

22
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,899
Oh, dear.

23
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,907
Fire.

24
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,242
-Fire!
-Fire!

25
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,243
OIL

26
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,744
-Oh, no!
-Fire!

27
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,919
Everything is burning!

28
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,054
Who's going to catch them?

29
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,390
What is happening?

30
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,062
Get some water!

31
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,099
Move him into a room and treat his wounds.

32
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,809
It seems he lost a lot of blood.

33
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,603
-Yes, ma'am.
-Come with me.

34
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,604
Yes.

35
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,855
Escort them.

36
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,234
Heat up the room and some water.

37
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,276
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,628
That's blood.

39
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,924
Seeing blood isn't anything special
for a butcher like me.

40
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,344
What about you? Are you all right?

41
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,981
Thank you for saving…

42
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,066
my friends.

43
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,903
I didn't do it to hear that.
Make sure you keep your word.

44
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:44,367
At the end of this month, a ship I do
business with will dock at Gapbigocha.

45
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,537
I'll help you get on that ship.

46
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,708
Okay. I'm counting on you.

47
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,882
You

48
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,803
kept your word and didn't take any lives.

49
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,555
Thank you.

50
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,270
The prisoners have escaped,
so you will be the first one they suspect.

51
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,356
They'll start chasing you soon.

52
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,651
Perhaps you should
get some sleep while you're here.

53
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,239
I don't have the slightest intention
of taking care of you for long.

54
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,758
You've been through so much.

55
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,421
Mother.

56
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,104
DISTRIBUTION LOG

57
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:22,567
I have kept a distribution log
of all the bribes

58
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,362
that I have given Lord Park Seung.

59
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,907
DISTRIBUTION LOG

60
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,678
My lord.

61
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,307
They say that Park Tae-seo
managed to escape the execution.

62
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,065
Father.

63
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,693
Yes.

64
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,862
Yes, my son?

65
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,573
Do-soo, you're awake. What is it?

66
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,699
Tae-seo…

67
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,410
Is he not dead yet?

68
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,624
You don't need to be concerned about that.

69
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,084
I will take care of everything.

70
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,588
You just have to worry
about getting better.

71
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,049
Don't worry about anything else.
Nothing else.

72
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,597
This will not do.

73
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,933
I'll pay a visit to Banchon.

74
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,017
BANCHON: A VILLAGE OF SLAVES,
IT HAS A BUTCHER'S SHOP

75
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,227
I'll go there myself

76
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,397
to buy that thing you like…

77
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,359
and some meat as well.

78
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,032
All right.

79
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:06,045
I guess our lord is working late again.

80
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,506
Let's bring him these treats
to cheer him up.

81
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,799
Let's hurry.

82
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,884
He'll probably be
working through the night.

83
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,512
Hello, sir.

84
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,099
What are you doing here?

85
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:22,228
We have something
to deliver to Lord Ra Yi-eon,

86
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,147
-a busuchan of Okdang.
-And this, too.

87
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:30,111
He left the palace earlier,
so I assumed he was headed home.

88
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,737
Earlier today,

89
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,365
some criminals escaped the execution.

90
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,908
So he must be preoccupied.

91
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,952
What…

92
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,997
Escaped?

93
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,083
Bi-ryeong, get some rest.

94
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,506
My goodness. I told you to get some rest.

95
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,300
Jo-yi, I told you, I'm really fine.

96
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,219
It just hasn't hit you yet.
How exhausted your body must be.

97
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,764
You testified at a royal interrogation.
In front of the king, no less.

98
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,225
Put that away. Don't do it.

99
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,564
Well? Are you feeling okay?

100
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,733
-What?
-Are you?

101
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,735
Yes. I'm perfectly fine.

102
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,570
Really? I don't think you are.

103
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,031
You should be lying down right now.

104
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,284
-Hurry up and lie down.
-I'm really fine.

105
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,620
You're not. No! Don't get up.

106
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,204
Lie down. Down. Just lie down.

107
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,706
Okay.

108
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,876
You have so many orders.

109
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,463
Yes.

110
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,300
But thank goodness I have quick hands.

111
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,095
You don't just have quick hands,
you have superior talent.

112
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,057
There are even some noblewomen

113
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,225
offering to pay extra
to come to them first.

114
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,520
A noblewoman has even asked me
to write up a talisman.

115
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,607
Wait… You don't mean
Lord Choi's wife, do you?

116
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,817
Yes, that's her! That's me!

117
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,322
Jo-yi, we might really end up
buying this house at this rate.

118
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,368
Yes, I think if we pinch
and scrape just a bit more, we can!

119
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,663
Where's Gwang-soon?

120
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:05,915
What?

121
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,250
I have no idea. She's not back yet.

122
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,337
She did say she had
something to take care of.

123
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,338
Really?

124
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,091
Maybe…

125
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,678
she found herself
a lover at the trading group?

126
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,222
That would be great.

127
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,475
Anyhow, lie down for a bit.

128
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,769
I'll go get some ox blood
and cook you soup.

129
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,230
Jo-yi. I'm really fine.
There's no need for that.

130
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,689
That's enough!

131
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,735
Lie down and don't even think
about moving until I get back. Got that?

132
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,737
Okay.

133
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,447
I'll be back.

134
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,921
Is anyone home?

135
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,385
Who are you?

136
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,678
Who are you?

137
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,057
I…

138
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,726
I came to see a man…

139
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,647
by the name of Ra Yong-gyun
that lives here.

140
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,190
Is he in?

141
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,525
Ra Yong-gyun?

142
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,070
-I don't know anyone by that name.
-Pardon?

143
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,866
He used to live in this house.

144
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:25,369
He used to work at the Naeuiwon.
Are you sure you don't know him?

145
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,621
That insane physician?

146
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,249
Just physician.

147
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,420
I heard he moved
to some temple near Hanyang.

148
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,213
What?

149
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,634
Do you know the name of the temple?

150
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,970
Come on, how would I know that?

151
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,930
I heard the rumor ages ago.

152
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,018
Is that so?

153
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,157
-Get out!
-Father!

154
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,744
Why did you come back?

155
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,162
I told you to leave!

156
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,748
Why are you doing this, Father?

157
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,790
Leave at once.

158
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,667
Leave this house at once!

159
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,338
You know I have nowhere to go.
I've just gotten back from Qing.

160
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,548
You can't stay at this house.

161
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,466
Go on.

162
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,426
Go on and leave now!

163
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,182
Father,

164
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:33,103
are you ashamed
that I was dragged away to Qing?

165
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,360
Do you know why
I tried so hard to stay alive?

166
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,281
Do you know why I've come back
after everything I've been through?

167
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,368
It's because of you.

168
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,162
Because I'm all you have.

169
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,540
And you're all that I have.

170
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,751
I really fought tooth and nail
to make it back here alive.

171
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,546
But…

172
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,175
you're ashamed
that your daughter returned alive?

173
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,512
Yes.

174
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,682
So don't come back here.

175
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,687
Don't ever come back here again.

176
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,700
I am not ashamed of myself.

177
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,162
I will go live my life…

178
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,292
and never return here.

179
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,715
Take care of yourself.

180
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,740
But he's still my father.
I should go and see him.

181
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,912
A temple near Hanyang?

182
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,042
Let's go find him.

183
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,419
Let's do that.

184
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,431
Hello, my lord.

185
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,352
Give me your best beef.
Don't worry about the price.

186
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,020
Of course, my lord.

187
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,271
Do you have any ox blood?

188
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,317
Just wait a moment.
I'm already with another customer.

189
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,905
We actually slaughtered a cow recently
for a Seonggyungwan ritual.

190
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,156
I'll be right back.

191
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,188
Where have I seen him before?

192
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,951
Do you by any chance have any of that?

193
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,036
My son is feeling a bit weak.

194
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,498
-Would you like that as well?
-Yes.

195
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,880
Here, my lord.

196
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,216
That will be ten yang in total.

197
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,940
What did that man just buy?

198
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,484
If it's good for restoring energy,

199
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,861
I'll take one, too.

200
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,571
Do you even know what that is?

201
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,366
It's called a poppy capsule.

202
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,411
It's a drug fed to cattle
to reduce pain when they're slaughtered.

203
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,372
It's best not to get started on it.

204
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,251
This will be one poon.

205
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,390
Boil that meat well and feed it to Do-soo.

206
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,600
Yes, sir.

207
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,146
Do-soo!

208
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,569
Jo-yi, is that you?

209
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,946
Yes, I bought some ox blood.

210
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,074
It won't take long to cook it.
Don't come out.

211
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,666
-Jo-yi.
-Jo-yi.

212
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,796
Yook-chil? Gu-pal?

213
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,048
What are you doing here so late at night?

214
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,383
By any chance, did our lord stop by here?

215
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,387
No. Why would he come here at this hour?

216
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,140
He's not here, either.

217
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,060
Maybe he's still in the palace.

218
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,395
He must be so busy
with all those criminals.

219
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,191
Well, the truth is…

220
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:34,321
Park Tae-seo, that damn bastard,
escaped from the execution site.

221
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,740
What?

222
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,034
We ran into some officers
on our way to Okdang

223
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,246
to bring him food
because we thought he was on night duty.

224
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,665
They said he definitely left for the day,

225
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,542
but he hasn't come home yet.

226
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,461
Then where did he go?

227
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,175
You don't think…

228
00:18:56,635 --> 00:19:00,430
he's still chasing after the criminals
by himself, do you?

229
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:11,984
So?

230
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:15,237
Were you able to catch me with that truth?

231
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,324
Back then and even now,

232
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,703
the one who failed
to catch or stop me was you.

233
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,331
I knew it from the start.

234
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:28,417
I knew

235
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,796
that you would do exactly as I expected.

236
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,805
We must find him.

237
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,308
Yes. We must find him immediately.

238
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,687
But you don't know where he is.

239
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,773
We must find him
even if we have to search everywhere.

240
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,734
Oh, right.

241
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,864
Cook this and have it with Bi-ryeong.

242
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,657
-Okay?
-Wait…

243
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,640
-This is…
-The perfect beef…

244
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,184
With a deep meaty aroma…

245
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,188
-This the best quality beef!
-This the best quality beef!

246
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,821
-This is for the young master.
-Okay.

247
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,917
What?

248
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,883
For letting the felons
escape their execution,

249
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:03,095
Chief Scholar Sim Tae-seon
shall be demoted two ranks

250
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,431
and Busuchan Ra Yi-eon
shall be removed from office.

251
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,575
Let's see.

252
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,081
So this is what a royal edict
of appointment looks like.

253
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,750
Hongmungwan is also called Okdang

254
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,670
because it's where precious
and elegant people work, right?

255
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,924
The most coveted government positions
appointed to the most distinguished…

256
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,052
Distinguished, my foot.

257
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,266
It's crap. Just crap.

258
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,769
As if a pathetic bastard like me
could ever…

259
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,608
So are you officially sacked now?

260
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,489
That's right.

261
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,786
I have been dismissed for good.

262
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,209
That's actually for the better.

263
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,712
Take this chance
to look after your health.

264
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,840
Or maybe this is my chance…

265
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,261
to open a dumpling place.

266
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,142
That sounds good to me.
I'll get to eat your dumplings every day.

267
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,939
Yes.

268
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,650
Sounds nice.

269
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,780
A life of making dumplings…

270
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,867
sounds so nice.

271
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
You run around like this all the time,

272
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,175
but you just end up
getting hurt more and more.

273
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,220
It's quite an unrewarding job.

274
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,398
Physical wounds will heal with time,

275
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,276
but what about the wounds in your heart?

276
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,573
Even if you work hard,
you achieve nothing.

277
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,868
Even when living isn't particularly fun,

278
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,080
you have no choice but to keep living.

279
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,249
How infuriating.

280
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,584
Sometimes,

281
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,295
I'm sick of it
the moment I wake up in the morning.

282
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,800
But it doesn't bring me
any closer to death.

283
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,928
I'd cry my eyes out,

284
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:54,015
but when the time came,
I would eat, sleep, and drink water.

285
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,524
I'm not sure…

286
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,529
if I can get back on my feet again.

287
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,492
My lord.

288
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,788
I'm sure you'll get back on your feet.

289
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,506
Would you like to make a bet?

290
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,737
So close.

291
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,744
Can you do it for me?

292
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,335
That was amazing. My lord!

293
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,294
It fell down!

294
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,462
It fell down!

295
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,547
How did you do it in one go?

296
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,843
My lord!

297
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,853
My lord, I made it this far.

298
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,104
It's your turn.

299
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,259
It seems that I have won.

300
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,511
That was too close.
Let's go for one more round.

301
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:01,893
I got you!

302
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,603
You're it, my lord!

303
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,106
I got you!

304
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,527
You're it!

305
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,251
I'm going to get you, my lord!

306
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,591
I'm so tired.

307
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,928
Even if you tell me
you're going to grill me to eat,

308
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,763
I can't run anymore.

309
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,891
How out of shape you must be

310
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,729
to be so out of breath
when we didn't even run that much.

311
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,940
You're the one to talk.

312
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,567
What about you?

313
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,278
I can even see
the whites of your eyes right now.

314
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,488
That's impossible.

315
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,117
I'm perfectly fine.

316
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,650
Jo-yi.

317
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,655
Yes?

318
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,120
Today's competition…

319
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,040
I won all three rounds.

320
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,815
Do you know something?

321
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,568
You…

322
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:01,239
called me by my name
for the first time today.

323
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:08,037
I was only called a wretch,
a rotten brat, and a wench all the time…

324
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,124
but after meeting you,

325
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,503
I became Kim Jo-yi.

326
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,726
My lord!

327
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,854
I know that you're here, my lord!

328
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,566
Come on out, my lord!

329
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,613
Found you.

330
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,282
You're it now, my lord.

331
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,956
Why are you just standing there?

332
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,427
Have you never been it before?

333
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,390
You now have to chase me down.

334
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,643
You need to start over.

335
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,276
Can't I…

336
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,280
just remain in hiding?

337
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,037
Can't I…

338
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,998
just not come out?

339
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,219
You can't.

340
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,391
Didn't you say you were going to show me?

341
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,143
I will catch those bad guys

342
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,231
and show you
that not everything was in vain.

343
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,067
Show me that.

344
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,656
So what if you fail?

345
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,618
So what if something goes wrong?

346
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,750
I like you…

347
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:23,089
So what's there to be afraid of?

348
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,756
Okay.

349
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,426
For you…

350
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,723
I will start over.

351
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,926
The sky is so beautiful tonight.

352
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,977
Well, then…

353
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,853
Get back safely.

354
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,982
Okay. Go on inside.

355
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,736
Okay. I hope you have
sweet dreams tonight.

356
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,488
Okay.

357
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,156
Sweet dreams.

358
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,540
By any chance…

359
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,252
I'm just feeling a bit bloated.

360
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,296
Is there any walking trail around here?

361
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,508
It just so happens
that I'm also feeling indigestion

362
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,552
and want to take a walk.

363
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,470
-Would you like some company?
-Sure.

364
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,484
Then, I'll go on inside.

365
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,779
Okay. You should really go inside now.

366
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,614
Okay.

367
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,330
-By any chance…
-Yes?

368
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,624
Did you see our poster on the way here?

369
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,085
I think I didn't.
Did it fall off? Where did it go?

370
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,629
Should we go and check together?

371
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,630
Yes.

372
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,678
Go on inside now.

373
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,763
Okay.

374
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,599
-By any chance…
-By any chance…

375
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,901
By any chance…

376
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,278
By any chance…

377
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,124
Then, I'll really, really go inside now.

378
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,586
Okay, go on inside now, really now.

379
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:52,882
Okay. I really hope you get home safely.

380
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,500
Noodles…

381
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,586
Do you want some before you go?

382
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,384
Noodles?

383
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,302
Noodles…

384
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,558
Noodles sound nice.

385
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,149
The fire in the furnace…

386
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,317
was just started,

387
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,570
so it'll get warm in no time.

388
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:56,988
Okay.

389
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,207
Make yourself at home.

390
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,628
Okay.

391
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,463
Here.

392
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,571
Noodles…

393
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,951
I'll hurry up and make some.

394
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,494
Okay.

395
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,234
My lord.

396
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,319
Young Master.

397
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,489
Hey.

398
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,491
Why aren't you sleeping?

399
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,870
How could we sleep when you were
nowhere to be found? Are you okay?

400
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,499
We were absolutely worried sick
while looking for you.

401
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,125
I'm sorry about that.

402
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,253
Anyhow, thank goodness you're okay.

403
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,672
You should've let us know you were back.

404
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,174
You're right. I should have.

405
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,760
Oh, right. Did you meet Jo-yi?

406
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,553
She went out to look for you.

407
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,600
She hasn't come back home yet too,
so they're panicking as well.

408
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,894
I guess we just missed each other.

409
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,980
Anyhow, you're not hurt, right?
You're okay?

410
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,065
Yes. I'm really fine.

411
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,692
I'm not hurt at all.

412
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,985
That's good to hear.

413
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:02,238
So stop following me around
and go to sleep already!

414
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,781
The noodles at this hour?

415
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:04,907
Two bowls, at that.

416
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,834
I ended up making too much. That's all.

417
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,547
But why are there two sets of chopsticks?

418
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,675
My lord, don't tell me they are…

419
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,011
What?

420
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,476
They must be for us.

421
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,687
Your generosity knows no bounds.

422
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,314
I was actually getting hungry.

423
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,317
-What?
-Thank you for this.

424
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,484
Thank you.

425
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,652
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

426
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,200
-Our Young Master is the best.
-I agree.

427
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,754
Damn annoying punks…

428
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,507
Well…

429
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,303
Let's have noodles some other time.

430
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,263
It's fine.

431
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,683
Young Master,
is someone in there with you?

432
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,237
Young Master?

433
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,826
He fell asleep already.

434
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,662
How tired he must have been.

435
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,083
Sleep well, Young Master. Let's go.

436
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,761
Enjoy.

437
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,764
Thank you for the food, my lord.

438
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,226
From the noodles,

439
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,937
-I can feel his love for us.
-Yes.

440
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,480
It's made with so much love.

441
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,733
He could have never made this
for someone else.

442
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,445
-Even for a woman.
-Of course not.

443
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,114
It'd never be this good.

444
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,825
His noodles are so good.
He's such a noodle enthusiast.

445
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,159
He really is.

446
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,412
What do we do now?

447
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,665
I wonder he ate some too.

448
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,964
Did you see him roll up
his sleeves to cook?

449
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:25,881
I think

450
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,760
you'll have to spend the night here.

451
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,523
So hot!

452
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,525
-It's hot!
-But it's so good.

453
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:33,908
Did you sleep well?

454
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,743
Yes.

455
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,704
Did you sleep well, my lord?

456
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,042
Waking up

457
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,004
together in the morning
like this is quite nice.

458
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,231
Yi-eon, are you inside?

459
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,067
I brought some honey…

460
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,034
Oh, no.

461
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,619
The honey has spilled…

462
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,290
-Grandmother?
-"Grandmother"?

463
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,638
Stop! Stop right there.

464
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,390
-My goodness.
-Catch me if you can!

465
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,396
Were you waiting there?

466
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,149
How is he?

467
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,111
He will live.

468
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,116
I'm the one who should suffer like that.

469
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,494
But that poor thing…

470
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,749
Who knew we would meet again like this?

471
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,004
We can't do anything
when it comes to destiny.

472
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,383
So,

473
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,427
what are you planning to do?

474
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,679
I don't know, either.

475
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,974
A part of me

476
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,351
doesn't see the point of telling him now.

477
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,270
But you're responsible for this twist,

478
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,939
so shouldn't you
be the one sorting it out?

479
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,568
It's a sin that I committed,

480
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,154
so I must wash it away myself.

481
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,366
That's retribution and fate.

482
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,717
The bastards that did this to you…

483
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,180
I'll make sure
to make them pay for it, so don't worry.

484
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,103
Father.

485
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,939
Yes? What is it?

486
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,650
Do you want to eat something tasty?

487
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,526
No, not something tasty.

488
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,279
Then, how about a new outfit?

489
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,407
I was actually planning
to get new socks made anyway.

490
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:27,831
Father.

491
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,878
I wasn't trying to rat you out
during the interrogation.

492
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,756
I know. I understand.

493
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,509
How scared you must have been to do that.

494
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,265
They took a sweet boy
and pushed him over the edge.

495
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,600
They're to blame.

496
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,104
There's no one
more despicable in this world

497
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,940
than a bastard who pushes one
to betray his own father.

498
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,404
I do not resent you, not one bit,

499
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,489
so don't worry.

500
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,034
But Father…

501
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,536
Yes?

502
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,204
What about Tae-seo?

503
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,082
Did they catch him?

504
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,962
They said the guards went after him,

505
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,257
but catching him isn't going to be easy.

506
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,302
Then what am I supposed to do?
I seriously can't sleep knowing

507
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,681
-that Tae-seo is alive.
-Yes. There, there.

508
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,142
I'll take care of that as well.

509
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,687
My son should be able to sleep well.

510
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,565
Then what about the inspector?

511
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,775
I think

512
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:41,155
he knows all about
what we did to the Crown Prince.

513
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:48,078
Father, I'm really scared.
I think he has evidence, too.

514
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,372
What if we really get caught?

515
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,208
Yes, yes. Stop crying. There, there.

516
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,544
Don't worry.

517
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,173
I have a plan in mind.

518
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:02,593
What's your plan?

519
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:08,724
They say that you should
keep your enemies closer.

520
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:13,937
Anyhow,

521
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,939
you don't worry about a thing.

522
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,025
Just focus on getting your health back.

523
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,946
When I was put in charge of this case,

524
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:26,116
I was also granted the authority
to oversee Gapbigocha.

525
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,454
I'll fix up Gokdu Trading Group's
buildings and let you use them.

526
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:35,042
I hear they have a spectacular view.

527
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,253
Then, is Gapbigocha ours now?

528
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:39,546
Instead of Chungcheong?

529
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:44,176
It's a bit smaller
than Chungcheong Province,

530
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,763
but it still has access to the sea,
so it should be quite lucrative.

531
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,724
That's my father for you.

532
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,644
The leader of the aristocracy,
the kingmaker,

533
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,064
and the true king
that controls the king like a puppet!

534
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,651
Oh, my baby.

535
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,820
My goodness. My baby. My sweet baby.

536
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,328
Sit down.

537
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,538
-Yes, ma'am!
-Yes, ma'am!

538
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,843
What is your name?

539
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,972
It's Kim Jo-yi.

540
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,473
Miss.

541
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,435
Grandmother.

542
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,731
Great Madam?

543
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,109
My lady!

544
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,152
My lady.

545
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,282
Based on your attire,
I don't believe you are of noble birth.

546
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,201
That's correct. I am of the middle class.

547
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,954
Well…

548
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,832
Families are being torn apart by the war,

549
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:59,126
what does her class or family matter?

550
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,669
Do you wish to be kicked out?

551
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,841
You seem old enough.

552
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,677
Why haven't you gotten married yet?

553
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,221
Well…

554
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,515
You've just met her,

555
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,601
so asking
such personal questions is a bit…

556
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:16,935
I'm divorced.

557
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,399
What?

558
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:24,735
Divorced?

559
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,531
Are you saying you were kicked out?

560
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,366
She had her reasons.

561
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,202
Her ex-husband had huge gambling debts.

562
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:35,954
Are you the one that got a divorce?

563
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,875
I wasn't kicked out.

564
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,878
I filed a lawsuit to end my marriage.

565
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:48,425
Life with my in-law was difficult
and my husband was far from sweet.

566
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,093
Marriage isn't a child's play.

567
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,512
Of course, you come
across some difficulties.

568
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,972
It was beyond difficult.

569
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,350
It was closer to slavery.

570
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,810
What a novel sophistry.

571
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:04,024
Are you sure it wasn't due to
your lack of patience and tolerance?

572
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,859
That's also correct.

573
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:11,657
Yes, I'm quite hardheaded
and do not follow customs.

574
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,869
However, I also believe
the customs of this world are virtueless.

575
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,830
This world hates me
and calls me an audacious brat.

576
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,874
How could I have love for this country?

577
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,215
-Oh, that's…
-Yi-eon, you wait outside.

578
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,261
Did you not hear me? Go outside now.

579
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,475
If you have something to say,
you can say it to me.

580
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,227
-Jo-yi…
-My lord.

581
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,604
You should wait outside.

582
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,315
No.

583
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,402
I'll talk to Grandmother,
so you leave the room.

584
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,736
No.

585
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,740
I should be the one
who talks to her about this.

586
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,386
My lord!

587
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,931
You should come out for a second.

588
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,868
So, what do you plan on doing with Yi-eon?

589
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,496
I don't plan on doing anything.

590
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,292
I'm just staying by his side.

591
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,503
So what is your purpose
in staying by his side?

592
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,214
If you're hoping to marry him,

593
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,593
you may try so over my dead body.

594
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,638
I have no intention of marrying him.

595
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,933
When a woman gets married,

596
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,144
she is buried under customs and rules.

597
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,188
She loses her life and name.

598
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,647
I know that very well.

599
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,151
Therefore,

600
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:15,739
I want to live the rest of my life
as Kim Jo-yi and not as someone's wife.

601
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,786
I'm more than capable
of standing on my two feet.

602
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,747
I am looking after myself well
and making good money.

603
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,501
It's tough at times, but I'm very
much satisfied with my life now.

604
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,753
Such insolence…

605
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:35,091
Anyhow, what you're worried about
will never happen.

606
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,177
And above else,

607
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,722
I'm familiar with
our nation's rules of decorum.

608
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,934
I'm well aware of
how difficult a nobleman's life becomes

609
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,687
if he marries
a divorced middle-class woman.

610
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,566
I like Lord Yi-eon.

611
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,777
I do not wish to ruin his life.

612
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,195
If you knew that,

613
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,448
you should've kept your distance from him!

614
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,035
I'm not the only one with these feelings.

615
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,997
I like Lord Yi-eon,
and he likes me as well.

616
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,375
I think it's unfair for you

617
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,002
to only blame me for that.

618
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,183
My lord.

619
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,060
What is going on?

620
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,062
You were ordered to come to the court.

621
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,398
Come to the court?

622
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,400
But I have been dismissed.

623
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,026
Exactly.

624
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,070
What is this, some child's play?

625
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,822
It seems

626
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:42,117
there will be a special appointment.

627
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,830
What in the world is going on?

628
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,680
I'll make an announcement
on the king's behalf.

629
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,315
As punishment for mishandling the case
regarding Park Tae-seo and his mob,

630
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,860
Chief Scholar Sim Tae-seon
shall be demoted to Deputy Scholar,

631
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:22,449
and Busuchan Ra Yi-eon shall be
demoted to Scribe, Senior 8th Rank.

632
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,203
My lord.

633
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,956
I am appointed as Scribe?

634
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,376
I have been dismissed,
so I cannot be appointed.

635
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,420
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

636
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,965
You were reinstated
because His Majesty granted

637
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,885
the new chief scholar's plea.

638
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,513
The new chief scholar?

639
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,098
That will be all from me.

640
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,601
You can discuss the rest
with the new chief scholar.

641
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,817
My lord.

642
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:03,281
Heading to Western Xia
with my shadow as my friend…

643
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,952
This is paradise…

644
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,375
You can even feel
the touch of class in the air.

645
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,126
This is the great Okdang.

646
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,424
I have become the leader
of Hongmungwan as His Majesty wishes.

647
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,094
I, Park Seung, am the new chief scholar.

648
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,517
Such diligent public servants…

649
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,478
I see that your investigation
was quite thorough.

650
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,063
Well done.

651
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,445
Out of the six ministries and
three offices, this is where you end up?

652
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,281
There are 11 glorious positions
in Uijeongbu alone.

653
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,491
Why did it have to be here?

654
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,368
Show some respect!

655
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,246
I am your superior. How dare you!

656
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,554
What do you think you're doing?

657
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,775
This is what's interesting about life.

658
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,319
Some work hard to make the porridge,

659
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,488
and some other minister gobbles it up.

660
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:30,887
Wait.

661
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,431
Hey.

662
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,353
I know how you feel,
but you must not act rashly.

663
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:42,816
If you go after Park Seung now,
who knows what the repercussions will be?

664
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,486
We might end up getting executed!

665
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,408
He won't kill us.

666
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:56,913
Park Seung is having
so much fun toying with us.

667
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,165
Why would he kill us?

668
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,545
What are you planning to do?

669
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,091
I must find it.

670
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,802
I will start over.

671
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,976
Okay. Leave work early.

672
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,310
I'll cover for you.

673
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:22,772
Go.

674
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,108
Make sure you find it.

675
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,372
They collected so many useless things…

676
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:44,669
I should take them
to use as kindling at home.

677
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,053
-My lord.
-How did it go?

678
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,389
It was as I expected.

679
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,686
This is the best way
to get rid of all the evidence at once.

680
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,022
Lord Park Seung is smart.

681
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,483
Fortunately, Lord Yi-eon is smarter.

682
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,235
We almost lost all the evidence
that we've gathered.

683
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,533
PHARMACY JOURNAL

684
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,870
You two take this to Jinin Temple
and find out about the dead physician.

685
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,038
Yes, my lord.

686
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,459
I'll go to Gapbigocha and see
if I can trace Park Tae-seo's whereabouts.

687
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:28,421
It's time to counterattack.

688
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,234
THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD ACTORS
IN THIS EPISODE WAS PROPERLY ENSURED

689
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,998
SPECIAL THANKS TO
LEE JUN-HYUK AND JO KWAN-WOO

690
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,256
Can't you just
take your hands off this case?

691
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,924
I must close this case.

692
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,176
She said the socks are urgent
and asked for them to be made.

693
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,346
Is this Lord Park Seung's house?

694
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,974
I'm also looking for someone. My father.

695
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,351
I'll be by your side until you find him.

696
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,603
Jo-yi, I don't want you
to walk on a thorny path.

697
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,605
It's up to me
to decide to get married or not.

698
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,191
If you don't want to get married,
stop seeing that girl.

699
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,776
You can resent and regret it all you want.

700
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,945
That doesn't change the life you led.

701
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,989
Get out of my way!

702
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:40,868
