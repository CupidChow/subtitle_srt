1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,097
Is this the way?

4
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,767
Or not?

5
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,103
I think I passed here earlier…

6
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,397
Maybe not? Is it that way?

7
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,315
Wait.

8
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,569
My goodness,
why do all the paths look the same?

9
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,363
Is it this way?

10
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,074
Or not?

11
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,076
What? Forest?

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,993
Forest?

13
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,622
It's the forest again.
I'm going around in circles.

14
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,332
Rage.

15
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,375
-That's 432.
-Labor.

16
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,378
-Animal.
-That's 433.

17
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,505
Water?

18
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,257
Water… Water stain.

19
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,717
Stain…

20
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,345
Forget it!

21
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,974
I can't believe this.

22
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,480
I can't do it. I just can't.

23
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,649
I can't, either. I can't!

24
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,532
My lord.

25
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,993
What in the world did we ever do to you?

26
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,829
See how many furrows the field has,

27
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,873
how much aconite there is,
and how wide the field stretches

28
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,250
as accurately as possible.

29
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,919
But why?

30
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,088
Why must we go so far?

31
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,091
Obviously, because
I have to submit a report

32
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,010
and because it concerns the Crown Prince.

33
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,221
There cannot be any mistakes.

34
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,517
Then you should've
at least gotten us some help!

35
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,981
This must be kept strictly confidential.
We can't just let anyone in on this.

36
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,192
Are you serious?
This is like talking to a donkey.

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,445
Why do we have to go through this mess?
Why just the two of us?

38
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,572
Easy.

39
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,949
Good luck then.

40
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,910
Take it easy,
but finish it as soon as possible.

41
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,705
Where are you going?

42
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,790
We cannot do this. I refuse!

43
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,876
I'll submit a report…

44
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,502
No, but he's still my master.

45
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,296
But this labor is unjust!

46
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,674
No!

47
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,596
Where were we?

48
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,225
You came from over there

49
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,936
and I was here and did about this much.

50
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,118
What?

51
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,454
What's this?

52
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,129
"Yeomcho"?

53
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,800
Isn't that gunpowder?

54
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,762
What did you just say? Yeomcho?

55
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,014
So it was true.

56
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,516
They said there was gunpowder.

57
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:27,976
Look.

58
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,145
Not only did they steal from the King,
but they also dealt gunpower.

59
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,064
They…

60
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,692
They don't sound like your common thieves.

61
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,321
But what are these characters?

62
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,614
"Mido."

63
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,658
"Mido"? What is Mido?

64
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,076
"Tail" and "island."

65
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,744
It sounds like a name of a place.

66
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,789
Tail Island?

67
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,042
Oh, my goodness! Who's there?

68
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,003
You're dead meat. I'm serious!

69
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,767
My lord.

70
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,937
Are you all right?

71
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,693
-One more bowl of water…
-Yes, of course.

72
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,622
What? That's why you came back midway?

73
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,209
The mountain terrain is quite rough.

74
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,296
It was like a maze.
The twists and turns just kept coming.

75
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:40,882
They may be evil,

76
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,886
but I couldn't help but think they built
their fortress in an amazing spot.

77
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,222
Then what are you planning to do now?

78
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,768
I was going to confirm the location first,

79
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,103
but since I wasted too much time,

80
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,565
I'll have to request backup
from the yeokcham or a nearby outpost.

81
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,193
But you said
the officials are in on it too.

82
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,991
I noticed on my way in
that this place has everything.

83
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,411
Do you trade medicinal herbs as well?

84
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,538
We don't deal with medicinal herbs.

85
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,542
The one in charge of that
is such a damn stickler.

86
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,377
I can't be bothered to deal with him.

87
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,714
Not everyone has colluded with them.

88
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,258
The bongsa is stationed
at the Gwangheungchang.

89
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,012
I must meet the magistrate
overseeing that jurisdiction.

90
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,722
I know where that office is.

91
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,934
It happens to be nearby,
so I can take you there.

92
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,018
No.

93
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,940
What if I can't find it?

94
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,278
Maybe to near the office, then.

95
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,197
Yes.

96
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,702
-Yook-chil! Gu-pal!
-They're not here.

97
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,460
That's 4,550.

98
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,212
And 7,432.

99
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,215
-That's 4,551.
-7,433…

100
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,092
That's 7,434.

101
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,970
-And 4,552.
-7,43…

102
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,227
Have you gone nuts?

103
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,770
Have you gone insane?

104
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,731
Is this my fault?

105
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,694
-Is this really my fault?
-Let go.

106
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,279
-You first.
-I told you to let go.

107
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,238
Let go first.

108
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,867
-I can do this until tomorrow.
-Me too. It doesn't hurt at all.

109
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,832
Are you still at it?

110
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,793
You're here.

111
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,795
-My lord.
-You punks! You little…

112
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,512
You can continue later.
Come, we must go somewhere.

113
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,474
-Lead the way.
-Yes. The office is this way.

114
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,518
Where are we going this time?

115
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,854
How did he get back so soon?

116
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,440
Hurry up!

117
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,615
A corpse?

118
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,037
Someone reported a rotting stench
coming from Soyang Trading Group.

119
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,997
And we found…

120
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,474
Hong Seok-gi…

121
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,977
This is the Chief of Maritime Transport.

122
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,687
Was there anything else besides it?

123
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,730
There was something…

124
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,274
This letter was with the body.

125
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,949
I saw a six-foot nobleman
with a sturdy frame

126
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,077
wearing a celadon-green cape

127
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:02,166
threaten the Chief of Maritime Transport
quite loudly before he was killed.

128
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,252
A passerby.

129
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,217
Come greet me.

130
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,552
Is there anybody inside?

131
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,720
State your business.

132
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,305
Oh, it's fine.

133
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,723
It's fine.

134
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,517
You'll find out once we get inside.

135
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,727
Excuse us.

136
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,146
I came to request assistance
with an urgent matter.

137
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,442
I saw a six-foot nobleman
with a sturdy frame

138
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,113
wearing a celadon-green cape

139
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:37,952
threaten the Chief of Maritime Transport
quite loudly before he was killed.

140
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,415
-I come from Hanyang…
-Arrest this man!

141
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,916
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

142
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,586
-What are you doing?
-Wait.

143
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,628
What are you doing?

144
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,255
What is this?

145
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,966
Do you know Chief Hong Seok-gi?

146
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,885
How do you know Lord Hong Seok-gi?

147
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,271
Hong Seok-gi?

148
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,943
Where was he found?

149
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,820
Who did this to him?

150
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,034
Bi-ryeong…

151
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,996
What about the woman who was with him?
What happened to her?

152
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,332
What are you going on about?

153
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,709
You're the one that killed him,
yet you play dumb.

154
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,337
There's a witness to your crime!

155
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,172
No, that's not possible.

156
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,632
My lord would never.

157
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,967
He's a deputy office of Hongmungwan!

158
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,303
That's correct.

159
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,892
I am a secret royal inspector
dispatched to Chungcheong Province.

160
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,528
He was the Chief of Maritime Transport,
and I arrested him to question him,

161
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,530
but I did not kill him.

162
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,367
I'm an inspector.
Why would I kill a suspect that needed

163
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,703
to be transferred
to Hanyang for questioning?

164
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,082
A horse plaque.

165
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,671
Do you know

166
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,883
how many crooks I've seen
impersonating secret royal inspectors?

167
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,893
-Lock them up!
-Yes, sir.

168
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,896
Have you gone insane?

169
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,232
How dare you! You'll pay dearly for this!

170
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,484
My lord, say something.

171
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,027
-You will regret this.
-Let go.

172
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,905
You should send someone
to check before accusing me!

173
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,115
Look here!

174
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,252
Wait!

175
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,087
You'll regret this!

176
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,630
There's been a misunderstanding!

177
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,257
Open this door.

178
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,804
Hey! How much farther do we need to go?

179
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,050
Hey!

180
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,812
That's not the punk we're trying to catch.
Wait a second.

181
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,148
Isn't that the moron of your family?

182
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,400
That crazy bastard.

183
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,652
How did he even know about this place?

184
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,576
You! You just wait right there!

185
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,204
I'm coming over to kill you!

186
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,163
You…

187
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,498
You stay right there!

188
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,211
The wrong guests have arrived.

189
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,213
My goodness.

190
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:25,262
He should've asked for help ages ago.
He just had to be so darn stubborn.

191
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,767
Where was I?

192
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,145
Mido….

193
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,772
Mido.

194
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,526
"Turukson"?

195
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,778
Turukson?

196
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,322
That's a sea monster.

197
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,702
Are they saying they did business
with a sea monster?

198
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,376
What?

199
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,641
TURUKSON

200
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,061
Jo-yi!

201
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,521
Jo-yi!

202
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,439
We're in big trouble!

203
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,192
Lord Yi-eon has been arrested!

204
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,862
What?

205
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,034
Look here!

206
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,828
My lord.

207
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,955
My lord.

208
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,545
There is another proof
that I'm an inspector,

209
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,380
so send an official to fetch it.

210
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,257
Please, we don't have much time.

211
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,509
A man that should be
at the Tribute Granary

212
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,094
has been found dead here.

213
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,346
Do you realize how serious this is?

214
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,516
If you know something,

215
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,519
you'd better come clean now.

216
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,731
Here is the proof!

217
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,279
He is an inspector
carrying out the king's command.

218
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,238
Here.

219
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,534
Here is his official manual,
sealed appointment letter, and vernier.

220
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,540
How did you know to come here?

221
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,544
I overheard while waiting outside
in case you got lost on your way back.

222
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,797
Are you all right?

223
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,383
What in the world is going on?

224
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,218
Are you two all right?

225
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:45,235
What are you people waiting for?
Release them at once!

226
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:50,616
Damn it!

227
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,703
Where is the mine?

228
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,332
Search the place! Now!

229
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:04,505
That's quite an intense greeting,
I must say.

230
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,298
How did you know about this place?

231
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,926
Hey, Tae-seo, did you tell him?

232
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,135
No.

233
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,806
I was also wondering
how he found out about this place.

234
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:19,186
What is the precious child of a minister
doing deep in the mountains?

235
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,270
Well,

236
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,231
you wouldn't tell me,

237
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,692
so I had to jump through some damn hoops.

238
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,777
You tend to be

239
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,113
quite reckless, Tae-seo.

240
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,700
You should speak with more grace.

241
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,703
I mean, a young master
of an elite noble family

242
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,080
shouldn't carry himself
in such a lousy manner.

243
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,957
How dare you!

244
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,086
How dare a filthy lowborn
like you talk to me?

245
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,219
How dare a lowborn bastard
try to lecture me?

246
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,852
I apologize for what happened earlier.

247
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,771
We've been fooled
by fake inspectors many times,

248
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,898
so I jumped to conclusions.

249
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,567
It's fine.

250
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,403
I was actually relieved
to see you not try to hide it.

251
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,407
They're all yours. You should hurry.

252
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,576
Do you know anything

253
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,871
about the woman who was with the body?

254
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,499
We haven't heard anything.

255
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:29,298
I went up myself to find
the entrance to Baekgwiryeong,

256
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,343
but I gave up and returned
because of the confusing paths.

257
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,432
It's not because of that.
He just has a terrible sense of direction.

258
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,645
Do you by any chance
know the way to the top?

259
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,522
Well…

260
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,776
You, come here.

261
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,028
Yes, my lord.

262
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,203
He's a ginseng digger
who knows Baekgwiryeong very well.

263
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,537
You can trust him.

264
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,749
He's someone carrying out
an important assignment.

265
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,543
Guide him to the top of the mountain.
I'm counting on you.

266
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,545
Yes, my lord.

267
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,759
There are so many people going
to the top of the mountain today.

268
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,803
It's surprising.

269
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,889
What do you mean?

270
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,682
Did you see someone else?

271
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,482
I saw a group of men with swords…

272
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,278
Hey!

273
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,531
And a young woman.

274
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,241
How much farther do we need to go?

275
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,575
We're almost there.

276
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,830
She seemed like a shaman.

277
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,291
A shaman?

278
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,585
My lord, do you think it was Bi-ryeong?

279
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,004
Perhaps Bi-ryeong was captured?

280
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,842
I shouldn't have left her by herself.

281
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,178
I should've stopped her back then.

282
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,389
Bi-ryeong…

283
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,880
I heard she was your new concubine.

284
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,800
I never said that. Concubine?

285
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,554
Look at him.

286
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,182
Does he look like someone
who would disclose

287
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,726
the mine location
to a mere female laborer?

288
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,520
There must be something
going on between you two.

289
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,109
You're wrong, you bastard!

290
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,572
Have you been lied to all your lives?

291
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,699
The spirits are watching everything!

292
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,160
You'll all receive divine punishment!

293
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,747
Divine punishment or whatever.

294
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,582
You look familiar.

295
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,544
Aren't you the slave that ran away
from our trading group?

296
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,257
When the inspector showed up,
didn't she shoot slingshots with the kids?

297
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:18,717
What?

298
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,137
You're on the inspector's side?

299
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,224
My goodness.

300
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,529
What did you come all this way to steal?

301
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,365
You must be after something.

302
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:44,243
That's right.

303
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,911
You're so quick.

304
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,084
You can just hand over everything
and get lost.

305
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,463
Is the mine really worth the risk?

306
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,923
If I open my mouth,

307
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,635
you'll be beheaded for high treason,
and your head will be on a spike.

308
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,763
Followed by a posthumous execution.

309
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:11,019
All right, then.
I'll assume you understand…

310
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,605
and take over this place.

311
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,102
Catch her!

312
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,939
We can't let her return
to the inspector! Get her!

313
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,673
Thank you.

314
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,050
This is good enough.

315
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,718
Yes, my lord.

316
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,223
As soon as you find Bi-ryeong,
leave this place with her.

317
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,475
Yes, my lord.

318
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,977
-You too, Gwang-soon.
-Yes, my lord.

319
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,229
Let's go.

320
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,773
Bi-ryeong.

321
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,442
Jo-yi.

322
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,076
Why that damn bastard…

323
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,036
Are you all right?

324
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,204
Yes.

325
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,581
How could you miss that?

326
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,480
Don't move!

327
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,819
This is what you get…

328
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,738
for coming after me.

329
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,543
Hey! Did he really light the fuse?

330
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,254
Forget this. Run!

331
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,257
Everyone get out!

332
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,868
-My lord!
-It's dangerous!

333
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,162
Get out of here.

334
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,061
My silver!

335
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,272
God damn it!

336
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,403
My lord!

337
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,125
My lord.

338
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,629
My lord!

339
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,214
Young Master!

340
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,601
My lord!

341
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,936
Young Master…

342
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,107
My lord…

343
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,827
-My lord…
-We must save Young Master…

344
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,413
My lord!

345
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,519
Please come back, my lord!

346
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,105
Please come back, my lord!

347
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,149
Please come back, my lord!

348
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:42,577
FUNERAL

349
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,045
What?

350
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,880
The inspector is dead?

351
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,799
Is that true?

352
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,176
Did you see it with your own two eyes?

353
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,637
It wasn't just me.

354
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:09,062
Dozens of soldiers were
watching when he died.

355
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,564
Soldiers?

356
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,403
The inspector brought with him a whole
lot of soldiers to raid Tae-seo's hideout.

357
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,738
Wait, what about you?

358
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,698
Are you all right?

359
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,741
Yes.

360
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,702
Since the inspector died
in front of the officials,

361
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:29,082
I'm not even suspected of anything.
I'm so lucky.

362
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,042
Is that so?

363
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,797
That's great news.

364
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,029
Darn it, the smoke is burning my eyes.

365
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,645
Yi-eon…

366
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,064
My goodness…

367
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,361
My precious grandson…

368
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,363
Forgive us, ma'am.

369
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,159
We should've served him better
and protected him.

370
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,786
Yi-eon.

371
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,037
Yi-eon…

372
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,001
You weren't even able to find his body?

373
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,669
No…

374
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,297
The whole mine collapsed, so…

375
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,592
Forgive us, ma'am.

376
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,260
If I didn't badger him

377
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,222
to take the state exams,

378
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:13,019
he wouldn't have died
so far away from home like this…

379
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,566
My poor grandson.

380
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,068
I have told you…

381
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,737
I gave you that name

382
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,282
so that you could become
a man of your word.

383
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,827
I even let you postpone marriage

384
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,954
because you said
you'd take the state exams.

385
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,997
How dare you deceive your own grandmother?

386
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,291
Forgive me, Grandmother.

387
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,546
However, I will not take the state exams.

388
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,964
Why you little…

389
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,925
What's the point of taking the exams?

390
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,970
Those who served the country well
are locked up in Qing

391
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,972
and only those who failed to protect it

392
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,641
have filled the court.

393
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,519
Chaos runs amok through the land,

394
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,188
yet look how we're living.

395
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,358
The fact that this country
belongs to the aristocracy

396
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,026
will not change in your lifetime!

397
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,528
The unchanging aristocracy

398
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,407
doesn't need me to join
for its reign to continue.

399
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:20,461
The Crown Prince will be returning.

400
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,842
So,

401
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,512
if you don't want any of them around him…

402
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,058
you go stand by his side.

403
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,229
Do not hide.

404
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,982
And climb the ladder, you brat!

405
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,281
My grandson…

406
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,134
And Tae-seo?

407
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,927
What happened to Tae-seo?

408
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,978
My silver!

409
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,938
God damn it!

410
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,747
Tae-seo.

411
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,336
Is this an escape route?

412
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,090
What a sneaky bastard,
building all this in secret.

413
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,218
Is there anything else?

414
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,305
It's not even yours.
It's none of your concern.

415
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,348
It is mine.

416
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,852
You used our family name
to line your pockets behind the scenes.

417
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,936
So that makes it mine.

418
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,688
Crazy bastard.

419
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,648
Father told me…

420
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,569
everything that's yours is mine.

421
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,783
What?

422
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,329
Even your life.

423
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,663
Did you know?

424
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,916
Father told me…

425
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,460
to kill you.

426
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,673
So even your life is mine.

427
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,468
Do you understand, Tae-seo?

428
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,435
So why did you let things come to this?

429
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,147
If you had taken care of the inspector
and given up the silver mine sooner,

430
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,108
I wouldn't need to go this far.

431
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,581
That's why you should've done better.

432
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,918
If you did, I wouldn't have
gone this far, either.

433
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,508
They're over there! Get them!

434
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,600
That little… Damn it!

435
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,526
I don't know where he ran off to,
but he disappeared.

436
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,778
That damn rat!

437
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:01,617
Then, Tae-seo's hideout
has been completely blown up?

438
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,035
Yes.

439
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,330
Who knew he was mining silver
up in the mountains?

440
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,375
Damn it.

441
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,295
Everything blew up before my very eyes.

442
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,005
Seriously, such a waste.

443
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,674
How could Tae-seo be so reckless…

444
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,093
He wasn't being reckless,

445
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,970
he was always that sneaky.

446
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,931
If he can't have it, nobody can.

447
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,767
He'd rather destroy it all.
That's the kind of punk he is.

448
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,645
There isn't a more spiteful punk
under the sun.

449
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:36,235
Setting a trap with all that gunpowder
to blow up the whole mine…

450
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,072
How could he burn down his own reserves?

451
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,617
That damn idiot.

452
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,213
How did you get in here?

453
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,220
What…

454
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,687
What do you think you're doing?

455
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,358
How dare you draw a sword in here?

456
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,318
You…

457
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,612
You must have finally gone mad.

458
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,865
You told him to kill me.

459
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,164
Is that true, Father?

460
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,630
I heard that the mine collapsed.

461
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,299
With all that going on,
you must have misheard.

462
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:45,096
After all, you've always had
quite the inferiority complex.

463
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,516
Calm down.

464
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,977
Let's talk, just you and me.

465
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,354
Without Do-soo.

466
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,023
You wait outside.

467
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,424
Our family registry…

468
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,760
You…

469
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,471
I know you're scum,

470
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,141
but how dare you rip our family registry?

471
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,154
Talk about impertinence
towards your sense of duty.

472
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,699
When the king was enthroned,
our family was honored,

473
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,744
and has produced ministers and officers
over three generations.

474
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:54,415
How dare a mongrel like you walk in here
and damage these records!

475
00:38:55,166 --> 00:39:00,254
A crazy bastard who lacks
filial piety, integrity, and pedigree!

476
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,693
Let go of me!

477
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,794
If you're done…

478
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,633
allow me to say a few words.

479
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,137
I was always loyal to you,

480
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,474
but you never acknowledged me.

481
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,686
I thought it was due to my shortcomings
and came to resent myself.

482
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,900
I've lived in the outskirts,
fearing I might disgrace the family name.

483
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,362
Carrying out your orders,
every day and night, all four seasons,

484
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,280
I wasn't able to look after myself.

485
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,325
However,

486
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:15,204
the wounds and bruises
that I've accumulated have turned to dust.

487
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:20,084
I have even lost the mine
I've devoted my whole life to.

488
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,298
And you are blaming me even for that?

489
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,053
What more…

490
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,056
What more!

491
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,893
What more

492
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,813
should I do for you?

493
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,568
Have you gone mad?

494
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,741
Did you eat something rotten?

495
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,411
Or are you that desperate to die?

496
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,581
Look here! Is there anyone out there--

497
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,169
And you, stop laying a hand on me.

498
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,212
As you must know,

499
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,883
I haven't killed you
because I chose not to.

500
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,511
Do-soo!

501
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,864
I don't know what has possessed you,

502
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,744
but it seems that
you have chosen your path.

503
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,872
That was decided the day I was born.

504
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,958
It's just that
I've come to terms with it now.

505
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,463
You got caught
trying to secretly line your pockets

506
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,132
and deserve to die.

507
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,342
Yet here you are,

508
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:55,930
lashing out at us
as if you had a moment of introspection.

509
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,976
Don't you know

510
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,396
I haven't killed you

511
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,608
because I chose not to?

512
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:13,447
Doing away with a punk like you
is nothing for a family like ours.

513
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,617
However, if our family
disappears from your life,

514
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,621
it'll surely be
a great inconvenience for you.

515
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,211
Just wait and see.

516
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,131
You will die soon enough,

517
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,134
and you will remember this day

518
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,721
and cry tears of blood.

519
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,299
I wish you…

520
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,138
health and happiness.

521
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,198
SOYANG

522
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,033
Let's just part ways here.

523
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,035
It's time to let him go.

524
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,331
No one can escape death.

525
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,543
People say ashes to ashes
when talking about death for a reason.

526
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,879
In a way,

527
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:38,842
life is just a journey to death.

528
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,221
Until we arrive at death,

529
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,556
we have no choice but to live.

530
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:53,148
I wonder if Yook-chil and Gu-pal
have arrived safely.

531
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,068
I'm sure they have.

532
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,945
I'm sure

533
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,155
they're holding the funeral now.

534
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:07,746
My lord, have you arrived safely as well?

535
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,839
Park Tae-seo.

536
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,466
Tae-seo.

537
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,638
If he's filled with that much malice,

538
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:29,184
I'm sure he will cause trouble,
and very soon at that.

539
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,770
We must take care of him.

540
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,108
Now that the inspector's dead,

541
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,735
our Tae-seo is useless.

542
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,240
We do have one more use for him.

543
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,831
That deed

544
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,375
you committed.

545
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,587
We need someone to take the fall for it.

546
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:06,388
You go and check
if the inspector is really dead.

547
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,140
But the entire mountain collapsed.

548
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:10,184
He's dead.

549
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,645
We can't underestimate
the inspector's family.

550
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,772
His late father

551
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:19,526
was a prominent figure
of the Southerners and a royal tutor.

552
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,447
The inspector might just be a small fry,

553
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,740
but his grandmother

554
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:29,953
is the head of the most influential
noble family in Gunamgugye, Hoehyeon.

555
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,333
If that inspector is really dead,

556
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,169
that whole region
should be in complete chaos by now.

557
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,464
You must go and confirm.

558
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,898
Lord Chief Scholar!

559
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:58,941
My lord!

560
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,984
Lord Chief Scholar!

561
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,444
My lord!

562
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,739
Have you heard the news?

563
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:06,990
My goodness.

564
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,160
Behave yourself.
You are at the Office of Special Advisors.

565
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,996
At Gunam-gu,

566
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,165
I just saw a bier being carried in.

567
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:19,002
I heard people whispering
that the body was mangled.

568
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,881
The discussion will be held soon,
yet a government official went around

569
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,925
watching other people's tragedies?

570
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,471
So, what are you trying to say?

571
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,100
What I was trying to tell you is…

572
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,602
The deceased

573
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:38,480
was the one dispatched for inspections.

574
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,233
Our Hongmungwan official.

575
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,115
That's not possible.

576
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,617
This report only arrived a few days ago.

577
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,411
How could he be dead?

578
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,787
Go and check again!

579
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,623
While he was searching
the hideout of felony suspects

580
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,292
in Left Chungcheong Province,

581
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,876
a mine collapsed.

582
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,673
And he was crushed to death.

583
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,477
REPORT FROM RA YI-EON

584
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,692
He's dead as I said.

585
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,874
-Maybe this was an unnatural death?
-Exactly.

586
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,751
I bet it was an unnatural death.

587
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,420
How could something like this
happen to their only son?

588
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,256
-He was so young.
-Exactly.

589
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,552
What an unexpected misfortune!

590
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:52,971
Let's get going.

591
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,057
Are you sure?

592
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,602
I'm sure. I saw it with my own two eyes.

593
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,361
FUNERAL

594
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,959
Young Master.

595
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,128
We'll now move you to the carrier

596
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,214
that will take you to your grave.

597
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,467
May you rest in peace.

598
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,346
We bid you farewell.

599
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,131
Before you carry out the coffin,

600
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,510
return this to the palace.

601
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,512
But my lady,

602
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,974
this was from when he was
placed first in the state exams.

603
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,226
Honor and glory…

604
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,313
What's the point of all that now?

605
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,315
They say…

606
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,110
that life is no different

607
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,696
from preparing a meal.

608
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,219
Go on.

609
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,764
I'll prepare a meal.

610
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,810
I'm sure…

611
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,690
you haven't eaten properly for a while.

612
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,413
I am so sorry, my lady.

613
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,708
I am so sorry.

614
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,847
Here comes His Majesty the King!

615
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:46,019
Did you really have to
call me out at this late hour?

616
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,943
I mean,
the palace isn't your reception room.

617
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,737
I am much too tired today.

618
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,949
You can tell me
during the discussion tomorrow

619
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,325
or try again next year.

620
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,326
Your Majesty,

621
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,539
we've received some troubling news,
so we've gathered in a haste.

622
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,834
How do we receive troubling news

623
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,378
every day without fail?

624
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,257
Go ahead.

625
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,883
A busuchan of Hongmungwan,

626
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,221
dispatched to Left Chungcheong Province
as a secret royal inspector

627
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,515
to carry out orders from Your Majesty,

628
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,475
has died in an accident.

629
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:41,783
How is it possible

630
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:45,495
that we haven't had a single
secret royal inspector return alive?

631
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,957
That is the major issue.

632
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,669
Officials of the Three Offices,

633
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,548
who were supposed to fulfill their duties
and repay your kindness,

634
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,637
have proven to be incompetent
by the royal inspectors' deaths.

635
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:06,433
We can't say they have fulfilled
their duties properly as your subjects.

636
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,102
I hope Your Majesty will be just.

637
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,980
He does not fear your royal orders

638
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,065
and has made a mockery of the royal court.

639
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,569
Yet, instead of paying for
what he did wrong and leaving the Capital,

640
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:21,281
he has shamelessly been staying
in his position for his own sake.

641
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,241
Chief Scholar of Hongmungwan,
Sim Tae-seon.

642
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:31,750
I ask that you remove him from office
and punish him severely.

643
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,455
I am Ra Yi-eon, a busuchan of Hongmungwan.

644
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,048
I have returned after my inspection
in Left Chungcheong Province.

645
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,184
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

646
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,825
SPECIAL THANKS TO JO KWAN-WOO

647
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,956
I have a feeling
something good will happen today.

648
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,375
Will this symbol be enough to find her?

649
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,295
-We're looking for a woman named Turukson.
-I'll take you there.

650
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,881
Remember. If we ever get separated…

651
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,884
In life, there are times
you must make a choice.

652
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:34,052
Mom…

653
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,596
I was murdered.

654
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,598
We should go. We have to go.

655
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,059
We even see ghosts now.

656
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,311
I'm sure something good

657
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,855
will happen this time.

658
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:51,069
