1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,772
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:26,044
Seaweed must be rubbed
and rinsed until bubbles rise

4
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,463
to remove the bitter taste.

5
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,590
Especially for chilled dishes

6
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,717
that you consume
without cooking over a fire.

7
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,095
If it's not prepared properly,
the seaweed will be too slippery

8
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,057
and the texture will be ruined,
so you must be careful.

9
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,850
-Young Master!
-Sir Yi-eon!

10
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,896
This is no time for you
to be washing seaweed!

11
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,272
It's time to go to work.

12
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,316
The new chief canes you when you're late.

13
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,527
I'll get going!

14
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,487
Young Master! Your lunch.

15
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,074
-Young Master, your clothes!
-You must wear your uniform!

16
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,117
Sir!

17
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,082
Young Master, your robe. Your robe!

18
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,668
Sir, you need to put on your robe
before going to work!

19
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,461
-Your robe!
-Put your clothes on!

20
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,921
Your robe!

21
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,487
I shall have dumplings for dinner tonight.

22
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,030
Dumplings or whatever.

23
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,824
Don't forget your headdress.

24
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,285
-Sir! Hurry!
-Hey!

25
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,203
Get in there!

26
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,790
Hold on!

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,378
Young Master, your headdress!

28
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:05,560
HONGMUNGWAN

29
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,589
Time for your lunch!

30
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,758
Mealtime!

31
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,524
Our lunch is in there.

32
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,818
-Let's go.
-Let's.

33
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,952
Wait… Hold on.

34
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,124
I told you not to forget about me.

35
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,545
I'll be charging you starting today.

36
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,050
You shouldn't enjoy
the fruits of one's labor for free.

37
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:24,472
To make it to work on time,
I need to wake up two hours early.

38
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,390
Exactly.

39
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,642
Why don't you have a maid do it?

40
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,394
Or just get married.

41
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,895
My palate

42
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,481
can only be satisfied
by the touch of my hands.

43
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,567
-My goodness.
-My word.

44
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,319
Oh, my.

45
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,740
-Seriously…
-So beautiful.

46
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,369
-We should eat this, right?
-Of course.

47
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,787
Hold on, I feel dizzy.

48
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,921
I'll give you two dae of rice
and five hop of beans next month.

49
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,007
-I'll do the same.
-Me, too.

50
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,012
Today's lunch will cost you

51
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,139
buckwheat flour from Jeju,
ginger from Wanju,

52
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,807
or the meat of a pheasant.

53
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,810
Isn't that too much?

54
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,187
They drastically reduced
our stipend recently.

55
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,774
But you're receiving
more bribes from the middlemen.

56
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,026
You little…

57
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,403
You might not know this
since you're a newbie--

58
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,240
Listen, how will we maintain our dignity
if we don't have that much side income?

59
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,034
I could introduce you to a middleman.

60
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,035
That's fine.

61
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,202
I'm just interested

62
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,788
in acquiring ingredients
on par with my culinary skills.

63
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,373
None of that interests me at all.

64
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,979
I'm thinking about making taro soup
and braised chicken for tomorrow's lunch.

65
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,690
Although I'm not sure
if you're interested.

66
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,907
I am. I'm interested.

67
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,659
-Very much so.
-Me too.

68
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,828
-You heard the man.
-I did.

69
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,414
-Jeju buckwheat flour.
-Ginger and pheasant.

70
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,834
I can even get you
the chief scholar position!

71
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,772
-What?
-Hey, what are you doing?

72
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,942
Isn't he Chil-bok who went on
the secret mission in Gyeonggi?

73
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,528
Sir Eungyo?

74
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,613
EUNGYO: SENIOR FOURTH RANK IN HONGMUNGWAN

75
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,616
How is it that every time
a secret royal inspector is dispatched,

76
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,243
they return in such a state?

77
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,121
He managed to come back alive at least.

78
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,957
Wait, did someone return dead?

79
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,835
They have to march along
a thousand-mile, rugged mountain road

80
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,419
with barely anything to eat.

81
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,046
No one can guarantee their safety.

82
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,132
Yes, you're right.

83
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,218
Inspector Park Moo-kyung
who went to Chungcheong…

84
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,638
They don't know if he's dead or alive.
No one has heard from him.

85
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,391
-When did that happen?
-Still no word?

86
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,393
What do you know exactly?

87
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,187
-Stop stuffing your face.
-How is there still no word?

88
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,730
So…

89
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,526
The moment you're appointed
as a secret royal inspector,

90
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,947
your life is as good as over.

91
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,116
So you should also be careful…

92
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,534
Hello?

93
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,660
Where did he go…

94
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,080
Hey! You shouldn't walk away
when someone is talking to you.

95
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,667
It doesn't concern
a newcomer like me, anyway.

96
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,128
What's the point of worrying about it?

97
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,382
Look at that rude bastard.
How could he be so cold…

98
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,427
If he weren't good at cooking,
I'd smack him in the head.

99
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,850
But punks like him always
pass the state examination first

100
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,978
and get to avoid the difficult positions.

101
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,771
That damn bastard…

102
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,234
It's nothing. We're just saying goodbye.

103
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,903
By the way,

104
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,031
since Sir Eungyo returned
without finishing his term,

105
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,491
will the lots be drawn again?

106
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,787
Hold on…

107
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:18,247
Will they be drawn again?

108
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,073
Your Majesty, I have something to report.

109
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,076
We'll soon…

110
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,579
have to draw lots
for another secret royal inspector.

111
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,997
It's regarding that matter.

112
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,040
What about it?

113
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,087
Hongmungwan can just choose anyone
and dispatch them again.

114
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,425
However, the last inspector

115
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,636
happened to go to Chungcheong

116
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,516
and it ended up causing
a minor issue for me.

117
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,102
You should've gone easy
with the extortion.

118
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,020
I might be the King,

119
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,982
but I can't back you up forever.

120
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,942
Don't be too greedy.

121
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,528
Yes, Your Majesty.

122
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,739
-So in regards to the regional drawing…
-Which region do you prefer?

123
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,451
Any place that's not in the south.
Especially not Chungcheong Province.

124
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,914
Your Majesty, the chief scholar
requests an audience with you.

125
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,631
Why do you come by every time?

126
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,801
The chief state councilor and I
can just do the regional draw.

127
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,138
Do you plan on selecting the region today?

128
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,600
I just came to submit
the Hongmungwan scholar's report

129
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,936
who just returned
from his dispatch duties.

130
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,481
Then you can just hand me the report
and be on your way--

131
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,985
Since I'm already here, please allow me
to assist you with the drawing.

132
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:15,281
I actually just stopped by Hongmungwan
to let them know about the inspector draw.

133
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,907
To quell your concern,

134
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,745
we should be able to dispatch
a new inspector tonight.

135
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,539
Go ahead then, Chief Scholar.

136
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,521
LEFT CHUNGCHEONG PROVINCE

137
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,326
I, Kim Jo-yi, wife of Noh Chu-han,
from Gaehwa Valley,

138
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,286
Left Chungcheong Province,

139
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,498
hereby request a divorce,
according to The Great Ming Code.

140
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,126
According to The Great Ming Code,

141
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,796
a divorce must be granted
if the couple requests it.

142
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,548
I implore you to properly review the laws

143
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,134
to make a judgment
on the objection to this marriage.

144
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,556
Why don't you just make up?
Do you really have to get a divorce?

145
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,810
Yes, I must.

146
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,230
At 21, I was married off
to a man I'd never met.

147
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,856
I've turned 24 this year.

148
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,526
The last three years
were infuriating enough.

149
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,486
Rather than wasting the next 30 years.

150
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,154
I want to live the rest of my life

151
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,407
not as the wife of Noh Chu-han,

152
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,866
but as Kim Jo-yi.

153
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,371
Look, she does seem
to be a very tiresome woman.

154
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,164
Why don't you just divorce her?

155
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,833
Sir, I'm…

156
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,959
Objection!

157
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,629
I will not allow that!

158
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,234
Sir, I'm the one that's furious,
the one that has been wronged.

159
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,571
See if you can find a mother-in-law
that has treated her daughter-in-law

160
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,282
as well as I have.

161
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,784
Did I starve her?

162
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,203
Did I not let her sleep?

163
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,623
She had three warm meals every day.

164
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,625
I was the one who prepared them.

165
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,337
-With freshly made kimchi.
-I was the one who made it every time.

166
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,091
I provided her
with seasonal greens and vegetables.

167
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,218
I did all the farmwork.

168
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:45,014
I made sure she ate warm rice,
always on time.

169
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,099
Who do you think sets
that table every time?

170
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:50,519
See? She talks back every chance she gets.

171
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,979
I'm just explaining.

172
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,772
Despite all this,

173
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:58,777
I always treated my daughter-in-law
as if she were my very own.

174
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,821
She never had a daughter.

175
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,660
I never laid a finger on her.

176
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,331
I might have grabbed her hair a few times…

177
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,461
A mother-in-law abusing
someone else's daughter

178
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,046
is nothing to brag about.

179
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,591
How dare a woman's voice be loud
enough to be heard over the wall?

180
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,719
Isn't it the daughter-in-law's duty
to look after her mother-in-law?

181
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,846
Why you crazy woman…

182
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,181
Silence!

183
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,142
Marriage is a major event
in a person's life.

184
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,437
I'm sure you know a divorce
won't be granted for such trivial reasons.

185
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,483
-Yes, sir.
-Then you must also be aware

186
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,276
that wrongfully demanding a divorce

187
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,029
will get you flogged 80 times.

188
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,869
Yes, I am, sir.

189
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,830
Then explain in detail
why you wish for a divorce.

190
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,127
From the start,

191
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,047
I never wanted this marriage.

192
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,258
Sir, from the start, Jo-yi--

193
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,220
That's a crock of horse crap.

194
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,805
Mother, let me speak…

195
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:12,017
This marriage was held
with blessings from both families.

196
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,145
How can she say that
she didn't want it from the start?

197
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,064
Sir, this is my petition.

198
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,358
-Hey!
-Jang Pat-soon, stay out of it.

199
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,487
Furthermore,

200
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,906
I have a name and it's Kim Jo-yi.

201
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,742
But since I got married,
I've only been called

202
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,246
this wench, that wench,
damn wench, rotten wench, and so on.

203
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,832
I've never once been called by my name.

204
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,251
That rotten…

205
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,712
Why does she even need a name?

206
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,297
She's not a kisaeng or anything.

207
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,512
That matter is also trivial.

208
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,558
I mean, look at how
slovenly she dresses herself.

209
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,730
I'm so embarrassed,
I can't hold my head up in this town.

210
00:14:59,064 --> 00:14:59,940
Sir.

211
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,610
Please take into consideration
all the work women do.

212
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,030
And if slightly altering
my clothes to make them

213
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,741
a little bit easier to work in
was such an embarrassment,

214
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,201
why did all these women here

215
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,413
ask me to alter their clothes too?

216
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,206
-These are so convenient.
-Definitely.

217
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,044
You resort to shaming her for her talent
because you've got nothing else?

218
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,962
-Shameful.
-How shameful.

219
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,008
That's not all.

220
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,929
I have not been treated
like a mother-in-law.

221
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,560
And it's happened more than once or twice!

222
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,313
Mother.

223
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,067
It's past lunchtime, are you not hungry?

224
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,485
I'm sleeping.

225
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,199
I have already set the table,
so you can eat when you're hungry.

226
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,742
I'll be stepping out for a bit--

227
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,244
Where are you going?

228
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,998
The lunch is ready.
Would you like to eat now?

229
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,083
What about Chu-han?

230
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,627
Did you give him lunch?

231
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,964
Yes, he ate earlier and went off
to see the traveling entertainers.

232
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,007
Did he now?

233
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,676
And what about you? Did you eat?

234
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,683
Of course not.

235
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,352
How could I when you haven't?

236
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,605
And because you gave me your leftovers
to finish during breakfast,

237
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,190
I ended up getting indigestion.

238
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,527
A woman shouldn't
have such a weak stomach.

239
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,906
Then, I'm going to take a nap.
Bring me my lunch later.

240
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,285
The table is all set.
You can eat whenever you want to, I'm…

241
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,205
What are you going on about?

242
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,374
You expect me to eat cold food?

243
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,712
The truth is,

244
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,173
I heard that my mother came back home.

245
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,718
I just wanted to go
and see her for a moment.

246
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,553
What?

247
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,681
As if being dragged away to Qing
is anything to be proud of.

248
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,975
You should be just lying low right now.

249
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,436
Are you trying to announce it
to the whole town?

250
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,313
"My mother went to Qing
and now she's back!"

251
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,401
My mother is not a criminal.

252
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,321
We failed to protect her,
so we should be ashamed,

253
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,240
not my mother who got dragged away.

254
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,909
Shameless, just like her mother.

255
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,620
Like mother, like daughter.

256
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,750
Anyway, I don't feel
like eating right now.

257
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,293
Just set another table later!

258
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,090
The table is set, so if you're hungry,
just fill your own bowl of rice.

259
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,842
What? Fill my own bowl?

260
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,093
That damn wench…

261
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,096
That damn wench is trying
to starve her mother-in-law!

262
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,225
She told me to fill my bowl!
Fill my own bowl!

263
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:42,728
Is she serious?

264
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,022
She asked her mother-in-law
to fill her own bowl?

265
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:48,692
She must have lost her mind.
That Jo-yi is really something.

266
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,613
Do you know when I last saw my family
since I got married?

267
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,782
My mother is alive!

268
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,534
I couldn't be there for my mother
when she passed away

269
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,454
because I had to prepare
the rites for my husband's ancestor.

270
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,456
It's all right.

271
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,585
Sir. That insolent brat…

272
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,133
My kind son Chu-han
is willing to live with her

273
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,969
for the rest of his life
because she's his wife.

274
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,388
She is clueless about her wrongdoings

275
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,724
and has brought shame on our town,

276
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:25,145
but I'm willing to teach her well
and kindly take her in.

277
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,688
We're very sorry

278
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:32,486
for causing you unnecessary concern.

279
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,697
Unbelievable.

280
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,954
Are you aware that kind son of yours

281
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,083
has been frequenting a jamojeon
to pay off his gambling debt?

282
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,501
JAMOJEON: LOAN SHARK

283
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,256
-He's the scum of the earth.
-Gambling is hopeless.

284
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,967
What sort of gibberish is that?

285
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,970
What did you say? My Chu-han gambled?

286
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,430
He gambled. He did.

287
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,765
No, he didn't!

288
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,852
Noh Chu-han, have you ever gambled?

289
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,021
No, I have not.

290
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,649
No, never.

291
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,949
Request a witness.

292
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,037
Does the plaintiff have a witness?

293
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,208
Yes. I'm sure one of these men here
knows that it's true.

294
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,008
I don't even know what that word means.

295
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,762
If you want a divorce,

296
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,890
bring either proof or a witness.

297
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,518
Witness? What witness?

298
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,022
If your accusation turns out to be false,
you will be flogged.

299
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,569
Poor Jo-yi.

300
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,541
You have no choice
but to crawl back home now.

301
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,462
If you don't want to be flogged,
scurry back home and make dinner.

302
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,006
Chu-han!

303
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,507
-Yes, mother.
-Let's go.

304
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,261
Goodness.

305
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,160
Welcome, sir.

306
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,846
Welcome, sir.

307
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,559
We have pork and chicken.

308
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,144
-I'll take the pork.
-Yes, sir.

309
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,245
Pheasant, buckwheat flour from Jeju,
ginger from Wanju.

310
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,247
They are quick.

311
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,752
Yook-chil.

312
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,754
Done with work, Young Master?

313
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,699
You frequent the kitchen
more than the outhouse.

314
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,951
If Madam finds out about this,

315
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,078
we will be punished.

316
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,122
If I have to give up
either my palate or your buttocks,

317
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,957
it will be the latter, of course.

318
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,085
You cook so well.

319
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:02,547
Whoever you marry,
she's going to have a happy, easy life.

320
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,091
It won't happen soon, though.

321
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,135
Marriage leading to
an easy life is all nonsense.

322
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,848
The number of elders to serve will double.
And if there's a child?

323
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,642
I'll have to take care of them

324
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,602
and tighten my belt.

325
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,480
Who is that marriage for exactly?

326
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,441
Let's eat.

327
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,375
BIOGRAPHY OF PARK

328
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,923
It's nice and lonesome.

329
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,552
BIOGRAPHY OF JEON UCHI
BIOGRAPHY OF HONG GILDONG

330
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,454
Yi-eon.

331
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,630
Now, this is Joseon.

332
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,097
Your Highness!

333
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,064
-Young Master, please wake up!
-You must flee at once.

334
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,984
What about His Highness,
the crown prince? Is he safe?

335
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,411
Anyone home?

336
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,839
Chief Royal Secretary.

337
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,300
It's a royal decree. Prepare to accept.

338
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,862
SECRET ROYAL INSPECTOR

339
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,280
RA YI-EON

340
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,368
I'm sure you know
what the procedure is going forward.

341
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,411
Devote yourself and obey.

342
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,122
Wait. Just a moment, my lord.

343
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,709
Are you sure this royal decree
was issued for me?

344
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,712
-Secret royal inspector?
-Secret royal inspector?

345
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,090
I am the newest member of Hongmungwan.

346
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:54,135
Everyone chosen before you was pardoned.

347
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,303
PARDONED: EXONERATED OF
ONE'S ROYAL DECREE DUTIES

348
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,304
DUE TO ILLNESS, MISHAP, OR OTHER GROUNDS

349
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,099
My apologies,

350
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,725
Chief Royal Secretary.

351
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,519
I have a cold…

352
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:07,190
My lord, my grandfather
suddenly passed away last night.

353
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,193
She's due soon.

354
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,320
Is the baby coming already?

355
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,655
Just hang in there.

356
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,073
Let's get you inside.

357
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,242
You can't give birth here.

358
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:27,877
PARDONED

359
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,129
TO OPEN OUTSIDE THE SOUTH GATE

360
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,715
What? His grandfather passed away?

361
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,926
How could he pass away again
when he already passed away last year?

362
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,721
A cold?

363
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,722
Labor?

364
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,435
What a wide variety of excuses
you all prepared.

365
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,145
They did. They really did!

366
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,481
Excuse me…

367
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:50,984
Young Master.

368
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:53,028
I haven't been feeling well
since yesterday.

369
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,488
What is it? Are you about
to go into labor as well?

370
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,073
Yes, labor.

371
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,413
-What about you?
-Back in my hometown…

372
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:07,500
Back in your hometown, your dog died,
so you need to mourn for three years?

373
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,381
If you don't get ready to leave
in 15 minutes,

374
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,799
you will be eating

375
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,094
rice with doenjang and soy sauce
for every meal from now on, all right?

376
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,935
Put the ingredients at the door,
so the villagers can take them.

377
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,980
Don't worry about that.
Hurry up and open the sealed letter.

378
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:29,939
I'm curious.

379
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,442
Please let it be Gyeonggi!

380
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,154
Right.

381
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,949
I've already been dispatched,
so let it be somewhere close at least.

382
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,534
Gyeonggi Province.

383
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,328
Gyeonggi Province.

384
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:50,293
-Gyeonggi!
-Gyeonggi!

385
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:54,798
-Gyeonggi!
-Gyeonggi!

386
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:55,715
Gyeong…

387
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,601
Chungcheong Province?

388
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,232
Chungcheong Province…

389
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,402
Chungcheong Province…

390
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,322
Chungcheong? How many days will it take?

391
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,117
How can you expect
the higher-ups to like him

392
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,411
when he acts like a jerk all the time?

393
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,123
When I refused to take the state exams

394
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,960
and climb the ladder,
who was it that ran out

395
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:36,005
and brought back a bush clover branch,
so that Grandmother could cane me?

396
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,097
Meanwhile, I believe someone suggested

397
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,892
that she should use an ash tree branch
instead since it was sturdier.

398
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,484
Come to think of it,

399
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,195
without the brilliant services
provided by you two,

400
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,323
I wouldn't be the youngest
secret royal inspector dispatched

401
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,575
here and now.

402
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,373
Come here.

403
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,670
Since it's come to this,

404
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,839
we might as well do
a Chungcheong food tour.

405
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:22,385
I actually have a lot of famous places
I wanted to check out.

406
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,220
But you're an inspector, sir.

407
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,140
You need to inspect and investigate
from time to time.

408
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,349
Forget about it.

409
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,894
Let's not foolishly waste
energy on state affairs

410
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,021
and just explore the local restaurants.

411
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,107
All I need to do is show my face
at the provincial office.

412
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,986
You used to be different
when the Crown Prince was alive.

413
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:42,989
Young Master.

414
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,617
No, Royal Inspector.

415
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,244
We're not walking all night, are we?

416
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,413
Don't just focus on tasty restaurants.

417
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,332
We should stop by a tavern on the way.

418
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,502
Bo-ri,

419
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,086
are you inside?

420
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,672
Hwang Bo-ri!

421
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,816
What are you up to, Bo-ri?

422
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,902
Hey, Jo-yi.

423
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,529
Why are you so surprised?

424
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,868
What is that?

425
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,254
What is this?

426
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,172
Why is an unmarried woman making…

427
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,715
It's not mine.

428
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,634
It's…

429
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,970
Right. Gwi-soon down the road…

430
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:47,887
You half-wit!

431
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,556
You're out of your mind!

432
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,682
That hurts, Jo-yi.

433
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,309
How could you get pregnant at that age?

434
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,103
What are you going to do now?

435
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,020
Hold on.

436
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,814
What sort of bum did you fall for?

437
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,732
He's not a bum! He's not!

438
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,943
Then what?
Is he a magistrate or something?

439
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,945
Yes! I'm carrying the magistrate's baby.

440
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,864
-The magistrate?
-Yes, the magistrate!

441
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,950
I'm sick and tired
of hitting on men to sell wine.

442
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,328
I want to wear nice clothes,
sit in a warm room, and have an easy life.

443
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,955
-That's why. So what?
-Bo-ri, then…

444
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,542
are you going to become his concubine?

445
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,466
Good. Well done.

446
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,260
Love won't feed you any meals.

447
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,554
He's the most powerful man
in Gaehwa Valley.

448
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,056
That's a good way
to turn your life around.

449
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,974
Well done.

450
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,853
-Really?
-I was worried you were pregnant

451
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,398
with some old bum by mistake,
but this is much better.

452
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,860
At least the magistrate's child
won't suffer like this.

453
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,863
Even on the coldest days and hottest ones,

454
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,948
you went through a lot to run this place.

455
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,744
Just look at your hands.

456
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,079
A wooden block would be smoother.

457
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,167
And above all else,

458
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,378
the magistrate won't turn
a blind eye if you're my witness.

459
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:04,672
Witness?

460
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,676
The truth is,

461
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,763
I came to see you today because…

462
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,698
Stop right there.

463
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,784
That fabric is really precious!

464
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,955
Shouldn't you be working?

465
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,374
Keep beating those clothes.

466
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,293
I'm sure he went gambling that day…

467
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,380
You don't remember anything?

468
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,548
You know, it was that night…

469
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,258
The night of the full moon.

470
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,010
You said woodcutters from Gyeongsang

471
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,097
brought with them a sack of silver coins
and set up a gambling den.

472
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,769
I think I did see him
when I brought food to the back room.

473
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,939
Bo-ri, then…

474
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,234
can you testify for me?

475
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,111
-Testify?
-Yes.

476
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,532
Once you become his concubine,
you'll be closing this place down anyway.

477
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,535
If I can prove that he gambled,

478
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,662
I'll be able to get my nabi.

479
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:23,584
NABI: PROOF OF DIVORCE FOR COMMONERS
DURING THE JOSEON DYNASTY

480
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,516
Please, Bo-ri.

481
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,353
Help me fly away freely.

482
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,063
So…

483
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,985
you want me to testify
that your husband gambled here?

484
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:49,902
Yes.

485
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,115
Every man in this town
is on the same side.

486
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,159
No one is coming forward.

487
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,827
Bo-ri.

488
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,412
Please.

489
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,206
But they're all my customers.

490
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,045
Help me escape my fate.

491
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,464
If given the chance,

492
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,467
I would take the state exam
and work as a civil servant like men,

493
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,135
but you know we can't do that.

494
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,473
But blaming my fate
and continuing to live like this

495
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,432
is even worse.

496
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,482
I want to be happy, too.

497
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,444
Can't you do this for me?

498
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,571
Bo-ri?

499
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,489
Please?

500
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,667
Fine.

501
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,629
Of course, I can do that for you.

502
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,506
Don't worry. I'll be your witness.

503
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,674
Thank you, Bo-ri!

504
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,135
Right, your baby.

505
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,474
I didn't hit your belly earlier, did I?

506
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,066
Hwang Bo-ri, you need to keep it together.

507
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,069
You're a mom now.

508
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,320
A mom.

509
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,363
Got that?

510
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,001
POST

511
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,645
He'll go as you pull the reins.

512
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,236
-Perfect landing.
-How do I stop?

513
00:35:57,697 --> 00:36:00,032
-I'm getting the hang of it now.
-Good.

514
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,909
Nice.

515
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,122
How far are you going?

516
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,332
Wait up!

517
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,801
-Sir.
-Giddyup.

518
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,137
Are we never going to eat?

519
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,306
-Sir.
-A Chungcheong delicacy awaits us.

520
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,391
At least the horse had some carrots.

521
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,309
Go.

522
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,733
Sir Yi-eon.

523
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,901
I'm hungry.

524
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,612
Right.

525
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,739
Here.

526
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,450
Go on and eat.

527
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,998
Thick kimchi stew
Simmer, simmer

528
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,292
Here comes the thick kimchi stew

529
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,382
Thick kimchi stew

530
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:03,804
Thick kimchi stew, thick stew
It's thick kimchi stew

531
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:09,810
Here I come to eat the thick kimchi stew

532
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,078
That's refreshing.

533
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,881
What are you doing?

534
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:42,843
Gu-pal, I saw a mill by the town entrance
on our way over here.

535
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,429
I'm going to rob it later.

536
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,597
I'll take the owner

537
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,724
and strike him on the temple
to knock him out.

538
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:49,976
You tie him up.

539
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,186
Yes, let's please do that.

540
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,231
We could have led honest lives
if we had a good master, right?

541
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,234
While traveling 300 ri,
all we had were two balls of rice

542
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,611
and three mouse-sized dates. Is this…

543
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,571
Is this any way for a person to live?

544
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,784
I am so hungry right now
that I cannot walk any further.

545
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,330
Please tell my lord that I must leave him
to be by the heavenly emperor's side…

546
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,332
Gu-pal!

547
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,750
Wake up!

548
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,378
You can't leave me like this.
Wake up, Gu-pal!

549
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,798
Gu-pal!

550
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:21,757
Hey.

551
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,385
We just kept the meals light for two days.

552
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,721
You act like we've been starving
for a few days.

553
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,056
Hunger is the best side dish.

554
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,601
If you want to eat good food,
you should at least show this much effort.

555
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,229
Get up. We're almost there.

556
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,147
I'll feed you.

557
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,898
When will that be?

558
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,109
-In our next lifetimes?
-I told you.

559
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,279
We'll soon arrive
at Chungcheong's most famous eatery,

560
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,364
Bo-ri's Thick Kimchi Stew.

561
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,534
They use a special minced seasoning
made out of dried chili powder.

562
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,703
Aren't you curious how good it tastes?

563
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,457
A stew or a brew,
I'm simply too hungry to walk any further.

564
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,792
Even during that brutal Year of the Rat,

565
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,753
I ate more than this.

566
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,131
I'll allow you to have
double servings of the stew.

567
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,133
That's just a single serving for Gu-pal.

568
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,676
We can't go any further.

569
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,262
Fine.

570
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,307
Double servings of the stew
and boiled pork.

571
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,975
Boiled pork and rice wine.

572
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,689
Fine.

573
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,732
Deal.

574
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,901
Let's go.

575
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,947
Let's go already.

576
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,533
BO-RI'S

577
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,965
TAVERN

578
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,309
What is this?

579
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,479
-This is our lifeline.
-Pardon?

580
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,274
Keep it close by, so we can grab it
and leave at a moment's notice.

581
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,734
Leave?

582
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,528
Why are we leaving?

583
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,615
Just be prepared to leave.

584
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,536
Let's leave it at that.

585
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,751
Bo-ri, you're still up, right?

586
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,170
Jo-yi?

587
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,009
Why are you up at this hour?
Is something wrong?

588
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,558
What's this?

589
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,893
You said you wanted to eat one.

590
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:38,811
Try it.

591
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,606
I did, but…

592
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,109
Where did you get such a precious thing?

593
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,528
I met a peddler from Cheongdo.

594
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:48,988
It was smuggled out.

595
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,325
Wasn't it one of the royal offerings?

596
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,244
For the King?

597
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,997
It's fine.

598
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,624
The nobles do this all the time
to fill their stomachs.

599
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,002
But…

600
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,505
-they're nobles.
-I'm telling you it's fine.

601
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,967
The baby inside is craving it.
I want to do this as their auntie.

602
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,552
Go on and eat up.

603
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,272
It's tasty.

604
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,982
So tasty.

605
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,528
Slow down, or you'll have indigestion.

606
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,206
So…

607
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,333
what's the persimmon like?

608
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,126
I mean,

609
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,546
what's the magistrate like?

610
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,547
Is he a good man?

611
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:50,925
Yes.

612
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,801
I grew up alone,

613
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,221
so I'm attracted to a father figure.

614
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,641
Even so, in my eyes,
you deserve more than him.

615
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,770
What about the baby?
Do you think it's healthy?

616
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,188
Yes.

617
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,315
I can't feel it yet…

618
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,944
but I still feel it.

619
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,695
What?

620
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,197
What does that mean?

621
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,203
Gosh, fine.
As long as the two of you are happy.

622
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,914
I'm off. My mother-in-law
doesn't know I'm out.

623
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:22,998
Already?

624
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:26,126
-You should have a taste too.
-No, I'm fine.

625
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,879
-Good night.
-You've never tried this, either.

626
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,381
Jo-yi!

627
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,340
See you tomorrow!

628
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,346
Let's see it.

629
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,224
Tell her to bring over this witness
she supposedly has.

630
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,393
-Let's see it!
-Let's see it!

631
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,651
Chu-han! Get up!

632
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,822
WITNESS

633
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,616
A maritime chief has appeared
in Gaehwa Valley.

634
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,785
You should give me the ledger.

635
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,584
-I'll make sure to hide it well.
-Sir.

636
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,502
Yes, right…

637
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,129
Where did we leave off?

638
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,840
-Officer.
-Yes, sir.

639
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,262
That's right.

640
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,849
Did you find a witness?

641
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:26,895
Yes, I found someone
that saw Noh Chu-han gamble.

642
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,815
Bring in the witness.

643
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,075
My goodness.

644
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,009
Hold on…

645
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,406
Gaehwa Valley, Left Chungcheong Province.

646
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,079
Do we finally get to eat that stew?

647
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,540
Sir, but…

648
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,628
what if word gets out about a strange man
poking around town?

649
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,214
You said it's dangerous
if your cover is blown.

650
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:36,507
Right.

651
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,301
If it's for your safety,

652
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,304
I'm willing to sacrifice myself.

653
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,421
Bang-deuk, you fool.

654
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,423
Stop acting so carelessly

655
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:20,759
and try to walk calmly,
composedly like me.

656
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:25,055
I may be in disguise for my own safety,
but when we're alone--

657
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,392
You punk!
How dare you speak to our lord like that?

658
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,771
That's enough small talk.

659
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,940
Let's just go and eat.

660
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,650
Bo-ri's Brew or whatever.

661
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,819
Make haste and lead the way.

662
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,612
Bo-ri's Thick Kimchi Stew.

663
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,157
It's over there.
At the edge of the market.

664
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,491
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

665
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,080
Here it is.

666
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:51,373
BO-RI'S

667
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,749
Finally.

668
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,964
What is this?

669
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,091
Closed?

670
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,803
-Look here!
-Closed.

671
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:06,847
-Is anyone in there?
-Closed?

672
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,433
-What's closed?
-Is anyone there?

673
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,604
-Is anyone in there?
-Closed?

674
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,105
-Why?
-Is anyone there?

675
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,691
-We're hungry.
-Hello?

676
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,568
Is anyone in there?

677
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,070
-What on earth…
-What's going on?

678
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,036
What's going on? We can't eat?

679
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,163
You said this place was good.

680
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,380
How dare you stab me in the back?

681
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,966
She must be the owner.

682
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,677
Hurry.

683
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,013
Hey, Hwang Bo-ri!

684
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,768
Hwang Bo-ri, why you…

685
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,772
Look at this.

686
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,572
Look at this brat…

687
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,658
She confidently told me not to worry.

688
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,035
Are you looking for the owner?

689
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,579
She ran away
since I'd kill her if she was caught.

690
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,748
Ran away? Are you saying
the owner ran away?

691
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,792
You got cold feet, didn't you?

692
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,419
You clearly ran in a hurry.

693
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,630
That naive brat is so quick.

694
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,841
She should've
at least given me the evidence.

695
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,094
-Wait…
-That damn brat.

696
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,596
-She saved herself…
-Where is the owner of this place?

697
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,223
Where did you go? Seriously!

698
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,684
Hey, look here!

699
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,478
Someone is talking to you!

700
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,369
Who are these beggars?

701
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,749
Why are you begging here
when the owner isn't home?

702
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,797
-We're not here to beg…
-Get lost!

703
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,261
Hwang Bo-ri, you're dead.

704
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,637
You'll be buried today.

705
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,642
Are you going to the owner?

706
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,185
Will we be able to eat today?

707
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,479
Hey.

708
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,689
Have you seen Bo-ri?

709
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,150
Hwang Bo-ri?

710
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,820
-Where are you going?
-Have you seen Hwang Bo-ri?

711
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,114
Have you seen Bo-ri?

712
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,454
Are you sure you can find this Bo-ri?
Wait, what about the food?

713
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,419
Isn't that a person?

714
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,683
How did she fall in there?

715
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,664
That's Bo-ri.

716
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,714
Bo-ri.

717
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,633
Bo-ri…

718
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,760
Bo-ri, wake up.

719
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,179
Bo-ri.

720
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,015
Let's get out of here.

721
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,402
Bo-ri.

722
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,948
Bo-ri, open your eyes.

723
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,783
Bo-ri.

724
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,121
Bo-ri.

725
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,416
No.

726
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,545
Bo-ri.

727
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,258
How did this happen?

728
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,759
Talk about bad timing.

729
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,345
How did the owner
of the special eatery die suddenly?

730
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,348
The mountain trails are so rough.

731
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,475
Was she trying to take a bath?

732
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,853
Bo-ri.

733
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,771
Bo-ri, wake up.

734
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:27,858
No.

735
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,114
God damn it…

736
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,200
-Drag her out.
-Yes, sir.

737
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,667
Wait.

738
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:46,710
Hold on.

739
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:50,380
Why are you doing this?
Where are you taking her?

740
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,757
It's none of your business.

741
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,384
Bo-ri!

742
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,803
Sir, maybe you should investigate this.

743
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,221
A person has died.

744
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,266
Bo-ri!

745
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,143
But what can be done?

746
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,729
It's unfortunate
that a young woman has died,

747
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,481
but it was clearly an accident.

748
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,234
But this isn't right.

749
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,695
How could they treat the body like that?

750
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:14,654
Bo-ri!

751
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,156
Should I go say something?

752
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,284
You can't. I'm not ready
to let her go yet.

753
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,536
There's no time. Hurry!

754
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,456
-Please let me say goodbye.
-That's enough!

755
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,292
Go easy! Easy!
Don't treat a person like garbage!

756
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,469
Move aside before I beat you.

757
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,305
I know she's of lowly birth,

758
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:44,100
but you can't take her away
without giving us time to mourn.

759
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,352
So?

760
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:50,982
Are you willing to join her
in the afterlife as her friend?

761
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,490
Hurry up!

762
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:22,305
Bo-ri!

763
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,350
Bo-ri!

764
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:27,352
Bo-ri!

765
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,646
My lord!

766
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,190
Bo-ri!

767
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,317
Bo-ri!

768
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:58,216
Seeing how they took the body in,
it seems they'll investigate her death.

769
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,011
That's quite a rough way
to conduct an investigation.

770
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,096
They must be hiding something.

771
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,766
Let us leave now.

772
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,102
-Leave?
-And go where?

773
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,230
Didn't I tell you earlier?

774
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,525
I will not get involved
in government matters

775
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,485
and just explore tasty restaurants.

776
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,573
I can't help
if it's not under my jurisdiction.

777
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,742
I shouldn't get involved.

778
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,165
So the next tasty restaurant…

779
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,875
Chief!

780
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,044
What do we do?

781
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,253
Chief!

782
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,173
Get out of the way!

783
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,762
Open the gate!

784
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,781
Leave?

785
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,865
Why are we leaving?

786
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:13,124
I just followed his orders

787
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:17,379
and took a little bit from the freighter,
just enough to buy a small house for us.

788
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,173
You stole from the freighter?

789
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,716
My lord!

790
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,426
But the inspector ended up…

791
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,976
If we want to run before it's too late,

792
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,852
you must keep this safe.

793
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,772
That is the only way
we can save ourselves!

794
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,066
My lord.

795
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,029
My lord!

796
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,781
The dead inspector…

797
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,450
They found his body on the beach!

798
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,368
What?

799
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,291
Get rid of it!

800
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,544
-Bury her today?
-Yes!

801
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,337
-But protocol…
-What about protocol?

802
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,631
Get rid of it. Burn it. I don't care.

803
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,259
That thing is not the issue right now.

804
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,386
Wait, should I burn her or bury her?

805
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,470
Sir!

806
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,390
Wait, sir. What do you mean, burn her?

807
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,183
Just get rid of it quickly.

808
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,226
Hurry up!

809
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,771
-Go get it. The carrier!
-The carrier.

810
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:32,996
This is just wrong.

811
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,625
I'll say what needs to be said.

812
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,969
My lord, please come out!

813
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,597
I have a desperate plea!

814
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,266
My lord!

815
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,519
My lord!

816
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,147
My lord, please.

817
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,024
Load her up now!

818
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:01,983
Bo-ri!

819
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,531
Go burn it up quickly. Go now!

820
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,909
Burn it? What do you mean?

821
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,329
I will make her a grave
and hold a funeral for her!

822
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,705
Go!

823
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:17,957
My lord!

824
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,086
My lord!

825
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,882
You can't do this!

826
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:26,841
She died today.

827
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:31,805
How could you get rid of her body
without holding a funeral for her?

828
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,352
How could you be so cruel?

829
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,521
Just because she was of lowly birth,

830
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,815
you're going to cremate her
the day of her death?

831
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,942
Move aside!

832
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,112
I'm just doing what I'm told.
What other choice do I have?

833
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,199
Am I not even allowed to get her a shroud?

834
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,201
Please! She was with…

835
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,331
She was with child.

836
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,385
Let's go!

837
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,686
My lord!

838
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,481
How could you do this to Bo-ri?

839
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,317
Let's make haste, sir.

840
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,861
Hey, hurry up!

841
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,136
All of you! Hurry up! Hurry!

842
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,637
Quickly!

843
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,899
Did you hear what she said earlier?

844
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,652
You can't do this!

845
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:10,820
She was with…

846
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,450
She was with child.

847
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,827
She was pregnant.

848
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,954
She had no reason to go up to the valley.

849
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,373
She must have slipped
on a boulder by the valley.

850
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,042
The mountain trails are so rough.

851
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,919
Was she trying to take a bath?

852
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:26,878
A bath…

853
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:28,671
A bath…

854
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,133
-My lord!
-Let's make haste, sir.

855
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,427
How could you do this to Bo-ri?

856
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,807
Never mind.

857
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,352
I shouldn't assume anything
when I know nothing.

858
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:43,853
Let's just go.

859
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,065
All right.

860
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,652
Jeez, it bothers me so much.

861
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,238
Let's just check one thing before we go.
Just one thing.

862
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,916
Park Moo-kyung.

863
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,293
That damn…

864
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,088
Where did you find him?

865
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:15,385
Something hefty got caught in my net.

866
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,762
I pulled it out thinking
that it might be a shark.

867
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,140
He was…

868
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,311
definitely taken care of
with the sunken freighter.

869
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,771
FREIGHTER: BOAT THAT LOADS THE GRAIN TAX

870
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:30,483
This body must have been swept in
with the wind and the rising tide.

871
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,987
But my lord, we still have the ledger.

872
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,615
We should be fine as long
as we take care of this body.

873
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,535
The ledger.

874
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,746
You must keep this safe.

875
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,915
That is the only way
we can save ourselves!

876
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:46,833
My lord.

877
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:48,626
Damn it!

878
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:54,007
You must know where it's hidden.

879
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,178
I was in a rush,
so I didn't get a chance to hear…

880
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,644
Let's move it first.
People can't see this.

881
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:10,148
What are you doing? Lift it up! Move it!

882
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,650
-Move it!
-If I were you,

883
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,194
I'd keep my mouth shut to stay alive.

884
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:16,821
Of course, my lord!

885
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:20,908
Hurry!

886
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,663
Hurry up! Move it!

887
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,633
Quickly!

888
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,386
Move aside!

889
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,723
Bow down!

890
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,068
Hurry!

891
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,552
Come!

892
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,315
Come!

893
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,789
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

894
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,846
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE JUN-HYUK,
SONG JONG-HO, AND JO KWAN-WOO

895
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:52,018
Where is the ledger? Tell me!

896
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,103
So there are no personal effects left now?

897
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,730
Bang-deuk, this is no place
for you to meddle.

898
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,148
-Hey!
-What?

899
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,192
Oh, my! Look at this kid!

900
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,277
How could he not take care
of a single secret royal inspector?

901
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,779
Rip him or skin him to death…

902
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,280
What I need is the ledger.

903
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:07,408
Could someone have murdered her
and disguised it as an accident?

904
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,578
-Be careful.
-This belongs to the government office.

905
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,830
Can I sue my husband and mother-in-law?

906
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:15,208
-Secret royal inspector
-Secret royal inspector

907
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,876
I will handle this case from now on.

908
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:21,631
