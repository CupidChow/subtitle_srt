1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,049
I'll use this.

4
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,385
What are you doing?

5
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,678
Go and grab the sword.

6
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,847
Grab the sword. The sword!

7
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,765
My lord.

8
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,225
My lord. The sword.

9
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,916
You brought this upon yourself.
Do not resent me.

10
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,751
Stop!

11
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,170
He is a secret royal inspector!

12
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,217
So?

13
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,552
What about it?

14
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,306
He is a secret royal inspector.

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,225
So what?

16
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,560
Keep going.

17
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,481
This worked out.

18
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,658
Good. Our lord grabbed the sword.

19
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,867
He's done for.

20
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,630
That's not the same as a knife.

21
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,508
All blades are the same.

22
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,054
If you want to protect something precious,

23
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,768
you must be prepared
to do whatever it takes.

24
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,521
A day will come

25
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,732
when you will have to wield
a real sword instead of a wooden one

26
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,986
to protect yourself
and the things precious to you.

27
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:44,182
Don't disappoint your father.

28
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,518
My son.

29
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,496
What a shame.

30
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,669
I thought I was going
to see a head fly off today.

31
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,003
That was lame.

32
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,673
What are you doing?

33
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,926
You promised the loser would
accept defeat without objection!

34
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:20,927
Promise?

35
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,638
Tae-seo did. I didn't.

36
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,269
What are you all doing?

37
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,437
Do not move!

38
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,400
Take care of that easy girl first.

39
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,196
Big Eyes, you…

40
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,079
Don't you think your late mother

41
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,291
would be sad
seeing you live like a rascal?

42
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,880
How did you know
my mother used to call me Big Eyes?

43
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,802
I'm sure when you were younger,
you were a kind boy

44
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:07,598
who suited the nickname Big Eyes, right?

45
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,226
Mother…

46
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,854
For the sake of your mother
who raised you,

47
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,315
you must live a good life.

48
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,366
Now, call your men off.

49
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,536
And put down the knife.

50
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,456
I don't want to.

51
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,709
Do you think

52
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,878
my mother just cherished me?

53
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,132
The sweet, naive Big Eyes

54
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,801
died alongside his mother.

55
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,888
I'm Mal-jong now. Mal-jong!

56
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,223
What are you doing? Get them!

57
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,894
Are the backup forces not coming?

58
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,730
Why are you only doing this to me?

59
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,524
Never speak unless absolutely necessary.

60
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,276
Shoot!

61
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,294
What is all this…

62
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,723
The secret royal inspector has appeared!

63
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,851
He finally appears!

64
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,311
He's finally here!

65
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,399
The government workers
are always one step behind.

66
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,776
-That's how it always was.
-He's finally here!

67
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,078
Brother.

68
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,294
Bring in the culprits!

69
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,510
Mal-jong,

70
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,180
I'll deal with them, so just stay put.

71
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,599
Fine.

72
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,768
Listen well,
Cha Mal-jong and Park Tae-seo.

73
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,938
You not only broke the laws

74
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,691
by producing moonshine
to share amongst yourselves,

75
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,528
but you also abused your power
to enslave people for personal use.

76
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,238
They are serious crimes.

77
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,448
You will be punished

78
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,534
according to the Article
on Kidnapping or Selling Persons.

79
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:18,122
Breaking the law to gather
and drink was undeniably wrong.

80
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,210
However, how is taking in homeless,
starving women to feed and clothe them

81
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,545
considered a violation of such an article?

82
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,340
Furthermore, there's a policy
that allows orphans

83
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,926
to be legally fostered
or taken in as slaves

84
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,010
after they turn ten.

85
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
Only qualified people are allowed…

86
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,891
to take in the children.

87
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,895
You should ask the Relief Agency
about our qualifications.

88
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,272
I have written approval
from the Relief Agency.

89
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,702
Then how will you explain
the crime of attacking me

90
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,206
even after I revealed
that I was a secret royal inspector?

91
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,544
There have been so many punks
impersonating one recently.

92
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,548
You can't believe anyone
until you see the horse plaque.

93
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,260
Besides, you attacked Tae-seo

94
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,595
with your excellent swordsmanship.

95
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,930
Then I will question you

96
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,349
about murdering an inspector
and covering it up.

97
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,268
What?

98
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:23,688
Another inspector was dispatched
after we took care of the other one?

99
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,773
-Don't kill him. Capture him.
-Why?

100
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,400
What are you going to do with him?

101
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,527
I need to find out
how much he's dug up first.

102
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,237
We can kill him afterward.

103
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,699
I guess we carried our jokes too far
since we're such old friends.

104
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,952
It's not like an inspector
is some stray dog.

105
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,705
Murder? My goodness.

106
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,040
A joke?

107
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,501
Of course, we shouldn't
even have joked about it.

108
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:49,714
Therefore, I'll accept the punishment
for insulting a government official.

109
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,966
But if you wish
to discuss a murder charge,

110
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,552
you will need
conclusive evidence to prove it.

111
00:09:59,015 --> 00:09:59,974
You're right.

112
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,312
I can't punish you without evidence
just because you seem suspicious.

113
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,981
I find Park Tae-seo
and Cha Mal-jong suspicious,

114
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,401
but due to a lack of evidence,
we cannot say they are guilty.

115
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,361
However…

116
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,575
because murder is a serious crime,
I cannot release you immediately.

117
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,828
I'll investigate thoroughly
and uncover the truth,

118
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,165
and then decide what to do with you.

119
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,209
Transfer the suspects to the Uigeumbu!

120
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,919
-Yes, sir.
-What?

121
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,087
Uigeumbu?

122
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,797
They're transferring us to Hanyang?

123
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,009
Isn't it serious enough
to sentence them immediately?

124
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,845
I think it'd be best
to imprison them right now.

125
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,348
I do not like the look in his eyes.

126
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,936
It'd be best for you to end it here.

127
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,524
I haven't even gotten started yet.

128
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,033
It's yok-geum-go-jong.

129
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,080
I intentionally cut them loose
to catch a bigger fish.

130
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,291
You need good bait to catch a big fish.

131
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,671
I'm sure this is related to aconite.

132
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,841
Find out all you can about Park Tae-seo.

133
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,051
Yes, sir.

134
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,556
You don't have to hide anymore, come out!

135
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,725
It's safe so you can all come out now!

136
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,645
Cha Mal-jong and his group were arrested!

137
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,065
A secret royal inspector
arrested Cha Mal-jong.

138
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,901
You've been through a lot.

139
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,159
What did I tell you?

140
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,494
I told you not to worry.

141
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,236
Do you all have somewhere to go
once you leave this place?

142
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,200
My lord,

143
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,119
all the women here

144
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,122
are hwanhyangnyeos
that have returned after the war.

145
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,791
And all the children are orphans.

146
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,878
Even if they leave, they'll either
end up back at the Relief Agency

147
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,297
or be sold off as slaves again.

148
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,759
How about you all go
to the provincial office

149
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,596
and wait for your next destination
to be decided?

150
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,559
You're going to send them
to the magistrate?

151
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,770
I know you're an inspector,
but you trust the magistrate too much.

152
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,608
What if the Soyang Trading Group
has connections there too?

153
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,319
You saw how reckless they can be!

154
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,653
A slave with no master

155
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,780
legally belongs to the magistrate.

156
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,492
It's only right they go to him.

157
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:05,993
My lord.

158
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,703
Strictly speaking, the slaves here

159
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,330
are privately-owned slaves.

160
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:13,083
That is to say,
the government does not own them.

161
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,919
Then what do you propose?

162
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,296
Could you have
the remaining station officers

163
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,757
watch over them
while they stay here for a while?

164
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,302
We'd appreciate it
if we could decide our own fate.

165
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,012
Hold on.

166
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,016
We have no intention of going back
to the magistrate or staying here.

167
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,684
Then what do you plan to do?

168
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,604
We'll all take a ship to Gapbigocha.

169
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:38,859
Then neither the magistrate
nor I will be able to protect you.

170
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,402
I'm aware of that,

171
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,197
but we don't want to give up this chance

172
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,282
to live our lives freely.

173
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,125
I respect your decision.

174
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,294
Do as you wish.

175
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,216
My lord.

176
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,220
You can't just let them do
whatever they want. You're an inspector.

177
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,639
What are you going
to report to the higher-ups?

178
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,433
Why don't you convince that woman
to make them stay here

179
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,185
while you finish your report

180
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,688
and then let them go?

181
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,485
Is your leg all right?

182
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,321
I have some medicine for that.
Come with me.

183
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,241
-Go ahead.
-Yes, sir.

184
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,085
Your flesh is torn.

185
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,546
It's going to take some time to heal.

186
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,842
By any chance, do you know
anything about Park Tae-seo?

187
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,512
He is the only friend that
Cha Mal-jong dare not go up against.

188
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,432
I don't know what he does
up in Baekgwiryeong Valley though.

189
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,853
Rumor has it that
he's some nobleman's illegitimate son.

190
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,862
Do you feel this?

191
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,323
Do you? Here…

192
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,284
-I do.
-What about here?

193
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,122
I do.

194
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,291
Luckily, your nerves seem fine.

195
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:21,629
I sprinkled some medicine on the wound,
so new skin will grow soon.

196
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,308
Are you all right?

197
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,791
Hey.

198
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,834
-My goodness…
-What are you doing here?

199
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,420
Remove that from your lips already.

200
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,845
Use some water.

201
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,891
Thank you.

202
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,352
It's clean water.

203
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,617
You can clearly tell that
the government officials are in on it.

204
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,870
It seems you were right, my lord.
They aren't ordinary thieves.

205
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,499
Embezzling all that would've
been impossible without their help.

206
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:45,838
The mastermind I'm looking for
may possibly be closer than I thought.

207
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,050
SOYANG TRADING GROUP

208
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,011
Rest up before we go into battle.

209
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,390
A war is about to begin.

210
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,062
Although we won't be rewarded,

211
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,815
at least we'll get to
sleep comfortably in this mansion.

212
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,067
We'll call it even
by sleeping on silk sheets.

213
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,654
Let the women, children,
and slaves use the main building.

214
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,908
Imagine how much they've suffered.

215
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,869
Show some generosity.

216
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,912
What about us, my lord?

217
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,998
Are you saying we haven't suffered…

218
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,917
Do you not see this allergic reaction
from the makeup, my lord?

219
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,170
What about this? Well?

220
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,422
If this isn't suffering, then what is?

221
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,142
Come and lie down.

222
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,063
What's wrong?

223
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,775
My dirty feet will taint the silk sheets.

224
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,486
It's too nice for us to use.

225
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,696
I'll just sleep on the floor.

226
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,033
You get beaten if you touch the blankets.

227
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,499
My goodness. This is so nice.

228
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,214
Why is this so soft?

229
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,884
Lord Cha Mal-jong hates
hard wooden pillows.

230
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,136
He had those made with cotton.

231
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,513
I see.

232
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,183
There's precious cotton in here?

233
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,519
The cotton is replaced every month.

234
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,480
How much is this worth then?

235
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,110
Here, take it.

236
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,320
Here.

237
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,032
Pillow fight!

238
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,374
It's snowing!

239
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,209
It's snowing!

240
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,720
This is so fun!

241
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,269
I've never felt anything so soft.

242
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,437
I feel like I'm floating on a cloud.

243
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,570
I'll show you something fun.

244
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,655
If you put your hand up like this…

245
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,240
Look.

246
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:19,992
What does it look like?

247
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,661
It's fluttering. Look.

248
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,540
That's pretty.

249
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,541
A butterfly, right?

250
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,544
-Do you think you can do this?
-Yes.

251
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,587
-Mine is a bird.
-Me too.

252
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,921
-Mine is a snail.
-Mine is a butterfly.

253
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,007
-Mine is a snail.
-Mine is a deer.

254
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,216
Mine is a toad.

255
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,428
Toad, toad

256
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,221
I'll give you an old house

257
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,265
Give me a new one

258
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,434
-Toad, toad
-Toad, toad

259
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,311
I'll give you a bad master

260
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,021
Give me a good one

261
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,064
-Toad, toad
-Toad, toad

262
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,567
I'll give you an empty bowl

263
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,694
Give me one filled with rice

264
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,613
-Toad, toad
-Toad, toad

265
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,531
I'll give you tears

266
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,533
Give me smiles

267
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,118
-Toad, toad
-Toad, toad

268
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,662
-I'll give you an old house
-I'll give you an old house

269
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,748
-Give me a new one
-Give me a new one

270
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,387
The secret royal inspector…

271
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,349
Has appeared…

272
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,934
Appeared…

273
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,354
Finally appeared…

274
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:36,860
Let's go.

275
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,868
Goodness. Being on a mission
is not very rewarding.

276
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:45,953
Look at this dust…

277
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,164
That is our reality and fate.

278
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,795
"He is my husband!"

279
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,674
"His Majesty the King is a rot--"

280
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,301
Stop.

281
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,306
I told you to stop.

282
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:12,145
My lord. Tonight is the night
you kissed a woman for the first time.

283
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,524
In front of all those people.

284
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,775
My goodness.

285
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,321
What a night
for the hot-blooded old bachelor.

286
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,907
Old bachelor? You little…

287
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,992
Wait!

288
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:29,246
"Let's settle this man to man.
Wouldn't that be more grand?"

289
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,539
"Make room."

290
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,962
These punks.

291
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,600
Thank you for putting the kids to bed.

292
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,852
Not at all.

293
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,524
By the way, do you really not know Bo-ri?

294
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,485
Who is this Bo-ri?

295
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,994
-She was my closest friend.
-"Was"?

296
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,414
She passed away recently.

297
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,504
That's why you were so surprised
when you first met me.

298
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:26,178
They say that everyone
has someone that looks exactly like them.

299
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,347
And it's so rare to run into any of them

300
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,100
that most people
never meet them before they die.

301
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,020
But I guess you have beaten the odds.

302
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,027
Our meeting must have been fate.
Do you want to come with us to Gapbigocha?

303
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,199
As you heard earlier,
anyone who wants to join us can.

304
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,077
Let me know if you want to.
Gwang-soon is coming with us too.

305
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,705
Yes, I do. I want to go with you.

306
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,958
But you don't even know
about the place we're going to.

307
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,919
Besides, the journey will be tough.

308
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,130
I heard it's a place where women
who returned from the war live.

309
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,132
That's more than enough reason for me.

310
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,467
I knew it.

311
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,427
I had a hunch you would.

312
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,596
I sort of have a sixth sense.

313
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,223
You don't mind it, right?

314
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,226
She's an adult.
You don't need my permission.

315
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,979
But the more companions we have,
the better the journey will be.

316
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,357
Right. By the way,

317
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,775
did you like it?

318
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,443
What?

319
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,445
Kissing the inspector.

320
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,164
My bundle! I forgot my bundle…

321
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,585
The kids' room.
Yes, I left it in the kids' room.

322
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,841
I'll go fetch it now.
Just give me a minute.

323
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,843
Don't wait up for me though. Go and sleep.

324
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,112
You came outside.

325
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,322
I did.

326
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,867
You did too.

327
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:26,423
You must be tired.
Why are you out here instead of sleeping?

328
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:34,139
Seeing the trumpet creepers reminded me
of the old days, so I was taking a walk.

329
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,185
Do you know that flower?

330
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,397
Of course.

331
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,942
When I passed the state exam,

332
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,737
I wore a chaplet
made out of these flowers.

333
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:00,874
But…

334
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,211
how did you know?

335
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,547
That Cha Mal-jong's nickname was Big Eyes.

336
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,344
I saw that he was
wearing mismatched socks.

337
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,762
One of them

338
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,097
was embroidered with the words, Big Eyes.

339
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,099
When I was young,

340
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,728
my mother always embroidered
butterflies on all of my things.

341
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,360
Judging by how he kept and wore
the patched-up old sock,

342
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,779
he still seemed to be missing his mother.

343
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,531
So I tried to appeal to that emotion.

344
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,909
How clever you are,

345
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,287
being able to pick up
on such things in that situation.

346
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,081
I am…

347
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,042
quite observant.

348
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,218
So,

349
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,720
what do you plan on doing now?

350
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,974
I decided to leave

351
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,269
for Gapbigocha with the people here.

352
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:05,939
That's too bad.

353
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,858
Since you're so clever,

354
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,570
I was hoping to keep you around
to run errands.

355
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,284
Showing up pretending to be my wife
was such a clever move.

356
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,831
When you were forced into a seubcheob,
you absolutely hated it.

357
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,168
But now, you think it was a clever move
to have me show up as your wife?

358
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,546
Well,

359
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,965
I'm sorry about that.

360
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,134
But I came to a realization.

361
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,470
There's no better disguise
than pretending to be a married couple--

362
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,682
And what are you going to do
if we're forced to kiss again?

363
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,810
I can pull it off because I'm a divorcee,

364
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:47,355
but you were so awkward
that they found out we were lying.

365
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,065
If it wasn't my first, I would've…

366
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,696
I mean…

367
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,156
So what I mean is…

368
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,659
I mean that it was my first time acting.

369
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:03,204
I'm certainly not saying
it was my first time kissing.

370
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,164
Absolutely not.

371
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,293
What a relief, then.

372
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,337
Anyhow, I'm not interested at all,

373
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,464
so if you need a fake wife,
look elsewhere.

374
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,381
Good night.

375
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,675
Fine. Good night.

376
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,078
We need to go out on a hunt.

377
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,287
-Yes, boss.
-Yes, boss.

378
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,048
Your Excellency.

379
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,675
A kite has arrived
from Soyang Trading Group.

380
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,521
You called for me, Dad?

381
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,564
-What is it?
-An inspector

382
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,691
arrested Tae-seo.

383
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,943
Really?

384
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,407
Our Tae-seo is in big trouble.

385
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,660
The Uigeumbu chief is from the south,
so we can't sway him.

386
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:27,330
We must stop them from coming
to Hanyang at all costs.

387
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,666
I see.

388
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,835
Then, Father.

389
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,170
Should I go?

390
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,839
It sounds fun.

391
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:42,804
Their transfer to the Uigeumbu
must be prevented at all costs.

392
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,557
If you can't…

393
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,475
If I can't,

394
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,478
should I kill him?

395
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,816
Do-soo,

396
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,738
Tae-seo still has a lot of work to do.

397
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,907
Can I just kill him?

398
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,576
You little…

399
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,498
"Father."

400
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,835
"Could I just kill him?"

401
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,920
You should ask politely.

402
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,423
Father.

403
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,800
Could I just kill him?

404
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,388
If you don't want any blood
on your hands, let him live.

405
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,806
Understood?

406
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,101
Yes, I'll get going then.

407
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,102
Right.

408
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,812
Don't skip your meals.

409
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,899
Make sure they're balanced meals,
understand?

410
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,568
Yes.

411
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,517
My lord.

412
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,521
The convoy just left
for Hanyang with the culprits.

413
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,899
They resisted so much,
they were like rabid dogs.

414
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,652
One even bit the wrist
of the officer transporting them.

415
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,403
Gosh.

416
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,531
What is all this?

417
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,367
They're not for you.

418
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,456
When are the children and women
leaving for the dock?

419
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,167
The ship leaving to Gapbigocha

420
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,753
is supposed to arrive
at the dock in an hour.

421
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,382
So they'll leave soon.

422
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,384
In an hour…

423
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,637
Bidding farewell as soon as we meet…

424
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,772
Here.

425
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,066
The inspector prepared
these lunch boxes himself.

426
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,068
Here you go. Enjoy it.

427
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,237
Have it with the kids on your journey.

428
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,573
Here.

429
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,325
The inspector's special lunch box.

430
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,035
I bet it's good.

431
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,249
My lord.

432
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,919
They have a lot to carry. Is it fine
if I escorted them to the dock?

433
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,462
Go ahead.

434
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,132
You too, Gu-pal.

435
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,926
-Yes, sir.
-My lord.

436
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,804
Thank you so much for saving us.

437
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,016
-I wish you a long and healthy life.
-Thank you.

438
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,269
-I wish you a long and healthy life.
-Thank you.

439
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,877
Thank you for everything.

440
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,969
We have a long way to go. Let's hurry.

441
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:10,929
Let's go.

442
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,185
Give that to me. I'll carry it.

443
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,236
We meet only to part.

444
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,676
My stomach!

445
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,678
Let's just go quietly, punk!

446
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,181
I can't just go on like this.

447
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,101
Must I beat you with a club
for you to come to your senses?

448
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,060
The thing is,

449
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,521
my bowels are quite sensitive.

450
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:06,234
They're suddenly sending me a signal.
What am I supposed to do?

451
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,361
Do you need a really good beating to--

452
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,700
-Why you…
-Gosh.

453
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,160
It's coming out. What do I do?

454
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,579
Hurry up and untie me!

455
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,458
I know I'm a prisoner,
but you should still let me poop.

456
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,918
Gosh.

457
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,045
My stomach!

458
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,630
Oh, my stomach!

459
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,392
These won't be sufficient evidence.

460
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,603
What?

461
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,941
Should I bring it to them?

462
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,495
Just take a dump anywhere.

463
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,082
I know you consider me a criminal,
but I can't do it in front of others.

464
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,625
It's coming out!

465
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,921
This looks like a good spot.

466
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,926
This is it.

467
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,929
This is the perfect spot.

468
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:55,676
Of course. They call you
the Baekgwiryeong Tiger for a reaon.

469
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,929
Are you making a lunch box
for the tigers again?

470
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,305
Well done.

471
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,474
How was my acting?

472
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,311
Controlling a fart is not easy.

473
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:06,813
What happened?

474
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,524
Let's talk more back at the mountain base.

475
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,235
My goodness.

476
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,699
They're all over there.

477
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,100
Halt.

478
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,727
Tae-seo.

479
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,187
Hi.

480
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,775
I guess I was one step too late.

481
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,694
Are you hurt anywhere?

482
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,028
What are you doing here?

483
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,032
Father sent me
after he heard about the inspector.

484
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,537
Father did?

485
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,874
It looks like you two
have a lot to talk about.

486
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,418
I'm just going to go and catch them.

487
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,878
I'll go finish them off.

488
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,004
Hey, Mal-jong.

489
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,590
-Yes?
-Bring her to me unscathed.

490
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,549
Who?

491
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,009
The little brat.

492
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,262
She is the inspector's weakness.

493
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:25,099
Right, now all of you are going
to come with me to catch them.

494
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,142
Let's go.

495
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,898
Why aren't you coming?

496
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,525
Let's go.

497
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,407
Hurry up if you're going to board.

498
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,867
We're ready to set sail.

499
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,243
Yes, we're coming!

500
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,786
We're coming. Just a minute.

501
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,788
Careful. Watch your step.

502
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,628
Come on, kids.

503
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,171
Careful.

504
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,883
Get off if you're not going to Gapbigocha.

505
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,927
-We're going to set sail.
-Yes. I'm coming.

506
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,387
I'm fine, I can manage.

507
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,165
Are you going too?

508
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,819
Stop hurting, my heart!
I'll make sure to tire you out, my body!

509
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,362
Goodness, what's wrong with him?

510
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,788
You didn't see anything, all right?

511
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,964
We'll set sail if everyone's aboard.

512
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,174
My goodness. What's with me?

513
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,010
I left my own bag behind.

514
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,098
You know how to read?

515
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,852
Just the simple words.

516
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,645
Then why do you have a book?

517
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,063
It's burnt.

518
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,524
This isn't just a book.

519
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,360
It's a keepsake of my friend, Bo-ri.

520
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,864
Sorry, I had no idea.

521
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,033
Hold on.

522
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,368
Can I look at that for a moment?

523
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,703
You know how to read?

524
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,999
Just for a moment.

525
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,004
This is…

526
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,714
What? What does it say?

527
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,716
What's the matter?

528
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,889
This isn't just a book. It's a ledger.

529
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:11,557
A ledger?

530
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,060
I'm sure this is important evidence.

531
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,395
You must show it to the inspector.

532
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,357
Gosh, I'm exhausted. That was close.

533
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,277
This ship is heading for Gapbigocha.
We'll set sail now.

534
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,737
-Wait!
-Wait!

535
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,284
Brother, you can look
after our siblings, right?

536
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,205
Ma'am, please take good care
of these children.

537
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,122
Don't worry. Go on.

538
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,499
Stop!

539
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,917
We're just going to get off.

540
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,960
-I can't refund your fare.
-It's fine.

541
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,213
Just take good care of these people.

542
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,130
Come on.

543
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,091
Run!

544
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,271
Where are you going?

545
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,110
I saw you go to the dock.

546
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,986
Why are you suddenly running that way?

547
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,823
What are they doing there?

548
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,949
Should I tell you?

549
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,159
Why do you think?

550
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,953
I'm here to catch you.

551
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:14,954
You damn bastards!

552
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:15,871
Listen.

553
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,457
Let's talk this out.

554
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,084
Just take one more step!

555
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,627
You'll be sorry!

556
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,795
-Get them!
-Get them!

557
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,838
Run!

558
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,927
How could you leave your sword behind?

559
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,471
Quickly pick that up and go after them.

560
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,764
On your left.

561
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,141
Run!

562
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,851
Hurry!

563
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,313
She loves me. She loves me not.

564
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,608
She loves me. She loves me not.

565
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,694
You spent just one day with her.

566
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,738
You're acting as if
you lived together and separated.

567
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,991
It doesn't matter how long.

568
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,326
The heart is what's important.

569
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,455
Yes, I'm sure.

570
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,666
Is this what love is like?

571
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,253
I feel like I can hear
their voices again already.

572
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,256
So clearly.

573
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,340
Stop!

574
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,468
-Run!
-It hurts too much! Stop!

575
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,139
Yook-chil!

576
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,689
Hurry!

577
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,483
-Hurry!
-My lord!

578
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,067
What's the matter?

579
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,487
-Why are you coming back?
-My lord!

580
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,742
My lord! My bundle!

581
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,542
My lord!

582
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,507
What is going on?

583
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,218
I found the ledger
regarding the Gaehwa Valley.

584
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,636
-Ledger?
-Yes.

585
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,264
-If we lose them, we're all dead.
-What?

586
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,642
Catch them at all costs!

587
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,103
They'll explain later.

588
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,189
-Let's get going for now.
-Retreat!l

589
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,024
Hurry! Pull!

590
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,734
Quickly!

591
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,488
No! This way!

592
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,406
Oh, my! My lord!

593
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,033
-My lord!
-My lord!

594
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,536
-This way!
-Where are you going?

595
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,912
One, two, three.

596
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,039
Quickly!

597
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,173
I need to cut the rope.

598
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,758
-Hold on tight.
-Yes.

599
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,228
-That'll take forever.
-Be patient.

600
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,233
My bundle.

601
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,488
I caught my bundle.

602
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,115
Are you all right?

603
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,289
My lord!

604
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,498
My lord!

605
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,499
Get him!

606
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,835
-My lord, grab on!
-Drag him up!

607
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,254
Drag him down!

608
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,799
There you go! Drag him down!

609
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,135
Those idiots!

610
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,846
There you go! Drag him down!

611
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,514
Drag him down!

612
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,696
If you fail to catch them,

613
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,782
I won't let you step onto land again!

614
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:42,786
My lord!

615
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,706
My lord!

616
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:47,875
My lord!

617
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,469
Are you all right?

618
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,637
Yes.

619
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,019
That's all that matters.

620
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,483
How dare you, punk?

621
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,652
We nearly died because of you!

622
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,654
Please, help me.

623
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,030
I don't want to die.

624
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,239
-Help me.
-Let go of it.

625
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,617
Stop!

626
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,873
Please spare him.

627
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,835
If we show him mercy and spare his life,
he might confess.

628
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:39,885
Pull him up.

629
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,555
Pull him up? He tried to kill us just now.

630
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,558
If we save him now,
it might blow up in our faces later on.

631
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,899
If we get a statement
regarding Mal-jong out of him,

632
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,526
it might help the investigation.

633
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,069
-Damn.
-Damn it.

634
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,620
Hey!

635
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,832
Let's go.

636
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,345
I came all this way.
Why don't you show me around the base?

637
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,848
I don’t believe
we're close enough for that.

638
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,976
Right. Forget it then.

639
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:33,730
I thought we could take this chance
to become brothers, though.

640
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,107
Are you saying

641
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,985
we haven't even been brothers?

642
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,032
The thing about mistress' sons is

643
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,619
that they might as well not exist.

644
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,081
What can I do?

645
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,584
I was turned down, so I have no choice.

646
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,336
Since I saw you still alive…

647
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,548
Bye.

648
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,260
Tell Father…

649
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,514
Thank him for me.

650
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,934
For sending you all this way

651
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,936
when we're not even brothers.

652
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,318
You should visit him.

653
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,277
He was

654
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,446
very worried about you.

655
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,325
But you should either find the ledger
or take care of the inspector

656
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,659
before you do

657
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,244
if you want to face him.

658
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,641
What happened to the culprits?

659
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,850
Ji Maeng-su took them.

660
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,936
I only did what I was told.

661
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,147
-Ji Maeng-su?
-I had no other choice

662
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,816
because they were holding
my mother captive.

663
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,735
Please spare me, my lord.

664
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,488
If I disobey them, my mother will die.

665
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,740
If I'm told to kill, I have to kill.

666
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,701
If I'm told to die, I have to die.

667
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,453
I had no other choice.

668
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,247
I didn't mean to do all that…

669
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:17,584
Yook-chil, Gu-pal, go get a straw mat.

670
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,919
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

671
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,672
Please, my lord. Have mercy.

672
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,714
My lord…

673
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:23,715
All right.

674
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,593
All right. Roll!

675
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,056
What I meant was,

676
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,225
cover him with it.

677
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,019
Not roll him in the straw mat?

678
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,521
We did cover him.

679
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,856
Don't roll him up.

680
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:42,359
He's shivering.

681
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,404
Cover him with the straw mat, now.

682
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,780
We all got wet too.

683
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:47,948
Yes, sir…

684
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,544
Explain in detail.

685
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,463
The mountain base
is Soyang Trading Group's headquarters.

686
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:06,216
The stuff Cha Mal-jong stole
from the royal offerings

687
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,177
and what Ji Maeng-su embezzled
with the base by colluding

688
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,138
with the officials are all there.

689
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,932
They sell all those goods
and the moonshine they make there

690
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,183
to the eight provinces.

691
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,394
I hear they make a lot of money from it

692
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,397
and use it to run Park Tae-seo's
smelting plant in Baekgwiryeong.

693
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,649
A smelting plant in Baekgwiryeong?

694
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,152
Yes. I hear they dig up
the silver ores from the mines

695
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,405
and extract silver from them
in the smelting plant in Baekgwiryeong.

696
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,533
All the way over there in Jinsan.

697
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,494
There's a valley called Baekgwiryeong.

698
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,413
That's where it's all made.

699
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:41,668
They make alcohol, weave hemp fabric,
and even extract silver…

700
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,380
What exactly are they scheming?

701
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,216
I need to go there.

702
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,344
Can you take me to the base?

703
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,928
Then they'll kill my mother.

704
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,639
My lord, please don't make me--

705
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,016
We must go there to save your mother.

706
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,225
Where is it?

707
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:01,313
I don't know. I don't know anything!

708
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,023
My lord.

709
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,816
I hear the head of the mountain base

710
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,985
holds his subordinates'
family members hostage

711
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:10,030
to ensure that nobody
leaks information about the base.

712
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,658
Do you know anything about the base?

713
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,493
I don't know the details,

714
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:18,038
but I did escort some traveling
entertainers to the base entrance

715
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,623
for the boss' birthday once.

716
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,167
-Traveling entertainers?
-Yes.

717
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,503
I believe every year
on the boss' birthday,

718
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,464
they hold a party
with traveling entertainers.

719
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,634
Then show me the way.

720
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,804
Showing you the way isn't difficult,

721
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:39,893
but even the royal forces
are powerless there.

722
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:42,437
As you enter,
they thoroughly check your identity,

723
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,648
and then you follow the gatekeeper inside.

724
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,360
It's not a place you can easily sneak
into without careful planning.

725
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,029
My lord.

726
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:55,534
Perhaps, you should ask for backup
from Hanyang and then raid the place.

727
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,244
There's not enough time for that.

728
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,914
We must attack before Park Tae-seo
and Cha Mal-jong destroy the evidence.

729
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,502
Lock this man up for now.

730
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,712
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

731
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,630
My lord…

732
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,758
Let me take a look at the ledger you have.

733
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,979
What happened to this?

734
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,023
Well…

735
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,235
I was burning it
because I thought it was just a book…

736
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,363
You burned this important
piece of evidence?

737
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,284
I didn't know it was
such important evidence.

738
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:40,787
If this ledger had been preserved,

739
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,706
we could have ended it right away.

740
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,583
Why didn't you tell me back then?

741
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,001
I mean,

742
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,712
you were a stranger then.

743
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,923
Besides, you looked like
a beggar asking for food.

744
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,468
Should I have told you about it back then?

745
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:55,969
She's right.

746
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,933
These are tax papers.

747
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,562
No, they're not just tax papers,

748
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,106
but a list of people
involved in tax embezzlement.

749
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,777
It was a personal effect?

750
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,904
Yes, it was amongst Bo-ri's things.

751
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,741
But why was this ledger there?

752
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,076
Well,

753
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,995
Bo-ri was carrying…

754
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,207
the magistrate's baby.

755
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,466
My lord.

756
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,469
What about the ledger?

757
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,932
-Well…
-Spit it out.

758
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:44,142
-I couldn't find it.
-You couldn't find it?

759
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,645
It must be in Gaehwa Valley!

760
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:50,190
I searched the magistrate's house
and office, and even his mistress' tavern.

761
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,776
I checked every single thing
that resembled paper,

762
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,528
but I couldn't find it anywhere.

763
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,365
However, I found this…

764
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,872
Here.

765
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,209
I found this.

766
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,296
This is…

767
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,841
I found it in the tavern's furnace.

768
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,634
The tavern's furnace?

769
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,971
It seems it was burned
with her personal effects.

770
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,098
Her personal effects were burned?

771
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,516
By whom?

772
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,518
Jo-yi.

773
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,812
There's a brat that I suspect.

774
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,564
Then you should've gone after her.

775
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,316
But she got a divorce
and left Gaehwa Valley,

776
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,235
so I don't know where she is.

777
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,028
You moron.

778
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,072
Is that really your excuse right now?

779
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:40,532
Please, spare me.

780
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,200
If you want to live,

781
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,911
search all eight provinces if you have to

782
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:47,372
and find that brat, Jo-yi.

783
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,464
"Chief of Maritime Transport,
Hong Seok-gi."

784
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,552
Even the Chief of Maritime Transport
is involved?

785
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,596
But…

786
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,098
why did the magistrate of Gaehwa Valley

787
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:09,853
give this ledger to Bo-ri
and not to Hong Seok-gi?

788
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,733
Did Bo-ri act or say anything strange
before her death?

789
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,235
She did say she was about to leave anyway.

790
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,364
But I assumed that meant
she'd be closing her tavern down

791
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,283
once she was officially his concubine.

792
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,785
She was about to leave anyway?

793
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,040
Then that means

794
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,959
someone knew the magistrate
had entrusted Bo-ri with the ledger

795
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,129
and went looking
for the ledger before her incident.

796
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,130
Then,

797
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:39,549
was Bo-ri's death not an accident?

798
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,259
Was she murdered?

799
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:43,845
It seems so.

800
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:52,812
Then do you think
Hong Seok-gi also killed the magistrate?

801
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,232
According to the ojagin,

802
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,277
the assassin's arrow was made
from an aconite root.

803
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,403
Aconite is used

804
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,823
for medicinal purposes in the palace.

805
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,742
It's known as the best base for a tonic.

806
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,369
However, if misused,

807
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,454
it could be used as a base for poison.

808
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,831
They are using aconite.

809
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,293
If that aconite made
its way to the palace…

810
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,756
How deep is the Chief of Maritime
Transport involved in all of this?

811
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,759
Then, why don't we catch
Hong Seok-gi or whatever

812
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:24,010
and interrogate him?

813
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,804
Things are not that simple.

814
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,305
We might lose the mastermind.

815
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,474
Then,

816
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,977
how about raiding the mountain base?

817
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,271
I'm sure we'll find
even more evidence there.

818
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,024
On top of that, they're holding hostages.

819
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,777
Wait. I told you before.
Don't underestimate that place.

820
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,824
Then are you saying we should just
let the bad guys run free like this?

821
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,159
No, I mean… That's not what I meant.

822
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,497
He's putting on a show.

823
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,669
The inspector is putting on a show
with the traveling entertainers.

824
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,173
I apologize, my lord.

825
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,342
Bi-ryeong sometimes
gets possessed by spirits.

826
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,011
It's all right, Bi-ryeong.

827
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:11,182
Did you just say that he was putting on
a show with the traveling entertainers?

828
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,399
Did I say that?

829
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,277
My goodness.

830
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,572
And both of you need
to watch what you say.

831
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,157
He's an inspector…

832
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,325
Do you remember
the date of the boss' birthday?

833
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,704
Let me see.
He was born in the year of the red dog,

834
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,664
the month of the blue horse,
on the day of the black tiger…

835
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,832
That's in two days.

836
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,543
You can trust Gwang-soon.

837
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,713
She's good with numbers
and has a great memory.

838
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,550
-Traveling entertainers.
-Traveling entertainers.

839
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,930
Let's sneak in pretending
to be traveling entertainers.

840
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,390
I had the same thought.

841
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,685
Then we'll go to the marketplace
and look for traveling entertainers.

842
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,646
-Now?
-Now?

843
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,023
-Let's go.
-What?

844
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,108
I see it!

845
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:06,905
Putting on a show.

846
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,824
-What did she see?
-Putting on a show…

847
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,451
Let's go.

848
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:18,625
My lord.

849
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,753
Someone claiming to be
your in-law's cousin's nephew

850
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:23,088
is waiting inside.

851
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,091
-Who?
-He said you'd know of him…

852
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,260
Trying whatever they can
to mooch off of me, I see.

853
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,431
I told him you were out,
but he said that he'd wait inside.

854
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,934
They never do anything by themselves.

855
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,103
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

856
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,567
You punk!

857
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,570
How dare you pretend
to be a relative of mine

858
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,447
and deceive the officials?

859
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,787
The secret royal inspector

860
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,622
-A horse plaque?
-has appeared!

861
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,892
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

862
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,395
THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD ACTORS
IN THIS EPISODE WAS PROPERLY ENSURED

863
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,993
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE JUN-HYUK

864
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,583
Look at my shoulders.
If these aren't rafters, what are they?

865
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:44,836
You and the inspector must have had
a deep connection in a past life.

866
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:46,546
I must catch the inspector myself.

867
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,089
Is it because of that brat?

868
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,591
They've all disappeared.

869
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,927
Who is trying to cover up
the truth behind this whole incident?

870
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,679
We must take care of
the Chief of Maritime Transport first.

871
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,723
He was also looking for the ledger.

872
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,100
The ledger…

873
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,186
I can do it myself.

874
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,230
Do not get hurt, no matter what.
That's an order.

875
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,273
Let's go.

876
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:10,153
