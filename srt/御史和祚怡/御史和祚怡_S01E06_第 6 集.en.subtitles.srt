1
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,316
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,408
He's putting on a show.

4
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,828
The inspector is putting on
a show with the traveling entertainers.

5
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,706
Bi-ryeong…

6
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,207
I apologize, my lord.

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,334
Bi-ryeong sometimes
gets possessed by spirits.

8
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,086
It's all right, Bi-ryeong.

9
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,175
Did you just say that he was putting on
a show with the entertainers?

10
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,551
Did I say that?

11
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,889
Do you remember
the date of the boss' birthday?

12
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,142
He was born in the year of the red dog,

13
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,977
the month of the blue horse,
on the day of the black tiger…

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,228
Oh, that's in two days.

15
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,858
-Traveling entertainers.
-Traveling entertainers.

16
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,280
Let's sneak in pretending
to be traveling entertainers.

17
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,698
I had the same thought.

18
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,701
Then we'll go to the marketplace
and look for traveling entertainers.

19
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,911
-Now?
-Now?

20
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,120
-Let's go.
-What?

21
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,456
In the meantime,
I'll go and arrest Hong Seok-gi.

22
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,166
I bet

23
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,878
you and the inspector must've had
a deep connection in a past life.

24
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,796
You think so?

25
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,049
Deep connection? Please.

26
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,009
Just find the traveling entertainers.

27
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,178
They should be here already.

28
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,889
Why not? You two seem to get along well.

29
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,351
Plus, didn't you meet him
for seubcheob at the shrine?

30
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,769
Seubcheob?

31
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,772
So you two are married by seubcheob?

32
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,317
No. We decided that never happened, so no.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,986
You're lucky to have run
into an inspector at the shrine.

34
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,781
I heard some wait
for inspectors by their routes.

35
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,783
But it wasn't my intention--

36
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,451
Was it nice?

37
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,539
What?

38
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,707
They must be over there!

39
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,264
Here they are.

40
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,434
They're so popular
that we didn't even have to search.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,405
You punk!

42
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,366
How dare you pretend
to be a relative of mine

43
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,243
and deceive the officials?

44
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,293
A horse plaque?

45
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,763
As if being a widower wasn't sad enough,

46
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,558
I now have to chase
after some useless brats.

47
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,395
How am I supposed to find
that Jo-yi, Jo-raeng, or whatever?

48
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,689
What?

49
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,816
My goodness.

50
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,069
Look at you all enjoying yourselves.

51
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,279
Hooray!

52
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,572
Coming through!

53
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,741
Hurrah!

54
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,125
Wait, that's…

55
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,295
I was wondering where I'd find that brat.

56
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,297
The deities are smiling upon me today.

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,673
Hey, you brat!

58
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,258
Where is the ledger?

59
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,302
Hand over the ledger!

60
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,678
Officer?

61
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,138
Come with me.

62
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:43,973
What's going on?

63
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:56,986
Bo-ri?

64
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,366
My goodness.

65
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,619
What? Are you Bo-ri?

66
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,621
Did he just say ledger?

67
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,128
Help!

68
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,304
I'll get straight to the point.

69
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,851
I looked over the records
of the grain tax transported

70
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,273
and saw an entry regarding the freighter
that sank off the coast of Gaehwa Valley.

71
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,567
According to the entry,

72
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,153
the freighter was sucked
into a storm before sinking.

73
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,323
Is it true that no one drowned
or went missing?

74
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:47,829
Luckily, a warship nearby found them,
and the sailors rescued everyone.

75
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,540
Is that so?

76
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:01,259
The navy vessel records
for the day the freighter sank

77
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,846
show that not a single warship
set sail that day.

78
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,393
Not a single warship set sail that day,

79
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,063
so how is it possible
that they were rescued by sailors?

80
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,278
Who is it?

81
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,489
Who destroyed the evidence,

82
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,034
aided the murder,

83
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,788
and is now trying to cover up
the truth behind this whole incident?

84
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,048
You are under arrest for embezzling
tributes and destroying evidence.

85
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,299
Tie him!

86
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,300
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

87
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,437
Father was very worried about you.

88
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,483
But you should either find
the ledger or take care of the inspector

89
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,360
before you do if you want to face him.

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,921
Are you inside?

91
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,844
Let me do it for you.

92
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,722
Your Excellency.

93
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,948
Now that you've become an adult,

94
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,326
you should contribute something
to the family.

95
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,744
Therefore…

96
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,713
What is this?

97
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,801
It's a hat strap
with our family crest engraved.

98
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,981
I'm not worthy…

99
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,358
of such…

100
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,198
It signifies

101
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,326
that you have a duty and responsibility

102
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,789
to ensure our family's prosperity.

103
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,708
Do you understand?

104
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,336
My son.

105
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,842
Yes.

106
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,597
Yes.

107
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,433
Father.

108
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,358
What about the brat?

109
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,235
We lost her.

110
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,197
That damn inspector
showed up out of the blue. Damn it.

111
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,908
I must catch the inspector myself.

112
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
Yourself?

113
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:16,120
Wait, you've never gotten
directly involved before.

114
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,955
I just changed my mind.

115
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,124
Is it because of that brat?

116
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,002
Or is it because of Do-soo?

117
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,838
No way.

118
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,467
Don't tell me you really
consider him your brother.

119
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,762
The nobles do not consider you
as one of their own at all.

120
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,973
They have children
with slaves only to enslave them.

121
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,893
So if this is because of the man
you believe to be your father,

122
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,353
don't do it.

123
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,857
I just think it'll be fun.

124
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,068
That's all.

125
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,320
My lord.

126
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,989
How about sending him
to the provincial office?

127
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:55,159
If you can't trust them either,
sending him to the station house

128
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,203
could be safer for protecting the witness.

129
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,539
My lord. I think you should at least

130
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,499
move somewhere protected by armed guards.

131
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,793
I will see this through myself this time.

132
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,295
Come on!

133
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,798
Turn! There you go.

134
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,384
No. With your arms.

135
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,468
Try again.

136
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,596
That's it. Nice.

137
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,348
Well done.

138
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,019
My lord.

139
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:29,569
These are the traveling entertainers
for the boss' birthday party.

140
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,737
I lured them here
by offering free lodging.

141
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,491
Well done.
I'm sure it wasn't easy to persuade them.

142
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,998
Is that Hong Seok-gi?

143
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,379
Then he must be involved in Bo-ri's death.

144
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,425
Involved? I didn't kill anyone!

145
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,926
Inspector.

146
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,886
You got the wrong person.

147
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,514
I admit that I pocketed
a bit of the tribute,

148
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,308
but I never murdered anyone.

149
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,767
If I could,

150
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,937
I would cut myself open
and show you my heart.

151
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,897
You want to show him?

152
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,691
That's good to hear.

153
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,860
Why don't we go inside?

154
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,820
I have to show you something.

155
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,867
Let's go.

156
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,127
You're here.

157
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,881
Officer?

158
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,799
He's the Gaehwa Valley Officer.

159
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,885
Why is he here?

160
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,012
He was also looking for the ledger.

161
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,019
Did you tie him up on your own?

162
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,979
We got help from the entertainers.

163
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:49,857
You're right on time.

164
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,067
It's time.

165
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,695
But all of you need to remain quiet.

166
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,656
What's with the bell

167
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,783
and what are the things on the box for?

168
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,785
That's a jewoong.

169
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,663
We're going to use that
to make him confess.

170
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,750
You little…

171
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,212
You are all much too superstitious.

172
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,006
This is why people need to study.

173
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,592
How could you have
blind faith in old folk beliefs--

174
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,266
Ask me anything.

175
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,601
It's working!

176
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,027
Ask him about the ledger.

177
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,530
The spirit asks you.

178
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,367
Tell us everything you know
about the ledger now.

179
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,537
The ledger…

180
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,374
I received orders from the boss

181
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,794
and went to Bo-ri's tavern
to look for the ledger.

182
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,212
Hey! Stop it right now!

183
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:11,188
I went…

184
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,820
I went there and came across a woman.

185
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,824
It was a big woman named Jang Pat-soon.

186
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,660
She lured me into her house.

187
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,871
I told her that I had
to return to the office,

188
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,081
but she tried to force me
to spend the night.

189
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:34,503
She stuck her lips out
and breathed hot air onto my nape…

190
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,965
This isn't going to work.
Change the question.

191
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,550
Just tell us everything you know!

192
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,010
Everything…

193
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,888
Tell you everything?

194
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,474
My family is from Chungcheong Province.

195
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,350
The year my father turned 20,

196
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,521
he married the daughter
of the station house and had me.

197
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:57,276
My surname is Mi and my name is An-hae.

198
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,195
Mi An-hae.

199
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:03,657
He really is telling us everything.

200
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,576
-Make him stop.
-Stop.

201
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,705
One long bar of rice cake
and two rice ball cakes…

202
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,582
-I said stop!
-The one in the middle…

203
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,875
Why isn't he stopping?

204
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,127
I don't really know how to stop them yet.

205
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,838
-So you can't stop him?
-A dream that predicted a son…

206
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,674
That's how, on July 7th,

207
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,510
when I turned 18,

208
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,930
I met the first woman I had ever loved,

209
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,724
but our relationship did not last.

210
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,645
To tell you the reason,
one day she came up to me

211
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,899
and said sorry
with a very serious look on her face.

212
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,360
I wasn't sure if she was apologizing

213
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,446
or calling out my name.

214
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,166
I thought I lost them all,

215
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,378
but here they are.

216
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:03,717
Goodness, these traveling performers
just do whatever they want.

217
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,637
-They're completely out of control.
-The rookies, too.

218
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,015
If we don't check on them again later,
it'll be a complete mess.

219
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,183
Just let them be.

220
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,145
We found a way to sneak
into the mountain base thanks to them.

221
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,898
Try to be understanding and generous.

222
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,026
Why is he so obsessed with being generous?

223
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,781
If we keep being generous like this,
we might end up sleeping on the streets.

224
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,367
You worry too much.

225
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,244
That won't ever happen.

226
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,328
Anyway, my lord,

227
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,582
is there really no other way
than to enter the mountain base?

228
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,167
I hear it's quite a scary place.

229
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,546
It's a place we must go through
to acquire evidence.

230
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,424
But they all know our faces.
Is that going to be okay?

231
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,510
That's why we're disguising ourselves
as entertainers.

232
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,053
If you're still so worried,

233
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,139
put on more makeup.

234
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,016
No.

235
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,644
Fine, let's say we'll manage
to get past the gatekeeper, then what?

236
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,063
With no backup forces and just performers.

237
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,941
My point exactly.
Please think it over once more, my lord.

238
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,194
If we end up getting caught…

239
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:08,407
Hence, I need one of you
to go to Hoehyeon-dong.

240
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,578
Hoehyeon-dong is where
the crown prince's home is.

241
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,414
Are you planning to call them here?

242
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,502
Then I'll go since I'm fast.

243
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,130
I'm faster than you. I'll go.

244
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,007
-I'm faster.
-I'm faster.

245
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,259
I'm older, so of course, I'm faster.

246
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,552
My lord.

247
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,929
My lord?

248
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,892
Since I'm going,
I'll go see what she needs.

249
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,353
My goodness.

250
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,562
Damn it.

251
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,777
You don't have a room to sleep in?

252
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,573
The entertainers took every single room,
so there's no room left for us.

253
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,204
Dozens of young men went into the rooms
and fell asleep, so there's no room left.

254
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,123
What do you mean?

255
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,917
I apologize, my lord.

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,920
I knew this would happen
when he kept going on about generosity.

257
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,384
Then let's give this room to the ladies.

258
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,052
-We should--
-No!

259
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,346
We should what?

260
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,598
Sleep out in the yard?

261
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,684
I can't do that.

262
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,519
You can do that if you want.

263
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,104
I'm going to sleep in this room.

264
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,982
You can sleep out in the yard if you wish.

265
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,152
I was going to say

266
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,072
we should go sleep at the tavern.

267
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,282
Forget it, then.

268
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,703
I was thinking about
buying you rice wine at the tavern.

269
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,996
Rice wine? Wait.

270
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,999
Then can we also get
the boiled meat you promised?

271
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,709
Don't bother.

272
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,547
We're here because
we already went and had no luck.

273
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,675
Maybe it's because we're near the dock,
but every tavern is full.

274
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,010
There's no room left.

275
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,181
Now what?

276
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:58,517
Well,

277
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:03,230
how about we share the room
as we do at taverns?

278
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,401
Nobles like you might find it unpleasant,

279
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:10,070
but it's something pretty common for us.

280
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,869
I apologize if I've offended you, my lord.

281
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,580
I didn't want you
to experience unnecessary trouble.

282
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:25,627
Our lord is slightly, very slightly picky.

283
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,380
But he's quick to accept things
if it seems reasonable.

284
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,549
He has the heart of a saint.

285
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,801
The noblest of all nobles.

286
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,636
Right, my lord?

287
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,644
Fine.

288
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,230
We shall do that.

289
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,317
If everyone else does it,

290
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,486
why can't I?

291
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,783
-Let's go inside.
-Yes.

292
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,494
Thank you.

293
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,622
By the way,

294
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,042
you have somewhere to go,
don't you Yook-chil?

295
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,630
Gu-pal. You're right.

296
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,840
You're much faster.

297
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,010
Hurry up.

298
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,012
Have a safe trip.

299
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,019
Thank you, Gu-pal.

300
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,360
I'll go and get some water then.

301
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,368
We'll have no choice but to stick together
because the room is small.

302
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,249
Therefore, you should stick to the wall.

303
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,181
-Thank you.
-Sure.

304
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,109
Turn the lights off and lie down.

305
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,404
Tomorrow will be even busier than today.

306
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:27,124
You should go ahead and sleep.
I'm going to get some fresh air.

307
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,125
Wait

308
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,763
What are you doing right now?

309
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,564
Don't worry.

310
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,359
I'll make sure not to cross this line.

311
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,490
My lord.

312
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,120
Are you asleep, my lord?

313
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,547
My lord.

314
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,801
My lord.

315
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,263
My lord?

316
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,725
Are you asleep, my lord?

317
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,128
Unbelievable.

318
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,341
How could you be still in bed?

319
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,884
The sun is high up in the sky.

320
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,804
Put these on and come out quickly.

321
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,279
There you go.

322
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,955
Gu-pal, you're pretty good at that.

323
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,588
I can tell that you're a shaman
from the way you hop around.

324
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,007
Your spiritual powers
are a bit unstable though.

325
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,425
Gwang-soon.

326
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,594
Look.

327
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,222
Did you see how high that went up?

328
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:56,309
There are a total of 29 entertainers,
27 excluding the kids.

329
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,395
Three different colors per person,
that's 81.

330
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,731
If we include the 5 of us,
we're going to need 96.

331
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,525
There's one missing…

332
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:04,943
Oh, here it is.

333
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,239
"The five of us"?

334
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,867
Why are you going? It's dangerous.

335
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,371
No one knows Cha Mal-jong better
than I do, so I'm sure I'll be helpful.

336
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:20,208
This isn't about reading or calculating.
A sword fight might break out.

337
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,669
Stay out of it.

338
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:27,215
This is a chance to end Cha Mal-jong
and you're telling me to stay out of it?

339
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,800
If I was going to stay out of it,

340
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,553
I would've never gotten off the ship
when I saw the ledger.

341
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,931
Just go, Yook-chil!

342
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,016
Gosh.

343
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,069
Damn it, you scared me!

344
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,529
When did you get here?

345
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,823
It's your birthday today, Maeng-su.

346
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,950
Are the preparations
for the party going well?

347
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,203
-Where's Tae-seo?
-Tae-seo?

348
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,289
He's probably training somewhere.

349
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,583
There he is.

350
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,713
Hong Seok-gi was arrested.

351
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,176
That inspector even arrested Hong Seok-gi?

352
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,804
It's only a matter of time
before he opens his mouth.

353
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,224
Hold on.

354
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,435
How did he know
that Hong Seok-gi was involved?

355
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,105
That must mean
that the inspector found the ledger.

356
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,982
How did that punk find the ledger

357
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,860
when we couldn't
even after ransacking Gaehwa Valley?

358
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,154
The brat from Gaehwa Valley
must've had it.

359
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:37,535
I should've killed them
when I had the chance.

360
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,828
Wait.

361
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:42,624
Now that Hong Seok-gi's been caught,
this place isn't safe.

362
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,980
Goodness.

363
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,780
Let me do it.

364
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,075
This is quite difficult to tie by myself.

365
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,705
You can't even do this by yourself?

366
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:23,915
How did you…

367
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,052
First, take this strap.

368
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:40,056
Start from your right shoulder and wrap it
to the left side of your waist,

369
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,767
and then tie it here.

370
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,853
Then, you take this

371
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,772
and start from the left shoulder.

372
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,485
You wrap it
to the right side of your waist,

373
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,363
crossing them before tying it
in the middle of your waist.

374
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,536
Lastly,

375
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,997
you take this strap…

376
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,252
and wrap it around your waist once

377
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,880
before tying them together
in the center of your back.

378
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,715
Then, you just let them hang.

379
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,307
It's easy, isn't it?

380
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,357
Let me do yours.

381
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,153
-It's fine. I can do it by myself.
-Wait.

382
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,294
How do you know how to do this?

383
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,758
Commoners participate in Durepungjang,
a festivity held every spring.

384
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,969
They wear three different colored straps
and pray for a good harvest.

385
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,388
I saw it a lot then.

386
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,851
You only saw others do it,

387
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,313
yet you condescend to me.

388
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:18,863
Even if I want to,
they don't let women join the performance.

389
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,533
Only men are allowed
to wish for a good harvest.

390
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,951
That's what condescension is.

391
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,335
That's why I must join the entertainers
this time and go to the mountain base.

392
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,796
Don't you dare leave me out
just because I'm a woman.

393
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,507
I won't.

394
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,264
But do not get hurt.

395
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,642
That's an order.

396
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,530
Thank you.

397
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,829
What about the silver for Gapbigocha?

398
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,165
We're mining the last bit.
It'll be done by today.

399
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,543
We'll take the promised silver
to Gapbigocha once the party is over.

400
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,044
You're going there yourself?

401
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,254
Han-gi is at Gokdu.

402
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,965
No, I'll deal the gunpowder myself.

403
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,467
We need to fast-track the plan.

404
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,763
Sure. There's no point in stalling.
It might be better to get it done sooner.

405
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,307
Han-gi will be so happy to see you.

406
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,685
Or will she be happier if Maeng-su goes?

407
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,978
No, that's not right.

408
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,063
Han-gi will be the happiest if I go.

409
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,357
Is it necessary to fast-track the plan?

410
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,610
-Since it's come to this…
-Can you just not do it?

411
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,362
Think about it.

412
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,783
We can live good enough lives
with the silver we get from here.

413
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,953
We didn't start this to get rich.

414
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,373
Contact Gokdu.
Let them know I'll deliver it in person.

415
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,875
All right.

416
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,925
Are you telling me to wear this?

417
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,886
Yes, put it on.

418
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,638
It suits you well.

419
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:10,225
Multi-color is the way to go
if you want to disguise yourself.

420
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,142
Oh, my.

421
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,812
There's our nobleman.

422
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,440
It suits her well.

423
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,109
You look great.

424
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,656
A nobleman needs a beard.

425
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,949
Let's put on this beard.

426
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,992
Good.

427
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,287
My lord, hurry up and put it on.

428
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,499
Let's put this on top of your head.

429
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,502
Goodness, you look pretty.
It suits you well.

430
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,420
You should position your legs like this.

431
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,757
Swing right and left as you walk forward.

432
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,677
Like this.

433
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,806
Nobleman. Let's see you give it a go.

434
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,602
You didn't mean me.

435
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,106
Go on.

436
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,902
Nobleman, watch carefully.

437
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,198
You open your fan like this
and become bow-legged.

438
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,910
Come out and greet me!

439
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,999
Come out and greet me!

440
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,794
-Well done.
-Thanks.

441
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,713
-You're set. You can go back.
-Okay.

442
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,424
My lord, come on out.

443
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,386
Fine.

444
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,724
Please do it right.

445
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,851
Like this.

446
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:39,647
Like this.

447
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,232
Like this…

448
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,359
I think he needs to do more than that.

449
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,905
Oh, dear.

450
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,783
My lord. Like this.

451
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:51,993
How can you not do it?

452
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,371
Do you expect a nobleman
to do something so foolish?

453
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,333
This isn't going to work.

454
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,960
Why don't you just go in with a mask on?

455
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,754
Yes.

456
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,715
That sounds good.

457
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,718
Are you sure you'll be okay?

458
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,763
Yes. Didn't you see what I did with this?

459
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,183
A ship from Gapbigocha is coming in today.

460
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,352
I'll go out to the marketplace
in the evening.

461
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:22,607
I'll feel at ease once the peddlers
confirm that the children arrived safely.

462
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,816
All right.

463
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,027
But make sure to be careful.

464
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,111
I'll be fine.

465
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:28,738
Don't worry too much.

466
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,116
The soldiers will be here soon.

467
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,160
I'm counting on you.

468
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,954
Sure.

469
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,667
AGRICULTURE IS THE BACKBONE
OF THE COUNTRY

470
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:01,729
Let's go.

471
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,731
Let's go!

472
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:37,348
Why do you keep submitting petitions
when you know they'll be turned down?

473
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,521
If Hongmungwan has time on their hands,
they should help out in the kitchens.

474
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,440
A very important petition

475
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,651
regarding Chungcheong's Chief
of Maritime Transport came up.

476
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,614
Reports from
the dispatched royal inspectors

477
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,366
have been coming in one by one.

478
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:01,247
I was going to suggest an investigation
into the grain tributes to His Majesty…

479
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,003
You should have me,

480
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,548
the Chief State Councilor, deliver such
an important petition to His Majesty.

481
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,592
I will discuss it
with Saheonbu and Saganwon

482
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,761
and submit a joint petition
to His Majesty.

483
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,430
To avoid rejection.

484
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,685
Hongmungwan doesn't just
study public sentiment.

485
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,520
Even when a sword is held to our neck,

486
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,899
it is our only honor to promote
what is right for the nation

487
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,693
before succumbing to death.

488
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,323
Also…

489
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,953
we do indeed have some time to spare.

490
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:03,851
My goodness. Have you been well, sir?

491
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,686
-You're here.
-Yes.

492
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,438
I didn't see them last year.

493
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,818
I thought that you might get bored
if you saw the same show every year,

494
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:16,155
so this year, I brought
some Durepungjang and masked performers.

495
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,783
We prepared a very fun show,

496
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,910
so I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

497
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:21,869
Great.

498
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,666
This is well-made.
Leave me one when you leave.

499
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,710
Yes, of course.

500
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,588
-Let them in!
-Thank you, sir.

501
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,673
Let's go in!

502
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,434
We got in more easily
than expected, right?

503
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,852
Yes.

504
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:31,189
They said it was a really scary place,
but it's not that bad.

505
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,609
But the base seems too empty.

506
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,571
You're right.

507
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,407
My goodness.

508
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,577
You really go all out.

509
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:00,927
Gosh.

510
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,056
Let's see.

511
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,556
I just think it'll be fun.

512
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,641
That's all.

513
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:52,478
But how are you going
to catch that rotten inspector?

514
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,188
That bastard is no joke.

515
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,732
Unless he came here voluntarily.

516
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,401
He wouldn't dare come here.

517
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,361
That's true.

518
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,154
Breaking into
the Great Jade Emperor's palace

519
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,240
would be easier
than breaking into this palace.

520
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,450
It's possible once a year.

521
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,039
On just one day.

522
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,462
Right.

523
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,429
Maeng-su, we should go all out
for your birthday this year.

524
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,310
I'll have Pebble tail them.

525
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:51,329
Even a royal inspector
who passed the state exams

526
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,957
doesn't make the right call
every single time.

527
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,418
That system is just fundamentally wrong.

528
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,129
Does it make any sense
that a smart punk like Tae-seo

529
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,631
isn't even allowed
to take the state exams?

530
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,551
Still, this world of ours

531
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,512
subtly shows that it can be fair at times.

532
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,394
Even a ten-year-old child knows
how precious human life is.

533
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,522
You, who have abused children
and maltreated human lives,

534
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,691
have no right to speak of fairness.

535
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,240
And one more thing.

536
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,119
I passed the state exams…

537
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,497
Well…

538
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,832
for a reason.

539
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,169
Attack!

540
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,724
Who are these punks?

541
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:54,975
The crown prince's guards.

542
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,811
The crown prince's guards?

543
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,020
If they really are…

544
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,147
Then we're doomed.

545
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,441
They're Joseon's human weapons.

546
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,654
I'll take this. You search for evidence!

547
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,988
Yes, my lord.

548
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,242
This way!

549
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,003
Hey!

550
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,424
Why is a woman so unbelievably strong?

551
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,885
What's wrong with a woman so strong?

552
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,807
I think this is it.

553
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,725
Ledger…

554
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,603
Cha Mal-jong most likely
just left it out in the open.

555
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,688
Take a look.

556
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,816
Something that doesn't look precious.

557
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:44,984
Something he put out

558
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,319
as if it wasn't important at all…

559
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,205
Stop getting in the way.

560
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,211
You're the one who needs
to stop being distracted!

561
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,514
All right. Just stand behind me.

562
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:17,266
Do not back down!

563
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,941
Do-soo, you're back.
Are you hurt anywhere?

564
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,615
The inspector I told them to kill
keeps sending in reports.

565
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,701
Why is he still alive?
What on earth is Tae-seo doing?

566
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:39,246
That's why you shouldn't
trust Tae-seo with anything.

567
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,081
The Chief of Maritime Transport.

568
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,292
We must take care of him first.

569
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,836
Goodness.

570
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,379
Do-soo.

571
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,425
You need to go there one more time.

572
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,595
Go and pressure Tae-seo once more.

573
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,598
If those rotten bastards
from the Three Offices join forces,

574
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,768
Saheonbu might break in here
and search our house.

575
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,646
Father, I just got back from Chungcheong.

576
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,439
You should leave immediately.

577
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,113
Go and tell him to take care
of the Chief of Maritime Transport first.

578
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,410
All you need to do
is relay my message to Tae-seo.

579
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,746
Do not get involved. Do you understand me?

580
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,206
Here.

581
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,499
Not this one. That one.

582
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,002
All right. Here.

583
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,838
Hear me! Get a horse ready immediately!

584
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,151
But I just got back.

585
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,778
It's urgent.

586
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,118
Go and eat something tasty
on your way, all right?

587
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,412
Fine.

588
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,582
-Darn it.
-There.

589
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,459
I'll tell him to take care
of the Chief of Maritime Transport.

590
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,589
-Wait, Father.
-Yes? What is it?

591
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,675
Do you want more money?

592
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,428
No.

593
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,180
Can I go look around
Tae-seo's mountain base?

594
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:21,765
Mountain base?

595
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:26,937
Are you talking about Tae-seo's minions'
hideout deep in the mountains?

596
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,606
What for?

597
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,024
You know, Father,

598
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,276
I've always been curious

599
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:36,989
how Tae-seo has all that money to spend.

600
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,076
All the alcohol, parties,
and his lavish lifestyle…

601
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,078
How is all of that possible?

602
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,830
That's because of the tributes--

603
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:49,918
Wait a minute.

604
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,963
Did you figure out the source
of his hidden income?

605
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,675
I feel like I might find it this time.

606
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,137
All right.

607
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,477
Anything I find
at the mountain base will be mine.

608
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,103
Okay?

609
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,523
-I'll get going.
-All right. Be careful.

610
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,230
What now?

611
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,731
I think we're losing.

612
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,817
Find the tax ledger
before they do and leave.

613
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,735
The ledger. Right.

614
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,536
Ledger…

615
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:09,832
Damn it!

616
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,356
Retreat!

617
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,827
Tae-seo.

618
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:00,632
Stop right there!

619
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,656
My lord. If we go after them now,

620
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,744
we'll most likely be ambushed
by the mountain trail.

621
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,455
They're wounded,

622
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,998
so they won't get too far.

623
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,087
My lord, please help.

624
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,633
Are you all right?

625
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,427
I'm fine, but these people…

626
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,770
Let's treat the wounded first.

627
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,689
They're all exhausted,
so we should feed them.

628
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,985
Let's start with the wounded first.

629
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,487
Yes, sir.

630
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,323
My lord!

631
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,034
The ledgers! We found all the ledgers!

632
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,453
We also found all the hostages!

633
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,372
But what is all this? Where did they go?

634
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:16,625
They're all gone.

635
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,587
They all ran away.

636
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,301
We won!

637
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,025
If it were not for these ledgers…

638
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,532
Gwang-soon.

639
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,242
Gwang-soon.

640
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:54,121
Did they always exist in Joseon?

641
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,665
I heard they're the crown prince's guards.

642
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,668
They're in charge
of protecting the crown prince.

643
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,336
So it goes without saying.

644
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,382
Gosh. They're indeed
the guards who protect the royal family.

645
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,843
Their martial skills
are spectacular and beautiful.

646
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,553
Not just martial arts skills.

647
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:13,140
Exactly. Their solid physiques,
the confident look in their eyes…

648
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,767
-Yes.
-Shoulders as broad as rafters.

649
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,727
Yes.

650
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,812
Did you see them fight earlier?

651
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,189
They were like…

652
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,528
They must be tired.
We should prepare some food for them.

653
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,989
Is the kitchen this way? That way?

654
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,490
All right.

655
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,575
This way.

656
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,077
Come this way.
Thank you so much for your hard work.

657
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,829
This way, please.

658
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,582
Rafters?

659
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,964
Both of you. Look at my shoulders.

660
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,301
If these aren't rafters, what are they?

661
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:52,804
I think I should go prepare some food.

662
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,435
If these aren't ridgepoles, what are they?

663
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,008
What are you doing? Hurry up!

664
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,301
What about the ledgers?

665
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,099
This is all I could get.
They had already taken the rest.

666
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,850
We must get them
or my father will be in trouble.

667
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,060
It's too late!

668
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,439
Luckily, I was able to get the ledger
that has your old man's name in it.

669
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,857
So don't worry.

670
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,944
Go to Gokdu
and postpone the gunpowder deal.

671
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,612
All right.

672
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,741
Let's go. We need to get away first.

673
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,460
Let's see.

674
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,003
Both of you, step aside.

675
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,564
This is my turf.

676
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,537
All right.

677
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,999
The ingredients
are especially fresh today.

678
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:48,086
-Should we start with draining the blood?
-Cut the tail off first.

679
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,338
Wait. Don't cut too much into the flesh.

680
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,673
Yes, Chef.

681
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,011
What are you doing right now?

682
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,596
Whole chicken soup.

683
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,389
What? No…

684
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,932
That's not what I meant.

685
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,019
I meant, why are you in here?

686
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,479
To cook, of course…

687
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:09,816
What?

688
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,651
You've never met a perfect man like me

689
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,780
who's handsome, intelligent,
and even knows how to cook?

690
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,706
You should leave
the physically demanding tasks to men.

691
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,963
Have you gone insane?

692
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,800
We need to put them in whole.
Why did you crush them?

693
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,347
Then again,

694
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,643
an old bachelor should know
how to cook if he doesn't want to starve.

695
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,644
Well, that's…

696
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,562
Good luck then.

697
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,816
But will it be even edible?

698
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,068
Our lord has a nasty temper,

699
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,153
but he excels in cooking and studying.

700
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,490
I see.
It's a relief he's good at something.

701
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,910
We'll go assist the others then.

702
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,747
-Good luck!
-But Jo-yi, we should still…

703
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,457
-We can't just…
-Come on.

704
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,342
"An old bachelor…

705
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,679
with a nasty temper".

706
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,180
Me?

707
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,682
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

708
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,270
I wasn't asking you two!

709
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,521
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir.

710
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,525
You little…

711
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,949
Yes, sir.

712
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,676
How dare you!

713
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,638
Are you still trying to
do something foolish in this situation?

714
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,392
I'm watching your every move.
Every one of them.

715
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,066
Move an inch and I'll teach you a lesson.

716
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,015
My lord.

717
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,350
Right.

718
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:50,644
-Be careful.
-Yes, sir.

719
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,271
-It's ready.
-Give us some, too.

720
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,814
-Sure. Just a moment.
-Yes.

721
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,024
Coming right up.

722
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,236
It's coming right up.

723
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,448
-Here you go.
-Thank you for your patience.

724
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,201
-Thank you.
-No worries.

725
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,118
My lord.

726
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,745
This is the last one.

727
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:09,704
All right.

728
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,331
You two should eat, too.

729
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,374
Yes, sir.

730
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,919
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

731
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,676
It's getting cold. Hurry.

732
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:36,231
My goodness.
This meat just melts in your mouth.

733
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,858
This place has good chicken soup.
What a surprise.

734
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,779
The broth is the best
for restoring energy.

735
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:44,739
-Eat up.
-We will.

736
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,450
Enjoy your meal!

737
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,786
-We will.
-Thank you, my lord.

738
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,330
It's delicious.

739
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,126
-You should eat first.
-No, I…

740
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,337
My goodness, but I can eat later.

741
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,839
Where did Jo-yi go?

742
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,509
Yook-chil.

743
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,011
Enjoy your meal.

744
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,098
Yook-chil.

745
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,449
Thank you, my lord.

746
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,703
It's hot!

747
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,204
Are you all right?

748
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:36,458
It's not hot. Not at all.

749
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:40,003
It's not hot at all.

750
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,880
Here you go.

751
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,214
It must be hot.

752
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,262
Eat slowly, Gu-pal.
You'll get indigestion!

753
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,728
There's only one drumstick.

754
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,563
I can't eat this.

755
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,024
Don't worry. I can have this.

756
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,698
There must be mosquitoes
because we're in the mountains.

757
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,325
Enjoy the drumstick.

758
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,420
My lord.

759
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,715
Are you not eating?

760
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,516
This looks so good!

761
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,521
It's specially seasoned
with sesame seed oil and soy sauce…

762
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,314
It's even seasoned.

763
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,113
Her eating habits are rather rough.

764
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,702
I've never seen this much meat in my bowl.

765
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:11,928
What are these?

766
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,603
Taffy.

767
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,032
Taffy?

768
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,124
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

769
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,351
The crown prince
beseeched us to protect you.

770
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:42,894
I must figure out where
the entrance to Baekgwiryeong is.

771
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,271
No, you can't.
Where do you think you're going alone?

772
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,565
You sound like his wife or something.

773
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,984
They did every bad thing they could
by colluding with government officials.

774
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,236
What's up there?

775
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,863
I heard there's something
that explodes when you step on it.

776
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,200
I could blow up something even bigger
to catch the inspector.

777
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,203
How many murder cases
have there been in just one month?

778
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,456
Please get to the bottom of this mystery,
my lord.

779
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,500
I promise I will at all costs.

780
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:11,839
