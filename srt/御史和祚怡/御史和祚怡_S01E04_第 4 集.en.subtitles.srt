1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,316
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,479
-What's wrong?
-Look…

4
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,314
-Look…
-What?

5
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,232
-Over there.
-Where?

6
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,663
If you're a ghost, go away!
If you're human…

7
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,964
Bo-ri?

8
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,846
Bo-ri.

9
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,140
How wronged she must have felt.

10
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,017
Have you gone insane?

11
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,394
Do you want to get bewitched by a ghost?

12
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,147
A ghost or whatever, she's my friend.

13
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,067
Bo-ri!

14
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,569
Bo-ri!

15
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,703
Bo-ri!

16
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,497
Bo-ri…

17
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,132
What is that?

18
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,760
Goblin fire. I'm busy. Go away.

19
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,975
Oh, that's hot!

20
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,983
Bo-ri!

21
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,943
Bo-ri…

22
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,487
-Let go of me. Hold on.
-Bo-ri…

23
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,407
-This is not it…
-What?

24
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,367
Wait…

25
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,869
What's wrong with her?

26
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,593
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,890
Kids! No!

28
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,292
That's…

29
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,842
So, you've been
pretending to be ghosts here

30
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,302
to keep people away?

31
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,888
Yes, to survive. We have no other choice.

32
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,939
It's mulberry juice.
It looks just like blood.

33
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,861
By any chance, do you have a twin sister?

34
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,199
Or do you have a cousin around your age?

35
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,078
I'm an orphan and the only one
of my bloodline in this world. Got it?

36
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,873
Then how are you all related?

37
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,335
-If you're not brothers and sisters--
-No! We're family!

38
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,128
We're family!

39
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,755
We may not share blood,

40
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,299
but we grew up together
like a family in the orphanage.

41
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,425
We are family.

42
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,803
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,848
You look so much like my late friend.
I'm sorry if I was rude.

44
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,186
Anyway, the kids look quite sick.

45
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,109
What happened to their eyes?

46
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,153
They caught a disease
while drying medicinal herbs.

47
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,614
-Medicinal herbs…
-It'll make you sick if you eat it.

48
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,370
My lord, they all seem a bit off.
Let's just go.

49
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,707
We should get out of here
before they do anything to us.

50
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,459
What herb was it?

51
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,795
Why don't you stop being nosy
and be on your way?

52
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,966
Before the people who seem off
do something to you.

53
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:00,967
No.

54
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,095
I need to know.

55
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,188
They rubbed their eyes with
the hands they used to dry the herbs.

56
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,276
If your eyes come into
direct contact with it, you go blind.

57
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,778
-This herb called aconite.
-Aconite?

58
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,409
Tell me in detail.
How you all ended up like this…

59
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,245
I must hear it.

60
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,214
Follow me.

61
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,819
It's all right.

62
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,575
It's all right. Don't worry.

63
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,702
When kids at the yujeobso turn ten,

64
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,538
they are either adopted
by families or become slaves.

65
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,959
The kids here were sent
to Soyang Trading Group as slaves

66
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,336
and they escaped.

67
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,381
They broke the ordinance and escaped?

68
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,758
ORDINANCE: RULES AND LAWS

69
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,259
They had no other choice.

70
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,514
Cha Mal-jong,
the head of the trading group,

71
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,266
colludes with the village officials

72
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,354
to make excessive profits
in the public impost process.

73
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,816
He hoards the inventory to sell later
and has amassed great wealth.

74
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,902
He was a madman who tormented and toyed

75
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,239
with the slave children
whenever he felt like it.

76
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:51,452
He would starve those who were
unable to obey or refused his orders.

77
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,039
And some of them even ended up dying.

78
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,582
Why did you not report him?

79
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,630
Joseon law forbids slaves
from reporting their owners.

80
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:07,343
Furthermore, Joseon law permits owners
to punish their slaves however they wish.

81
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,139
Were you not aware of this?

82
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,728
They'd just say the kids deserved
punishment or died because they were weak.

83
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,150
Because not a single official cared
when a child died.

84
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,238
When people had enough,

85
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,824
a few like-minded adults joined hands

86
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,786
and started smuggling the kids
from the trading group to bring them here.

87
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,745
Which is why

88
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,708
we even spread rumors
about ghosts to keep people away.

89
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,545
Still, you can't live
deep in the mountains like this.

90
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,341
-Are you sick?
-Those children should

91
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,260
see a doctor as soon as possible.

92
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,471
As soon as the boat
to Gapbigocha comes in,

93
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,097
I plan on leaving with the kids.

94
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,682
Go to sleep.

95
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,728
I heard that place has a village
made for orphans like us

96
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,730
and hwanhyangnyeos.

97
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,856
HWANHYANGNYEO: A WOMAN THAT
HAD RETURNED HOME AFTER THE WAR

98
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,025
Did you just say hwanhyangnyeo?

99
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,030
I heard repatriated prisoners of war
that were kicked out of their homes

100
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,032
and orphans were welcome there.

101
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,201
Since the village leader is

102
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,495
a woman who suffered the same fate.

103
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,219
I'm here because I heard
you can get beef here.

104
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,555
There's no beef because of the beef ban.

105
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,765
Come on, now.

106
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,519
We heard the rumors
that you bring beef to the beggars' huts.

107
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,023
You must have some left

108
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,317
for the royal kitchens.

109
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,574
I don't even have any
for the King, so go back.

110
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,245
She could just say it's not enough.

111
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,749
This should be
worth 70 rolls of hemp fabric.

112
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,173
We'll leave.

113
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,424
We're leaving.

114
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,134
We are.

115
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,617
Have some of this to appease your hunger.

116
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,828
But this is so precious…

117
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,247
I heard there wasn't even enough meat

118
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,416
for the royal ceremonies
because of rinderpest.

119
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,877
We can't let the living starve
so we have enough to offer to the dead.

120
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,257
It's not much, but come have some.

121
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,472
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

122
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,810
Hand the baby over and eat.

123
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,406
How pretty you are…

124
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,908
Do you also have a child?

125
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,998
I heard

126
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,208
she lost her child early on.

127
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,837
And that's why she works
so hard to save children.

128
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,064
What do you plan on doing now?

129
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,942
I'm planning to smuggle out as many kids
as I can from the trading group.

130
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,362
Isn't it better to just report it?

131
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,990
That's like telling
Cha Mal-jong where these kids are.

132
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,826
Right…

133
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,287
I will go myself.

134
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,164
You're not going to Gongjinchang?

135
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,957
I need to check something for myself.

136
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,545
I'll go, so let me know
if you need anything.

137
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,931
To tell you the truth,
my mother is also a hwanhyangnyeo.

138
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,981
I want to help in any way I can.

139
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,279
Then…

140
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:42,034
I have a favor to ask.

141
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,747
There's something I need you to do
for me at Soyang Trading Group.

142
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,916
-Toss it.
-Yes, sir.

143
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,213
Should I give up or keep going?

144
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,840
Give up or keep going?

145
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,189
What are you doing?

146
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,567
I'm sorry, sir.

147
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,529
It's fine.

148
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,783
Why waste time apologizing
when you can be beaten to death?

149
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,662
Right? Don't you agree?

150
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,289
Look at me.

151
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,834
There you go.

152
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,045
My goodness! You foolish girl!

153
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,714
I apologize, sir.

154
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,634
A beating won't be enough.
We must teach a lesson to brats like her.

155
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,805
She must be straightened out now,
or she won't take mistakes seriously.

156
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:49,143
I'll drag her to the shed
and punish her by hanging her up.

157
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,478
Let's go, you brat!

158
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,022
All right. Go ahead then.

159
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,066
You'll find an older servant
named Gwang-soon there.

160
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,244
Usually, she sneaks the kids
out of there and I pick them up.

161
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,081
But as you can see,
I can't leave these sick children alone.

162
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,709
So could you pick them up for me?

163
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,127
Look.

164
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,755
Men who look like servants
are all armed with swords.

165
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,466
How deep must the collusion run

166
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,260
for them to have
armed thugs running around?

167
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,095
Those bastards are completely insane.

168
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,098
The government officials are all in on it.

169
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,059
How do we get them?

170
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,986
We must acquire concrete evidence.

171
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,280
Or we won't stand a chance.

172
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,450
I'm sure they have
a secret ledger in there.

173
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,661
You're not going in there
right now, right?

174
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,830
It's going to be a while
until Moo-jeok brings backup here.

175
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,124
Here.

176
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,961
Do you think you can
deliver this before dawn?

177
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
Your family's safety depends on you.

178
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,094
It's your favorite, yakgwa.

179
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,345
Yakgwa!

180
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,013
Not now.

181
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,350
Eat it when you arrive at yeokcham,
do you understand?

182
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,313
Hold on.

183
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,748
START

184
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,125
ARRIVE

185
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,960
It stings!

186
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,316
Hello.

187
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,863
While we wait for backup,

188
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,866
we'll get in there and buy time
while looking for evidence.

189
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,203
But won't they get suspicious
if three strange men walk in?

190
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,587
Of course, we can't just go in.

191
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,532
It's all right. You're safe now.

192
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,743
Are you hurt?

193
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,745
I'm all right.

194
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,997
You must have been very scared.

195
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,796
It's all right.

196
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,549
I'm sorry for hitting you earlier.

197
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,681
Have a drink.

198
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,809
Drink up.

199
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,659
I think you should stay here for a bit.

200
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,246
I'll let you out once it's safe outside.

201
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,498
You cannot come out before then.

202
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,002
If Cha Mal-jong sees you,
we don't know what will happen.

203
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,295
Even if it's a bit stuffy,
just be patient.

204
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,338
Yes.

205
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,100
Get back.

206
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,102
Sit down.

207
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,891
LINENS

208
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,480
What are you doing?

209
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,481
Come on out.

210
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,651
Come now. Come on out.

211
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,061
Happy?

212
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,396
Are you?

213
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,482
No. It's killing me.

214
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,234
You're so cute, it's killing me.

215
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,089
Now,

216
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,216
the two of you

217
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,635
shall be lovers.

218
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,555
Absolutely ridiculous.
We'll go with siblings.

219
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,934
All right. Then you shall be siblings.

220
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,779
Are you really the same person?

221
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,032
My, you look like
a completely different person.

222
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,742
Really?

223
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,911
Does it not suit me at all?

224
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,956
Then,

225
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,250
what about this?

226
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,641
My goodness. Have you been well?

227
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,684
Hello, Gwang-soon.

228
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,353
I've been waiting for you.

229
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,104
-Wait here for a second.
-Yes.

230
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,608
The meeting place is the linen shop.

231
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,110
Did anything happen?

232
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,572
Of course not. Nothing ever happens here.

233
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,076
Bi-ryeong hasn't come yet.

234
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,535
But what about the child?

235
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,790
There was another incident today,
so she's locked up in the shed.

236
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,459
I'll bring her
when I come back later today.

237
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,211
Go on and get back.

238
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,713
If you're gone for too long,
you'll be in trouble.

239
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,423
-I'll go now.
-All right.

240
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,511
-Follow her.
-Yes.

241
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,401
You dropped this.

242
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,903
Yes.

243
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,238
-Thank you.
-The password is

244
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,074
-"I came from Heunhaengi Hill."
-I came from Heunhaengi Hill.

245
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,163
I heard there will be
a party in this village.

246
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,249
So I came hoping to make a few bucks.

247
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,961
That's great!
We were actually very short-staffed.

248
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,005
Let me carry that for you.

249
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,631
Oh, thank you so much.

250
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,882
You should go this way.

251
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,509
-This way?
-Yes.

252
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,346
We should get to work as well.

253
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,219
-Go on.
-You must be hungry.

254
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,090
Did you get someone skilled?

255
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,051
He's a carpenter that participated
in the palace reconstruction.

256
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,679
I told him to use only the best materials
that were used for the palace,

257
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,972
so no need to worry.

258
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,016
What about the layout of the house?

259
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,269
He mentioned that it would be ideal
to arrange the structures

260
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,564
in the shape of the "day",
"month", or "nine" characters.

261
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,442
The "day" and "nine"
characters seemed plain

262
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,861
so I asked him to go
with the character for "month."

263
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,571
I heard from the other lords

264
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:32,119
that the preferred layout nowadays
is shifting from "month" to "luck".

265
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,328
Oh, my.

266
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,454
Is that so?

267
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,125
I'm unaware of the latest trends.
I apologize, sir.

268
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,961
My eldest son will live in this house.

269
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,587
Yes. Of course, my lord.

270
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,550
I actually like this one better.

271
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,095
I hate complicated things.
I prefer this one, Dad.

272
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,472
But this layout will bring you luck.

273
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,811
And how many times
have I told you to speak properly?

274
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,146
You shouldn't call me "dad."

275
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,647
Yes, Father.

276
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,149
Excuse me.

277
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,650
Look here, Carpenter.

278
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,402
I need to speak to you.

279
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,239
You are a minister's son.
When will you stop acting like a kid?

280
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,825
Father, do not worry about me.

281
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,661
You should worry about Tae-seo.

282
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,997
Why are you worried about him?

283
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,416
A report regarding
the dead inspector was submitted.

284
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,251
What?

285
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,672
Tae-seo always leaves a trace behind.

286
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,258
You're about to be completely exposed

287
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,844
because he couldn't
take care of one inspector.

288
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,262
You punk, watch what you say!

289
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,764
Why do you need to be cautious?

290
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,600
-You put the King on the throne.
-Watch it.

291
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,227
Father, you're the leader of the noblemen

292
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,771
and the loyal subject
who put the King on the throne.

293
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,440
What are you so worried about?

294
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,487
We haven't found the ledger yet.

295
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,741
It seems His Majesty the King got
the chief scholar involved.

296
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,827
It'll get tiresome
if he acquires evidence.

297
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,829
It never hurts to be careful.

298
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,336
It's been a while
since I saw you being so serious.

299
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,509
Tae-seo harbors resentment
because he's an illegitimate child.

300
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,055
That's why he used my title
as the chief state councilor

301
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,600
to coax the countryside officials
and increase his own assets.

302
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,061
So,

303
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,315
even if the ledger is discovered,
the evidence won't point to us…

304
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,486
but to Tae-seo.

305
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,906
What are you talking about?

306
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,469
My apologies, master!

307
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,889
Please forgive me!

308
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,602
Then work.

309
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,855
Without fearing death.

310
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,234
That desperation will save Joseon.

311
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,115
You can't live as slash-and-burn farmers,

312
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,033
servants,

313
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,327
and slaves forever!

314
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,289
Regardless of class!

315
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,250
Those who sweat and produce results
should be rewarded.

316
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,002
We must create…

317
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,631
such a world together.

318
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,217
Master.

319
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,593
Until that happens,

320
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,013
you must be willing to make sacrifices.

321
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:38,930
Yes.

322
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,350
-Do you understand?
-I do!

323
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,441
What are you talking about?

324
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,651
Tae-seo only has eyes for you.

325
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,112
"Father, I await your command."

326
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,489
"Father, is this enough?"

327
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,117
"Father, can I fetch you something?"

328
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,507
You're so scary, Dad.

329
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,344
You'll do that to Tae-seo
who tries that hard?

330
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,138
That makes me feel so bad for Tae-seo.

331
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,435
Not all brothers are the same.

332
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,646
So Do-soo,

333
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,526
you must brace yourself.

334
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,406
I will, Dad.

335
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,866
Don't worry too much.

336
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,291
My lord.

337
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,462
Do you have any pheasant meat?
I must pay tribute.

338
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,005
I do.

339
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,468
I just got some fresh
pheasant meat from Suanbo.

340
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,803
How much is it?

341
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,182
It's 200 rolls of cotton for one.

342
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,978
You could buy a horse
with 200 rolls of cotton.

343
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,400
My goodness. How can pheasant meat
cost as much as a horse?

344
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,403
Then go get flogged
for not paying tribute.

345
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,612
If you don't want that,

346
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,989
you can sell one of your children.

347
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,783
My goodness! My lord!

348
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,035
Please give me a discount.

349
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,204
My son is sick and lying down in a cart.

350
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,997
I can't even pay for his medicine.

351
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,916
Forget it! Damn it.

352
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,210
My lord! Please.

353
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,170
What are you looking for? Pheasant?

354
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,214
Get me a plump one.

355
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,549
Here you go.

356
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,801
This is pretty good.

357
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,054
So this is how the pheasant meat
given out to pay for lunch

358
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,681
made its way to the palace.

359
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,850
How is this a country?

360
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,393
Corruption is in every corner.

361
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,020
I seriously need to get out of Joseon.

362
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,712
You must be craving alcohol,
seeing how you're loitering around here.

363
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,713
Right?

364
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,967
This is hahyangju,
which only the King gets to drink.

365
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,052
Well? Do you want a taste?

366
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,263
Do you want a sip?

367
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,016
No, I'm good.

368
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,310
We occasionally drink it too.

369
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,146
It is very famous after all.

370
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,403
My goodness. You must be
a pretty big hotshot yourself.

371
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,031
Fearlessly snarfing down a royal offering.

372
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,327
You'll be dead meat
if the Uigeumbu squad catches you.

373
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,918
Well, rather than live my life as a fool
constantly worrying about the law,

374
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,506
I choose to eat everything I want
and end up as a good-looking ghost.

375
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,342
Don't you agree, Chil-guk?

376
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,095
Of course.

377
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,349
The law is crap.

378
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,353
I, Chil-guk, would rather
quit pooping than drinking.

379
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,441
Pal-soon, what about you?

380
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,695
Of course, my dear brother.

381
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,322
It's the most thrilling

382
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,742
when you break the law.

383
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,349
My sister is quite shy.

384
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,981
You're so pretty.

385
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,905
Do you know that you're cute?

386
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,535
Come inside.

387
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,954
What are you doing?

388
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,711
He just said he's pretty, right?

389
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,089
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

390
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,938
This is insane.

391
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,274
The ingredients are top-quality.

392
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,525
Naturally.

393
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,695
They were all
supposed to be royal offerings.

394
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,282
It's not just food.
There's also hemp fabric.

395
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,956
Hey, you scoundrels.

396
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,958
Let's go to the backyard.

397
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,462
Sure. The weather is perfect.

398
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,395
You're here, Mal-jong.

399
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,730
Hey, there.

400
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:24,025
Why are you bastards always here?

401
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,736
Keep playing.

402
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,030
Come here.

403
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:31,991
Sit.

404
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:36,454
Pretty Girl, you sit next to me.

405
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,087
Bring the food!

406
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,007
I don't mean to be rude,

407
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,678
but do you mind
if I ask who your father is?

408
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,599
I should know who the family is
before I accept a meal…

409
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,936
I don't have a father.

410
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,274
I'm a child with no father.

411
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,410
Pretty Girl.

412
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,578
Have a drink.

413
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,225
This is…

414
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,395
not hahyangju.

415
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,315
What?

416
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,317
What do you mean?

417
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,529
This is the aroma of chamomile,
not lotus flowers.

418
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,995
I even detect a hint of ginger
and the pungent aroma of red peppers.

419
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,707
This is hansan sogokju, isn't it?

420
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,847
You really are a man about town.

421
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,265
I was thinking

422
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,935
if you were some measly secret
royal inspector here to play some tricks,

423
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,020
I'd kill

424
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,938
and bury you.

425
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,858
You even know
what hansan sogokju tastes like.

426
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,611
Are you a real scoundrel?

427
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,529
Great.

428
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,658
So he tested me on purpose?

429
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,910
Bring more alcohol!

430
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,163
I noticed on my way in

431
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,582
that this place has everything.

432
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,087
Do you trade medicinal herbs as well?

433
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,632
We don't deal with medicinal herbs.

434
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,011
The one in charge of that
is such a damn stickler.

435
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,805
I can't be bothered to deal with him.

436
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:00,765
Is that so?

437
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,144
She definitely said that
it happened while drying aconite.

438
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,816
But where did you
get all this alcohol from?

439
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,027
-Do you make it as well?
-What?

440
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,071
You know…

441
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,406
Pretty Girl, where are you from?

442
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,130
Why does that even matter?

443
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,508
What matters is that we met here today.

444
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,263
You're quite the romantic, aren't you?

445
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,350
-But…
-Yes?

446
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,353
Where do you make…

447
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,149
all this alcohol?

448
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,736
All the way over there at Jinsan.

449
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,739
There's a valley called Baekgwiryeong.

450
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,409
That's where it's all made.

451
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,706
What do they make other than alcohol?

452
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:12,378
They make alcohol, weave hemp fabric,
and even extract silver…

453
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,672
Silver? Did he just say silver?

454
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,516
Thanks to you,
I got all this work done in no time.

455
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,602
Thank you for carrying
all this for me too.

456
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,354
Don't mention it.
Just let me know if there's anything else

457
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,315
and pack me a few extra yukjeon.

458
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,030
Where is the child?

459
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,407
In the storage shed.

460
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,702
In the backyard of the annex,
you'll find a side door.

461
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,872
Once I bring the child there,
get her out through it.

462
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,711
Actually, the caterer was looking
for an extra kitchen maid.

463
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,838
There's going to
be a party today, you see.

464
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,841
Is that so? I'm actually a great cook.

465
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,301
Really? That's great.

466
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,011
-Let's go. This way.
-Yes.

467
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,836
How much longer must we keep this up?

468
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,131
If my calculations are correct,

469
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,717
he should've arrived at yeokcham by now.

470
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,538
I'll stall. You search the house.

471
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,458
We must find the trade ledger.

472
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,960
Also, see if they have
a shed for medicinal herbs.

473
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,347
Can't you only look at me?

474
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,016
All right.

475
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,143
I'll only look at you.

476
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:15,561
Wait…

477
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,316
I think you mentioned something
about silver extraction earlier?

478
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,696
But silver isn't sesame seed oil.
What did you mean by extract?

479
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,824
Why do you keep asking questions?

480
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,034
That's suspicious.

481
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,127
Your taste in women…

482
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,598
How can the guest of honor be so late?

483
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,685
We're holding this party for you!
How can you be so late?

484
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,898
Baekgwiryeong was covered in fog.

485
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,777
Then again, it's pretty rough out there.

486
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,615
Wait, are you sure it's fog and not smoke?

487
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,741
Coming out of there?

488
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,370
We have a long way to go before that.
We're just getting started.

489
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,456
Anyway, it's fine as long as
your father didn't throw a fit.

490
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,418
I was worried that old geezer might again.

491
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,378
Who are you?

492
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,131
Me?

493
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,972
They're just scoundrels passing through.

494
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,098
One of us.

495
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,975
One of us?

496
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,145
And who is your father?

497
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,817
My father…

498
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,235
Father?

499
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,281
I don't think he's one of us,
seeing how he uses the word "father".

500
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,725
What's up? Do you like her?

501
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,518
I just brought her from the yujeobso.

502
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,853
YUJEOBSO: THE CENTRAL PUBLIC FACILITY
THAT RESCUED ORPHANS

503
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:24,273
Let's not do anything that could make us
look bad. We should be careful.

504
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,819
Nothing will happen.

505
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,281
I talked it all out with the nangcheong

506
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,159
and cooked the books
for all the slave deals.

507
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:39,622
Anyway, just lie low for the time being.
Especially until we catch the inspector.

508
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,290
What?

509
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:44,502
Another inspector was dispatched
after we took care of the other one?

510
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,588
Damn it.

511
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,132
Do I need to send the kids out again?

512
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,301
I already did.

513
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,386
I don't know what tree they're barking up.

514
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,056
Anyway, if he shows up
in this tiny village,

515
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,058
he'll just end up becoming
a trapped mouse.

516
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,310
He's more than welcome
to pass through here.

517
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,978
Don't kill him. Capture him.

518
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,356
Why? What are you going to do with him?

519
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,650
I need to find out
how much he's dug up first.

520
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,735
We can kill him afterward.

521
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,071
Fine. Sure.

522
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,408
Excuse me, I need to relieve myself.

523
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,663
Hey.

524
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,669
You'd better return within 15 minutes.

525
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,338
If you take too long to urinate,

526
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,341
it might make us think
you've run to the authorities.

527
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,806
Come on. What if he goes
and reports it to the authorities?

528
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,849
They're all on my payroll, anyway.

529
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,935
Those damn fools.

530
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:47,022
They gobbled up
all their meals here again yesterday.

531
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,148
I know that.

532
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:49,775
But…

533
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,029
you never know.

534
00:42:55,489 --> 00:43:00,119
My goodness. My dear brother
isn't that righteous of a person.

535
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,581
You don't know how cheap,
selfish, and egocentric he is.

536
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,457
Go on and take your time.

537
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,815
Hello.

538
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,822
Well done. Let's go.

539
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,928
You there.

540
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,313
I don't know you.

541
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,941
You over there.

542
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:18,113
Take a break and have some of this.
They're freshly made mung bean pancakes.

543
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,449
Just look at this color.
It smells amazing.

544
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,160
They taste the best
when they're warm. Eat up.

545
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,454
Look at the color.
You need to hurry up and eat.

546
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:29,124
Come and sit. Come on, you guys.
Come and take a break to eat.

547
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,085
Eat up.

548
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:35,130
My goodness. Maybe it's
because there's a party today.

549
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,716
-There are so many new faces.
-Enjoy. Go on.

550
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,802
It's good. It's really good.

551
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,973
Why is this trading group so big?

552
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,688
The trade ledger and medicinal herbs…

553
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,357
Medicinal herbs…

554
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,036
The ledger…

555
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,010
What are you doing here?

556
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,139
You can't be in here. You need to leave.

557
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,057
I was looking for the bathroom.

558
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,436
Oh, my goodness.

559
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,276
I'm here. This is it. Yeokcham!

560
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:43,615
I'm so very late!

561
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,827
I'm going. I'm going to get that.

562
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,706
-I finally remember!
-I'm coming!

563
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,919
I brought a letter.

564
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,922
What? Get lost.

565
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,103
Keep it down. Please.

566
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,818
Help me.

567
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,501
Are you all right?

568
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,503
My lord.

569
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,590
What happened?

570
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,093
My lord, what are you doing here?

571
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,598
I was searching the house
and heard you scream.

572
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,309
That's what led me here.

573
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,188
There's no time to waste.

574
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,982
If you're caught lurking around here…

575
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,782
Then you're dead.

576
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,077
Oh, no. What should I do?

577
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,423
What did I tell you?

578
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,258
If he didn't return within 15 minutes,

579
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,927
he was a rat.

580
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:12,264
You know, I was being genuine.

581
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,724
It was you, Pal-soon.

582
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,393
This is your last chance

583
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,437
to explain yourself.

584
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,982
I'm sorry.

585
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:26,236
This is a misunderstanding.
We didn't go in there to steal.

586
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,738
He just got lost

587
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,865
-and stepped on a trap--
-He got lost

588
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,950
and walked into
someone else's storage shed?

589
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:35,495
It's all because I was careless.

590
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:40,125
Your storage shed is
so grand and magnificent.

591
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,754
I just couldn't help myself
from taking a look. I shouldn't have.

592
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,464
I apologize.

593
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,259
How dare you still act like a nobleman?

594
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,017
Are you really with Saheonbu?

595
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,445
Hey.

596
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,406
Drag them away and search them.

597
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,616
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

598
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,746
Letter.

599
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,542
Wake up!

600
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,044
-Why you…
-My lord.

601
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,462
He is my husband.

602
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:58,453
This damn husband of mine.
I'm about to die from being driven mad!

603
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,123
You keep failing the state exams,
yet you learn no lesson.

604
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,375
You told me you'd live
in a temple to study.

605
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:06,461
Are you going around
looking for parties and drinking again?

606
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,379
What?

607
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,925
When are you going to grow up?

608
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,345
You squandered away the fields
and farmland your father gave you.

609
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,639
How much longer will you live like this?

610
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,767
-You're killing me!
-Wait.

611
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,227
Hold on!

612
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:27,899
I made a mistake. Forgive me.

613
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,363
-Let's die together!
-Wait!

614
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,919
Enough!

615
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,516
Are you really his wife?

616
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:07,898
I am. How nice would it be if I wasn't?

617
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:12,110
You don't know how frustrating it is
to have a husband like him.

618
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,531
Actually,

619
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,825
I wouldn't mind at all

620
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,745
if you went ahead
and killed this man here.

621
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,705
I'm just sick and tired of him.

622
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,916
I wish he were gone.

623
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,130
What are you doing?

624
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,803
If you two are really married,

625
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,806
then kiss.

626
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:42,933
What?

627
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,648
Either kiss

628
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:54,903
or yell out, "His Majesty the King
is a rotten bastard!"

629
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:55,821
What?

630
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:13,338
What do you say?

631
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,714
Why is he hesitating?

632
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,385
He's never kissed anyone before.

633
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,558
Would calling His Majesty the King
a rotten bastard be better?

634
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,314
His Majesty the King…

635
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,197
His Majesty the King is a rot--

636
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,928
Even if you have no desire
to be successful,

637
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,140
how could you even think
about insulting His Majesty the King?

638
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,602
In front of all these people!
What if someone reports you?

639
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:13,231
You'll be arrested for contempt
and face capital punishment!

640
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,985
The backup forces will be here soon.
Just hang in there.

641
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,197
And you, my lords!

642
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,783
I understand
that my husband made a mistake,

643
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,995
but how could you create
such a preposterous situation?

644
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:30,123
You all must be aware that
you may not speak ill of the sovereign,

645
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,750
even as a joke.

646
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,258
You have no shame.

647
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:45,680
Are you that easy of a woman
to not think of kissing as a big deal?

648
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,272
I'm not easy.

649
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:57,692
But,

650
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,945
so what if I were?

651
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,282
Is that so?

652
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,411
Then how about this?

653
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,331
If you kiss me…

654
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,084
I'll release everyone here.

655
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,294
Watch your mouth!

656
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,425
I don't care what you may think
about His Majesty the King,

657
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,594
but do not insult my wife.

658
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,439
You two are not a married couple.

659
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,235
Have you ever seen a married couple kiss?

660
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,695
That's right.

661
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:46,408
A couple that hates each other enough
to wish death upon each other

662
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:49,869
kiss in front of all these people?

663
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,622
It's as ridiculous
as eating in the outhouse.

664
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,545
Who are you?

665
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:00,588
Answer me.

666
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,551
Tell me!

667
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,812
Either let us kiss

668
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:18,982
or let me slit her throat.

669
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,695
If you make a decision,
I'll let the rest of them live.

670
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,535
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

671
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,331
Let's settle this man to man.

672
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,836
What do you say?
Wouldn't that be more grand?

673
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,553
Make room.

674
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,737
Pick up the sword.

675
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,614
I don't want to.

676
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,828
Brother, if I learn how to use a sword,
I'll end up using it against someone.

677
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,998
I don't want to use
a knife except for when I cook.

678
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,355
I'll use this.

679
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,690
What are you doing?

680
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:46,152
-Go and grab the sword.
-Grab the sword. The sword!

681
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,445
My lord.

682
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,115
My lord. The sword.

683
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,283
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

684
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:35,618
THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD ACTORS
IN THIS EPISODE WAS PROPERLY ENSURED

685
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,796
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE JUN-HYUK

686
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,179
You will have to protect yourself
and the things precious to you.

687
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:58,016
The mastermind I'm looking for
may possibly be closer than I thought.

688
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,517
It must be prevented at all costs.

689
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,768
If you can't…

690
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,978
Should I kill him?

691
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,648
You need good bait to catch a big fish.

692
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,775
His Majesty the King is a rot--

693
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,694
I told you to stop.

694
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,529
Do you want to come with us to Gapbigocha?

695
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,198
Yes, I do. I want to go with you.

696
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,909
-That's too bad.
-That brat is the inspector's weakness.

697
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,911
Catch them at all costs!

698
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:22,999
