1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,772
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,251
Your Highness.

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,758
Brother!

5
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,635
Did you say
that you were scared and lonely?

6
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,389
Then having something sweet is the best!

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,934
You were right.

8
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,729
This makes me feel much better.

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,440
Then, what should we eat next?

10
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,754
Pick up the sword.

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,380
I don't want to.

12
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,882
Why don't you want to?

13
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,719
Brother,

14
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,138
it's been so long
since we last met in private.

15
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,641
Why would you waste
this precious time on training--

16
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,817
Brother, if I learn how to use a sword,
I'll end up using it against someone.

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,070
I don't want to use
a knife except for when I cook.

18
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,659
Has the world ever gone your way?

19
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,079
Has it ever gone our way?

20
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,088
In order to protect something precious,

21
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,799
you must be prepared
to do whatever it takes.

22
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,386
A day will come

23
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,098
when you will have to wield
a real sword instead of a wooden one

24
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,184
to protect yourself
and the things precious to you.

25
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,606
Even so,

26
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,776
I don't think I'll be
able to wield a real sword.

27
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,414
Your Highness…

28
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,085
Your Highness.

29
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,422
Why didn't you evacuate?

30
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,341
Safely escort him to Mount Gwanggyo.

31
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,051
-Your Highness!
-What do you mean?

32
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,054
Those barbarians don't know your face.

33
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,224
They could harm you
on your way back to the fortress.

34
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,892
I'll find my way back.

35
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,436
-But our duty is to escort--
-Did you not hear me?

36
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,687
Obey your Crown Prince!

37
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,358
You can't, Your Highness.

38
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,692
I cherish this man

39
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,570
more than my real brother.

40
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,116
Consider his life as important as mine.

41
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,577
Yes, Your Highness.

42
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,537
You can't, Your Highness.

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,040
Your Highness!

44
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,708
You can't!

45
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,876
Your Highness!

46
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,296
Your Highness. No!

47
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,422
Your Highness!

48
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,008
Your Highness!

49
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,052
Your Highness!

50
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,142
Have you been well?

51
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,120
Your Highness!

52
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,082
Please come back, Your Highness!

53
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,127
Please come back, Your Highness!

54
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,921
Please come back, Your Highness!

55
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,227
You feared that
your corruption would be exposed,

56
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,939
so you murdered Park Moo-kyung
who were inspecting the regional office.

57
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,068
And to cover up the murder,

58
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,070
you sunk the freighter.

59
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,448
Despite all that, his body was found.

60
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,826
So you attempted to get rid of it!

61
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,537
I swear I didn't kill him!

62
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,291
Even if you didn't do it yourself,
you must have aided or overlooked it.

63
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,501
This is my command.

64
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,379
Lock up the storehouse
and confiscate the seal immediately!

65
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,298
No, you can't!

66
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,221
You're the divorcee who slapped my mouth.

67
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,139
You're Bang-deuk!

68
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,394
-Royal Inspector!
-Mother!

69
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,897
You came at an opportune time, my lord!

70
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,275
We shall return home now.

71
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,986
You damn brat.

72
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,238
Your impudence knows no end.

73
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,575
Let her go.

74
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,162
How dare you use violence
in a government office?

75
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,420
I hope I'm not too late.

76
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,508
As of today, May 5th…

77
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,056
your divorce is approved.

78
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,775
The royal inspector's body was washed up?

79
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,859
It seems

80
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,362
that the inspector
dispatched to Chungcheong

81
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,863
raided the grain storehouse

82
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,949
and found out about the freighter.

83
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,326
To get rid of the evidence,
we had no choice

84
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,371
but to sink the freighter
and bury the inspector at sea.

85
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,957
Then you should've been thorough.

86
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,292
Why are you telling me this?

87
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,878
We gave you half of the taxes we embezzled

88
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,255
in exchange for protection.

89
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,800
No, you gave it to Park Tae-seo.
Why are you dragging me into this?

90
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,387
What are you trying to pull here?

91
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,556
You took everything you wanted using him!

92
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,474
How could you turn your back on us now?

93
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,767
Besides, Park Tae-seo

94
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,145
is your son, isn't he?

95
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,941
How could he be
when he's not even in the family registry?

96
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,450
Oh, my gosh!

97
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,580
-What?
-What's going on?

98
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,256
An assassin! Run after him!

99
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,160
Move aside!

100
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,706
Your mother is over there!

101
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,624
No!

102
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,543
You have to be the one
to protect her now, not me.

103
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,048
-Grow up already!
-Mother!

104
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,183
My lord!

105
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,062
The marketplace will be chaotic
because it's Dano today.

106
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,190
If your men crash in there
without warning, people might get hurt.

107
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:48,152
How about your men block
the streets leading to the marketplace

108
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,862
and just a few chase after him?

109
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,073
Listen up.

110
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,659
Block all the streets
leading to the marketplace

111
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,828
and surround the village walls
so the assassin cannot escape.

112
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,414
-No one is to get hurt. Understood?
-Yes, sir!

113
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,415
Yook-chil, Gu-pal.

114
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,376
-Yes, sir.
-We will go after the assassin.

115
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,087
-Yes, sir.
-I'll lead the way if you need me to.

116
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,005
I know this town very well.

117
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,090
Lead the way.

118
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,552
How will you keep up with a horse?

119
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,553
Get up here.

120
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,523
You should've at least
stopped the dispatch of another inspector.

121
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,025
You should've at least
stopped it for your safety!

122
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,737
Did I sink the freighter?

123
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,116
Or did I kill the royal inspector?

124
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,077
What did I do for you
to dare voice your concern about my safety

125
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,370
and threaten me?

126
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,125
If you made a mess,

127
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,129
kill all the witnesses and those involved

128
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,215
or take your own life.

129
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,509
Take care of it on your own.

130
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,974
Please help me, my lord.

131
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,564
What has Tae-seo done to your face?

132
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,900
He should have just killed you.

133
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,073
Giddy up!

134
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,790
Giddy up!

135
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,099
Halt.

136
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,106
This way.

137
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,525
Move!

138
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,860
Make way!

139
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,153
Yook-chil, Gu-pal.

140
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,031
Do not draw any attention.

141
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,283
We need to move cautiously.

142
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,202
Let's go.

143
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,205
Move quietly.

144
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,859
Did we lose him?

145
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,695
-We have to find him.
-How do we find him in this mess?

146
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,782
I told them to block all the streets,
so he couldn't have gone far.

147
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,537
Just a moment.

148
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:13,858
Watch out!

149
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,954
-What was that?
-Oh, my goodness.

150
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,122
My lord!

151
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,257
Get him!

152
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,300
That way!

153
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,597
Stop right there!

154
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,895
-Damn it. This way, Gu-pal.
-Yes, sir.

155
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,233
That way!

156
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,777
-Be careful!
-Move aside!

157
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,070
Gu-pal!

158
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,499
Stop. I want him alive.

159
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,918
My lord, over there.

160
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,854
-Get him!
-Get him!

161
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,535
Are you all right?

162
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,870
What?

163
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,499
Yes.

164
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,378
Thanks to your quick wit,

165
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,964
we captured the assassin
without anyone getting hurt.

166
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,299
I'm more grateful
that I could be of assistance.

167
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,555
Besides, I regained my life thanks to you.

168
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,642
Thank you very much.

169
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,649
No.

170
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,319
You regained it yourself

171
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,029
with your courage.

172
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,581
I wish to reward you,
so tell me if there's anything you desire.

173
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,708
Do you mean it?

174
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,004
If I really can,

175
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,090
there is a favor I'd like to ask.

176
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,092
Go on then.

177
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,306
I'd like to make
a grave for my friend, Bo-ri.

178
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,851
Do you mean the maiden who ran the tavern?

179
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,603
Yes.

180
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,314
Although there's no body
because it was burned,

181
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,568
I wish to at least
bury her spirit in a sunny spot

182
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,778
to let her rest in peace.

183
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,913
You are on your own
now that you're divorced.

184
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,791
I can submit a byeoldan to reward you.
How do you feel about a reward?

185
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,918
A reward?

186
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,337
As in prize money?

187
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,468
No, it's fine.

188
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,804
I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

189
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,641
I decided to get a divorce

190
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,143
because I didn't want
any more regrets in my life.

191
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,730
I'm going to stop
living a life with regret.

192
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,072
-My lord.
-The culprit is ready to be transported.

193
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,198
Let's go, my lord.

194
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,783
-Let go of me!
-Stay still!

195
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,910
I will not interrogate you.

196
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,792
The moment you were arrested,
you failed your mission.

197
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,294
The ones who hired you
will kill you anyway.

198
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,047
Or, since you have committed murder,

199
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,051
sentencing you to death
right now is also an option.

200
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,179
But if there are
extenuating circumstances,

201
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,390
I may show you
some form of mercy or another,

202
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,684
but I'm sure you won't
reveal the one behind this.

203
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,812
Am I wrong?

204
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,612
Am I wrong?

205
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,707
Think about it carefully.

206
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,210
Are those that you're
risking your life to protect

207
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,629
worth that much?

208
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,093
-Lock him up.
-Yes, sir.

209
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,354
They sent someone
who can't speak on purpose.

210
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,405
We don't know when they'll send
another assassin, so stay alert.

211
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,284
A report has been submitted,
so Hanyang will send instructions.

212
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,747
All of you must oversee
the district until then.

213
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,499
Pardon?

214
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,878
Will you not be doing that yourself?

215
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,510
I received a royal decree
to inspect all of Chungcheong Province.

216
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,637
I cannot stay here for much longer.

217
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,014
I know things are chaotic,

218
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,642
but you must do your duty

219
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,268
in your post.

220
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,812
Yes, my lord.

221
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,279
Oh, but my lord…

222
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,204
According to the ojagin,
the assassin's arrow

223
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,498
was made from an aconite root.

224
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,545
-Aconite?
-Yes, sir.

225
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,756
Aconite is used

226
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,843
for medicinal purposes in the palace.

227
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,303
Yes. It's known
as the best base for a tonic.

228
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,891
However, if misused,
it could be used as a base for poison.

229
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,187
The base for a poison?

230
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,022
What do you mean?

231
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,943
Many people know aconite
to be a medicinal herb,

232
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,946
but depending on the way it's used,

233
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,073
it can also be poisonous.

234
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,253
I have an abscess on my back.

235
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,507
What did you use to make the medicine?

236
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,387
I used aconite.

237
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:47,060
It's an herb civilians
are prohibited from cultivating.

238
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,231
If aconite was used,
those behind this are in no way ordinary.

239
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,859
Please, be careful.

240
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,246
My lord.

241
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,291
Let's quickly move on
to the next restaurant.

242
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,420
What are we having next?

243
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,546
It was aconite.

244
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,799
Aconite?

245
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,968
Is that the name of a dish?

246
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,553
Does it taste good?

247
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,348
What?

248
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,810
Me coming here was divine intervention.

249
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,939
We must hurry.

250
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:35,359
Before people hear about
a secret royal inspector digging around,

251
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,527
we'll trace the route the freighter took.

252
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:43,116
I shall get to the bottom of this case.

253
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,295
Gu-pal. It seems our restaurant tour
has been postponed.

254
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,634
Gosh.

255
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,475
They say that
even furniture harbors memories.

256
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,821
All of you should forget me.

257
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,418
What is all this you packed?

258
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,337
Being kicked out with nothing
wouldn't be good enough.

259
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,797
You dare collect alimony?

260
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,715
Not a chance.

261
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,591
Your jars of alcohol…

262
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,969
-I broke all of them yesterday.
-What?

263
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,429
Because I hate you.

264
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,932
That was the last act of revenge
as your daughter-in-law.

265
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,184
You little…

266
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,604
You're just going out of your way
to act like a dirtbag, aren't you?

267
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,900
How dare you break
those precious jars of herbal liquor!

268
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,698
Even if you get sick,

269
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,284
he has no money
because of his gambling debts.

270
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,788
So don't buy alcohol with this.

271
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,833
Make sure to save it
and use it for medicine later.

272
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,629
How dare you try
to lecture your mother-in-law?

273
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,383
You insolent brat!

274
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,636
The alcohol inspectors might come.
So don't make your own alcohol.

275
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,430
Why do you care?

276
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,307
You said that we're strangers now!

277
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,853
Damn it.

278
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,397
You said that we're strangers now.

279
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,237
You vicious brat!

280
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,407
Go back inside.
When did you ever see me out?

281
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,326
You…

282
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,329
You really can't do this.

283
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,039
I'll forgive everything.

284
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,957
I'll give you one field of barley.

285
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,544
A tenth of a patch.

286
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,010
Just come back!

287
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,012
Are you deaf?

288
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,474
Can she not hear me?

289
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,647
Where are you going?

290
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,486
This is quite a lot.
How did she save all this?

291
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,865
Pardon? He left already?

292
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,700
This case is a complete mess.

293
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,828
He must have a lot
to report back at Hanyang.

294
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,454
He left in a hurry.

295
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:40,001
Then did he, by any chance,
mention where he was heading next?

296
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,838
Don't be ridiculous.

297
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,091
He's a secret inspector so acts in secret.

298
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,510
So of course, he didn't tell me.

299
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,138
That makes sense.

300
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,520
Maybe I should've accepted
the reward when he offered it.

301
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:03,400
Before I forget,
he asked me to give you this.

302
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,070
What is this?

303
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,786
He said you should go there.

304
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,131
Hey, woman. Stop right there.

305
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,301
Did you think
we'd just let you go peacefully?

306
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,136
You think divorce is a joke?

307
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,221
Listen, a man and a woman--

308
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,140
That hurts!

309
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,395
-Hey!
-Watch it!

310
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,820
Goodness.

311
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,909
You're too tough for a woman!

312
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,744
You'll have a rough life!

313
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,080
Like mother, like daughter!

314
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,541
Her mother returned
after being dragged away to Qing,

315
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,376
but she didn't even end her life!

316
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,713
You are a disgrace to our village!
A disgrace!

317
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,970
My friend.

318
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,223
You've worked hard.

319
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,934
Well done.

320
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,047
Goodness.

321
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,674
Are you leaving now?

322
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,470
Child.

323
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,934
What is this?

324
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:29,105
They're trumpet creeper seeds.

325
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:33,485
They're precious flowers
that nobles plant in their yard.

326
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,655
Do you know what this flower symbolizes?

327
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,284
Honor.

328
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,541
They say that even the southern skies
could not stop this flower from blooming.

329
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,836
I'll be rooting for you.

330
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,298
Never bend to someone else's will
or give in.

331
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,805
Take care of yourself.

332
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,182
Thank you.

333
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,100
Of course.

334
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,570
Jo-yi!

335
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,698
You've worked hard!

336
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,242
Take care!

337
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,994
You made the right decision!

338
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,622
Don't ever come back here!

339
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,501
Fly away freely like a butterfly
and live a good life!

340
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,504
My lord.

341
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,215
-Hello, there.
-This way.

342
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,383
Make way.

343
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,887
I heard this scumbag
is going to hold a banquet.

344
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,139
Why make a fuss with banquets and whatnot?

345
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,641
We have a banquet every month.

346
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,686
It's different this time
because there's a reason.

347
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,687
A reason?

348
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,940
Tae-seo successfully
pulled off cupellation.

349
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,860
Cupellation?

350
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,197
Isn't that when you separate
pure silver from silver ores?

351
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,449
Is that true?

352
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,410
Congratulations!

353
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,997
How could the King look down
on that precious technology?

354
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,792
Isn't Tae-seo much better than the King?

355
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,668
Of course, he is.

356
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,922
Getting Joseon in your grasp
is just a matter of time.

357
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,466
Isn't the King

358
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,968
so pathetic?

359
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,680
He has no idea
what's going on in the world.

360
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:12,602
He just sits on his throne
trying to hold onto that position.

361
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,568
Father, I'm glad you are here--

362
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,742
Nobody move.

363
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,666
I need all of you here

364
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,335
to humiliate him.

365
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,632
-Father.
-Shut up!

366
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,469
If any of you were foolish enough to think

367
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,264
that you could gain scraps
by sticking around him,

368
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,392
remember what you just saw.

369
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,234
Father…

370
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,152
Father.

371
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,448
Father.

372
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,784
Father.

373
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,661
I was the fool

374
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,540
for putting a punk like you to work,
thinking you'd be useful.

375
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,294
I have no idea what you mean.

376
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,548
If I told you to steal something,

377
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,175
you shouldn't have left even
a trace of a breath behind.

378
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,262
Thanks to you, the idiot
that forgot to clean up after himself,

379
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,472
rumors about a warehouse
in the south being robbed

380
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,516
are running rampant.

381
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,644
It'll be better

382
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,898
if I bury you myself, don't you agree?

383
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,779
Father, I…

384
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,741
For you…

385
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,036
I did everything

386
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,330
you asked me to do.

387
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,248
I told you to do it with no loose ends!

388
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,506
I hear a secret royal inspector
was murdered

389
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,051
and the ledger is lost.

390
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,930
The next inspector from Hongmungwan

391
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,723
will be after you now.

392
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,434
Want to know what I think?

393
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,355
I think it'll be best

394
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,941
if you take the fall for everything,

395
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:26,694
let the inspector take you away,
and disappear from the world.

396
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,369
Tae-seo.

397
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:06,651
Don't disappoint your father.

398
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,868
My son.

399
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:29,882
Yes.

400
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,802
Father.

401
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,601
Get up!

402
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,982
Go and kill
the new secret royal inspector.

403
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,568
How can we find a secret royal inspector?

404
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,779
Just kill them all.

405
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,532
The secret royal inspector…

406
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,869
or someone that looks like one.

407
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,959
If I hear the inspector has returned
to Hanyang after fulfilling his duties,

408
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,589
all of you will be dead.

409
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,903
Why would you burn
these precious rice cakes?

410
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,697
Exactly. We should be
licking and sucking on them.

411
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,699
Come now. If you roast them like this,

412
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,701
they'll be crispy on the outside
and chewy on the inside.

413
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,411
It enhances the flavors.

414
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,623
That's roasted well.

415
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,418
Take out the soft persimmons
we got from Gaehwa Valley.

416
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,628
Soft persimmons?

417
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,138
Wait.

418
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,140
Here.

419
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,526
Why do that to the sweet persimmon?

420
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:18,616
Here.

421
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:55,027
See? You know how much
of a gourmet master I am.

422
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,070
It's good, isn't it?

423
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,032
Soft persimmons aid digestion
and are great for hangovers…

424
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,660
"Great for hangovers…"
He started another lecture.

425
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,163
No wonder he's a Hongmungwan official
who passed the state exam.

426
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,999
Doesn't every word
of the sentence sound annoying?

427
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,500
It has many benefits…

428
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,502
Go chew on some rocks,
you wicked bastards!

429
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,420
"Go chew on--"

430
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,257
Here.

431
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,016
Did the Crown Prince
enjoy soft persimmons as a snack, too?

432
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:29,770
What?

433
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:39,655
It's already been over a year

434
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,949
since the Crown Prince left us.

435
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,744
He's not gone.

436
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,040
I still see him often.

437
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,668
Every night, in my sleep.

438
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,464
Who else would I dream about

439
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,549
but the Crown Prince?

440
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,635
Brother!

441
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,474
You were always by my side.

442
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,362
He was the one
who saved my life in the war.

443
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:23,157
I cherish this man
more than my real brother.

444
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,742
Even when he returned to Joseon

445
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,994
after nine years
of being held hostage in Qing,

446
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,996
I was

447
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,624
the first person he asked for.

448
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,753
-He always…
-Your Highness.

449
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,505
put me first.

450
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,470
His Highness…

451
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,265
protected me.

452
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,395
But I…

453
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,190
wasn't able to protect him.

454
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,538
I'll be taking a nap.

455
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,498
Wake me up in a short while.

456
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,084
We need to pass that hill
before nightfall.

457
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,088
Have you decided on our next destination?

458
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,925
We'll be heading to Gongjinchang,

459
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,928
where the grain
from the freighter came from.

460
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,745
I'm sure this is the way to the dock…

461
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,430
But what are you going to do
after you get divorced?

462
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,766
I'll go to Hanyang.
I heard that at the dock,

463
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,768
there's a large ship that goes to Hanyang.

464
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,728
There must be a lot of nobles in Hanyang.

465
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,731
I will be able to make money
by making clothes for the ladies.

466
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,108
You know I'm pretty good
at making clothes.

467
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,196
Can't you just forget
about getting a divorce

468
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,114
and just put up with your husband?

469
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,949
No, I don't want to do that.

470
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,868
I don't want to live like this anymore.

471
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:36,207
And above all else,
I want to find my mother.

472
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,848
But Bo-ri,

473
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,435
before even beginning my fresh start,

474
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,480
I think I'm lost.

475
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,732
Giddy up!

476
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:09,949
Giddy up!

477
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,460
My lord.

478
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,421
I don't think

479
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,173
this is the way.

480
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,928
How is this a path for people?
It clearly leads to the afterlife.

481
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:33,639
If we take the path that most people take,

482
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,101
we might come across a tiger.

483
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,102
Are you sure

484
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,896
you're going in the right direction?

485
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,648
Do not worry. Here.

486
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,609
Once we get past this hill,
we'll see a path.

487
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,156
Maybe this isn't the right way.

488
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:34,867
What?

489
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,087
Bo-ri.

490
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,340
There's a shrine here. Isn't that cool?

491
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,844
Someone even lit the candles.

492
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,740
Right.

493
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,285
It'd be better to rest here
than to wander around out there.

494
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,667
I'm sure the spirits will look after me
if I stay close to the shrine.

495
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,629
Excuse me for a moment.

496
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,644
These are all wishes made by people?

497
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,438
Everyone is desperate.

498
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:42,077
Fly away freely like a butterfly
and live a good life!

499
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:46,582
Never bend to someone else's will
or give in.

500
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,442
You regained your life yourself

501
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,612
with your courage.

502
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,282
Why…

503
00:44:21,825 --> 00:44:23,869
Why did I think about Bang-deuk?

504
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,413
I must have gone crazy.

505
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,083
It's because I was in a weird position.

506
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,669
Let's lie down. That'll be better.

507
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:37,257
I must be losing it.
This isn't like me at all.

508
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,151
Found it!

509
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,157
I found it! Finally!

510
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,248
We almost died
because you have no sense of direction.

511
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,125
But we made it. We're alive!

512
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,836
If he wasn't our lord,
I would've killed him on the spot.

513
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,087
But we're alive!

514
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,338
We're alive!

515
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,132
What?

516
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,259
We're alive. That's all that matters.

517
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,177
-Gu-pal, run!
-Yes.

518
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,846
You punks. Stop right there!

519
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,348
You punks.

520
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,641
Stop right there!

521
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,143
-Gu-pal, run!
-Yes.

522
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,394
Stop right there!

523
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,399
What is it? Where is it? Who is it?

524
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,742
You're…

525
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,453
Bang-deuk…

526
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,170
Royal Inspector?

527
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,222
So…

528
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,725
you were sleeping here?

529
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:10,893
By yourself?

530
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:14,354
I was just taking a short break
because I didn't know where to go,

531
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,483
but I guess I fell asleep
because I was so tired.

532
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,819
Anyway, I'm sorry.

533
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,238
Are you all right?

534
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,657
No matter how tired you are,

535
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,910
you can't fall asleep in the mountains.

536
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,330
You'd be in danger
if you ran into thieves or wild animals.

537
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,624
After all you've been through
to get a divorce,

538
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,295
how could you sleep
in front of a creepy shrine like this?

539
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,213
Right.

540
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,632
Thank you for making Bo-ri's--

541
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,258
Yes, it's a shrine!

542
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,014
So that's why.

543
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,725
Pardon?

544
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,268
Well…

545
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,021
Are you not aware?

546
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,607
What? What is it this time?

547
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,735
This is why I have no choice
but to lecture you all.

548
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,570
What? What did we do now?

549
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,490
Yes, my lord.
What do we not know this time?

550
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:11,078
If there's a divorced woman
standing in front of a shrine,

551
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:18,752
the first man she comes across
must take her to be his wife.

552
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:21,505
That's the custom in Joseon.
It's called seubcheob.

553
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,756
-Seubcheob?
-Seubcheob?

554
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:27,761
If that man is not married,
he must marry the divorced woman.

555
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,556
If the man is already married,

556
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,684
the divorced woman becomes his concubine.

557
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,853
I had no idea.

558
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,314
That's right! I've heard of that before.

559
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:44,444
Then, were you waiting here,
hoping to find someone to remarry?

560
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,612
What?

561
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,823
No, of course not.

562
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:00,002
That's not it. I was just taking a break.
I didn't even think about seubcheob.

563
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,046
The ink on my divorce papers
hasn't even dried yet.

564
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,006
Then again,

565
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,009
there's no reason to abide by that custom.

566
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,720
How dare you! It's a serious crime!

567
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,930
If you break a custom,

568
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,142
you could be dragged
to the Uigeumbu and flogged.

569
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,063
Are they that strict?

570
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,565
I didn't know that.

571
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,359
-The law is really quite scary.
-Yes.

572
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,444
Flogging…

573
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:29,281
But thank goodness,
no one has passed by until now.

574
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,451
Hold on, if no one
has passed by until now,

575
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,953
-we're the first.
-Yes.

576
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,872
Lord Yi-eon was the first man?

577
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,290
Yes.

578
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,417
Wait.

579
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,296
The first man that she comes across
becomes her husband.

580
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,840
-That's what he said…
-That's not it. Listen, you punk.

581
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,969
Then what?
Are you saying Lord Yi-eon must…

582
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:57,017
marry her or something?
Is that what you mean?

583
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,355
-I see it now. I apologize.
-What nonsense is that?

584
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,733
Have you gone insane?

585
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,073
You're talking nonsense.

586
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,579
That's hilarious.

587
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,832
That's so funny.

588
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,148
What did I do wrong?

589
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,317
Seubcheob? Why is this happening?

590
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,444
No.

591
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,657
-This is…
-Please pretend you didn't see.

592
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,618
-Why out of all people…
-I can't.

593
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,371
-I can't remarry.
-No.

594
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:02,374
-Please pretend you didn't see.
-Maybe I'm not the first person.

595
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,126
-Maybe not.
-I can't do this.

596
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,419
-I'm not.
-I won't remarry.

597
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,753
-This is invalid.
-Please.

598
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,963
-Right.
-Hear my prayers.

599
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,297
This is invalid.

600
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,217
How many times is he going to repeat that?

601
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:13,760
Hear my prayers…

602
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,597
Let's pretend this never happened.
We never met here. What do you think?

603
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,518
We all saw it. How can we lie about that?

604
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,061
Earlier you were like,

605
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,230
"It's a serious crime!"

606
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,067
"You could be dragged to
the Uigeumbu and flogged!"

607
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,570
That's what you said.

608
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,823
Besides, he's a public official.
He can't break the law.

609
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,871
I was just talking to myself.
Why are you eavesdropping?

610
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,583
I can't.

611
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,668
Why me?

612
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,087
Why did you have to lie down there?

613
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,301
It's not like I wanted to be here.

614
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,845
I was lost and taking a short break.

615
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,932
And I didn't hear you coming
because I fell asleep.

616
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,610
Hold on.

617
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,571
Then why did you have to
walk in front of the shrine?

618
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,948
When there are a lot of other paths.

619
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,159
And why did you have to trip over my leg?

620
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,120
Who was the one who hurtled
screaming when I was sleeping?

621
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:25,332
Well, that's…

622
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:29,920
Fine.

623
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,506
I apologize for stepping on your leg.

624
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,885
But…

625
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:40,430
I have no intention of getting married!

626
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,817
I even forced myself
to take the difficult state exam

627
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,110
because I didn't want to get married.

628
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,863
My grandmother went
on a hunger strike for six days,

629
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,866
telling me to either
get married or take the exam.

630
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,912
That's why I had no choice
but to choose the lesser of two evils.

631
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,206
-That's true.
-Yes.

632
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,749
He did.

633
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,209
Do you understand now?

634
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:13,839
Do you understand now
what I despise the most in this world?

635
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,680
Then,

636
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,433
do you know what I despise
the most in this world?

637
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:32,357
It's not my forced marriage
or the divorce I barely got.

638
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,820
It's remarrying a man I'm not in the least
attracted to who's arrogant and selfish!

639
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,370
She called him arrogant.

640
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:46,580
And selfish.

641
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,708
Fine. I understand.

642
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,043
Let's never cross paths again.

643
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,337
Yes. Why would we ever meet again?

644
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,881
-My point exactly!
-My point exactly!

645
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,222
-My lord!
-My lord!

646
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,682
-My lord!
-My lord!

647
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:28,914
My lord!

648
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,501
Don't move. You'll be dead if you do.

649
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,631
Collect all their bags.

650
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,175
And tie them up with some ropes.

651
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,426
-Okay!
-Okay!

652
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,720
Who are you people?

653
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,848
My goodness, what a temper. Damn it.

654
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,272
How is a woman so strong?

655
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,067
She might be stronger than a man.

656
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,653
Do you know who this is?

657
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,408
This man is…

658
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,451
Who else could he be?

659
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,370
Your husband.

660
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:10,872
-No!
-No!

661
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,666
What?

662
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,168
What do you mean no?

663
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,963
We heard you talking
about seubcheob in front of the shrine.

664
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,882
-Was I the only one?
-We all heard it.

665
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,510
-We're the witnesses.
-I heard it, too.

666
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,263
All these people saw and heard it,
so stop lying!

667
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,391
Listen…

668
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,021
I'll bury you together
like the seubcheob couple you are.

669
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,191
Let's bury them quickly and leave.

670
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:39,609
-Okay!
-Okay!

671
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,278
-How dare you!
-Hold on.

672
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,780
-Hold on.
-I didn't move.

673
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,865
-Hold on.
-Let go of me!

674
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:46,992
Let go of me!

675
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,469
Can't you just tell them
you're a secret royal inspector?

676
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,638
No, I can't.
It'll set back the investigation.

677
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,641
Since when did you have a sense of duty?
We're all about to die!

678
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,893
Show them the horse plaque
and yell at them now.

679
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,562
I can't reveal my identity!

680
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:18,606
-To find the culprit--
-Reveal your identity first,

681
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,358
then you can look for the culprit.

682
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,069
Then why bother
hiding identities in the first place?

683
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,655
Hey.

684
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:32,871
Hey, Brother!

685
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,539
Did you eat?

686
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,833
Yes. How's your eldest?

687
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:39,252
He's growing up so well.

688
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,546
What are you doing down there?

689
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,298
We're digging a hole.

690
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,050
To bury them.

691
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,928
They were in front
of the shrine for seubcheob,

692
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,305
so we robbed them.

693
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,975
By the way, where are you going
in this pitch darkness?

694
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,895
Are you on your way to catch
an inspector like last time?

695
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,857
Watch your mouth
and make sure you bury them well.

696
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,817
Or the bodies will pop out when it rains.

697
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:06,154
And if you see anyone escaping
from the merchants, bring them to me.

698
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,113
Let's go.

699
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,031
Okay.

700
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,699
Good luck.

701
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,661
Why are you so heavy?

702
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,208
It's all done.

703
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,431
-Are you all right?
-Do I look okay?

704
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,100
I'm not okay, either.

705
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,105
It looks like they're really
going to bury us alive.

706
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,149
What do we do now? Do something!

707
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:45,527
My goodness!

708
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,364
Thanks to our unprepared lord,
I'm about to die as a bachelor!

709
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:52,117
Our lord? We're about to die.
Who cares about our lord?

710
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,618
I met the wrong lord.

711
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:54,786
You're still young.

712
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,955
-How is he a lord?
-I'll die as a bachelor!

713
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,915
Be quiet. Let me think.

714
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,505
Hello?

715
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:09,926
Hey!

716
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,312
What just happened?

717
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,234
Was my yelling that scary?

718
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,987
A tiger must have shown up.

719
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,197
-A tiger.
-No, it wasn't an animal.

720
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:34,325
Then what could it be?
You're scaring me even more.

721
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,703
We need to get out of here first.

722
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,788
Let's cut this rope first.
I need your help.

723
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,958
You need to do it.

724
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,961
If you reach inside my robe,
you should find a vernier. Hurry.

725
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,090
We don't have time. Just do it.

726
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,384
All right.

727
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,052
Excuse me for a moment.

728
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:02,812
I got it.

729
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,442
I modified it just in case.

730
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,944
-Now open it.
-Okay.

731
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,198
Good.

732
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,825
That's right. You punks.

733
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:19,871
You never need to worry
about our Lord Yi-eon, you punks!

734
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:23,917
Exactly. Our lord is fully prepared.
Right, my lord?

735
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,462
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

736
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,671
Let's go.

737
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,006
My lord.

738
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,591
What about us?

739
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,512
Why would I?
You said I wasn't your lord anymore.

740
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,764
It hurts.

741
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,849
Come on, my lord. Just this once.

742
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,646
I can't believe these guys.

743
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,693
Almost.

744
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,362
Almost.

745
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,821
There we go!

746
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,165
Grab it.

747
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,627
Hurry up and grab it.

748
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:51,921
Climb up now.

749
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,050
Hurry.

750
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,358
How is your grip stronger than a man's?

751
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,028
Our lord's hands are delicate as ferns.

752
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,698
Try carrying around the water jug
and doing laundry and housework.

753
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,158
You end up with a strong grip.

754
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,367
Is housework that hard?

755
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,119
You punks. Stop blabbering.

756
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,912
Help me too!

757
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:08,247
-What's wrong?
-Look…

758
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,250
-Over there.
-Where?

759
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,376
You're about to be completely exposed

760
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,877
because he couldn't
take care of one inspector.

761
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:56,921
My mother is also a hwanhyangnyeo.

762
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,215
I want to help out in any way I can.

763
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,634
Ruffians working with the merchants
are controlling the village, and

764
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,553
are all armed with swords.

765
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,263
Those bastards are completely insane.

766
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,181
We must acquire concrete evidence.

767
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,892
Pretty Girl, where are you from?

768
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,978
We must teach a lesson to brats like her.

769
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,479
Do not insult my wife.

770
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,149
Who are you?
I don't think he is one of us.

771
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,360
Who are you? Tell me!

772
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:25,408
