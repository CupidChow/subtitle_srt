1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,400
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,367
You should

4
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,828
be taking me to the Uigeumbu.

5
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,663
What are you trying to pull?

6
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,248
We will.

7
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,347
However, before we go,

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,267
there's something you must do.

9
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,777
Due to your unjust, tyrannical acts,

10
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,488
these people have lost their family,

11
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:15,241
friends, lives, and homes.

12
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,120
You must apologize to them first.

13
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,955
What?

14
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,707
Apologize?

15
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,209
All they want from you

16
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:28,004
is your sincere remorse and apology.

17
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,216
How ignorant and foolish you are.

18
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,053
How could you know so little
about how the world works?

19
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,557
Remorse?

20
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,976
Think about it carefully.

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,353
If I

22
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,064
had a conscience,

23
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,399
how could I have gained such power?

24
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,654
That's enough nonsense about remorse.

25
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,198
Hurry up and take me to the Uigeumbu.

26
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,367
I will go and receive my punishment there!

27
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,091
Do you now understand
why we took you here, not to the Uigeumbu?

28
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,260
Why you cursed little…

29
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,095
You should be careful with your words.

30
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,516
You could end up
losing your head, my lord.

31
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,853
What did I do so wrong?

32
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,896
To get power,

33
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,024
you broke the moral laws
and did inhumane things.

34
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,445
You held people in contempt
and mocked justice!

35
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,823
How is that a crime?

36
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:42,453
Desiring riches and yearning for power
is all part of human nature.

37
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,415
I only did what I was able to.

38
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,585
You're the incompetent one
for not being able to!

39
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:52,005
Being human doesn't mean
taking other people's lives

40
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,215
or disregarding

41
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,593
the ways of the world

42
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,054
to get what you want.

43
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,474
That is just the instinct of a beast.

44
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,019
Since

45
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,938
you even fall short of being a brute,

46
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,027
may I behead you now?

47
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,282
Listen.

48
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,034
How…

49
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,660
How about

50
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,080
we talk it out between us noblemen?

51
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,917
There's a distinction
between the noble and common,

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,045
and the aristocracy must keep face.

53
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,429
Good.

54
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,058
Send away those of lowly birth.

55
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,643
And let's…

56
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,521
Let us talk it out like human beings.

57
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,982
Using words…

58
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,782
Young Master!

59
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,987
Will you seek forgiveness…

60
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,906
or choose death?

61
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,165
If I have to ask
those lowly creatures for forgiveness,

62
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,667
I would rather you killed me.

63
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,471
But death is
too light a punishment for you.

64
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,227
I'll make sure you live
a life worse than death.

65
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,366
Take the criminal to the Uigeumbu!

66
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,367
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

67
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,389
My lord.

68
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,892
He more than deserves to die.
Why did you let him live?

69
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,355
He isn't even worth killing.

70
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:59,609
I was only hoping
for a sign of repentance.

71
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,612
He will properly pay for his crimes.

72
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,572
He's getting what he deserves.

73
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,409
What will happen to them now?

74
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,954
Park Do-soo will be exiled
to a place 1,200km away

75
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,456
and then isolated.

76
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,335
How exactly will he be isolated?

77
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,922
A thorny fence will be installed
around the residence,

78
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,508
and the main gate
will always be locked with a padlock.

79
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,928
He'll be confined
and secluded from the outside world.

80
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,264
How many rooms will that house have?

81
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,434
Are there servants?

82
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,103
Have you lost your mind?

83
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,985
It's really over now.

84
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,987
Well done, my lord.

85
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,698
-Well done, sir.
-Well done, sir.

86
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,122
This is all thanks to you guys.

87
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,127
Let's all

88
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,337
go home now.

89
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,297
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

90
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,633
We can go home now!

91
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,766
Park Seung will be removed from office
and face death by boiling.

92
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,976
Death by boiling?

93
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,646
They'll put him into a cauldron
and pretend to boil him.

94
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,273
After he is taken out,

95
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,900
he'll be treated as if he were dead.

96
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,449
GHOST

97
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,117
Listen.

98
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,786
If I need to urinate…

99
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,371
How dare a ghost speak?

100
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,039
Just asking for it!

101
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,626
Here, you can pee in this.

102
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,219
Do you remember me?

103
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,187
You…

104
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,524
You're Tae-seo's mother,
the one that ran away.

105
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,027
You do remember me, then.

106
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,237
A slave who ran away from her master…

107
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,365
You should've died and disappeared
from the face of the earth.

108
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,534
How dare you show up like this?

109
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,371
What a brazen, lowly creature you are.

110
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,210
Do-soo is one
of the lowly creatures you speak of.

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,089
Do-soo has three red spots
on his back, does he not?

112
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,592
How…

113
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,471
do you know
about the red spots on his back?

114
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,348
Because he's my child.

115
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,351
I didn't want him to live being scorned,

116
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,937
so I switched the babies.

117
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,688
What on earth…

118
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,983
are you talking about?

119
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,152
Tae-seo is the legitimate son,

120
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,362
not Do-soo!

121
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,032
The one that you used as a pawn

122
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:58,037
before you mercilessly got rid of
when he got in the way.

123
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,207
He's your legitimate son!

124
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,761
I've been waiting for this day.

125
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,598
I will pay for my crimes with Do-soo.

126
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,350
I hope

127
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,312
you spend the rest of your days
being tormented in hell

128
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,815
while you painfully inch towards death.

129
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,036
Father…

130
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,751
Let's go now.

131
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,379
No…

132
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,006
Just wait and see.

133
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,010
You will die soon enough,

134
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,387
and you will remember this day

135
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,141
and cry tears of blood.

136
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,227
No…

137
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:07,064
Do-soo! No… Tae-seo! Tae-soo…

138
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,068
No…

139
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,281
No!

140
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,590
Ten out of ten

141
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,302
Again and again and again…

142
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,264
My lord.

143
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,933
What's the matter?

144
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,438
I…

145
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,731
What? What is it?

146
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,113
I have resigned!

147
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,077
Our lord is finally unemployed!

148
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,747
-Dreams do come true!
-That's right, punks!

149
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,000
Starting today, I'll be
rolling around on the floor and living

150
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,710
-an idle life.
-Yes!

151
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,420
-Idle life!
-Idle life!

152
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,089
We'll just play, eat, and sleep.

153
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,715
So happy!

154
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,217
Oh, yes! Nice!

155
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,677
We'll just play, eat, and sleep.

156
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,305
I can live as a man about town.

157
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,268
-About town!
-Yes! Oh, yes! Yes! Nice!

158
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,691
-We're not missing anything?
-No.

159
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,444
We can sell the rest at the market.

160
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,786
Gwang-soon. Bi-ryeong.

161
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,497
You don't have to come with me.

162
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,542
I can always come visit Hanyang
to see you. You can stay here.

163
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,796
What are you talking about? I'm so excited
to see my brother and siblings.

164
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,674
Hey, what good is Hanyang without you?

165
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,803
I came here to be with you two. Otherwise,
I wouldn't have come to Hanyang.

166
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,516
It is a bit of a shame
because we've made a home here,

167
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,227
but I prefer going to Gapbigocha together.

168
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,605
-You were planning to go there anyway.
-That's right!

169
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,527
Thank you both so much.

170
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,821
-Don't mention it.
-Come on now.

171
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,491
When we get there,
I'll be a needlewoman like I am now

172
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,034
and Bi-ryeong, a fortune-teller.

173
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:24,952
What about you?

174
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,037
I'm thinking about opening a pharmacy.

175
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,540
A pharmacy?

176
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:34,044
I hear there are a lot of sick people
who are unable to get medicine.

177
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,212
That's what I hear.

178
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,007
There are a few things
I picked up from my father.

179
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,176
I can differentiate herbs
and know their uses,

180
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,386
so it should be helpful
if I open a pharmacy.

181
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,513
-That sounds great!
-Really?

182
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:50,394
But a seamstress shop,
a fortune-teller shop, and a pharmacy…

183
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,397
It's going to cost quite a bit
to set that all up.

184
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,774
It will, but we've been working so hard.

185
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,068
-Let's see. So far…
-Wait.

186
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,278
What?

187
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,654
The truth is,

188
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,991
I discussed this with Lord Yi-eon already.

189
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,827
Then…

190
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,163
what's next?

191
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,207
I'll open a dumpling place.

192
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,875
What?

193
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,376
You know that my dumplings

194
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,171
are good enough
to bring peace to the whole country.

195
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,215
Have you seriously lost it?

196
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,051
How can a nobleman run a dumpling place?

197
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,804
You may have resigned,
but sales are for those of lowly birth.

198
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,014
Besides,

199
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,058
your whole family
might end up being ruined.

200
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,477
Your descendants won't be
able to take the state exams.

201
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,811
I know that.

202
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,857
However, it has been my lifelong dream
to be the best chef in all of Joseon.

203
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,026
I went through all that to resign,

204
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,278
and I can't even do
the one thing I want to do?

205
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,196
I mean,

206
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,491
unless you give up your noble title
and become a commoner…

207
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,285
A nobleman can never go into sales.

208
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,330
You don't want to move up
in the world or get married.

209
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,457
And now you want to go into sales?

210
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,585
Young Master, you really
can't do this to your grandmother.

211
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,962
You know that.

212
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,798
I'm of lowly birth,

213
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,676
so I can't marry Gwang-soon.

214
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,012
But you will give up
that nice noble title? That's nonsense.

215
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,848
You can't marry her?

216
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,768
She's a physician's daughter,
so she's middle-class.

217
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,479
If she marries me,
she becomes lower-class.

218
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,692
No matter how much I love her,

219
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,903
I can't let her become lower-class.

220
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,448
My lord, there are even people like us.

221
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,369
So please, stop saying
that you're going into sales.

222
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,624
Then, what about this?

223
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,044
I get some land on Gapbigocha,

224
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,714
and we all run our own shops there.

225
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,717
We can run a seamstress shop,
a fortune-teller shop, a pharmacy,

226
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,011
or whatever business we want.

227
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,347
In exchange, he just wants us to
open a dumpling place there as well.

228
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,099
-A dumpling place?
-A dumpling place?

229
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,519
He wants to run a dumpling place
with Yook-chil and Gu-pal.

230
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:00,107
So Yook-chil and Gu-pal are also coming?

231
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,318
Everyone together?

232
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,654
Does that include Gwang-soon?

233
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,367
Then I'm in.

234
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,162
You said it was crazy.

235
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,956
You punk. I said
going into sales was crazy.

236
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,917
I never said going to Gapbigocha was.

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,085
It'd be nice and reassuring to have them.

238
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,296
Exactly. I'll provide the money…

239
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,839
We'll run the businesses…

240
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,883
And then split the profits equally…

241
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,593
What do you think?

242
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,762
It sounds like a pretty good deal.

243
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,597
I'm all for it.

244
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,016
It doesn't sound like a bad idea.

245
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,478
But what are you going
to tell your grandmother?

246
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:42,024
I already told her I'd go to Gapbigocha
with you two to get some rest.

247
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,944
And she thought it was
a good idea and gave me permission.

248
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,487
But Young Master,

249
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,532
you can never be
directly involved in the sales. Okay?

250
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,369
If you promise
never to be directly involved,

251
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,372
I'll agree to it, for now.

252
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,040
Fine. Okay.

253
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,083
Eat up.

254
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,542
You first.

255
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,669
This is perfect!

256
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,171
Wait, what will we do again?

257
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,090
A seamstress shop, a fortune-teller shop…

258
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,633
-A pharmacy.
-A dumpling place.

259
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,762
Yook-chil.

260
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,780
This place will be our new base.

261
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,574
-It's great!
-It really is.

262
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,826
This is nice!

263
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,120
Can I set up
the dumpling place in the middle?

264
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,288
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

265
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,460
Then I'll open my seamstress shop there.

266
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,714
It'll be nice if the seamstress shop
is next to the dumpling place.

267
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,801
A fortune-teller shop
should be in the corner, so there.

268
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,971
Then, I'll set up the pharmacy
near the entrance

269
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,640
so that people can
easily pick up medicine.

270
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,518
Okay. Our residences are over there,

271
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,061
so let's move our things.

272
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,479
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

273
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,273
Miss Jo-yi, let me do it for you.

274
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,150
What's with the miss all of a sudden?

275
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,943
Just call me Jo-yi.

276
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,070
Come on, Miss Jo-yi.

277
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,531
You and our lord are
in a relationship now.

278
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,451
Come on. That doesn't change anything.

279
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,411
I'm more comfortable with "Jo-yi."

280
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,166
Do what makes her comfortable.

281
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,418
Fine, Jo-yi.

282
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:25,961
Jo-yi.

283
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,421
Let's go.

284
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,214
Oh, right.

285
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,924
Did you find a chef?

286
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,720
Don't worry, I found
the best chef in Joseon.

287
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,264
I'll bring him over
once everything is ready.

288
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,766
Let's go.

289
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,560
Then let's decide on the sign first.

290
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,644
What should I write?

291
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,526
How's it going?

292
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,154
-Don't peek, my lord.
-Don't.

293
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,531
-I wasn't planning to.
-"I wasn't planning to."

294
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,578
Now, we'll reveal the signs
that we have made.

295
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,455
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

296
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,545
Here's my masterpiece.
It's "Dumpling House."

297
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,505
"Dumpling House"?

298
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,674
But we all have different businesses.

299
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,969
How can you just
write down Dumpling House?

300
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,639
But the dumpling place
will be at the very center.

301
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,434
And you shouldn't draw
such childish drawings.

302
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,646
Our dumpling place will be
an elegant establishment.

303
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,315
Even so, how could you
write it in Chinese characters?

304
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,151
How will people who don't know
how to read find the place?

305
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,069
That's right.

306
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,488
You're right. My lord, Jo-yi has a point.

307
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,283
I wanted to emphasize
our shops are clustered together.

308
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,912
So I came up with "Mokkoji."

309
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,331
That's nice.

310
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,582
-I like it.
-I like it.

311
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:49,503
But there's no way
of knowing what is being sold.

312
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,799
Then, we can just hang
the Mokkoji sign in the middle

313
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,260
and hang these drawings at your stores.

314
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,720
Then they'll know
what services are being offered.

315
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,390
And above all else,
we can use all the signs we made.

316
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,268
-That's it!
-I like that.

317
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,894
I think that's nice.

318
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,689
Okay. Then, I'll hang this

319
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,025
along with Yook-chil
and Gu-pal's drawings.

320
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,861
-My goodness. How nice.
-"Mokkoji."

321
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:16,071
-Mokko what?
-That's in Chinese characters too.

322
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,072
Palkkoji?

323
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,700
-This looks good.
-Balkkoji?

324
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,329
Bi-ryeong. Let's quickly finish this
and have a drink.

325
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,208
Gosh, there you go again
when we have so much to do.

326
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,586
Gu-pal, shall we have a drink?

327
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,962
I'm game.

328
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,632
Hey, now.

329
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,385
I purposefully put the tables there.

330
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,928
Why are you moving them here?

331
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,806
Don't stack the tables
in front of the seamstress shop.

332
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,392
It'll make it difficult
for the customers to enter.

333
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,977
Difficult for the customers?

334
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,315
I set it up so to make people see
your shop while they eat dumplings.

335
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:55,152
But if people sit here,
they'll block others' view of my shop.

336
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:59,281
What are you talking about? Look. When you
sit here alone having some dumplings…

337
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,617
It'll be like,
"There's a seamstress shop here?"

338
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,410
No view will be blocked.

339
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,995
That's only because you're tall.

340
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,706
Maybe he should go back
to being an inspector, right?

341
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,875
You won't see anything like this.

342
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,252
Going into business
together is never easy.

343
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,253
Aren't you going in?

344
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,089
I think they'll still be at it come dawn.

345
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,176
You should be aware
that you're quite the nagger.

346
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,511
Are you really telling me
that I nag too much?

347
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,222
Yes. You're the king of naggers.

348
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,806
"The king of naggers"? Seriously?

349
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,773
DUMPLING HOUSE

350
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,699
How's it? Take a look.

351
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,661
-A bit more to the opposite side.
-The opposite side?

352
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,871
-Just a bit more?
-Yes, good.

353
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,048
MEDICINE

354
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,551
It's almost ready.

355
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,306
When is the chef coming?

356
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,724
The chef?

357
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,062
He should be almost here.
I'll go and get him.

358
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,530
I wonder if there is a chef that will
satisfy our Young Master's palate.

359
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,992
I know, right? Who's going
to satisfy that particular palate?

360
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,289
The best chef in Joseon.

361
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:40,882
I am Bang-deuk.

362
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,969
It's nice to meet you all.

363
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,765
Bang-deuk!

364
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,810
Where have you been all this time?

365
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,103
Gu-pal.

366
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,354
You punk.

367
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,523
If you're Bang-deuk,
you should call me sir.

368
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,692
-Sure.
-Sir?

369
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,324
Bang-deuk, you're pretty cute.

370
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,242
-You punk!
-Bang-deuk!

371
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:08,910
Bang-deuk!

372
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:20,964
Their dumplings are so good.

373
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:24,051
-I heard there was a talented needlewoman.
-Oh, really?

374
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,511
I hear the fortune teller is so gifted.

375
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,555
IF YOU WANT TO TRY A SPECIAL DISH,
COME TO MOKKOJI DUMPLING HOUSE…

376
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,226
Have you seen that poster?

377
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,312
For the place
everyone has been flocking to.

378
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,566
You mean Dumpling House in Gapbigocha?

379
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:44,279
Gapbigocha? That's where my Yi-eon is.

380
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:48,533
People are going all the way to Gapbigocha
just for some dumplings?

381
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,621
You're out of the loop.

382
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,248
They call them "tasty hotspots."

383
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,251
I hear the trend now is
visiting famous restaurants

384
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,087
throughout the eight provinces.

385
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,465
There, you can get your fortune told
by the gifted Bi-ryeong

386
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,218
and you can even stop by
a pharmacy run by the daughter

387
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,844
of a former royal physician.

388
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,765
From what I hear, Needlewoman Jo-yi
of Ojang-dong is there as well.

389
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,309
-Oh, gosh.
-Oh, no.

390
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,353
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

391
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,271
Are you unwell, ma'am?

392
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,564
Not at all.

393
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,442
So,

394
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,571
where did you say this dumpling place was?

395
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,165
-One seafood dumpling.
-Thank you.

396
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,251
Welcome. We have a table here.

397
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,502
Please, have a seat here.

398
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,923
Let me draw it first.

399
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,808
This place gets four and a half stars.

400
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,351
You're going to be that generous?

401
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,645
Okay.

402
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,404
I heard you asked for me, my lord.

403
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,240
Doesn't it look tastier?

404
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,660
-It does.
-Speaking of which…

405
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,666
Can you give us some?

406
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,169
Comp.

407
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,211
Pardon?

408
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,506
Comp.

409
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:39,019
We'll use my drawing and his review
to spread the word in Hanyang.

410
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,022
We are noblemen
that seek out tasty hotspots

411
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,566
as professional gourmets.

412
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:50,530
So I'm sure you can guess
how influential we are.

413
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,782
I'm not interested in doing such a deal.

414
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:57,746
I solely rely on my cooking skills
with pride to make dumplings.

415
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,713
Luckily, they work perfectly fine.

416
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,383
I was worried because they were
under the sand for so long.

417
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,843
Thank goodness.

418
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,348
If we trade them for silver,
we'll be able to repatriate many POWs.

419
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,849
You're right.

420
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,267
Mother!

421
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,395
Hey.

422
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,398
Hello, sir.

423
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,569
If you came by the dumpling place,
I would've served you dumplings I made.

424
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,447
I asked you to come
because I had something to show you.

425
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,457
These rifles belonged to Kang Han-gi.

426
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,836
I held them as collateral
when she didn't pay me for gunpowder.

427
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,214
I apologize for not telling you sooner.

428
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,971
And dealing gunpowder
was inexcusably wrong.

429
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,058
As I was looking to earn money quickly
to repatriate the POWs,

430
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,768
I started dealing with gunpowder.

431
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,687
And to trade it,

432
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,064
I lived as Turukson on Tail Island.

433
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,025
I am aware.

434
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,861
I'm sure you had no other choice.

435
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,991
Anyway, I'm thinking
of trading all these rifles for silver

436
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,243
and leaving for Qing.

437
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,498
You're leaving?

438
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,502
I'm planning to bring back the women
who were taken to Qing.

439
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,634
Do you have to go?

440
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,761
We finally reunited like this.

441
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,346
This is

442
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,224
something I must do.

443
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,393
Try to understand.

444
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,195
Your life

445
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,323
belongs to you.

446
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,330
Thank you.

447
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,837
So I was hoping

448
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,591
you could be an anchor
to them here while I'm gone.

449
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:16,926
Then,

450
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,553
how about

451
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,264
Jo-yi instead of me?

452
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,394
My lord.

453
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,522
I'm sure she'll be able
to fill your shoes quite well.

454
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:41,534
I will be rooting
for Kim Jo-yi as Ryu Deok-bong.

455
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,887
Do you think I can pull it off?

456
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,226
You have me by your side.
What are you afraid of?

457
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:10,063
I will forever be
the sponsor of Tail Island.

458
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:19,406
By the way, are you really closing
the restaurant for the next two days?

459
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,241
We worked for five days straight,

460
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,244
so we need to rest
for two days to regain the energy.

461
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:30,250
I've never thought about
taking a day off before in my life.

462
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,836
Taking time off is making me feel guilty.

463
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,548
You lived your life diligently.
What is there to feel guilty about?

464
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,010
We all made this place happen together.

465
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,304
Jo-yi.

466
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,932
You can do whatever you want.

467
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:54,149
So, what would you
like to do on your day off?

468
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,445
Then…

469
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,329
Let's get everyone together
and have some fun.

470
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,586
-Everyone?
-Yes.

471
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,213
Let's invite all the children
and women in Tail Island

472
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,424
to have some fun together.

473
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,136
-Together?
-Yes.

474
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,307
Okay, let's do that.

475
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,268
The trumpet creeper is in bloom!

476
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,979
The trumpet creeper is in bloom?
Where? Can you see it?

477
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,522
-Can you see it?
-No, I can't.

478
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,565
Wait.

479
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,319
I'm not saying they're actually in bloom.
It's just a name of a game.

480
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,574
-I see. What a strange name for a game.
-Yes.

481
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,035
We all played this game
when we were younger.

482
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,578
You've never played it?

483
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,288
When I was young,

484
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,249
I was busy attending the school
to learn how to read and write.

485
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,711
Okay, now we'll start the game!

486
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,463
Okay, let's give it a go.

487
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,217
Now, there will be a penalty
for the losing team.

488
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,763
Since we're taller,
we'll start three steps behind.

489
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,682
This game is not about height,

490
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,767
it's about heart.

491
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,687
You need to be quick-witted,
quick on your feet, and quick to respond.

492
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,315
All the qualities that I possess.

493
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,110
However, you cannot get hurt.

494
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,654
That is an order.

495
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:34,624
The trumpet creeper is in bloom

496
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,128
What are you doing?

497
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,755
I'm sorry, my lord.

498
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,511
You're dead. Go back.

499
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,888
-I'm sorry.
-Dumb inspector.

500
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,475
The trumpet creeper is in bloom

501
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,562
Trumpet creepers!

502
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,398
You're dead. Go back. Now. I'm busy.

503
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,192
The trumpet creeper is in bloom

504
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,195
-I saw that. Go back.
-Do not get hurt.

505
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,533
The trumpet creeper is in bloom

506
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,092
You're dead. You too.

507
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,051
Go back.

508
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,346
The trumpet creeper is in bloom

509
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,520
The trumpet creeper is in bloom!

510
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,405
We won!

511
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,908
You went on and on
about height or whatever.

512
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,868
You weren't able to do anything.

513
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,995
And she rang her bells!

514
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:54,913
-Go back.
-I never.

515
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,122
Is this how it's played?

516
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,291
Yes, and you lost.

517
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,211
You lost, so you must
receive your penalty.

518
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,839
Fine. What is the penalty?

519
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,385
You must go to the cemetery
on the back mountains at night

520
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,346
and plant a flag there.

521
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,774
You had to let Jo-yi have her way.

522
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,317
Look how we ended up.

523
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,367
-Stand back up.
-You're the one to talk.

524
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,037
You tried to save Gwang-soon
and ended up knocking me out, too.

525
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,206
Why did you give in like that?

526
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,415
Will you be quiet?

527
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,751
We need to find the cemetery first.

528
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,587
My goodness.
He acted like a know-it-all earlier

529
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,964
but got us lost again.

530
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,758
It's not like
him getting lost is anything new.

531
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,762
What? Seriously! What is it?

532
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,180
I think I found the way.

533
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,226
Maybe not?

534
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,020
Isn't it that way?

535
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,441
I think it is this way.

536
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,985
-Maybe not?
-I doubt…

537
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,499
Oh, my elbow!

538
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,467
-I found it!
-Just like that?

539
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,677
-Where?
-Over there.

540
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,012
Where?

541
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,891
I don't see any graves over there.

542
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,810
It's over there. Go and check. Hurry up.

543
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,688
-I can't see anything.
-Go and check. Hurry up.

544
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,235
I'm so scared.
It's so scary to go by myself.

545
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,987
I'm so scared!

546
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,071
So scared!

547
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,755
Yook-chil.

548
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,465
What…

549
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,593
Gwang-soon? What are you doing here?

550
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:15,845
I…

551
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,515
I've been waiting for someone here.

552
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,101
For whom?

553
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:27,315
Who are you waiting for
this late at night, all dolled up?

554
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,900
Who could it be?

555
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,069
Well…

556
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,948
A man.

557
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,158
A man?

558
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,286
Who is it?

559
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,163
Why can't you say it?

560
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:43,998
Are you a dummy?

561
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,502
Why can't you say who he is
and he's your man?

562
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,711
It's you!

563
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:50,838
I've been waiting for you.

564
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,139
A cemetery in the middle of the night?

565
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,724
That's too harsh.

566
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,560
Come with me.

567
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,649
The truth is…

568
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,944
Gwang-soon wants to marry Yook-chil,

569
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,905
but he just won't ask her.

570
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,366
The thing is…

571
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,994
He wants to but can't.

572
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,247
-Because of his lowly class.
-I know that.

573
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,000
Gwang-soon is aware of it, too.

574
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:32,964
But she doesn't care about that
since she's even lived as a slave.

575
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,301
The only problem is that Yook-chil
is not willing to propose to her.

576
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,972
I didn't know she felt that way.

577
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,559
So I'm going
to use the penalty as an excuse

578
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,769
to get the two
to meet in front of the shrine.

579
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,022
-You want to arrange a seubcheob?
-Yes.

580
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,608
Gwang-soon came up with it
so that Yook-chil can propose

581
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,235
to her without feeling pressure.

582
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,488
Then,

583
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,992
I'll let Gu-pal know of the plan
and use the penalty as an excuse

584
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,952
to bring Yook-chil with us to the shrine.

585
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:07,039
Bi-ryeong, Gwang-soon, and I
will be at the shrine.

586
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,499
All right.

587
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,050
This can't be…

588
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,221
I was waiting here

589
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,724
hoping that you'd be
the first man to go by.

590
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,563
Marry me!

591
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,593
-Everyone here is a witness.
-Yes.

592
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:03,221
You know you must take her
as your wife, right?

593
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,473
The deity says you'll be together
for 100 years!

594
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,141
After 20 years,

595
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,435
I'll finally have my own room.

596
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,565
It looks like we have no choice
but to share a room starting today.

597
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,443
I've already packed.

598
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:18,945
Wait.

599
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,113
This reminds me.

600
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,951
What about Lord Yi-eon and Jo-yi?
You became a seubcheob couple too.

601
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:31,791
You said you should be flogged
if you broke the custom, didn't you?

602
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:41,968
Rain.

603
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,177
-What?
-What?

604
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,473
Doesn't it look like it's going to rain
soon? We should hurry and get back.

605
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,350
-It's a full moon. What rain?
-No.

606
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,269
-It'll suddenly pour.
-You'll be dragged…

607
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,436
Let's go, baby.

608
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,523
-Let's go.
-I'll be your umbrella, baby.

609
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,441
Let's hurry.

610
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,530
Wait for me!

611
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,366
Rain…

612
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,963
It looks like there will be good news.
The magpies are singing.

613
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:22,425
I guess we should be
expecting a special visitor.

614
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,734
What does this say?

615
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:45,448
Hey…

616
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,869
This document says
your status has been revoked.

617
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,871
Revoked?

618
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,791
Does that mean
I'm no longer a slave or something?

619
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,626
That's right.

620
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,046
Yook-chil!

621
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:01,797
Here…

622
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,508
It's from our lord.

623
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,095
He didn't want to interrupt
your first night together.

624
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,474
He says that it's your wedding gift.

625
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,103
Thanks to you, my status was revoked, too!

626
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:21,734
-Is that true?
-Yes. This says so.

627
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,736
That's right. Then…

628
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,947
That means

629
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,616
our children can live freely

630
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,576
as members of the middle class.

631
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,917
Thank you, my lord.

632
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,088
Thank you, my lord!

633
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,174
Yook-chil…

634
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,676
Yook-chil.

635
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,762
Well done!

636
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,557
-Gwang-soon.
-Well done!

637
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,020
-Gwang-soon.
-This is great. So great!

638
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:58,979
Gwang-soon.

639
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,316
Gwang-soon…

640
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,611
Hold on…

641
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,783
My goodness. I can do it. Let me do it.

642
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,868
-Have a nice day.
-Take care.

643
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,841
What? Are you jealous?

644
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,052
No, it's not that.

645
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,972
Let's be honest.
I'm better looking than him.

646
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,141
But why can't I find someone?

647
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,559
Well, it turns out,

648
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,478
every Jack has his Jill.

649
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,648
When the time comes,
you'll find someone, too.

650
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,151
When? In my next life?

651
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,572
Then should we ask Bi-ryeong?

652
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,074
Bi-ryeong!

653
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,160
Hey, Jo-yi. What's up?

654
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,247
-Listen.
-Yes?

655
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,499
Can you read Gu-pal's fortune?

656
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,544
Sure. Is there something
you want to find out?

657
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,212
It's not exactly that.

658
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:11,260
You know, Lord Yi-eon and Yook-chil
have both found their life partners.

659
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,179
But I'm still alone.

660
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,726
So I was wondering,
if you do that thing you do,

661
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,104
will you be able to find out
when I'll meet mine?

662
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,898
-Is that so?
-Yes.

663
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,192
Then, let's see.

664
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,868
Let's see here.

665
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,121
That's odd. So odd.

666
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,380
Mal-jong is still
not over Pal-soon, I see.

667
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:49,924
What?

668
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,806
Do you know how cute you are?

669
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,311
Pal-soon, you've always been

670
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,939
the one for me.

671
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,280
Cha Mal-jong?

672
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,575
It won't be easy because Mal-jong
won't let go of Pal-soon.

673
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,952
That bastard…

674
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,745
Oh, you poor thing…

675
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,164
I told you I didn't want to do this!

676
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,249
Gu-pal.

677
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,667
Yes?

678
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,379
-This is why I didn't want to do it.
-Sorry.

679
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,467
Oh, no.

680
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,971
Maybe I shouldn't
have talked him into this.

681
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:39,640
Jo-yi!

682
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,642
Yes?

683
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,896
It's me. Bo-ri.

684
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,824
I came because I missed you.

685
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,537
Bo-ri?

686
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,914
Yes. It's me.

687
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,797
Gosh. It's so nice to see you doing well.

688
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,011
What about you?

689
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,471
Are you doing well where you are?

690
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,472
Yes.

691
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,309
I even met my baby and my mom.

692
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,604
I was able to meet my baby safe and sound

693
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,648
because you properly sent me off
with the baby clothes.

694
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,153
I see.

695
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,780
I'm glad.

696
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,032
So, Jo-yi,

697
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,576
enjoy your life here
until you're sick of it.

698
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,494
And we can meet again

699
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,039
later. Much later.

700
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:46,999
Okay?

701
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,341
Goodness. My baby is asking for me.

702
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:59,428
Do you have to go?
Can't you stay a little longer?

703
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,015
You'll know once you become a mom.

704
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,393
I'm going to leave now, Jo-yi.

705
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,190
My goodness.

706
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,153
How can I possibly leave in peace
if you cry like that? Smile, okay?

707
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,575
Okay.

708
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,079
Go on.

709
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,289
Bye.

710
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,480
What?

711
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,856
Oh, Jo-yi.

712
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,317
Gu-pal will find someone.
Don't worry too much.

713
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,280
Bi-ryeong.

714
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,664
What's the matter?

715
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:22,928
Have you heard?

716
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,639
I was in Hanyang not too long ago.

717
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,267
And I heard from people there

718
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,769
that the King is quite sick.

719
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:31,937
I heard that, too.

720
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,690
I heard he ate sweet injeolmi so much

721
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,151
that he's got diabetes.

722
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,193
Oh, dear.

723
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,043
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

724
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:58,046
-Call a physician!
-Your Majesty! Hurry up!

725
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,214
Then,

726
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,217
maybe our lives will improve a bit?

727
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,178
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

728
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,346
Just hurry up and eat your dumpling soup.

729
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,682
It's the worst right now.
It has to get better.

730
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,476
That's right.

731
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,935
Right. You're right.

732
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,854
Can we get some more radish kimchi?

733
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,397
Sure.

734
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,525
-We actually ran out of it.
-I see.

735
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,694
I felt bad, so I brought some dumplings.

736
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:21,987
Dumplings on the house.

737
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,740
-Oh, you didn't need to.
-Enjoy.

738
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,408
Thank you.

739
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,618
We'll enjoy them.

740
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,038
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hello.

741
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,001
Aren't you Yook-chil?

742
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,921
Gu-pal, is that you?

743
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,175
What are you two…

744
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,095
Oh, so…

745
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,479
Isn't that…

746
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,608
Isn't that Yi-eon?

747
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,027
My lady.

748
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,863
Why would Young Master be in such clothes?

749
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,073
Then again…

750
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,326
I'm sure you're here
because you heard the rumors.

751
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:12,037
We're also here to try their dumplings.

752
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,288
Yes, that's right.

753
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:17,918
He just looks so much like him.
That tall fellow over there.

754
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,379
-Isn't that Yi-eon?
-No, ma'am.

755
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,130
Why would he be there doing that?

756
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,383
-That's true.
-Yes.

757
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,594
Yi-eon wouldn't be here doing that.

758
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,388
Then,

759
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,640
where is Yi-eon?

760
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,434
He went to use the outhouse.
He should be back shortly.

761
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,728
-Why don't you have a seat, ma'am?
-All right.

762
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,649
What is Grandmother doing here?

763
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,276
What should I do?

764
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,070
Clothes!

765
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,905
-Here! Hat!
-Hat!

766
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,867
Hold on! Aren't you rushing too much?

767
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,249
Right! Hurry!

768
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,919
What would you like?

769
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,592
I mean, what should we order for you?

770
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,890
Watershield dumplings, seafood dumplings…

771
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:17,811
-Just order one of each.
-Yes, ma'am.

772
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,479
Give us one of each!

773
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,772
Everything you have!

774
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,232
They're so nice.

775
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,236
Grandmother.

776
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,363
When did you arrive?

777
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,616
You should've come to the house.

778
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,702
I thought I may see you here
because you love dumplings so much,

779
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:34,995
and I was right.

780
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,664
It's close to our house, you see.

781
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,625
We come here often.

782
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,543
What do you mean?

783
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:43,795
Then

784
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,799
is that girl named Jo-yi
staying with you as well?

785
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,696
Follow me.

786
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,005
I wasn't just talking to you.

787
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,840
Why don't we talk first?

788
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,343
I saw that pipsqueak
still wear her hair down.

789
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,053
I guess you haven't gotten married.

790
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,848
We are living
happily together, Grandmother.

791
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,392
Exactly!

792
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,479
You two are living together,
so why haven't you gotten married?

793
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,899
What does that little brat
take my grandson for?

794
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,902
Jo-yi needs some time to think as well.

795
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,242
Then again,

796
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,537
cozily shacking up with her
is better than going

797
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,456
on dangerous missions
as an inspector or whatever.

798
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:03,417
By the way,

799
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,587
do you live alone in this room?

800
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,381
Yes.

801
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,882
Then where is Jo-yi's room?

802
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,219
There's a separate room
for the women over there.

803
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,763
Why you damn fool!

804
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,223
Pardon?

805
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,560
Be careful, Grandmother.

806
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,522
If they're put in the same room,

807
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,774
a baby might be conceived.

808
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,736
Then, they'll have
no choice but to get married.

809
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,784
I will be staying
at your place for a few days.

810
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,703
Pardon?

811
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:44,249
I'm saying I will be staying in this room,
so you sleep somewhere else.

812
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,501
Grandmother?

813
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,350
What do I do now?

814
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,270
Yook-chil…

815
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,356
Gwang-soon is with him now.

816
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,820
Oh, right. There's that vacant room.

817
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,430
I have no choice
but to go to Gu-pal's room.

818
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,390
Hey, Gu-pal!

819
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,935
-You're still up?
-Hey.

820
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,937
-Are you coming from the outhouse?
-Yes.

821
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,147
Well…

822
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,025
Can I sleep in your room?

823
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,195
-Don't do this.
-Gu-pal!

824
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,031
My grandmother is here.

825
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:01,201
This is my very first room in 20 years.

826
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,829
Forget it.

827
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,915
Gu-pal!

828
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,583
Gu-pal.

829
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:10,460
Gu-pal?

830
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,064
Jo-yi.

831
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,650
Are you asleep?

832
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:37,946
Jo-yi?

833
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:39,865
Are you asleep?

834
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,345
Don't worry.

835
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,265
I…

836
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:10,645
promise never to cross this pillow.

837
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:23,199
Whatever. I'm tired and sleepy.
I'm going to sleep now.

838
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:38,089
You're not

839
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,800
really sleeping, are you?

840
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,266
Hey!

841
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,518
I'm here right next to you…

842
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,645
How could you sleep?

843
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,076
I…

844
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,746
want to see the stars.

845
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:42,612
My lord.

846
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,074
I'm really happy right now.

847
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,370
I like you.

848
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,250
I'm happy
that I'm doing what I want to freely.

849
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:00,046
Having a happy life was my dream.

850
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,508
And my dream has come true.

851
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,556
I'm happy.

852
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,941
I am as well.

853
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:24,279
The time I'm spending with you here
is precious to me,

854
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:29,451
and I'm happy that we're able
to share every meal together.

855
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,624
Jo-yi.

856
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,879
Will you

857
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,590
be my companion for the rest of my life?

858
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,767
Yes, my lord.

859
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:19,918
MOKKOJI

860
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,635
My goodness. I told you
to put things away after using them.

861
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:32,806
One makes a mess
while the other cleans it up.

862
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,436
Hold on. I'm letting you stay in my room.
How could you say such a thing?

863
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,105
So I clean up more than you do.

864
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,692
By the way, why do you
not wash your feet before bed?

865
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,277
Oh, come on.

866
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,238
I can't live with all your nagging.

867
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,949
If you don't want to hear it,
wash your feet!

868
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,660
Stop that, or get out of my room!

869
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,870
Fine. Do you think I won't?

870
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,580
Take your stuff with you!

871
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,623
Fine!

872
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,176
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
SECRET ROYAL INSPECTOR & JOY

873
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,400
THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD ACTORS
IN THIS EPISODE WAS PROPERLY ENSURED

874
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,444
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

875
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,790
SPECIAL THANKS TO
JO KWAN-WOO AND JO EUN-SOUL

876
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,630
-We'll start.
-Oh, my goodness.

877
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,715
-What are you doing?
-Get ready.

878
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,759
-What the? Is that supposed to be me?
-Yes, it is.

879
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:56,890
Do I…

880
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,266
One, two…

881
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,855
Get up, my lord.

882
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:04,814
I'm leaving.

883
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,275
Are you abandoning me?

884
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,694
Yes, I have a late-night snack
waiting for me.

885
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,155
Shall we start?

886
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:13,990
Hurry. Let's do this.

887
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,701
-Okay.
-Ready.

888
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,660
Yi-eon…

889
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:20,038
Didn't I wrap her up really well?

890
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,623
-You did that?
-Yes.

891
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:22,957
I feel very stable.

892
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,293
Come here. You must be cold. Come here.

893
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,756
You hugged me because of this.

894
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,300
-All of a sudden.
-So what?

895
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,052
Maybe we should prepare…

896
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,512
I'm sorry.

897
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,971
They must be tired.

898
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:40,183
Maybe we should
prepare some food for them? Okay.

899
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:42,977
I'm not interested at all…

900
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,815
Cut. All right.

901
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,527
This isn't working.
I can't aim it very well.

902
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,819
Look forward. Forward.

903
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,780
-Look forward.
-Okay.

904
00:58:58,576 --> 00:58:59,494
Version Two.

905
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,092
We were perfectly fine sitting down.

906
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,177
Why are we doing this?

907
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,264
-You must be so hot.
-Can someone wipe away Jo-yi's sweat?

908
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,308
Seriously, she has
beads of sweat above her lip.

909
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,687
Don't you need the fan more than I do?

910
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,648
-That is how you help me.
-I told you, you can't!

911
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,693
No, that's too cheesy.
Cheesy. Don't do that.

912
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,697
Cut!

913
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,742
But this is the problem.

914
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,786
The hat straps are the problem.

915
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,040
I need to get going. I'm busy.

916
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,338
Wow, she's really fast.

917
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,050
She was as fast
as she is when she goes home.

918
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:58,303
I need to get going. I'm busy.

919
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,431
Shouldn't I get closer and tie something?

920
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,515
-Right.
-Right.

921
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,600
Go away.

922
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:06,394
Leave.

923
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,855
We're supposed to play a game.

924
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:12,191
-Take a look at this screen.
-Kindly look here.

925
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,569
You look like Jafar.

926
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,529
From Aladdin.

927
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,200
-You're filming this?
-We're filming.

928
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,494
Sorry. It just looked so fun.

929
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,704
-Really?
-Yes.

930
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,583
-So happy!
-So happy!

931
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,043
Yes! So happy!

932
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,169
The hat strap fell.

933
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,129
-Cut!
-Cut!

934
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,009
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

935
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,969
Isn't that too much?

936
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,929
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

937
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:46,351
Yes! I understand! I understand!

938
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:47,435
Let's go!

939
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,107
I told you to hold it up.

940
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,027
-Wow, so fun.
-Okay.

941
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,198
-Thank you for loving
-Thank you for loving

942
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,908
-Secret Royal Inspector Joy!
-Secret Royal Inspector Joy!

943
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,452
