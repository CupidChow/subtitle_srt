1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,655
Careful!

4
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,825
-Father!
-My son, you'll get hurt.

5
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,201
Father.

6
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,245
I feel so good.

7
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:42,000
Seeing my son being so happy
makes me so happy.

8
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,503
This can't be…

9
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,715
Is this Lord Park Seung's house?

10
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:49,716
Here is your pay.

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,055
Thank you.

12
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,560
You did such a good job.

13
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,480
I hope to see
the Young Master's clothes soon too.

14
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:04,981
Sure.

15
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,943
Oh, my goodness.

16
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,361
My belly!

17
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,948
I am sorry to ask this,

18
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,576
but could I use your outhouse?

19
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,869
The outhouse?

20
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,163
My belly suddenly…

21
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:23,958
It's over there, but make it quick.

22
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,628
Yes, I will. Thank you.

23
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,344
It didn't flip.

24
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,263
-This isn't right…
-Yes!

25
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,391
So close!

26
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,437
It's my turn.

27
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,191
There's no way it can't flip over.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,320
The evidence that Lord Yi-eon
risked his life to acquire…

29
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,905
Why isn't it flipping over?

30
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,409
It didn't flip!

31
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,038
There's no way you can flip mine over.

32
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,456
I will flip it over.

33
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,170
All kinds of birds fly in…

34
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,715
-Among the birds…
-Among the birds…

35
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,716
Are they drunk?

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,094
-Chirp!
-Chirp!

37
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,266
The Chief State Councilor of a nation
is fooling around like that…

38
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,184
-Father.
-Yes?

39
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,981
I'm so bored staying at home all day.

40
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,943
I paid quite a hefty sum to get you
released saying that you were sick.

41
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,196
It will look bad
if you're seen out there too soon.

42
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,739
Then,

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,576
-what about my villa?
-What?

44
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,036
I want to see what it looks like.

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,500
Then shall we go and take a look?
And get some fresh air too?

46
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,586
Can we?

47
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,463
Of course!
If my son wants to do so, of course!

48
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,632
Of course!

49
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,717
My lord.

50
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,554
Your new socks have arrived.

51
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,805
Okay.

52
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,892
-The birds are flying.
-Leave them there.

53
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,645
Let's see here.

54
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,730
My goodness.

55
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,902
The new socks came out quite nicely.

56
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,576
They fit perfectly.

57
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,122
What? What's that?

58
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:38,176
What is that and why does he
carry it with him at all times like that?

59
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,595
It's a letter.

60
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,808
You…

61
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,985
Chirp! Chirp…

62
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,099
You should take with you
as little as possible.

63
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,437
It's a completely different world
over there. Most of it will be useless.

64
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,774
That's none of your concern,
so stop being nosy.

65
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,069
What about a ship?

66
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,282
Be at the port by noon on the day.
You'll see Yoon, a messenger from Gokdu.

67
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,118
He'll guide you there.

68
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,164
Thank you for keeping your word.

69
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,335
I want to thank you too
for not kicking me out.

70
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,924
I'm sure you've prepared yourself,

71
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,968
but even if you manage to get there,

72
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,638
it will not be easy to settle in.

73
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,182
That's true.

74
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,728
But we can't keep living here
putting up with the persecution.

75
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,855
Why don't you just stay and fight?

76
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,815
Stay and fight…

77
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,946
Do you think
this nation will change if we do that?

78
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,661
Well, if you can't stand the heat,

79
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,955
get out of the kitchen.

80
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,169
I hear you decided to turn yourself in
to the Uigeumbu.

81
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,838
Tae-seo, that insane bastard, wants to.

82
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,133
If you confess, they might
consider the extenuating factors

83
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,844
and you might end up
with a lighter sentence.

84
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,972
You have not harmed anyone,

85
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,183
but I have.

86
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,227
I can't hope for a lighter sentence.

87
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,440
We just hope our confession is
enough to expose what Park Seung has done.

88
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,777
Perhaps this is
our last chance at repentance.

89
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,405
As long as you've prepared yourself.

90
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,661
Anyway,

91
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,080
I've been meaning to ask this.

92
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,126
Why are you so devoted to them?

93
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,088
What do these women
and slaves here mean to you?

94
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,006
They are

95
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,093
just like you and me.

96
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,805
They're not just women and slaves.

97
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,935
Everyone has a right to live,

98
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,063
and we have banded together
to protect that right.

99
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,107
It's not out of devotion.

100
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,491
Han-gi, let's head out.

101
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,327
I must go now.

102
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,037
I hope

103
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,290
you achieve what you want.

104
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,034
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-No.

105
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,744
I'm just grateful that you came.

106
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,914
Is something wrong?
Today's not the day we promised to meet.

107
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,249
As I told you last time,

108
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,085
we've decided to leave this place.

109
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,880
You've supported us
materially and emotionally,

110
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,966
but we haven't been
able to protect this place. I apologize.

111
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,385
There's no need to apologize to me.

112
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,013
I'm just a mere messenger.

113
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,475
Since we don't know

114
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,853
when we'll meet again after we leave,
I must ask you for this favor.

115
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,816
The person who's been
sponsoring us all this time…

116
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,277
Could you tell me who it is?

117
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,279
Didn't you promise not to ask?

118
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:54,450
We may be just recipients,
but we should know who to thank.

119
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,786
Once we leave this land,

120
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,872
we may never be able to return.

121
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,093
The first sponsor

122
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,804
was the late Crown Prince.

123
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,516
He felt bad for the women that returned

124
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,810
and were once again
abandoned by their own,

125
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,728
so he wished to help them.

126
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,774
But

127
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,069
it's been ages
since His Highness has passed.

128
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,487
Since then,

129
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,240
a man that could be considered
a brother to him

130
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,325
has been supporting you

131
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,327
in his place.

132
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,414
And who is that man?

133
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:44,709
Who is he?

134
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,632
He is Hongmungwan's…

135
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,519
Lord Ra Yi-eon.

136
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,484
He's a busuchan at Hongmungwan,
and his name is Ra Yi-eon.

137
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,779
The two met when he was a secret
royal inspector in Chungcheong,

138
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,073
and I believe
he's been by her side ever since.

139
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,211
Bi-ryeong!

140
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,379
What's going on?

141
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,423
-Those socks.
-What?

142
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,426
The socks were ordered by Lord Park Seung.

143
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,845
Then are you coming from his house?

144
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,473
What?

145
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,267
You were at his house?

146
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,644
Yes.

147
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,314
So Lord Park Seung was the one
that asked for that pocket

148
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,732
to be made inside his socks?

149
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,900
Yes.

150
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,528
And I saw him try on the socks
that I made for him.

151
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,324
He put some sort of letter
into the pocket to carry it with him.

152
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,826
It must be a very important letter

153
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,829
if he's carrying it with him
at all times in his sock.

154
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,630
By the way, these straw shoes…

155
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,800
Why is this one row different?

156
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,134
What?

157
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,812
What is this?

158
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,739
This is…

159
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,452
It's a list of ingredients for a tonic.

160
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,792
One and a half don of seohyang,

161
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,752
two dons of baeggyeong…

162
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,839
Gwang-soon, I gave the right prescription.

163
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,008
I put exactly one nyang of angelica root
and the aconite…

164
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,719
My father left

165
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,515
the list of ingredients
for the tonic as evidence.

166
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,019
To prove that the Crown Prince
was poisoned to death.

167
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,716
Do-soo!

168
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,760
You should never eat this.

169
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,554
Why? I've been taking one every day.

170
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,600
These poppy capsules contain aconite.

171
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,642
Aconite?

172
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,274
I've had them especially made
to be offered to the king.

173
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,442
So…

174
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,238
Take these instead.

175
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,454
But if they're meant for the king…

176
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:14,460
It's about time the King joined
the Crown Prince. Don't you think?

177
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,674
Anyhow, these contain aconite,

178
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,511
so you must not touch them, okay?

179
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,972
Okay, I won't, Father.

180
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,527
If I didn't get lost,
I would've gotten home much sooner.

181
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,487
I just had to get on the wrong boat.

182
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,126
PARK SEUNG

183
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,610
Didn't they say
he was quite the proper gentleman?

184
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,073
Excuse me.

185
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,289
May I help you?

186
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:19,209
By chance, are you Lord Ra Yi-eon?

187
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,139
I am.

188
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,892
Lord Yi-eon! Did you have a safe trip?

189
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,727
Your clothes are a complete mess.

190
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,938
Did you find anything out
about the physician?

191
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:39,897
That…

192
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,110
-Who is she?
-My lord!

193
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,403
Who are you?

194
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:52,785
It turns out the abscess specialist
was Gwang-soon's father.

195
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,789
Are you back, Lord Yi-eon?

196
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,916
Listen, I was at Lord Park Seung's house…

197
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,837
Mother.

198
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,674
-Mother?
-Mother?

199
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,591
Mom?

200
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,513
Your mother-in-law?

201
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,024
So let me get this straight.

202
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,610
You are Jo-yi's mother.

203
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,154
Your sponsor was the Crown Prince.

204
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,448
You're the daughter of his physician.

205
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,117
Bi-ryeong is next to you.

206
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,786
Her brother and younger siblings
are with you.

207
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,204
And I'm now your sponsor.

208
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,498
Jo-yi is next to me,
and Gu-pal is next to her.

209
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,416
And Yook-chil.

210
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,544
And next to Yook-chil is you
whose father served His Highness.

211
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,046
And His Highness was like a brother to me,

212
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,548
but he was also your sponsor.

213
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,633
So you're Jo-yi's mother…

214
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,218
Then you are to me…

215
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,387
Young Master, please stop. My goodness.

216
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,891
Right. Yes, I should.

217
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,019
Okay.

218
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,564
Anyhow, they say it's fate
even when we cross each other's path.

219
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:08,235
It seems that a special sort of fate
has brought us together.

220
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,864
This is some fate…

221
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,242
Our meeting was not by chance.

222
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,162
Everyone here

223
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,998
must repay His Highness' grace.

224
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,836
I'm sure divine intervention
brought us together

225
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,338
so that the root of all these troubles,

226
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,175
Park Seung, can be punished properly.

227
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,767
This is a letter Park Seung wrote
after threatening the physician

228
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,143
to keep his mouth shut

229
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,687
about poisoning the Crown Prince.

230
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,697
You are never to disclose
what you saw and heard

231
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,908
after the temporary pharmacy
was established

232
00:17:55,991 --> 00:18:00,913
and to cooperate in letting the herbal
tonics into the Crown Prince's palace.

233
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:05,042
In exchange, I guarantee the safety
of your daughter, Ra Gwang-soon.

234
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,045
Tragically,

235
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,671
this became

236
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,132
your father's last message to you.

237
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,177
Your father

238
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,597
did what he could
to save you, his daughter.

239
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,601
I had no idea…

240
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,146
I just thought my father abandoned me

241
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,566
and resented him a lot for it.

242
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,072
But he was trying to protect me.

243
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,333
My father left this behind.

244
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,878
What is this?

245
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,841
It's a list of ingredients
for the Crown Prince's tonic.

246
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:58,554
It seems that he left it behind
as evidence of the poisoning.

247
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,185
A letter with Park Seung's seal.

248
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,105
A list of the tonic ingredients
with the physician's seal.

249
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,567
And although we'll have to see
if he keeps his word,

250
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,694
we should even have
Park Tae-seo's confession.

251
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,112
I'm sure he will.

252
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,951
I saw them leaving Gapbigocha
to go to confess.

253
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,578
By now,

254
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,706
Park Tae-seo, Ji Maeng-su, and Kang Han-gi

255
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:27,875
must have arrived in Hanyang.

256
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,215
Father, is all of this ours?

257
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,259
Yes. This is all yours now.

258
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,762
You'll hurt yourself. Be careful!

259
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,139
Okay.

260
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,059
I'm happy seeing my Do-soo happy.

261
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,396
It's better than I expected.

262
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,940
What do you like the most?

263
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,150
I like all of it.

264
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,735
Above all else,

265
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:58,947
I like the fact
that I'm here with you the most.

266
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,950
My goodness. My baby!

267
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,829
My goodness. My baby!

268
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,873
My goodness. There, there.

269
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,336
I'm also so very happy
to be here with you.

270
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,087
-Let's go, Father.
-Okay.

271
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,270
Don't be sorry.

272
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,107
I was already feeling bothered
by what happened to Mal-jong.

273
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,736
Me, too.

274
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,447
Everyone was against me
because I was a woman,

275
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,699
but you accepted me.

276
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,285
I made up my mind back then

277
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,372
that I'd die if you told me to.

278
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,380
Hey, Maeng-su.

279
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,383
What do you think
you'll be born as in your next life?

280
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,385
A tiger, of course.

281
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,513
A tiger? As if.

282
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,139
Maybe a cat.

283
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,724
-Why you…
-Meow!

284
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,186
A cat suits you much more.

285
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,813
-Roar!
-Meow!

286
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,152
Just give me a moment.
You should go ahead without me.

287
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,657
-Wait, Do-soo!
-Father!

288
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,326
Slow down, my son! Slow down!

289
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,497
Do-soo!

290
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,333
That kid.

291
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,835
Be careful.

292
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,882
Mother!

293
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,928
Mother!

294
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,023
Mother.

295
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,984
I don't care what others say.

296
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,697
You're still my mother.

297
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,162
I was four, so you might think
I was too young to feel anything,

298
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,499
but I remember everything.

299
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,255
I remember how much you adored me.

300
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,470
And I know…

301
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,975
that was real.

302
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,775
Wherever you are,

303
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,570
you take care of yourself.

304
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,941
Tae-seo!

305
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,656
Tae-seo…

306
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,675
Today really must be my lucky day.
Even running into you here…

307
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,398
Do-soo…

308
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,488
Do-soo, you…

309
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,741
Do-soo!

310
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,669
I had to take care of him quickly.

311
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,880
I was worried he might run away again.

312
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,101
Father…

313
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,898
Let's go now.

314
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,025
We should go and eat something.

315
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,284
Tae-seo is gone now,

316
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,536
and there's nobody else
to make a confession.

317
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,413
It's all perfect!

318
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,293
Get rid of them, too.

319
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:32,113
I no longer remember

320
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,909
what I worked so hard for.

321
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,553
It's a hat strap
adorned with our family crest.

322
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:58,974
My son.

323
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,850
Yes.

324
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,728
Father.

325
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,069
I want to believe you meant it

326
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,406
when you smiled at me.

327
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,362
Good work, everyone.

328
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,198
You must all be tired. Go home and rest.

329
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,575
Good night, my lord.

330
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,660
See you tomorrow.

331
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,496
-Good night.
-You, too.

332
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,082
After all the support

333
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,420
I have received through the royal guard,
I've just found out about you.

334
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,049
My apologies for taking so long
to come and meet you.

335
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,342
There's no need.

336
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,137
I just followed in his footsteps.
All of it was His Highness' doing.

337
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:23,433
I'm actually sorry for not knowing
how bad things have gotten until now.

338
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,482
Then, you should come over to our place.

339
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,900
-Come with us and--
-No.

340
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,693
I can just go to a tavern.

341
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,404
That's nonsense.
Your daughter lives around the corner.

342
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,156
-You can't do that.
-Come with us.

343
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,575
-We'll escort you there.
-Just come.

344
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,535
It's dark, be careful.

345
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,541
I shall get going as well, then.

346
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,667
Jo-yi.

347
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,129
Can you wait here for a moment?

348
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,471
What…

349
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,976
I'd like to cook for her myself,
but it might make her uncomfortable.

350
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,770
You should cook for her instead.

351
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:15,318
This is dried acorn jelly I made
from scratch. You just need to season it.

352
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,529
Thank you so much.

353
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,156
I should really get going now.

354
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,950
-Mother!
-If you

355
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,785
add crown daisies to the seasoning,

356
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,373
you'll get a nice aroma.

357
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:44,305
I'll hurry up and prepare dinner.
You can look around my room if you'd like.

358
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,650
These are the only ones that were washed.

359
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,069
Thank you. That will be more than enough.

360
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,991
We just added some firewood,
so it should warm up in no time.

361
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,918
Jo-yi is so good with her hands.
She must've gotten it from you.

362
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,796
There's nothing she can't do.

363
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,758
She's good at sewing.
She's strong and good at laundry.

364
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,676
She's even excellent at fighting.

365
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,304
That's right.
I'm a pretty good fighter as well.

366
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,558
Here we are.

367
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,687
Here we go.

368
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,942
I made a stew with the mushrooms
that Lord Yi-eon gave us.

369
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,819
-So hungry.
-Dig in.

370
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,408
This is dried acorn jelly
that Lord Yi-eon made from scratch.

371
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,910
Try it.

372
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,245
He made it from scratch?

373
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,831
This is nothing.

374
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,542
He's better at cooking than most women.

375
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,675
Lord Yi-eon really made this?

376
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,888
He's not just good at cooking.
He's good at many things.

377
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,599
Good for you, Jo-yi.

378
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,687
The tall one is our Yook-chil.
He's quite talented as well.

379
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,189
"Our Yook-chil"?

380
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,109
I mean… Our Gu-pal is talented, too.

381
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,986
That took her too long. Right?

382
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,364
My goodness.

383
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,077
-This is really good.
-It is.

384
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,834
Just keep still.

385
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,460
I told you, I'm fine.

386
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,754
I'm doing it because I want to.

387
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,173
You're all set.

388
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,847
Your feet…

389
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:59,357
They say that if you apply gourd extract,
it restores rough skin.

390
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,151
But it's out of season,
so it's hard to come by.

391
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,779
I'll apply honey on them tomorrow instead.

392
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,657
Rough skin is a given with old age.

393
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,534
I'm fine.

394
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,166
Come here. Let me comb your hair again.

395
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,309
This comb…

396
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,853
Where did you get it?

397
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,481
Does it belong
to the girl named Bi-ryeong?

398
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,276
No. It's not Bi-ryeong's.

399
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,820
It's a bit of a long story.

400
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,530
Bi-ryeong and Bo-ri

401
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,990
look so much alike

402
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,909
that even I get confused sometimes.

403
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,161
Anyhow,

404
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,704
Bi-ryeong didn't give it to me.

405
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:58,791
When I was back in Gaehwa Valley,
a friend of mine, Bo-ri, gave it to me.

406
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,961
Bo-ri?

407
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,468
But why do you ask?

408
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,567
You've always used
that broken comb, but this is new.

409
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,236
Yes, some lady gave it to me earlier.

410
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,781
That reminds me.
That lady was looking for you.

411
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:30,907
Me?

412
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,660
She asked where you live.
Did you not see her?

413
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,662
Then,

414
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,331
did you…

415
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,504
You came to Gaehwa Valley, didn't you?

416
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,218
You came to find me.

417
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:59,185
They say life is a stack of everything
you do, even the smallest things.

418
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:05,108
Not even a comb went to waste.

419
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,490
Let's comb your hair.

420
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,351
You're beautiful.

421
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,687
Today, I got to eat with you

422
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,480
and make you clothes.

423
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,441
And you even combed my hair.

424
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,193
It felt like a dream.

425
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,238
I never thought such a day would come.

426
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,158
It reminded me of when I was little.

427
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,075
Yes.

428
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,829
By the way, the dried acorn jelly Lord
Yi-eon made was really good, wasn't it?

429
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,664
-Yes, it was very good.
-Right?

430
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:09,797
Can I help you?

431
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,092
Is Deok-bong here, by any chance?

432
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,094
Yes.

433
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,515
Mother, someone is here to see you.

434
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,854
What are you doing all the way here?

435
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,773
Tail Island…

436
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,733
Tail Island…

437
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,236
Park Seung took it over.

438
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,908
What about the kids?

439
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,036
And Ba-hoe? What about
Daek-yi and the other women?

440
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,623
Daek-yi and the kids managed to get away.

441
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,626
But Ba-hoe…

442
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,170
Ba-hoe…

443
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,800
They're not even registered on the census.
Just drag them all away.

444
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,285
Mother!

445
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,376
Park Tae-seo has been killed?

446
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,921
He was on his way to the port
with his friends to turn themselves in

447
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,799
when she saw them being killed

448
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,510
by Park Seung and his son.

449
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,430
How could someone be so vicious?

450
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,016
I know he's illegitimate,
but he's still his child.

451
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,393
No.

452
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,771
Do-soo is not.

453
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,982
Tae-seo is the legitimate child.

454
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,194
I switched the babies.

455
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,531
Even if I end up dying,

456
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,034
I must see Park Seung,
that bastard, die first.

457
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,078
Just tell me what to do.

458
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:08,207
Therefore, I'm determined
to get back at Park Seung.

459
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,627
Please, let us help you punish him.

460
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,724
-You eat so well. So well.
-We have the same goal.

461
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,642
Punishing Park Seung.

462
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:31,230
However, he was even
able to evade a royal interrogation.

463
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:34,859
Without Park Tae-seo's confession,
if we go after Park Seung

464
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,738
only with the letter containing his seal
and the physician's records,

465
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,823
he might end up turning the tables on us.

466
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,749
Did you say you saw Park Seung
carry around a letter inside his sock?

467
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:53,586
Yes. He definitely had
a letter in his sock.

468
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,130
I must find out
the content of that letter.

469
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,091
But according to the servants,

470
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,764
he doesn't take that sock off
even when he goes to sleep.

471
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,103
But still, he must wash his feet.

472
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,490
Doesn't he ever visit a courtesan house?

473
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,824
Forget courtesan houses.

474
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,787
He's been on sick leave and
hasn't even come into the office lately.

475
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,124
Eat slowly. Slowly.

476
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,503
It seems that he rarely leaves home
looking after Park Do-soo.

477
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,130
And when he does,

478
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,509
it's to go to a butcher in Banchon.

479
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,468
That's right.

480
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,721
My lord.

481
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:50,518
I saw Lord Park Seung buy something
called poppy capsules at the butcher's.

482
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,979
-Poppy capsules?
-Yes.

483
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,106
I'm sure that's what they were called.

484
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,484
It's an anesthetic pellet given to cattle
before they're slaughtered.

485
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,570
That's why it's a medication
that butchers have.

486
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,531
Poppy capsules are hallucinogenic.

487
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,992
You see things if you take them.

488
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,828
You see things…

489
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,458
Then how about this?

490
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,129
Gather round.

491
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,189
Will that work?

492
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,152
We won't know until we try it.

493
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,237
-We'll do it!
-We'll do it!

494
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,081
Okay.

495
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,710
Then I'll look for a way
to have an audience with His Majesty.

496
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,920
Once you acquire the letter,

497
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,214
I'll go to the palace with the evidence

498
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,216
to have an arrest warrant issued.

499
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,345
And while you arrest Park Seung,

500
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,264
we'll come up
with a plan to plunge him into hell.

501
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,310
Okay.

502
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,313
Let's move out.

503
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,522
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

504
00:39:57,186 --> 00:40:00,231
-Be tasty.
-It will be.

505
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,946
Be tasty.

506
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,393
I made this injeolmi.
Please have His Majesty taste it.

507
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,980
Once he does,
I'm sure that he'll ask for it again.

508
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,524
I'll have an audience
with His Majesty then.

509
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,192
All right.

510
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,404
Father!

511
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,286
You scared me!

512
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,150
Father!

513
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:13,572
Gwang-soon.

514
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,991
Careful. Turn around.

515
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,621
I almost died.

516
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,957
I would follow you if you did.

517
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,750
Let's go.

518
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,877
Father!

519
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,047
-Do-soo!
-Father!

520
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,842
-What is it?
-There's a ghost. A ghost…

521
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,263
My hat flew away all of a sudden…

522
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,847
Oh, my poor baby.

523
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,975
What are you talking about?

524
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,143
At the well…

525
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,187
The grim reaper…

526
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,940
This is all because your mind and body
are too weak.

527
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:50,526
Let's call the physician over
and get you a tonic.

528
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,533
Do-soo? Do-soo!

529
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,034
Do-soo…

530
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,369
Do-soo!

531
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,002
Do-soo!

532
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,840
Take this, Do-soo.

533
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,841
Here.

534
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,386
Do-soo!

535
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,688
Do-soo!

536
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:33,235
Only three months ago, my spirited Do-soo
was doing backflips. What's happening?

537
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,621
The rumors were true. These are flawless.

538
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,748
The Young Master will be pleased.

539
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,374
Here is your pay.

540
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,084
Thank you.

541
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,548
By any chance,
would you like to order anything else?

542
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,383
If you give me more work,

543
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,219
I could also make a waistcoat for you
while I'm at it.

544
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,554
For free.

545
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,558
Then, could you make an overcoat
for the Young Master?

546
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,393
Sure, I'll get right on it.

547
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,020
Dear ancestors.

548
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,773
Please, look after my Do-soo.

549
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,108
Oh, right.

550
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:17,154
You know, I just ran into some monk
in front of the house.

551
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,324
He told me this nonsense
about this place being possessed

552
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,534
by the spirit of a son
born in this household.

553
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:27,373
He said the son had died with a grudge,
so his spirit was lingering here.

554
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,876
But it's complete nonsense

555
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,629
because the Young Master
is the only son. Right?

556
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,508
To tell you the truth,
there is an illegitimate son.

557
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,927
Although, we don't know
if he's dead or alive.

558
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,470
What? Really?

559
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:47,559
He did say something
about how the son died by the beach.

560
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,313
The Young Master has been
having difficulty sleeping recently…

561
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,315
He looks all weak and feeble
during the day

562
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,943
but screams and talks nonsense at night.

563
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,363
I would rush over to find him
just drenched in a cold sweat.

564
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,616
You can't just ignore things like that.

565
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,743
The only son
of the persimmon house in my town

566
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,746
got possessed by a ghost
and started seeing things and screaming.

567
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,500
He kept talking about
how he saw the Grim Reaper.

568
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,922
Then eventually, he couldn't function
anymore and was totally ruined.

569
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,011
But they fixed it with exorcism.

570
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:25,264
-With exorcism?
-Yes.

571
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,641
Bi-ryeong of Ojang-dong.

572
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:31,145
She's quite a gifted shaman
and I hear she just kicks the spirits out.

573
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,107
I should get going now.

574
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,779
Hey, look here.

575
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,906
Yes, my lord.

576
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,456
Bring me Bi-ryeong of Ojang-dong.

577
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:13,979
I didn't call you over here because
I believe in these silly superstitions.

578
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:18,192
I heard something bothering,
so I just wanted to give it a try.

579
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,068
If there is no improvement,

580
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,404
all of you will be punished.

581
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:23,989
Yes, my lord.

582
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,658
Furthermore, none of you

583
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,663
may divulge anything
about what's happened today to anyone.

584
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,041
Yes, my lord.

585
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,836
Get started.

586
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,199
You take lives as if they were meals,

587
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,160
so you have countless spirits
swarming all over you.

588
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,996
Two spirits of married women
on your shoulders.

589
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,541
Six spirits of unmarried women behind you.

590
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:19,127
From your legs to the top of your head,
all sorts of ghosts, evil spirits,

591
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,881
six-eyed spirits,
giant female spirits are having a feast!

592
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,216
Watch it!

593
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,051
How dare you talk down to me!

594
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,012
Forgive me, Father.

595
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,015
I failed to follow your order

596
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,267
and made a mistake…

597
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,775
She heard a detailed account
of something that happened that day.

598
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:44,736
I heard everything they said from Tae-seo.

599
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:49,116
You should re-enact that exact scene
in front of Park Seung.

600
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,913
What did I tell you?

601
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,082
Tae-seo can't do stuff like this.

602
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,420
You stupid bastard!

603
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,590
You couldn't even take
care of a simple task

604
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,092
and had to make my Do-soo
get blood on his hands?

605
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,595
You useless bastard.

606
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,680
Get out of my house right now!

607
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,810
Your Highness

608
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,228
the Crown Prince.

609
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,356
It's been ages since you passed away.

610
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,234
Why are you still wandering around?

611
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,281
Why are you still rotting away?

612
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,577
And why are you
holding onto this man's heart so tightly?

613
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,663
Shut your mouth!

614
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:40,208
You're talking complete nonsense!

615
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,256
Park Seung.

616
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,676
The Crown Prince's murderer.

617
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,678
A traitor to this nation.

618
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:03,982
Hey, Yi-eon.

619
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,861
My lord.

620
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,237
You were right.

621
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,406
His Majesty is asking for your injeolmi.

622
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,410
Is that so?

623
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:19,289
He said it was
the tastiest injeolmi he'd ever tasted.

624
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:22,584
He's asking for you to come
to the palace with it immediately.

625
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,503
Right now?

626
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,754
Right now.

627
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,509
-Get ready.
-Yes, sir.

628
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,515
Would you like to try it?

629
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,780
Hurry. We do not have time.

630
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,205
Hurry.

631
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,960
Now, we'll call upon the deity.

632
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,505
Wealth and status are nothing but useless,
worldly concepts to the deity.

633
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:13,677
Take off all the ornaments
and fine robes you're wearing right now!

634
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,517
Now!

635
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:27,190
Father, hurry up and take them off.

636
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,736
Father. They said I could die, Father.

637
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,654
Hey.

638
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,656
-Hurry it up.
-Father.

639
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,747
Your socks.

640
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,416
Take them off as well.

641
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,966
That's where the ghost is!

642
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:56,428
The deity is getting angry.
The deity is ready to end it all!

643
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,014
Do-soo! You punk!

644
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,933
Do-soo! Stop, Do-soo…

645
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,108
Now, we'll start the ritual.

646
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,027
The two of you keep bowing.

647
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:16,406
You are not to stop bowing
until I tell you to stop.

648
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,787
Wait…

649
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,748
Almighty deity!

650
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,503
They deserve death,

651
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,254
but accept their humble bows

652
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:36,676
and show them bountiful mercy.

653
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:41,723
Park Seung. Park Do-soo.
They deserve death,

654
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:46,520
but accept their humble bows

655
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:49,981
and show them bountiful mercy.

656
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:54,110
You are not to stop bowing
until I tell you to stop.

657
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,614
Almighty deity!

658
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,659
Beating them to death wouldn't be enough,

659
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,036
but…

660
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,123
Almighty deity!

661
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:12,712
My lord!

662
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,466
Hey. Did you succeed
in acquiring the letter?

663
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,094
Yes. Here it is.

664
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,141
In the Year of the Red Dog,

665
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,103
in return for what he did
regarding the Crown Prince,

666
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,815
I bestow upon Park Seung
authority over Chungcheong Province.

667
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,861
What does it say?

668
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:38,321
His Majesty really
bestowed upon Park Seung

669
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:43,368
control over Chungcheong Province
in return for poisoning the Crown Prince.

670
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,833
Will you be all right?

671
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,918
Even if I have conclusive evidence,

672
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,671
how can I go against the king of a nation?

673
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,096
Just think about a scarecrow and a mole.

674
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,807
A scarecrow and a mole?

675
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,975
Yes.

676
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,769
You place a scarecrow
to protect the farmlands,

677
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,897
but a mole who's not afraid
of the scarecrow

678
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,690
keeps stealing your grain

679
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,192
and spreading diseases in the field.

680
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,445
What would you do?

681
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,156
I would first catch the mole.

682
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,490
That's exactly it.

683
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,743
The useless scarecrow is not important.

684
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:27,454
Right now, it's time to catch that mole.

685
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,668
You are right.
I will catch Park Seung first.

686
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,211
Okay.

687
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,840
Park Seung will soon
start confessing to his crimes.

688
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,675
Please, don't be late.

689
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:44,137
Okay. I'll make sure to have
an arrest warrant for him issued.

690
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,479
-My lord!
-Young Master!

691
00:53:57,192 --> 00:54:00,111
This is getting intense.
Hurry up and kiss already.

692
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,988
You have no time for that.

693
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,744
-You must go to the palace now.
-You must arrive by five.

694
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:08,870
Right.

695
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,873
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

696
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:17,480
Now, you'll wash away
all the evil in the last step.

697
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,401
Confess to the deity
all the sins you've committed.

698
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,281
Or you and your son will not live!

699
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:55,894
Your Majesty. The injeolmi has arrived.

700
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,272
The injeolmi is here?

701
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:00,648
Let them enter.

702
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,577
I'm Scribe Ra Yi-eon of Hongmungwan.

703
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,622
I've made a fresh batch
of injeolmi for you, Your Majesty.

704
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,916
Go ahead and take them out.

705
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,251
Yes, Your Majesty.

706
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,052
This is soybean powder injeolmi.

707
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,806
This is black sesame seed injeolmi.

708
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:37,143
And even mugwort injeolmi.

709
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,145
I am ecstatic.

710
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:45,110
Your health leads
to the health of this nation.

711
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,279
So I added a bit of an herb
that's used as a base for tonics,

712
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,156
aconite, to the injeolmi.

713
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,868
What's the matter, Your Majesty?

714
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,955
You added aconite to this?
How much did you add?

715
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,833
Was there aconite
in the previous batch I had?

716
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,085
Yes, Your Majesty.
It also contained aconite.

717
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,421
I added one pun of aconite.

718
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,734
That is the list of ingredients
for the Crown Prince's tonic

719
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,611
his physician left behind.

720
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,866
As you can see,
six dons of aconite were added.

721
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,578
That amount is as many as 60 times

722
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,080
what you consumed through the injeolmi.

723
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:43,251
You permitted a tonic containing that much
aconite to enter Donggung Palace.

724
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,712
It must mean
it's that much beneficial for the body.

725
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:50,091
Which brings me much joy
and honor to be able to offer you

726
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,093
injeolmi that contains aconite.

727
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:57,557
So please, allow me to serve injeolmi
that contains aconite to you every day.

728
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,559
Wait, aconite…

729
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,561
I mean…

730
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,022
Anyhow, about that,

731
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:07,400
I never gave permission.

732
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,214
If you did not give permission,

733
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,133
how did Park Seung have a letter

734
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,677
you wrote yourself
that has the royal seal on it?

735
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,138
So I…

736
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,599
It's not that I gave permission.

737
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,437
Park Seung feared the Crown Prince
for being too clever,

738
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,898
so he forced me to do it.

739
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,445
Are you sure you weren't a cold-hearted
father who was jealous of his own son?

740
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,536
Your Majesty.

741
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,704
You are the father of this nation.

742
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,748
As the father and ruler of a nation,

743
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,459
how could you abandon your son
in the face of power?

744
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:11,464
If you do not fear the heavens, how do
you expect the heavens to look after you?

745
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,093
I dare risk my own life to ask you this.

746
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,763
Did you use Lord Park Seung as a shield?

747
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:22,100
Or did Lord Park Seung
turn you into a scarecrow?

748
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,151
If you feel any remorse
for the Crown Prince's death,

749
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,946
please allow me to punish Park Seung

750
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,864
by issuing a warrant for his arrest,

751
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:40,702
and revoke his rights to rule
over Gapbigocha, Your Majesty!

752
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,875
Instead of that,

753
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,963
I could bestow
upon you an official position.

754
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,926
How about Chief State Councilor?

755
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,809
What I want

756
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,729
is a fair judgment,

757
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,398
not unjust power.

758
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,985
I'd like to humbly offer Your Majesty
some sincere advice.

759
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,030
While I was on a mission
as a secret inspector,

760
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,824
I saw your subjects suffer
under malignant leadership.

761
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,826
It is my sincerest hope

762
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,162
that all officials
in the wrong be reprimanded

763
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:29,459
to restore law and order, prevent evil,
and comfort the poor subjects.

764
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,211
Instead of treating them poorly
for their lowly birth,

765
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,464
appoint those with talent to positions

766
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:35,757
and reform the customs

767
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,968
that discriminate
and oppress women and children

768
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,889
to give your subjects hope.

769
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,568
I will return the rights
to rule Gapbigocha

770
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,114
and grant you a warrant
for Park Seung's arrest.

771
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,619
You are excused.

772
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:14,105
Must your son die
for you to come to your senses?

773
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,707
Father did it!

774
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:40,339
He ordered Tae-seo
to steal royal offerings.

775
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,382
Do-soo.

776
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:46,262
To cover that up,
he murdered secret royal inspectors!

777
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:48,222
He threatened and forced the physician…

778
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,557
You punk!

779
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,392
…to add aconite to the tonic.

780
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,644
Pull yourself together, punk!
What are you…

781
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:59,567
He had aconite added to the tonic
to worsen the Crown Prince's illness.

782
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,778
The final dose of the poisonous tonic

783
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,529
was…

784
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,825
It was delivered by me!

785
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:10,912
Please, forgive me.

786
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:14,415
Forgive me… I was wrong!

787
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,750
Please, forgive me.

788
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,503
I am sorry.

789
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,297
-Please, forgive me. Forgive me!
-Hear the royal command!

790
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,567
Forgive me.

791
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,237
I was wrong. Please, forgive me.

792
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,074
Did you all hear them
confess their crimes?

793
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,492
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

794
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:58,668
Criminals, Park Seung and Park Do-soo,
are to be tied up!

795
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,630
Let go, you bastards!

796
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:05,758
How dare you lowborn servants
lay a finger on my body!

797
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,926
Let go of me!

798
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,746
THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD ACTORS
IN THIS EPISODE WAS PROPERLY ENSURED

799
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,594
SPECIAL THANKS TO JO KWAN-WOO

800
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,767
I'll make sure you live a life
worse than death itself.

801
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,645
You don't want to move up in the world
or get married.

802
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,896
Have you seriously lost it?

803
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:44,440
-I found it!
-Where?

804
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,233
Do you think I'll succeed?

805
01:05:46,317 --> 01:05:49,236
You have me by your side.
What are you afraid of?

806
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:52,365
The deity says you'll be together
for 100 years!

807
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,034
I will be rooting
for Kim Jo-yi as Ryu Deok-bong.

808
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:58,871
This place will be our new base.

809
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:02,291
Having a happy life was my dream.
That's how I feel now.

810
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:06,337
