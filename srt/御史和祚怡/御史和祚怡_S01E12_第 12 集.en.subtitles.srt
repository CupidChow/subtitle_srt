1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,199
Park Tae-seo was the fake physician?

4
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:35,994
Are you sure?

5
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,374
The scar that I saw on
the abscess specialist's wrist that day…

6
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,334
I saw that scar

7
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,254
on Park Tae-seo's wrist.

8
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,264
So it's true
Park Seung was involved in the death

9
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,600
of the Crown Prince.

10
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,019
But why?

11
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,441
Why would he partake
in such a horrendous act?

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,743
This is the pharmacy journal
Park Tae-seo has with him.

13
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:20,455
It contains a detailed account of
everything that happened in the pharmacy.

14
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,748
But

15
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,959
this is just a written record.

16
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:28,087
There's no entry
that directly mentions Park Seung's name.

17
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,467
This is not enough to prove that
he poisoned the Crown Prince to death.

18
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:37,305
On top of that,
the real abscess specialist is dead.

19
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,562
If this was a mere pharmacy journal,

20
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,149
why would Park Tae-seo go
all the way to Jinin Temple

21
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,360
to acquire it when he was on the run?

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,326
Park Seung used Park Tae-seo,
his illegitimate son,

23
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,328
to embezzle tax grains from Chungcheong

24
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,331
and flagrantly collude
with the government officials

25
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,166
to illegally gain personal profit.

26
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,962
He murdered the inspectors sent out
to Chungcheong without hesitation

27
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,132
and blocked all their reports
from entering the palace.

28
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,177
Could this have been possible
without help from the palace?

29
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,143
In exchange for poisoning
the Crown Prince to death,

30
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,687
someone gave

31
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,356
Chungcheong Province to Park Seung.

32
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,319
You don't mean…

33
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,242
That's where this case begins.

34
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,121
The last page of the ledger was burned,

35
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,999
but it's enough to prove
the embezzlement of tax grains.

36
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,667
My lord! The ledger!

37
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,588
And the ledgers acquired at
Soyang Trading Group and the mountain base

38
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,340
prove they colluded
with Chungcheong officials.

39
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,051
They are as corrupt as they can get.

40
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:01,097
Park Tae-seo illegally operated a mine
to produce silver

41
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,434
and also illegally
cultivated aconite there.

42
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,689
And Park Do-soo murdered
Chief Hong Seok-gi of Maritime Transport.

43
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,818
PHARMACY JOURNAL

44
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:17,155
I'm sure there is something
in the Pharmacy Journal.

45
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,742
We must prove that all of this
is connected to Park Seung

46
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,036
through the interrogation at all cost.

47
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,747
It's perfectly valid speculation.

48
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,042
But the issue is
much too grave to rely solely on that.

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,922
One wrong move, and we could
end up getting harmed, instead.

50
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,548
We need a proper investigation.

51
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,383
It's too dangerous.

52
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,470
Especially so if behind Park Seung is

53
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,348
the one you and I think it is.

54
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,474
Chief Scholar.

55
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,268
Let's not pursue the Crown Prince matter

56
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,270
at the upcoming interrogation.

57
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,065
I fully empathize with your impatience.

58
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,735
However, we must concentrate
on getting Park Seung imprisoned for now.

59
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,696
We must strip him of his power first

60
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,157
before we pursue anything else.

61
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,742
Or we won't stand a chance.

62
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:07,330
This is the most realistic option
at this point.

63
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,412
I know it's shameless,

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,832
but I'll accept this one last time.

65
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,751
What do you mean?

66
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,005
The benefactor has
no intention of stopping the support.

67
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,923
I'm aware.

68
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,259
If it's because the amount is not enough,

69
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,761
I could talk to them about it.

70
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,431
Thanks to their support,

71
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,852
we were able to settle down in Tail Island
when we had nowhere to go.

72
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,104
The benefactor gave us

73
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,356
the courage to fight for survival.

74
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,818
And we were able to farm
and raise livestock by ourselves,

75
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,654
and have made enough money
to be independent,

76
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,781
but that isn't the issue…

77
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,664
Most were kicked out of their homes,
have no parents,

78
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,333
or are fugitives.

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,878
That is to say, we're not
acknowledged as Joseon citizens.

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,839
We're not listed on a family registry,

81
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,300
so if you visit a physician
because you're sick,

82
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,302
you're most likely turned away.

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,097
And even if we offer
to pay many times the price,

84
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,641
medication is hard to come by.

85
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,560
Above all else,

86
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:57,774
government officials could raid
and disperse our village any moment,

87
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,402
so we must live in constant fear.

88
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,867
Which is why we're preparing to leave.

89
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,993
Leave?

90
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:13,664
I heard there are
many other countries in this world.

91
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:18,836
And I've seen some ships
from foreign lands dock in Gapbigocha.

92
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,591
As soon as we have enough money
to get us on one of those ships,

93
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,678
I'm planning to leave Joseon
with the women and children.

94
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,972
Must you do that?

95
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,516
Which is why

96
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,019
before we leave, I would
very much like to meet our benefactor.

97
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,731
I'd like to extend my gratitude in person.

98
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,984
Could you possibly tell me
who the benefactor is

99
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,362
and where I might find them?

100
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,781
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,659
I'm just the messenger.

102
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,579
I can't tell you anything about them.

103
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,756
Wait. Isn't that Tae-seo?

104
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,843
Tae-seo!

105
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,428
Tae-seo…

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,022
Did you really willingly give yourself up?

107
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,649
Were you

108
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,609
unable to get away?

109
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,823
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,869
We were caught thanks to
this idiot dawdling to buy some shoes.

111
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,745
You ate three bowls of noodles.

112
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,747
Because you were taking so long!

113
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,375
You fools.

114
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,921
What about Han-gi?

115
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,841
I'm not sure.

116
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,178
I doubt it's safe at Gokdu either.

117
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,350
GAPBIGOCHA

118
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,294
Ma'am!

119
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,338
What is it?

120
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,839
What is this fuss about?

121
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,007
Kang Han-gi…

122
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,968
Kang Han-gi's Gokdu Trading Group
is being ransacked right now!

123
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,179
What do you mean ransacked?

124
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,389
Officials from the mainland came in.

125
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,560
They're taking everything and everyone
they can get their hands on at Gokdu.

126
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,114
Ma'am.

127
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,617
What happened? What about the goods?

128
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,577
They took all the royal offerings

129
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,080
and the trade goods
that Kang Han-gi embezzled.

130
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,416
But

131
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,171
they didn't seem to know
about the gunpowder and weapons.

132
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,801
But

133
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,513
I can't find the ledger
containing our names.

134
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,933
To live as Turukson?

135
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,852
The Uigeumbu is searching for this.

136
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,439
This butterfly symbol.

137
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,525
It's your mark.

138
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,320
What about Kang Han-gi?
Did they take her, too?

139
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,922
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

140
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,138
TURUKSON

141
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,390
Why is your mark here?

142
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,643
What in the world is going on with you?

143
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,230
If that bothers you,

144
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,400
you can also commit a crime for my sake

145
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,903
or you can pursue justice for your sake.

146
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,447
You just need to choose.

147
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,229
Your plan isn't ruined
because of us, is it?

148
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,775
What is your plan anyhow?

149
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,235
Tae-seo, did you
give yourself up on purpose?

150
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,029
-Seriously?
-If you know, shut up.

151
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,031
Should I?

152
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,535
Hey, don't worry about us.
Just go on with your plan.

153
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,539
We're at the Uigeumbu. It's different
from the regional offices you frequented.

154
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,375
That's true.

155
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,131
I could have sent
Park Seung to hell by now.

156
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,552
If you two idiots hadn't been captured.

157
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,896
Were you going
to sacrifice yourself with that?

158
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,607
If I were alone,
I would've sacrificed, confessed,

159
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,235
taken my own life, whatever it took

160
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,654
to end Park Seung with this.

161
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:40,324
You should've told me if you had
something like that. I'm hurt.

162
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,326
Because it'd put us in danger, idiot.

163
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,578
Why are you so twisted?

164
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,164
I can't get a word out
without you jumping all over it.

165
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,750
Listen to me carefully.

166
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,213
The two of you must say
you were just following my orders

167
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,007
and get out
of the palace alive at all cost.

168
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,219
You might not be able to avoid punishment,

169
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,638
but if you say
I forced you to do all of it,

170
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,765
your lives should be spared.

171
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,600
What about you?

172
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,728
Once you're sentenced and taken away,

173
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,772
my interrogation will begin.

174
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,693
And that's when
I will accuse Park Seung with this.

175
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,904
Hey, even so, we can't
just leave you behind.

176
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,322
I won't gamble

177
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,032
with your lives.

178
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,618
So please…

179
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,581
Shut up and get out of here alive.

180
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,095
Fine.

181
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,056
I will.

182
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,559
I'll try my best.

183
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,146
You know I'm a pretty good actor, right?

184
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,689
Fine.

185
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,859
Maeng-su. You, too.

186
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,320
Okay.

187
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,929
Why is the gunpowder
transaction ledger missing?

188
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,935
Give this ledger to Yook-chil later.

189
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,771
I shall submit it as evidence
with my report.

190
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,274
Okay, I will.

191
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,866
My lord, I forgot to bring
one of the documents. I'll go retrieve it.

192
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,284
Go ahead.

193
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,704
And while you're at home,

194
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,374
why don't you take a nap and rest?

195
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,876
The interrogation will be held tomorrow.

196
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,711
Has it been postponed?

197
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,549
The royal forces that left for Gapbigocha
to arrest Kang Han-gi have yet to return.

198
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,053
Don't worry too much, and get some rest.

199
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,931
Then, I shall.

200
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,569
My lord.

201
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:24,738
My lord…

202
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,325
My lord, we're coming soon. Hang in there.

203
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,663
The source of Joseon's strength
is garlic, right?

204
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,622
Of course.

205
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,543
Without garlic and scallions,
you can't call it Joseon cuisine.

206
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,753
By the way, why are you crying so much?

207
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,258
-My eyes!
-Sorry!

208
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,051
I'm going blind…

209
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,304
I'm going blind. Am I dying?

210
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,890
I think I need to eat something.

211
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,935
My eyes… I think
I'm going blind because of you.

212
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,522
You haven't gone blind.

213
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,818
Seeing that you managed
to only pick out meat.

214
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,279
The meat is cooked perfectly.

215
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:09,533
Thanks to our lord,
our cooking skills have improved a lot.

216
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,369
-Of course. Pass me soybean paste.
-Yes, sir.

217
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,123
Who are you to order me around?

218
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,751
-Salt.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,795
Who are you to order me around?

220
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,928
-Is it seasoned right?
-Why are you--

221
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,601
Salty!

222
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,686
Salty? How could it be salty?

223
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,190
Salty!

224
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,318
We're in big trouble.
I threw in all the meat we had.

225
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,071
My God! Our lord despises salty food.

226
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,955
Then we should eat it all up.

227
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,331
Yes, let's.

228
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,541
-I prefer salty anyhow.
-Me, too.

229
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,672
-Salty makes it tasty.
-It makes you eat a lot of rice.

230
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,843
You know how to eat.

231
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,027
We're not going to buy anything!
You can try next door.

232
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,489
Yes. The neighbors are
much more well off anyhow.

233
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,700
The master of this house
is incredibly stingy.

234
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,034
You should just move on.

235
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,245
I see.

236
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,666
So you have meat as your side dish

237
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,669
because your master
is incredibly stingy?

238
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,507
My lord, when did you get here?

239
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,510
I make the money, and you spend it.

240
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:52,928
Well.

241
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,682
We were making it for you
because you've been working so hard,

242
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,392
but it was much too salty.

243
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,228
How are things going at work?

244
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,857
I'm sure he did
everything perfectly. Right?

245
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,901
He even locked up Park Tae-seo.
It's game over, right?

246
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,153
Right.

247
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,990
Anyhow, bring me the gunpowder ledger
you received at the mountain base.

248
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,784
You should've brought it to me
as soon as you received it.

249
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,744
I didn't receive it.

250
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,790
What do you mean? You didn't get
the gunpowder transaction ledger?

251
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,918
My lord, Jo-yi has that ledger.

252
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,963
She still hasn't handed it over yet?

253
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,798
No.

254
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,764
You said Ojang-dong, right?

255
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,098
You're going to visit her?

256
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,894
Gwang-soon is there, too.
You're not going empty-handed, right?

257
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,146
I have no time. Lead the way.

258
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,119
My lord.

259
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,291
Why do you look so pale?

260
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,086
My lord.

261
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,088
I apologize.

262
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,965
I should've given it to you sooner.

263
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,093
I made the wrong choice.

264
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,221
I can't tell you why,

265
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,473
but I tried to burn this ledger.

266
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,308
I am truly sorry.

267
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,770
It's fine.

268
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,941
You brought it to me right on time.
Do not worry.

269
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,195
My lord.

270
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,989
Whatever the truth may be,

271
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,785
please conduct a proper investigation.

272
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,788
I want a complete answer, the truth.

273
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,124
Okay.

274
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,292
I'll do my best.

275
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,053
Have you eaten?

276
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,848
I'm fine.

277
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,686
I have to take care of that.

278
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,527
-Yook-chil, Gu-pal.
-Yes, sir.

279
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,486
Get ready.

280
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,737
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

281
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,116
Did you find it?

282
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,033
No.

283
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,520
What's wrong?

284
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,338
You can't do that, my lord!

285
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,650
My lord.

286
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,569
You are so mean.

287
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,328
Wait!

288
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,957
Didn't you want to taste
Bo-ri's thick kimchi stew?

289
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:51,917
I did.

290
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,338
The truth is, I'm the one
who taught her the secret to her recipe.

291
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,632
Really?

292
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,302
Do you have
a mortar and pestle by any chance?

293
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,974
Men should do tasks like these.

294
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,141
Let me.

295
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,897
Don't you remember
what happened when we were held up

296
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,107
by those bandits?

297
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,615
Have a seat and wait.
It'll be done in no time.

298
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,164
Ta-da.

299
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,501
So this is the special seasoning
for Bo-ri's stew.

300
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,129
We'll soon arrive
at Chungcheong's most famous eatery,

301
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,046
Bo-ri's Thick Kimchi Stew.

302
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,382
They use a special minced seasoning
made out of dried chili powder.

303
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,675
Aren't you curious how good it tastes?

304
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,886
I get to taste Bo-ri's stew in Hanyang?
This is incredible, isn't it?

305
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,014
Does it make you that happy?

306
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,726
You must tell me the recipe.

307
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,187
No!

308
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,862
I might open a stew place of my own later.

309
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,827
Teach it to me.

310
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,876
Are you trying to score
a secret recipe for free?

311
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,960
You can't.

312
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,838
If you don't want to,

313
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,425
I guess you can come over
and cook it for me every day.

314
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,014
What?

315
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,267
I'd like to see you at my place every day
when I come home from work.

316
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,653
Well, I mean…

317
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,603
What a unique taste!

318
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,564
I've never tasted
anything like this before.

319
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,318
But it's something that you can't stop
eating once you've tasted it once.

320
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,656
How did you end up cooking like this?

321
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,576
I…

322
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,247
used to have a brother
with quite a finicky palate.

323
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:40,293
He was so picky that he used to
even reject meals with 12 side dishes.

324
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,216
You should go ahead and taste it, too.

325
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,843
Okay.

326
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,320
It's clean, not dry, yet deep in flavor.

327
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,491
How did you think
of making broth like this?

328
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:17,080
My mother used to cook it
for me often when I was younger.

329
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,001
My mother had such delicate hands.

330
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,086
But…

331
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,520
You should try it
after mixing the broth with rice.

332
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:43,064
You need a full stomach
to do your job well.

333
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,358
Okay.

334
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,443
You eat up, too.

335
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,905
When your stomach is empty,
so is your heart.

336
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,366
Even if it's just a single meal,
you must enjoy it to be happy.

337
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,552
Put the gunpowder
in the shed in the mountain.

338
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,722
And bury the rifles in the beach.

339
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,057
Except the ones we need,

340
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,100
-burn all of the ledgers.
-Yes, ma'am.

341
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,785
What do we do
if they come to raid us, too?

342
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,453
What do we do now?

343
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,372
There's no need for rash thoughts.

344
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,667
We just continue cooking and eating
with the other women and carry on.

345
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,793
Tail Island…

346
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,545
I'll do whatever it takes to protect it.

347
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,618
Tell me what you told me before.

348
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,704
I can help you get on an iyangseon.

349
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,955
IYANGSEON:
A SHIP HEADED FOR THE WEST

350
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,248
But to get on one,

351
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,417
you're going to need more than the fare.

352
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:41,391
My lord…

353
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,895
Do you see the Pleiades cluster,
towards the west?

354
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,858
"The Pleiades cluster"?

355
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,111
Are you talking about those?

356
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,949
That's toward the north.
That's the Big Dipper.

357
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,536
That's north.

358
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,289
Over there.

359
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,668
There! You mean those stars!

360
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,421
That's Cassiopeia.

361
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,342
"Cassiopeia"?

362
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,261
Over there.

363
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,765
That star! You're talking about that one.

364
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,975
That's the evening star!

365
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,146
It's the evening star?

366
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,442
Then, is it that star?

367
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,235
Which one do you mean?

368
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,613
The one right next to the evening star.

369
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,657
What star is next to the evening star?

370
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,909
Do you not see it?

371
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,243
That is

372
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,578
the moon.

373
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,999
Tie the criminal to the rack
and proceed with the interrogation!

374
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,465
Please, get the chief
state councilor for me.

375
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,884
I'm his only son.

376
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:02,472
Please, let me just talk to him. Please…

377
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,307
The chief state councilor… Please…

378
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,350
Remove the hoods.

379
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,443
Please get the chief
state councilor for me.

380
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,409
-Your Majesty…
-Your Majesty!

381
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,911
Your Majesty!

382
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,955
Your Majesty!

383
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,915
Such impertinence!

384
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,583
How dare you lift up your head?

385
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,090
Where is the other prisoner, Park Seung?

386
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,594
Chief Scholar.

387
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,471
Yes, Your Majesty.

388
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,932
Didn't you say
there was a female offender?

389
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,270
My deepest regrets, Your Majesty…

390
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:54,232
Gokdu Trading Group on Gapbigocha
was searched thoroughly,

391
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,444
but Kang Han-gi was nowhere to be found.

392
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,655
You couldn't even arrest a woman,
and now there's a setback.

393
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,743
Start the interrogation.

394
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,591
Park Tae-seo. Cha Mal-jong.
Ji Maeng-su. Park Do-soo.

395
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,968
They not only committed theft and robbery

396
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,722
but also kidnapped and sold people,
embezzled royal offerings and grain taxes

397
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,100
to rob the palace's assets
and violate principles of morality.

398
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,019
They even committed murder.

399
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,313
And these principal offenders
have been arrested.

400
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,527
Will you admit to your crimes and confess?

401
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,625
Cha Mal-jong will be interrogated first.

402
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,878
Why me…

403
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,839
Sir. My lord. Your Majesty.

404
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,716
I…

405
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,681
-Beat him 30 times.
-Yes, sir.

406
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,853
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,563
I'm truly sorry.

408
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,857
Please, spare me.

409
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,526
What are you apologizing for?

410
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,694
You better confess your crime in detail.

411
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,738
I…

412
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,407
I stole precious royal offerings

413
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,869
and committed acts of high treason.

414
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,579
Are you referring

415
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,166
to bribing the provincial offices
of Chungcheong as the head of Soyang,

416
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,545
abducting and abusing civilians
to turn them into slaves,

417
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,256
murdering secret
royal inspectors in the field,

418
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,885
illegally mining silver
by conspiring with Park Tae-seo,

419
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,929
and hiring bandits to pillage?

420
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,390
Those acts of high treason?

421
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,349
What?

422
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,977
No!

423
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,772
I don't know anything about that!

424
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:02,235
I only desired riches
to dress nicely and eat well.

425
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,113
You dare resort to lies
when there's evidence?

426
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,623
Please, spare me!

427
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:22,755
I was born into
an unremarkable noble family,

428
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,091
but they were still nobles,

429
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,720
so they kicked me out
for being an illegitimate son.

430
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:33,683
I just tried to make a living
with people of similar backgrounds.

431
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,145
That's how I ended up
committing such foolish acts.

432
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,479
Beat him!

433
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,569
Everything I did…

434
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,657
Tae-seo…

435
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,119
Tae-seo ordered me to do it…

436
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,795
And that punk, Park Do-soo…

437
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,008
killed Hong Seok-gi,
the Chief of Maritime Transport.

438
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:11,846
You bastard!

439
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,683
How dare you lowly bastard
run that mouth of yours?

440
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,645
Your Majesty!

441
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,146
It's not true!

442
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,482
I've never seen
these bastards before in my life

443
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,945
and only just found out about
the atrocious acts they've committed!

444
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:27,946
Everyone, be quiet!

445
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,615
Please call the chief
state councilor for me!

446
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,952
Your Majesty!

447
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,830
I swear that I'm innocent!

448
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:42,502
Park Do-soo,

449
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,297
is it true you killed Hong Seok-gi,
the Chief of Maritime Transport?

450
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,175
I did not.

451
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:52,261
I did not kill him.

452
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,555
Bring in the witness!

453
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,033
I…

454
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,872
saw Park Do-soo kill the Chief
of Maritime Transport with my eyes.

455
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,085
That is a false testimony!

456
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:29,215
Furthermore, he kidnapped me
and took me to Park Tae-seo's hideout.

457
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:33,261
Are you claiming that Park Do-soo
and Park Tae-seo kept in contact?

458
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,389
Your Majesty! How can you believe her?

459
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,892
It's true that Park Tae-seo
is an illegitimate son of my father,

460
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,020
but he left home when he turned 15,

461
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,397
and I haven't even
heard from him until now!

462
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:48,860
I swear, I did not
keep in contact with Park Tae-seo!

463
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,363
On the day I witnessed the act,

464
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,116
Park Do-soo, Park Tae-seo
and Cha Mal-jong were together.

465
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,869
And while I was a slave
at Soyang Trading Group,

466
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,079
I saw Park Tae-seo and Ji Maeng-su

467
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,123
come by the group many times.

468
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,878
Even with her testimony,

469
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,964
you still refuse to confess.

470
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,967
-Look here!
-Prepare the press!

471
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:18,097
I'll confess!

472
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,772
Yes, I was ordered
to just meet with Tae-seo

473
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,523
and went to Chungcheong Province.

474
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,069
Who gave the order?

475
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,404
Was it Lord Park Seung?

476
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,438
Father…

477
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,193
Your Majesty.

478
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,153
I, Park Seung,

479
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,197
was released by the grace of Your Majesty

480
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:21,369
and present myself
as the judge of this case.

481
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:29,919
Your Majesty.

482
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,922
Park Seung was named as
the possible mastermind behind this case.

483
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,174
It's not right to release him like this.

484
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,051
On top of that, he's the judge?

485
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,553
Does any of that evidence

486
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,472
contain Lord Park's name?

487
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,979
Your Majesty. His name may
not be mentioned directly,

488
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,314
but if we compare
the many transaction ledgers,

489
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,233
his involvement will be proven.

490
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,193
How could we investigate

491
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,321
the Chief Councilor
without direct evidence?

492
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,200
However, Your Majesty,
having a suspect solely exempt

493
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,578
from the due process is unheard of.

494
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,831
How could we investigate him
without clear evidence?

495
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,332
Your Majesty.

496
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,251
Park Do-soo and Park Tae-seo are

497
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,878
Park Seung's sons.

498
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,546
Even if there's no evidence,

499
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,382
Park Seung's connection
to their crimes is undeniable.

500
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,052
Then,

501
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,514
I will remove Park Seung
from his position and demote him.

502
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,266
You can stop there, Chief Scholar.

503
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,060
You may continue with the interrogation.

504
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,278
Your Majesty…

505
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,115
Your Majesty!

506
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,576
I…

507
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,079
have offered so many bribes to Park Seung

508
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,791
that I have kept a distribution log
detailing the transactions.

509
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,383
I have hidden it
in a place that I only know of.

510
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,303
I can go and get it right now if you wish.

511
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,056
Your Majesty.

512
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,772
Your Majesty. Please, immediately imprison
the suspects in separate cells

513
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,150
and let us interrogate them again
with additional evidence.

514
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,072
-You cannot--
-You may do so.

515
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,590
Bring them back to their cells!

516
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,846
Good. It's done.

517
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,696
If you're lying,
you will be beheaded on the spot.

518
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,991
Where is the distribution log?

519
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,327
I hid it in a tavern I know.

520
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,788
I would suggest you refrain
from pulling any tricks.

521
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:13,666
Even if I have to give it up,
I won't hand it over to you.

522
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,340
-Lock him up.
-Yes, sir.

523
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,694
Cha Mal-jong will never
hand over the distribution log to me.

524
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,863
I thought so as well.

525
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:47,658
I think we should send officials over
to find the evidence.

526
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,660
Is there anyone we can trust?

527
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,915
-Come over here.
-Yes, sir.

528
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,838
They served me for many years
during my time at Saheonbu.

529
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,094
Take Cha Mal-jong with you
to retrieve the distribution log.

530
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,929
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

531
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:29,700
Bi-ryeong!

532
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:31,869
Jo-yi.

533
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,538
Jo-yi.

534
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,583
My goodness. Well done.

535
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,710
How scary that must have been!

536
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:44,090
Not at all. Lord Yi-eon was there,
and I did so well without trembling.

537
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,966
Great. I'm glad to hear that.

538
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,553
-Let's hurry back home.
-Okay.

539
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,556
Here. Get on.

540
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,974
What?

541
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,685
Jo-yi, I'm not a child.

542
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,398
How badly your legs must
have been shaking in there!

543
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,941
I can't let you walk with them.

544
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,443
Get on.

545
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,862
Jo-yi.

546
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,407
I'm even taller than you.

547
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,327
You're right.

548
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,625
Then…

549
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:23,003
make sure not to let go of my hand, okay?

550
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,256
Okay.

551
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,299
Let's go.

552
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,807
Let's hurry.

553
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,899
You hid it well, right?

554
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,821
I just couldn't trust
that old geezer, Park Seung.

555
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,365
So I hid it,

556
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,869
and then I forgot about it. My goodness.

557
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,663
I remember now.

558
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,416
So don't worry.

559
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,835
You must find it.

560
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,796
I'll run over and find it,

561
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,008
so just hang in there.

562
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,553
Let's go.

563
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,601
Tae-seo, don't worry.

564
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:22,062
I'm Mal-jong. Cha Mal-jong!

565
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,038
This is it. Over there.

566
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,542
It's at the end. Over there at the end.

567
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,548
It's on top of that.

568
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,264
Good. It remained safe and sound up there.

569
00:41:57,973 --> 00:42:01,101
If you look inside,
you'll find Park Seung's seal.

570
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:11,695
Okay. It's going to be all right now.

571
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,079
Where is Cha Mal-jong?

572
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,998
Some guards just came by and took him.

573
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,210
Are there guards other than us
that were sent to transport him?

574
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,931
I don't think we came
through this way earlier.

575
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,267
Is there a way back
to the palace this way, too?

576
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,021
What are you doing?

577
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:49,191
I have to get back
to Tae-seo and Maeng-su!

578
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,240
What is this?

579
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,088
Damn it.

580
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,457
Cha Mal-jong is dead?

581
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,753
He's dead? What are you talking about?

582
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,130
When the guards we sent arrived,

583
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:57,217
other guards had already taken him away.

584
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,387
Other guards?

585
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,974
It seems that Park Seung intercepted.

586
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,020
According to the guards,

587
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,773
Cha Mal-jong lied, attempted to flee,

588
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,359
and ended up dead in the process…

589
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:16,612
Then, what about the distribution log?

590
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,448
They say it never existed
in the first place.

591
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,620
We don't know what's the truth though.

592
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,123
This is definitely Park Seung's doing.

593
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,292
We should do something about it.

594
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,460
Stop right there.

595
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,343
I can't just sit back
and watch this absurdity unfold.

596
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,553
Do you still not understand?

597
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,349
His Majesty

598
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,436
has taken Park Seung's side.

599
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,732
Do you still not understand?

600
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,875
Where are we going?

601
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,128
Where are you taking me?

602
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,463
Cha Mal-jong.

603
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,756
Where is he?

604
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,008
Cha Mal-jong is dead.

605
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,553
What do you mean, he's dead?

606
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,096
Why would Mal-jong die?

607
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,475
There's no way. That's impossible.

608
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,018
What did you do to him?

609
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,979
Cha Mal-jong!

610
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,365
Since the suspect has died,
the investigation cannot continue.

611
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,200
So the interrogation ends here.

612
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,290
The suspect, Park Do-soo,

613
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,959
has been proven guilty of murder

614
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,045
and shall be exiled
from the land of Korea.

615
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,174
Based on the compiled evidence,

616
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,676
Park Tae-seo and Ji Maeng-su

617
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,429
have committed too many crimes
to name individually.

618
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,643
I hereby order them to be executed.

619
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:29,786
Finally,

620
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,539
I'm done with you.

621
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,218
I'll do whatever it takes
to distract them, so you run.

622
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,761
This is the palace.

623
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,848
This is nothing
like the places we've lived at.

624
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,475
You're going to die like this?

625
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,477
Pull yourself together, punk.

626
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,479
Think of Mal-jong.

627
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,191
Mal-jong even died to save us.

628
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:33,058
The execution of Park Tae-seo and
Ji Maeng-su will commence soon.

629
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,104
You should attend.

630
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:38,897
If they die,

631
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,108
this investigation

632
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,027
will end like this.

633
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,116
Even though Park Seung
managed to get out unscathed.

634
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,453
This is the time to lie low
and wait for the right time.

635
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,331
I don't want to accept it,

636
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,126
but we have been defeated by Park Seung.

637
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,171
No, I cannot accept defeat.

638
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,465
Look here.

639
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,050
Look here, Busuchan.

640
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,602
Is he all right?

641
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,615
My son.

642
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,583
It's me, your father.

643
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,378
Where am I? Have I been exiled?

644
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,464
You're home.

645
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:48,508
Home?

646
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,929
I paid the restitution fees
to free you. Don't worry.

647
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,061
Father.

648
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,313
My goodness, my baby.

649
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,486
Why didn't you free me sooner?

650
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:10,781
I went through so much because of you!

651
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:14,201
It's okay. It's okay, my baby.

652
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,371
You must have been so scared, my son.

653
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,542
It's all right. You're all right now.

654
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,131
Sir, you can't. You can't, sir.

655
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,468
Do-soo is trying to get some rest!

656
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,389
How dare you barge in here like this?

657
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,641
I must hear
why you killed the Crown Prince.

658
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,405
If you wish to formally ask that question,

659
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,031
you must first

660
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,868
find evidence
that I poisoned the Crown Prince.

661
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,704
You used Park Tae-seo

662
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,165
to allow herbal tonics
containing aconite to enter his palace.

663
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,544
Is that the version
of the truth you believe?

664
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,379
So?

665
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,383
Were you able to catch me with that truth?

666
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,429
Did I run away? Did I hide?

667
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,597
I am standing right in front of you.

668
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,977
Back then and even now,

669
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,563
the one who failed

670
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,566
to catch or stop me was you.

671
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,786
I saw

672
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,122
what would happen.

673
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,765
Hold on!

674
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:18,325
CHUNGCHEONG PROVINCE

675
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,205
And

676
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,916
I knew it from the start.

677
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,126
Want to know what I think?

678
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,799
I think it'll be best
if you take the fall for everything,

679
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,886
let the inspector take you away,
and disappear from the world.

680
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,773
I knew

681
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,652
that you would do exactly as I expected.

682
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,084
The fools always blame the rock
after they fall over.

683
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:11,795
Father.

684
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,090
Yes, Do-soo.

685
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,383
I'm right here.

686
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,140
Do-soo!

687
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,344
So?

688
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,306
Were you able to catch me with that truth?

689
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,643
Did I run away? Did I hide?

690
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,397
I am standing right in front of you.

691
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,279
Back then and even now,

692
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,532
the one who failed
to catch or stop me was you.

693
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,476
Normally, after the first trial,

694
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,187
executions cannot take place
based on the law.

695
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,272
However, their crimes are heinous,

696
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,025
and there are flight risks.

697
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,110
So their executions
will be held immediately.

698
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,866
All right. Let's have some fun.

699
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,072
Stand guard of the area.

700
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,916
Make them step back.

701
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,252
Kill me or let me live,

702
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,421
you will be executed in the end.

703
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,383
You will not be able to
make it out of here alive.

704
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,218
Tae-seo.

705
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,302
Kill him.

706
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,360
Stop.

707
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,782
Attack the criminals now.

708
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,534
You cannot let them get away.

709
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:34,372
What are you doing?

710
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,751
Are you going to defy the royal command
to execute them?

711
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,516
Are you all right, my lord?

712
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,935
We must kill them.

713
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,272
Don't let them get away alive!

714
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,191
Go after them!

715
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,564
SPECIAL THANKS TO JO KWAN-WOO

716
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,319
So what if you fail?

717
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,738
So what if something goes wrong?

718
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,239
It's crap.

719
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,493
Father, I'm really scared.

720
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:20,205
The prisoners have escaped, so you will be
the first one they suspect, Leader Kang.

721
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,498
Mother.

722
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,041
What do you think you're doing?

723
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,334
Show some respect!

724
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,169
Some work hard to make the porridge

725
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,838
so another minister can gobble it up.

726
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,466
I'm sure you'll get back
on your feet, my lord.

727
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:33,510
Jo-yi, for you,

728
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,178
I will start over.

729
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:40,892
