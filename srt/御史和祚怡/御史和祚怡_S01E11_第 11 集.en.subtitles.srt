1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:28,361
We're looking for a woman
named Turukson on Gapbigocha.

4
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,196
Mom.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,907
Put those three on a boat
and get them off this island now.

6
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:34,993
Are you really Lord Yi-eon?

7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,579
Are you really not just a hallucination?

8
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,956
-Jo-yi!
-How do you know Jo-yi?

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,750
-We're childhood friends!
-We're childhood friends!

10
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,376
You're not implying that Park Tae-seo was

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,754
-in the Crown Prince's death, are you?
-I am sure of it.

12
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,882
Please, dismiss
Chief State Councilor Park Seung.

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,759
-Please, dismiss him.
-Please, dismiss him.

14
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,678
Who dares to arrest me? How dare anybody!

15
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,096
You…

16
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,432
Arrest him!

17
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,401
HWANG BI-RYEONG, KIM JO-YI, RA GWANG-SOON

18
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,697
So I calculated
our essential living expenses.

19
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:16,534
After rent, even if we spend
money frugally on just food,

20
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,454
we need at least 58 yang
and 36 jeon per month to survive.

21
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:24,709
That means we need to make
at least 60 yang per month to live.

22
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,668
Yes, that's right.

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,796
I can charge half a yang
per fortune-telling.

24
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,215
If I read one person's fortune per day…

25
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,425
-Fifteen yang!
-Fifteen yang!

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,219
That's assuming I have customers.

27
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,303
You will.

28
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,766
I have something to take care of. Then
I'll look for a job at a trading group.

29
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,436
I know how to read and do math, so
I should be able to find something soon.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,354
Right.

31
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,440
-I'll try being a needlewoman.
-Great.

32
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,276
One of the women
Seung-yul saved from a real estate scam

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,320
happens to be a vendor of goods for women.

34
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,823
I'll ask her if I could make garments
for noblewomen.

35
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,907
Yes, that's great.

36
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,535
Should we put up a poster
about me in the marketplace?

37
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,328
That's a great idea.

38
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,081
Add a line about there being
a great needlewoman too.

39
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:03,998
Sure.

40
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,625
I will write up the poster then.

41
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,252
-Then we'll put it up.
-We'll put it up.

42
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,169
All right.

43
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,175
Needlewoman Jo-yi from Ojang-dong

44
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,719
specializes in producing
excellent bespoke garments

45
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,513
with the minimum amount of fabric.

46
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,516
We promise to make you
the best garments you've ever seen

47
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,685
that stylishly accentuates your figure.

48
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,937
-I love it.
-Me too.

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,523
Are you curious about
your husband's previous relationships?

50
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,068
The gifted shaman, Bi-ryeong,
will see all just by holding your hand

51
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,112
and tell you your fortune in great detail.

52
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,699
To find out more,
come to the house with trumpet creepers

53
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,242
in Myeongcheol-bang, Ojang-dong.

54
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,368
-Bi-ryeong.
-Jo-yi.

55
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,870
Check us out!

56
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,371
It looks like they just opened.

57
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,541
You can get clothes made
and have your fortune told.

58
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,667
Should we check it out?

59
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,712
I want to find out how compatible I am
with Young Master Cha.

60
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,797
I just happened to need a new vest.

61
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,299
This is perfect.

62
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,467
Have you heard of

63
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,095
Needlewoman Jo-yi in Ojang-dong?

64
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,388
I have.

65
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,266
I heard she's excellent
at bringing out colors.

66
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,686
I heard that with a single stitch,
she can make someone chic.

67
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,688
I heard she came from Qing.

68
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,815
I heard her talent is unrivaled in Joseon.

69
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,401
I guess a needlewoman
from overseas really is different.

70
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,866
They say she makes garments
come alive with a single stitch.

71
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,243
A woman who'd been
rejected 100 times got engaged

72
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,162
as soon as she wore an outfit from here.

73
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,874
They say Needlewoman Jo-yi's garment
makes you look at least 10 geun lighter.

74
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:31,336
They say she's really good at finding
the right colors for your skin tone.

75
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,255
-This is quite pretty.
-It's quite pretty.

76
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,508
I hear that you're even able
to bring the beauty out of a pumpkin.

77
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,513
I hear the Minister of Interior's daughter
went on a blind date wearing your garment

78
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,599
and ended up getting engaged.

79
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,643
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,020
I was happy to hear that it went well.

81
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,108
They say it's easy for third-eldest
daughters to get married.

82
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,778
But my Soo-ryeon
has gone on 100 dates to no avail…

83
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,405
If my daughter
succeeds in getting married,

84
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,074
I'll gladly double your fee.

85
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,704
So please,
turn her into an attractive woman.

86
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,164
Please?

87
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,963
Well? Is there hope?

88
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,716
Go on, then.

89
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,635
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,098
To start with, her garments are
way too big for her body.

91
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,268
It makes her standing posture
look awkward.

92
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:32,021
And her sleeves are much too long
and hide her beautiful hands.

93
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,147
As for the jeogori,

94
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,357
based on her complexion,

95
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,653
warmer tones like the color of madder
will suit her better than cooler tones.

96
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,906
The neckline should be cut deeper
for her face to look slimmer.

97
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,493
And the skirt should be slimmer
and straight, one that's less full.

98
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,913
I believe such alterations
will make her look more chic.

99
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,916
We're done.

100
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,036
Who is this? Are you a human or a fairy?

101
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,330
We're in the presence
of a real-life fairy.

102
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,291
Thank you so much.

103
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,043
You just saved our family.

104
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,544
My pleasure.

105
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,965
My goodness.

106
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,218
Did you hear the rumor
about the needlewoman?

107
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,554
It turns out she didn't come from Qing.

108
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,848
They say she crossed the Milky Way.

109
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,269
Does it mean that she is the Weaver Girl?

110
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,938
No wonder. Her talents
did seem superhuman.

111
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,857
I knew she wasn't human.

112
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,067
Exactly.

113
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,569
How remarkable!

114
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:09,368
Would any of you
like your palms read while you wait?

115
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,884
Your husband has a mistress!

116
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,302
-A mistress?
-Oh, my.

117
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,057
-Her hair is long.
-Long hair.

118
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,767
-Her lips are red.
-Red lips.

119
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,396
And she has two eyes!

120
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,941
Two eyes?

121
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,568
-Do me next.
-One at a time, please.

122
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,071
-Who's the wench?
-Let's see.

123
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,073
You'll live a long life.

124
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,033
Bi-ryeong. It's half a yang!

125
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,243
Right.

126
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,913
Many children in your later years.

127
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,081
This is new.

128
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,875
You can see the masterful craftsmanship
in every stitch.

129
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,129
-You are just too kind!
-You'll meet your match soon.

130
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,548
I'll put these two aside.

131
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,842
-Thank you. This is too precious.
-Thank you.

132
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,552
-We'll see you later.
-Thank you.

133
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,095
Does it feel good?

134
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,596
Yes, it's really nice.

135
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,890
How much did we make?

136
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,226
We made 20 yang
just from your fortune-telling.

137
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,937
Then we can go to Unjongga tomorrow?

138
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,814
Yes, and have some mung bean pancake.

139
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,191
-Great!
-Mung bean pancake sounds great!

140
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,153
-This is so pretty.
-This one is already sold.

141
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,655
This one, too.

142
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,490
They're all sold.

143
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,909
-But how much is this?
-Thirty yang.

144
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,995
How much is all this?
We're going to be rich!

145
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,921
I want mung bean pancakes
and steamed rice cakes.

146
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,593
I hear injeolmi never runs out
in Haminjeong Pavilion.

147
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,512
I guess sitting on a throne
doesn't make a person refined.

148
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,431
I know, right?

149
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,475
When His Majesty looks at a woman,

150
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,602
he checks how neat her toenails are first.

151
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,814
I hear that's why he makes
every court lady take off her socks.

152
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,151
Such peculiar taste. A woman's toenails?

153
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:10,615
Anyhow, I hear the Minister of War
sent a matchmaker to Young Master Do-soo.

154
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,116
Young Master Do-soo?

155
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,119
Are you talking about
Chief State Councilor Park's only son?

156
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,037
Yes.

157
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,874
I heard that family was looking
for a daughter-in-law as well.

158
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,877
But I heard he has two sons.

159
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,379
I hear he also has an illegitimate son.

160
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,048
His name is Tae-seo.

161
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,593
Apparently, Lord Park Seung
knocked up a servant girl.

162
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,470
One was born in the master chambers

163
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:36,933
and the other in a room by the gate
on the same date and time, I heard.

164
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:42,522
I see. That explains why his wife
passed away bitterly early on.

165
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,567
And that servant girl also left the house,
abandoning her four-year-old son.

166
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,362
My goodness. How absurd.

167
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,072
Goodness me.

168
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,115
If you're done, I believe I'm next.

169
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,825
Of course.

170
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,508
Young Master.

171
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,761
Jo-yi asked if you could
meet her by the well tonight,

172
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,346
just the two of you.

173
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,722
Do you know what that means?

174
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,765
Young Master.

175
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,392
By a well, in the dead of night…

176
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,019
You can't find
a spot more secret than that.

177
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,563
"No, my lord!"

178
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,398
"No, we can't!"

179
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,369
You made it.

180
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,745
Yes.

181
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,792
Why did you ask
to see me here of all places?

182
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,753
While taking
some noblewomen's measurements,

183
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,758
I heard something about Lord Park Seung.

184
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,438
-My lord.
-Yes?

185
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,606
Come closer.

186
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,612
Is that true?

187
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,447
That's what I heard.

188
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:19,076
Well done. If you hear anything else,
let me know.

189
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,911
Yes, I will.

190
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,664
I'll get going then. I'm busy.

191
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,501
Wait, don't…

192
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,300
She must be really busy.

193
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,474
Jo-yi asked

194
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,270
if you could meet her at the field of
silver grass today, just the two of you.

195
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,189
Silver grass field…

196
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,358
The silver grass field

197
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,818
is crawling with ghosts.

198
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,243
Why did she have to
choose here of all places?

199
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,046
My lord…

200
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,178
My lord…

201
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,431
My lord.

202
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,351
My lord…

203
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,359
-My lord.
-Yes?

204
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,403
Today, I heard something
about Park Do-soo.

205
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,321
Yes. I see.

206
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,781
What is it?

207
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,914
Is that so?

208
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,416
Yes, apparently.

209
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,042
All right, then.

210
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,128
What? Wait…

211
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,765
She does things like that now.

212
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,440
Today, she asked you
to come to the shed by the watermill.

213
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,067
Shed? Indoors?

214
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,277
That's it then.

215
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,950
Right.

216
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,499
-My lord.
-Hey.

217
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,462
-Today, I'm really going to--
-My lord.

218
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,964
I heard something about Park Tae-seo.

219
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,300
Park Tae-seo?

220
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,313
Is that so?

221
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,356
Yes, apparently.

222
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,819
And…

223
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,713
Oh, my goodness. Gosh.

224
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,427
Well, I know you're busy,

225
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,472
but you should
still keep your appearance tidy.

226
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,225
Right.

227
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,894
Although…

228
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,189
you could even wear a straw mat

229
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,441
and still look good in it.

230
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,237
I have work to catch up on, so…

231
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,031
What? Wait!

232
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,574
So many things to do!

233
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,456
She's so busy, as always.

234
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,219
We can't seem to find Park Tae-seo.

235
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,684
This is aconite.

236
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,561
It's known as a medicinal herb, but…

237
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,812
It's also poison.

238
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,524
The one who secretly
mass-produced this aconite

239
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,569
is Park Tae-seo,
Park Seung's illegitimate son.

240
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,907
You're not implying that Park Seung
and Park Tae-seo were involved

241
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,868
in the Crown Prince's death, are you?

242
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,790
That is not something
you should say rashly.

243
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,085
The one who set up the temporary pharmacy
to treat the Crown Prince

244
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,920
was Chief State Councilor Park Seung.

245
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,799
A pharmacy was set up.
An abscess specialist was replaced.

246
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,598
And aconite was suddenly
prescribed too much and too often.

247
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,894
Do you really think
it was a mere coincidence?

248
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,438
I am sure of it.

249
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,400
The abscess specialist I saw that day

250
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,820
must have been an impostor.

251
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,530
I am certain

252
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,491
he wasn't the real abscess specialist.

253
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,827
Before the interrogation begins,

254
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,581
I will return with evidence that
my claim about the physician is right.

255
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,875
So please, trust me and wait.

256
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,294
GWANGHWAMUN GATE

257
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,350
Were you able to find anything?

258
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,517
I apologize, sir,

259
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,896
but we weren't able to find
any records regarding

260
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,190
the fake physician you saw that day.

261
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,487
But we found something about the real
abscess specialist who disappeared.

262
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,407
He was from Gyeongsang Province.

263
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,368
He was such a good physician

264
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,536
that the Crown Prince
trusted him a great deal.

265
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,414
But he was abruptly dismissed

266
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,584
and vanished from the palace
before His Highness passed.

267
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:11,261
It seems that he was
quite a meticulous notetaker.

268
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,932
Then he must have

269
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,476
left behind records of His Highness.

270
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,061
He must have.

271
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,897
According to those
who last saw the physician,

272
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,401
He was suffering from delusions

273
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,654
and suddenly left
for Jinin Temple in Mt. Samgak,

274
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,614
saying he needed a cleaning ritual.

275
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,953
JININ TEMPLE

276
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,424
Then,

277
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,969
are you saying
that physician is still alive?

278
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,054
It seems so.

279
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,892
Then we must find him

280
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,602
before the interrogation begins.

281
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,106
We must find that physician.
That is the highest priority.

282
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,317
Giddy-up.

283
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,198
I must find him
before the interrogation begins.

284
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,172
Your Majesty.

285
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,260
Your Majesty!

286
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:21,183
My goodness, I can't even play
the gayageum in peace.

287
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,310
I apologize, Your Majesty,

288
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,188
but Lord Park Seung,
who's currently locked up in jail,

289
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,856
keeps speaking of strange things.

290
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,068
He said…

291
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,719
Your Majesty.

292
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,807
What do you mean,
the real abscess specialist is alive?

293
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,976
You should know…

294
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,106
what that means better than anyone else.

295
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,696
How dare you try to mess with your King?

296
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,656
I am just…

297
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,912
sharing with you what only I knew about,
Your Majesty.

298
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,709
Because I was worried
that a false rumor might spread

299
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,170
that the Crown Prince was poisoned.

300
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,883
By his father, the King, no less.

301
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,559
That's why

302
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,395
you will need me.

303
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,316
That is, unless you want
the rumor to spread

304
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,943
that the King poisoned
his own son out of jealousy,

305
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,657
his son who had only returned
after facing hardship in a distant nation.

306
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,454
If you release me,

307
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,291
I will protect your throne

308
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,586
as I did back then.

309
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,918
Damn it.

310
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,046
This isn't going to work.

311
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,716
Seriously.

312
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,594
Damn it.

313
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,554
This thing is too damn sturdy.

314
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,724
They must've spent
all the taxes to build these prisons.

315
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,893
I embezzled all those grain taxes,

316
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,646
but it didn't even make a dent
in the royal treasury.

317
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,855
Unbelievable.

318
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,525
Hey.

319
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:21,029
Why are you so calm?
Are you meditating or something?

320
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,118
Damn bastard.

321
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,745
How can you sleep at a time like this?

322
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,082
Tae-seo will be coming down
from the mountain at some point.

323
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,251
What if he gets captured as well?

324
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,380
Go on ahead with Mal-jong.

325
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,091
As soon as you arrive in Gapbigocha,
take Han-gi and flee.

326
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,593
Gokdu might not be safe as Mal-jong said.

327
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,137
I'm counting on you.

328
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,974
What are you talking about?
You must come with us.

329
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,728
Go on ahead without me.
I'll catch up after meeting someone.

330
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,062
Who?

331
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,481
The King.

332
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,985
How can you sleep right now, punk?

333
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,904
My goodness! You can't just
suddenly open your eyes like that!

334
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,406
You almost scared me to death!

335
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,159
The way to meet the King in person…

336
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:08,869
What?

337
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,287
This is what…

338
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,873
Tae-seo meant.

339
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,417
What in the world are you talking about?

340
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,546
What did Tae-seo say
and what the hell is this about?

341
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,305
You can't be serious.

342
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,351
Are you saying
he's going to get arrested on purpose?

343
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,815
That damn fool…

344
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,402
His plan is to see the King
at the interrogation site?

345
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,947
What a crazy bastard.

346
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,335
I just love the sound of money.

347
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,294
Jo-yi.

348
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,630
Gwang-soon and I are going
to the night market.

349
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:04,341
-Okay.
-We'll be right back.

350
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,927
Bi-ryeong sounds so excited.

351
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,140
I wonder who made these. They're amazing.

352
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,687
I have lots of money and lots of orders.

353
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,107
These…

354
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:24,069
will go over here.

355
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,487
And this…

356
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,993
I'll put it in my bag
in case of emergencies.

357
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,413
What?

358
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,552
Bo-ri, how nice it would be
if you were here with me.

359
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,517
Jo-yi!

360
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,060
Hey.

361
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,816
-What brings you here?
-Well…

362
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,527
Can you comb my hair for me?

363
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:09,614
Sit here, then.

364
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,710
You've always used
that broken comb, but this is new.

365
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,504
Yes, some lady gave it to me earlier.

366
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,966
That reminds me.
That lady was looking for you.

367
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,968
-Me?
-Yes.

368
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,429
She asked where you live.
Did you not see her?

369
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,639
Really?

370
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,184
No one stopped by today.

371
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,227
How strange…

372
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,646
She said she was
from your hometown, Yeowul Valley.

373
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,403
-Yeowul Valley?
-Yes.

374
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,739
She said she lived
in the same town as you.

375
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,826
A neighbor?

376
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,537
She said she was just a neighbor?

377
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,789
Yes, just a neighbor.

378
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,042
A neighbor?

379
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:03,960
Who could it be?

380
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,088
That hurts!

381
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:08,632
Sorry.

382
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,468
That's why you shouldn't move.

383
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,762
It hurts more when you do.

384
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:19,100
You combing my hair like this…
It feels like you're my mom.

385
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,436
Though, I never had a mom,

386
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,064
so I don't really know
what it feels like to have a mom.

387
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,860
You can keep that comb.

388
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,156
She gave it to you.
Why would you give it to me?

389
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,076
Who cares? You'll be
combing my hair anyway.

390
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,079
You hold onto it, so I can
order you around whenever I want.

391
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,331
All right.

392
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,086
Order me around as much as you want.
I'll comb your hair every day.

393
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,087
Yes.

394
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,731
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

395
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,695
My lord.

396
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,906
Have a safe trip.

397
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,493
By the way, what is that ledger?

398
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,289
It seems to be
a ledger of gunpowder transactions.

399
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,665
Gunpowder?

400
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,546
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

401
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,009
KANG HAN-GI

402
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,760
TURUKSON

403
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:37,429
These bastards are just sickening.

404
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,599
They crossed the sea
to even strike deals in Gapbigocha.

405
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,313
Give this ledger to Yook-chil later.

406
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,357
I shall submit it as evidence
with my report.

407
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:54,154
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

408
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,699
Are you inside?

409
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,825
Yes.

410
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,827
I brought over the rental lease document.

411
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,882
It seems Korean melons are out of season.
They're hard to come by.

412
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,092
But I managed to acquire some.

413
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm so good at listening to Jo-yi.

414
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,603
Here's the contract.

415
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,104
Yes.

416
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:29,731
Thanks.

417
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,442
You should look through it.

418
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,986
There's no need. I trust you.

419
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,948
What's wrong?

420
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,409
Are you tired?

421
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,535
What?

422
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,081
Yes.

423
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,300
Since you're a lawyer,
you must know a lot about the law.

424
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,636
Yes, I probably know a lot more than you.

425
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,805
I have a question.

426
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:06,434
When a royal interrogation takes place,
there must be evidence

427
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,395
for the criminal to be punished, right?

428
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,312
Right.

429
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,398
People confess sometimes,

430
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,566
but having evidence is the surest way.

431
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,820
Then what happens

432
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:20,949
if your name is on the document
presented as evidence?

433
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,285
What?

434
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,331
You didn't commit any crime.
You're innocent.

435
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,333
But what if…

436
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:35,713
What if your name is
on that documentary evidence?

437
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,967
Will you still be punished?

438
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,430
It means you're involved in some way.
So you might not be sentenced,

439
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,308
but you'll be arrested
to be tortured or interrogated.

440
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,105
But why are you asking about that?

441
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,491
You may pass.

442
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,160
Stand over here.

443
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,830
You may pass.

444
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,415
PARK TAE-SEO
KANG HAN-GI

445
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,292
You may pass.

446
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,753
Stop. All right, you may pass.

447
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,922
Where are you coming from?

448
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,800
I came from Gapbigocha.

449
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:21,885
Gapbigocha?

450
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,138
Then write your name
and address on that log.

451
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,432
Why?

452
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,227
There was a heinous crime,
so we're looking for the suspects.

453
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,646
You're a woman,
so I'm sure you're not one of them.

454
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,442
But anyone from Chungcheong, Gyeongsang,
and Gapbigocha must be recorded.

455
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,277
Here. Go on and write it down.

456
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,739
Next.

457
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,241
Stand over here.

458
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,620
You may pass.

459
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,289
You may pass. Stand.

460
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:55,043
I don't really know how to write,
so I don't know how to write my address.

461
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,461
Go. Just go.

462
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,504
Yes. Thank you.

463
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,922
Stand over here.

464
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,882
Stand in the back.

465
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,718
Write down your name and address.

466
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,646
Wait. Why do you have this?

467
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,524
I don't know.

468
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,071
What do I do, Seung-yul?
What if my mother ends up in danger?

469
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,118
Thinking about handing this over
to the Uigeumbu terrifies me.

470
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:34,123
So you somehow got involved with a secret
royal inspector and ended up with this?

471
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,251
A secret royal inspector?

472
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,796
I should've handed it over back then,

473
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,508
but I broke my promise.

474
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,719
I know I shouldn't be doing this, but…

475
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,472
I know. You're human
and her daughter, after all.

476
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,059
But if you do this,
you become an accomplice,

477
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,811
because you're withholding evidence.

478
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,816
And it will also
put the lord in a tight spot.

479
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,070
You said he already saw
the content of the ledger.

480
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,866
Then he may have already gotten
a confession out of the criminals

481
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,284
by torturing them.

482
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,661
If he did,

483
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:15,248
does it mean
my mother might be arrested soon?

484
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,583
But as you said,

485
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,751
if she's innocent, she'll be released.

486
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:23,464
You said the inspector was a just man.

487
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,635
If her innocence is proven through
the investigation, he will help her.

488
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:35,143
But if my mother really committed a crime…

489
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,478
Let's go.

490
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,200
Let's go. Come on.

491
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,917
I can't do it. I can't go there.

492
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,591
This is the cruelty
and inconsistency of the law.

493
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,510
It stresses the importance
of bonds and virtues,

494
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,930
but forces you
to turn your back on your family.

495
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,943
Then why don't you sleep on it tonight

496
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,445
and let me know
when you make up your mind?

497
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,705
And have some of this.
You need to eat to keep your strength up.

498
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,875
I'll get going.

499
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:38,891
I'm sorry.

500
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,187
I had to take a detour to avoid
checkpoints. There are so many of them.

501
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,732
It's fine. So you're a little late.

502
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,483
Did you find her?

503
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:55,033
It seems she somehow found a house to live
with help from a friend.

504
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,035
A friend?

505
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,287
Yes, a male friend.

506
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,207
So I looked into him,
and he's a lawyer in Hanyang.

507
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,752
Choi Seung-yul is his name.

508
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,211
Do you know him?

509
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,796
I know Seung-yul.

510
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,674
He is Jo-yi's childhood friend.
He's trustworthy.

511
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,134
Is that so?

512
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,055
Thank you. Getting all this information
couldn't have been easy.

513
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:17,972
Goodness.

514
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,977
Thanks to me being a deplorable mother,
an innocent person like you has to suffer.

515
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,479
Deplorable? Come on.

516
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,981
Mothers are people, too.
You need to live your life.

517
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,279
You should get going.

518
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:37,575
Try not to leave
a long-lasting thorn in her heart.

519
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,831
Where is it?

520
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,750
Tell me where it is.

521
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,920
Seeing how you're still alive,

522
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,923
the agreement must be still valid.

523
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,092
I don't know what you mean.

524
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,178
What you received in exchange

525
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,680
for taking everything you saw
and heard to your grave.

526
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,140
Where is it?

527
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,476
I really don't know.

528
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,353
Where did you hide it?

529
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,083
No…

530
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,261
No…

531
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:43,224
No! You can't!

532
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,475
PHARMACY JOURNAL

533
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,522
No.

534
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,941
You can't…

535
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,280
No!

536
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,532
You are never to disclose
what you saw and heard

537
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,826
after the temporary pharmacy
was established

538
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:06,539
and to cooperate in letting the herbal
tonics into the Crown Prince's palace.

539
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:11,252
In exchange, I guarantee the safety
of your daughter, Ra Gwang-soon.

540

Is anyone home?

543
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,595
Excuse me.

544
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,061
Who is it?

545
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,315
Can I…

546
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,027
hug you?

PHARMACY JOURNAL

550
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,561
I have an abscess on my back.

551
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,272
What did you use to make the medicine?

552
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,733
I used aconite.

553
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,973
I knew it.

554
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,851
You're the culprit.

555
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,022
You did that to the Crown Prince!

556
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,941
-I…
-Silence!

557
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,158
Ever since His Highness passed away,

558
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,076
the past year…

559
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,289
felt like I was going through hell.

560
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,960
The likes of which
you could never imagine.

561
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,489
Stand up.

562
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,082
Killing you like this
might make me feel better.

563
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,337
But if I did that,

564
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:50,132
it would be too unfair
for the Crown Prince.

565
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,178
And…

566
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,766
when I'm given a chance
to harm someone like this,

567
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,896
choosing not to do harm

568
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:10,027
is my way of being conscientious…

569
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,614
as a human being.

570
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,449
There he is.

571
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,408
My lord!

572
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,333
Take him away.

573
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,291
When I returned to Joseon,

574
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,918
you were already married.

575
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,921
I heard it was
to a well-off middle-class family.

576
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,926
I wanted to visit you
when I heard you'd returned,

577
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,970
but I wasn't able to.

578
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,849
Even if you did,
we wouldn't have been able to meet.

579
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,018
I was…

580
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,104
forced out immediately.

581
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,690
I'm sorry.

582
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,276
What do you have to be sorry about?

583
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,862
We were just born in the wrong era.

584
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,245
But still…

585
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,793
But still, I thought you'd come
to visit me at least once.

586
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,630
Although I wasn't able to go,

587
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,679
I still waited for you.

588
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,438
How foolish.

589
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,734
You shouldn't have expected it from
a mother who ran away to save her skin.

590
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,736
I know.

591
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,781
I'm sure you had your reasons.

592
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,240
It doesn't matter.

593
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,247
Why did you leave Gaehwa Valley?

594
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,128
The truth is,

595
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:36,423
I got divorced recently.

596
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,634
Good for you.

597
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,054
Good?

598
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,933
I'm sure it wasn't a marriage
you wanted in the first place.

599
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,144
Then…

600
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,689
I can just live alone like this?

601
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:55,818
Of course.

602
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,736
Do as you wish.

603
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,284
The purpose of life is
to learn how to stand on your own.

604
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,869
It's time you found that out.

605
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,501
Anyway, we now know the other
is well and alive, and that's enough.

606
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,171
I'm sure the past nine years
have been hard for you,

607
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:18,632
but I had to put my survival first.

608
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,844
I tried my best
so I could see you again someday.

609
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,346
I hope you know that.

610
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,474
How could I not?

611
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:32,479
I'm just thankful that you've returned.

612
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:42,823
So I hope you continue
living your life without me in it.

613
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:48,162
I can no longer live
solely as your mother.

614
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,747
And to be honest,

615
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,500
I no longer want to live for someone else.

616
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,044
I just want to be completely alone.

617
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,714
Mom.

618
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,758
You're an adult now,
so I don't have to worry about you.

619
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,637
That's very true.

620
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,056
I can help you and earn my own living…

621
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,559
I'm telling you that I won't be staying.

622
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,938
What do you mean?

623
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,400
And that my duties
as your mother end here.

624
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,948
But why?

625
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,910
Do you have an illness, by any chance?

626
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,078
Or is there another reason?

627
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,372
You can tell me. I'll be understanding.

628
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:37,711
I'm saying I'm leaving my name, Deok-bong,
and my past behind.

629
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,426
Why?

630
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,347
To live as Turukson?

631
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,193
The Uigeumbu is searching for this.

632
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,778
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

633
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,614
What is that?

634
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,413
This butterfly symbol.

635
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:16,041
It's your mark.

636
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,923
This is a ledger of gunpowder transactions

637
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,175
made by the criminals
detained at the Uigeumbu.

638
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,096
Why is your mark here?

639
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,306
How are you connected with them?

640
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,393
And why do you do something
so dangerous in Gapbigocha?

641
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,312
What in the world is going on with you?

642
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,273
I am surviving.

643
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,778
Do you understand?

644
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:48,156
I, too, am doing my best to survive.

645
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:54,204
So you should pull yourself together
and focus on your own future.

646
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,665
And if the Uigeumbu is
looking for that ledger,

647
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,542
just bring it to them.

648
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,044
And what if that lands you
on the list of suspects?

649
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,212
Why would I be?

650
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,339
Is my name written in there?

651
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,051
As if a butterfly signature
could prove anything.

652
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,846
Why do you still have
that important piece of evidence?

653
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,641
Are you trying to get dragged
to the Uigeumbu and severely punished?

654
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,563
That's not an answer to my question.

655
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,776
I asked if you committed crimes
with those criminals.

656
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,362
Your name may not be written there,

657
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,948
but I know

658
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,451
this means you.

659
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,121
I know.

660
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,178
If that bothers you,

661
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,181
you can also commit a crime for my sake

662
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,184
or you can pursue justice for your sake.

663
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,144
You just need to choose.

664
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:05,108
That may be a good starting point
for your journey to independence.

665
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,843
Excuse me.

666
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,387
Is this Gaehwa Valley?

667
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,556
-It is.
-By any chance,

668
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,436
do you know of a woman named Kim Jo-yi?
She married a man in this town.

669
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,313
If that's the case,
you should give me her husband's name.

670
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:28,400
How would I know
a name of a woman from another town?

671
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,280
I know her.

672
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,910
I know Jo-yi well.

673
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:41,955
Why are you looking for my sis?

674
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,459
Your sis?

675
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,797
I am Jo-yi's…

676
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,554
I was sent on an errand
from Yeowul Valley.

677
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:58,930
Her hometown?

678
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,808
My goodness.

679
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,727
How happy she will be!

680
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,438
Hold on. What should I do?

681
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,273
I'm just on my way to open my tavern…

682
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:12,110
No, that's not important right now.
I'll take you to her--

683
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,320
It's fine.

684
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,906
If you just tell me where to go,
I can find my way.

685
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:16,907
Goodness.

686
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,577
Then you just need to keep going this way,

687
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,662
and when you see the stream, turn right.

688
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,080
Turn right…

689
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,086
And take about ten steps.
Then you'll come across a big tree.

690
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,172
From there,

691
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,384
it's the third house.
Remember, the third one.

692
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:37,969
Thank you.

693
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,649
You should ask Jo-yi
to braid your hair next time.

694
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,150
She's quite good at it.

695
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,235
I will.

696
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,320
Have a safe trip.

697
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,496
The third house.

698
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,084
What are you going on about?

699
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,294
You expect me to eat cold food?

700
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:16,842
The truth is, I heard that
my mother came back home.

701
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,594
I just wanted to go
and see her for a moment.

702
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,971
What?

703
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:23,890
As if being dragged away to Qing
is anything to be proud of.

704
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,309
You should be just lying low right now.

705
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,229
Are you trying to announce it
to the whole town?

706
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,147
"Everyone!"

707
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,401
"My mom went to Qing and now she's back!"

708
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:36,778
My mother is not a criminal.

709
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,115
We failed to protect her,
so we should be ashamed,

710
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,033
not my mother who got dragged away.

711
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:46,079
Shameless, just like her mother.

712
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:50,667
Anyway, I don't feel
like eating right now.

713
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,085
Just set another table later!

714
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:57,299
The table is set, so if you're hungry,
just fill your own bowl of rice.

715
00:52:57,382 --> 00:53:00,760
What? Fill my own bowl?

716
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,806
My goodness! Chu-han!

717
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,393
That damn wench is trying
to starve her mother-in-law!

718
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,980
Chu-han!

719
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,528
She's so terrible.

720
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,406
How could she say such a thing?

721
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,953
I might have put up
with all sorts of abuse from her,

722
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,955
but I can't with her insulting my mother.

723
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,208
It's not like she wanted to go to Qing.

724
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,795
The country is at fault
for losing the war, not the women.

725
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,715
Why are the women at fault
for everything wrong in this world?

726
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,548
Our lord finally caught him, you see.

727
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,633
Yook-chil, that's the bastard.

728
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,843
You rotten bastard.

729
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:08,430
We had to hold a funeral for our lord
because of you, you bastard!

730
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,850
-You absolute bastard!
-It's fine. He's as good as dead.

731
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:18,732
That man is our lord.
That's right. He's our lord.

732
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,400
He's a Hongmungwan busuchan.

733
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:24,195
He is Lord Ra Yi-eon
of the Naju Ras! All right?

734
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:27,824
That's our lord! Our lord!

735
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,461
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

736
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,094
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

737
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,804
Everyone!

738
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,347
Our lord,

739
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,016
Lord Ra Yi-eon,

740
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,852
captured the leader of traitors!

741
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:59,147
Our lord captured a traitor, everyone!

742
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:02,901
That's him. There he is.

743
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,445
A bandit and a murderer.

744
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,406
I've never seen
a more evil bastard in my life.

745
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,367
So evil that the King himself
ordered to catch him.

746
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,870
Bastards like that should be executed.

747
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,623
Of course. He should be beheaded.

748
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,666
-You rotten bastard!
-Step back.

749
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,085
Calm down.

750
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,921
A traitor like him deserves much worse!

751
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:26,674
Death wouldn't be enough
of a punishment for his bad deeds!

752
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,474
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

753
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,819
Where's the ledger
of gunpowder transactions?

754
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,281
ALL SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS
WERE SAFELY STAGED

755
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,419
SPECIAL THANKS TO LEE JUN-HYUK,
JO KWAN-WOO AND CHA HAK-YEON

756
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,924
I made the wrong choice.

757
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,343
Gokdu Trading Group
is being ransacked right now!

758
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,512
I can't find the ledger
containing our names.

759
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,432
Could this have been possible
without permission from the palace?

760
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,768
My lord, we're on our way.
Just be patient.

761
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,730
I'm sure there is something
in the Pharmacy Journal.

762
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:06,691
Did I run away? Did I hide?

763
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,234
I am standing right in front of you.

764
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,944
Whatever the truth may be,

765
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,530
I want a complete answer.

766
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,241
Tie the criminal to the rack
and proceed with the interrogation!

767
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,537
