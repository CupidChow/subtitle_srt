1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,358
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,582
I'm not the only one with these feelings.

4
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,918
I like Lord Yi-eon,
and he likes me as well.

5
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,337
I think it's unfair for you

6
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,215
to only blame me for that.

7
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,636
Why, I never…

8
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,598
What in the world did she say to me?

9
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:01,061
A girl the size of a field mouse,
wide-eyed like some rabbit…

10
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,771
What did she say to me?

11
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,864
I shouldn't only blame her.

12
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,825
My grandson is the biggest…

13
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,330
fool, idiot, moron out there.

14
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,187
Nice.

15
00:01:57,867 --> 00:02:00,120
-Grandmother.
-Were you in the kitchen again?

16
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,791
I heard that you were here,

17
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,918
so I made some gwapyeon for you.

18
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,253
I won't fall for it!

19
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,975
You need to add more honey.

20
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,185
More starch, too.

21
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,522
Come inside.

22
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,400
Okay.

23
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,154
What were you doing?

24
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,115
She barged in,
so there was no time to signal to you.

25
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,533
-Hurry.
-Put it on him.

26
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,160
She just came out of nowhere.

27
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,369
Bring out some tea.

28
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,713
I hope the madam hits him
with the switch again.

29
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,339
I'll have a sturdy one ready.

30
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:58,011
How can anyone sleep
with all this mess around?

31
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,897
Why does your room look like this?

32
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,857
I told you time and time again

33
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,027
that orderly surroundings
lead to a refined fate.

34
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,411
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
You've been coming by a lot.

35
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,664
When are you going to get married?

36
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,001
-All of a sudden?
-That's right, punk.

37
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,712
You have a job and you make a living now.

38
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,923
Your bachelor life needs to end

39
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,133
so that this messy room

40
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,261
can house a set of lovebird bedding.

41
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,471
Well…

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,556
You told me to choose

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,643
between marriage and the state exams,
so I took the exam.

44
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,939
Lord Kim and Lord Park's grandsons
got married ages ago

45
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:54,275
and have produced
strapping great-grandchildren.

46
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,569
What exactly is your plan?

47
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,864
But their grandsons did not get
the highest marks on their state exams.

48
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,827
The Inspector General's daughter

49
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,998
is wise, fair-complexioned,
and quite composed.

50
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,795
She enjoys eating,
so she'll suit you well.

51
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,006
Grandmother.

52
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,301
It hasn't been that long
since the Crown Prince returned

53
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,679
and there are things
I must assist him with--

54
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,681
You have no such duties.

55
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,770
Your Highness.

56
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,900
Don't use me as an excuse.

57
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,412
In my opinion,

58
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,748
he's the most handsome crown
prince in this nation's history.

59
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,252
I seriously think
they chose him because of his looks.

60
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,962
True.

61
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:00,008
Then who is more handsome?
Our lord or His Highness?

62
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,261
Me.

63
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,103
Don't do things like that.

64
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,980
You? No. Me.

65
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,274
Me…

66
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,277
It's me. Me!

67
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,990
He's being
such a terrible grandson, Your Highness.

68
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,784
The only son in a string of
only sons for five generations

69
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,371
refusing to marry means
the family name will end with him.

70
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,166
His Highness most certainly said

71
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,211
that there isn't anything worth
giving up one's life for in this world.

72
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,964
I did say that.

73
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,299
Did he?

74
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,884
Then,

75
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,012
what are you going to do
about the life I sacrificed to raise you?

76
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,140
Right.

77
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,227
Men drag in all sorts of customs and
rules to make women sacrifice everything

78
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,689
and they get to cherish
their sense of dignity?

79
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,193
Why don't you give us
your input, Your Highness?

80
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,031
You're wrong.

81
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,576
Every single word you spoke is wrong.

82
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,413
-Your Highness.
-Saying that marriage is

83
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,916
like giving up your life
is an exaggeration.

84
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,168
It's an excuse typical Joseon men make.

85
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,795
With the support of a wife,

86
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,506
you could achieve even greater successes.

87
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,423
Women

88
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,592
make more sacrifices.

89
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,552
My thoughts exactly.

90
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,264
Please call me over
when you set up his blind dates.

91
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,225
I would like to meet them, as well.

92
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,352
Will you do that for us?

93
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,147
Until then, I'll do what I can to quell…

94
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,026
this kid's persistent obstinacy.

95
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,574
We have a whole grove
of ash trees outside.

96
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,451
The branches make great switches.

97
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,954
What a great idea.

98
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,296
Would you like some help?

99
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,422
Go away.

100
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,383
Wait…

101
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,765
Do you pluck the eggplant at the top?

102
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,978
Can I just pluck it?

103
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,150
Come now.

104
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,820
How dare you turn your back
on your crown prince?

105
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,824
We shall see how long you can hold out
without talking to me.

106
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,495
Will you only be satisfied if I call
the guards over and teach you a lesson?

107
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,794
You're too old
to play tricks like some snot-nosed child…

108
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,465
So stop throwing a tantrum.

109
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,925
If a young noblewoman
is willing to marry you,

110
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,844
you should gratefully welcome her.

111
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,597
If you do not get married,

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,266
then how will I ever get
to see a nephew or a niece?

113
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,938
Nephew and niece, my foot.

114
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,690
What nephew? What niece?

115
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,862
We make a pact to never get married,

116
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,698
and then he runs off to get hitched.

117
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:12,909
Traitor.

118
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,495
What a hopeless fool…

119
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,790
How are you going to survive
if you only listen to me?

120
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,792
What would you do without me?

121
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,713
I bet you'll live
5,000 years more than me.

122
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:28,716
You eat so many tasty
and precious things at the palace.

123
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,899
Anyhow, Yi-eon,

124
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,651
keep what I tell you in mind.

125
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,735
Understood?

126
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,864
Don't just blindly follow what I say.

127
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,701
See how the world lives
and learn to be flexible.

128
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,372
Rely on people other than me.
That's all I'm saying.

129
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,920
Anyhow, what's for dinner tonight?

130
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,926
Why would you look for dinner at my place?
You should eat at the palace.

131
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,178
But your food tastes so much better.

132
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,472
Wait a second. How about

133
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,600
you take this chance
to become my taster maid?

134
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,062
Since you have
the most discrimination palate

135
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,855
in all of Joseon.

136
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,942
How can I enter the palace as a maid?

137
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,945
Yes. What a pity…

138
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,073
You'd be perfect.

139
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,870
Why don't you help me
with the red beans first?

140
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,541
I made sure to empty my schedule today.

141
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,043
When are you going back? You should soon.

142
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,838
I won't until I finish
every dish you've made today.

143
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,756
Nothing's been made yet, Your Highness.

144
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,347
Everything that damn rabbit said

145
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,975
is right.

146
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:09,150
Grandmother?

147
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,699
All the young women and men
in the country have gathered

148
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,785
to find their partners on Dano.
Why are you in your room?

149
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,579
Grandmother, can you just…

150
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,789
Stop idling at home

151
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,751
and go find someone to marry, punk!

152
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,879
-Grandmother!
-No matchmakers. No marriage.

153
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,923
You can't just live your life
doing the things you like.

154
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,719
You can't live your life
just doing the things you want to do!

155
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,928
Grandmother!

156
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,263
This isn't ladylike!

157
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,475
Let's talk this out
like sophisticated people would do.

158
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,311
I'm the only one
without a granddaughter-in-law.

159
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,230
All other noblewomen
have granddaughter-in-laws

160
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,815
except me, punk!

161
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,776
I told you to give it up.

162
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,779
Not everyone is cut out for marriage.

163
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,696
Then,

164
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,701
are you cut out to be a good-for-nothing
staying home all the time?

165
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,830
He has the tendency
to just dig his own grave.

166
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,874
His tolerance for a beating will grow.

167
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,380
Everyone has a granddaughter-in-law
except me, punk!

168
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,842
Grandmother, do you think this is going
to make me suddenly want to get married?

169
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,012
Fine.

170
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:24,892
Let's just beat you up
until you come across a woman you like!

171
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,268
Wait, Grandmother!

172
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,478
Grandmother!

173
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,065
It's not like I can just
meet a woman I like

174
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,608
because I want to.

175
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,152
Then go and bring some widow if you must!

176
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,823
I won't care as long
as you like her. I won't!

177
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,074
Grandmother!

178
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,789
Who knew he would
really bring a divorced woman?

179
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,001
Kkot-dan.

180
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,004
Are you outside, Kkot-dan?

181
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,714
Yes, my lady.

182
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,719
Did you call for me?

183
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,559
Go and find out all you can
about that girl, Kim Jo-yi.

184
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,018
Kim Jo-yi?

185
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,270
You know…

186
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,022
She was in Yi-eon's room…

187
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,778
The one sweet as honey with him…

188
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,530
Yes.

189
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,115
Anyhow,

190
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,493
find out where she lives
and what she does for a living.

191
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,831
Trace every step
and leave no stone unturned.

192
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,542
-Do you understand?
-Yes, my lady.

193
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,016
Did I say too much?

194
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,893
Maybe I should've just kept quiet.

195
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,187
Why did I have to keep talking back?

196
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:52,813
No.

197
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,900
Marriage is still…

198
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:58,152
Marriage is…

199
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,283
Kim Jo-yi!

200
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,453
Why don't you know how to hold back?

201
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,247
-This is why--
-People call you an audacious brat.

202
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,676
Would you like
to have a cup of tea, cute lady?

203
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,139
Sure, adorable lad.

204
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,685
Here.

205
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,355
I want this one.

206
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,106
Okay, it was more expensive, anyhow.

207
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,691
-Then I want that one.
-No.

208
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,777
My goodness!

209
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,489
Give it to me.

210
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,739
Is there one that you like?

211
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,533
Seung-yul.

212
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,412
If you want, I could buy you everything
from here to there.

213
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,539
Look at you.

214
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,750
Forget it. People like us
have no use for jade hairpins.

215
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,502
Why not?

216
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,214
People may discriminate
against other people, but not hairpins.

217
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,257
How much is this?

218
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,383
Come on now.

219
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,970
This is for a nobleman's wife.

220
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,889
Why don't you look at the cheaper stuff?

221
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,685
How embarrassing!
I knew you'd get turned down.

222
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,313
Once I pass the exam,

223
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,523
I'll buy you a cartload
of these ornaments…

224
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,818
I'll be a granny by then.

225
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,363
With you wandering around markets,
it'll take a lifetime.

226
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,075
If I really pass the exam
and get you this hairpin,

227
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,371
will you marry me?

228
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,596
If you pass it as you say,

229
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,059
then I'll consider it.

230
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,479
I'm leaving, punk.

231
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,148
What are you going to do if I really pass?

232
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,900
You just wait, Kim Jo-yi.

233
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,280
Come on now.
I said, it's for a nobleman's wife.

234
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,657
Go after her.

235
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,092
What are you going to do?

236
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:09,927
What?

237
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,845
You and Lord Yi-eon.

238
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,348
What do you mean?

239
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,975
It's an unwritten law

240
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:20,604
that a nobleman cannot marry
a divorced woman even in his next life.

241
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,857
You know that remarriage
is legally prohibited

242
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,609
in Gyeongguk Daejeon.

243
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,531
I'm sure if Lord Yi-eon says
he would like to marry you,

244
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,533
his grandmother will have to wait her turn

245
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,994
as the scholars of this nation
rise up to oppose it.

246
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,496
People from across the land
will submit appeals

247
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,000
and the scholars will protest against it
in front of the palace.

248
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,877
Appeals and protests?

249
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,129
Yes.

250
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,674
Listen, Seung-yul.

251
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,384
Lord Yi-eon and I are just--

252
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:55,389
Which is why I mobilized all the knowledge
I had as a lawyer to find a solution.

253
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,642
I analyzed all the laws
enforced in this nation,

254
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,562
and there's only one way
you and Lord Yi-eon can get

255
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,689
officially married.

256
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,403
To sue Lord Yi-eon

257
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,030
for the seubcheob.

258
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:17,161
Get people who saw you and
Lord Yi-eon enter a seubcheob to testify,

259
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:18,704
and sue Lord Yi-eon.

260
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,249
In accordance with the laws
based on the code of morality,

261
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,209
he must take you as his wife.

262
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,919
That way,

263
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,423
Lord Yi-eon and you
can officially get married.

264
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,342
Stop right there!

265
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,307
What the? Where is it?
Who is it? What is it?

266
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,976
The first man she comes across

267
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,688
must take her to be his wife.
That's the custom in Joseon.

268
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,982
It's called seubcheob.

269
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,359
There's no reason to abide by that custom.

270
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,112
How dare you! It's a serious crime!

271
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:56,658
If you want,

272
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,453
I could help you with the lawsuit.

273
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,916
However, that path
will inevitably be a thorny one.

274
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,089
I don't want you to walk on a thorny path.

275
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,469
Jo-yi.

276
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,224
How about only walking
on flowery paths with me?

277
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,252
Forget it, punk.

278
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,549
My goodness, Seung-yul.
You're so good at your job.

279
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,009
I didn't even ask you to,
but you prepared all this.

280
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:01,098
I can see now why you're the lawyer
with the highest success rate.

281
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:07,354
But I have no intention
of accepting a hairpin from you

282
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,356
or hiring you to sue Lord Yi-eon.

283
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,196
So look for clients elsewhere.

284
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,781
Do you understand?

285
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,580
That was completely fruitless.

286
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,623
The act of bravado was a bit too much.

287
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,625
It wasn't an act.

288
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,127
See.

289
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,839
I even packed my bags to leave
in case you rejected me.

290
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,632
Really?

291
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,887
I'm going on a business trip, brat.

292
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,557
It seems that word of me
has even spread across the sea.

293
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,892
I received a request.

294
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,229
That makes more sense. But I can
understand why after seeing how you work.

295
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,899
It may take a while.

296
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,401
Sure. Okay. Have a safe trip.

297
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,655
Don't skip meals.

298
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,365
Don't get sick.

299
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,910
Don't get angry so easily.

300
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,163
Don't cry.

301
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,170
You said it's just a business trip.
Why the long goodbye?

302
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,338
Get going.

303
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,175
You go on first.

304
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,347
Okay, goodbye.

305
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,563
Get a silk garment for me!

306
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,302
What is this bundle for?

307
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,475
I'll be making a short trip
to Gapbigocha for the investigation.

308
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,646
You only came back not too long ago.
Why are you leaving already?

309
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,023
You said that you were even demoted.

310
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,026
Can't you just
take your hands off this case?

311
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,028
I took on this case,

312
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,822
and I must close it.

313
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,826
I'll try my best to be careful.

314
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,161
All right.

315
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,373
As you've said,
I'll stay out of your affairs.

316
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,708
However,

317
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,503
the issue of marriage isn't yours alone.

318
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,838
So do as I say.

319
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,881
Don't complain.

320
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,885
Marry the girl that I choose
by the end of the year, no matter what.

321
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,305
-Do I make myself clear?
-Grandmother.

322
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,015
Marriage is my business.

323
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,351
If you don't want to get married
that badly, then stop seeing that girl.

324
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:54,271
If you're not even going to get married,

325
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,690
why in the world
are you seeing that girl, Jo-yi?

326
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,151
Even if I'm not sure about marriage,

327
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,444
Jo-yi…

328
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,404
I'm sure about her.

329
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,367
And are you sure
she's sure about you as well?

330
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,913
I hear that she's just been
spotted with another man earlier.

331
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,710
You didn't

332
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,920
have someone tail her, did you?

333
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,840
I did.

334
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,012
I need to know what kind of girl she is
for me to make a decision as well.

335
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,680
Well done.

336
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,934
I'm sure once you find out
what kind of girl she is,

337
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,436
you will get to like her.

338
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,190
Grandmother.

339
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,777
I know very well how much you care for me.

340
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,737
However,

341
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,406
my decision not to get married stands.

342
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,242
Despite that,

343
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,079
if you continue to push for marriage…

344
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,372
I will do it.

345
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,043
With Jo-yi.

346
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:03,048
I can only do one of two things
regarding the issue of marriage.

347
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,300
Either I don't get married,

348
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,595
or if I'm forced to, I will with Jo-yi.

349
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,350
There are no other
possible choices in my life.

350
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,149
Then, I'll leave for Gapbigocha now.

351
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,569
Let me know when you've made your mind.

352
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,275
You can take them now.

353
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,155
Good job. Be careful with them.

354
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,583
This place was finally
beginning to look like a home.

355
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,085
I'm getting a bit upset.

356
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,172
We're still people of this land.

357
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,466
First, for being captured
and dragged away,

358
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,928
and then for coming back,
they treat us like crap until the end…

359
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,308
Let's have no regrets
about leaving this place.

360
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,982
Go through the things
in the butcher's shop

361
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,610
and take what you can
to trade at the marketplace.

362
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,820
Try to get food if you can.

363
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,864
Okay, I will.

364
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,159
You should get some rest.
I can take care of this place.

365
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:58,455
I'll prepare food for the kids
and leave the rest to you.

366
00:24:59,122 --> 00:24:59,956
Okay.

367
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,927
I'm glad you're here.

368
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,721
I was actually looking for you
because some work came in.

369
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,806
-Really?
-A minister's servant

370
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,225
just stopped by.

371
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,937
She said that money wasn't an issue
and asked for the best needlewoman

372
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,897
to make clothes for the young master.

373
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,441
So I've been waiting for you to come by.

374
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,859
Oh, thank you.

375
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,778
Go on and show them what you can do.

376
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,697
He tends to order by the cartload
if he likes what he sees.

377
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,491
Okay.

378
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,784
But if you accept the job,

379
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,745
you need to make
some socks for the lord, too. Look.

380
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,623
You just need to make

381
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,252
a pocket like this inside each sock.
You can do that, right?

382
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,629
A pocket inside a sock?

383
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,007
Yes. That's what she orders,
so you just need to make them like that.

384
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,093
But she said she was in a hurry

385
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,470
and asked for them to be made by tomorrow.

386
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,764
-Is that possible?
-Of course.

387
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,432
Then, choose the fabric.

388
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,434
The most expensive silks are there,

389
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,436
-so choose from there.
-Okay.

390
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,458
Excuse me,
can I ask you for some directions?

391
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,795
If I continue along this path,
will I find Sewoon Temple?

392
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,507
Yes, if you go down a bit more,
you'll see the first gate.

393
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,801
Okay, thank you.

394
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:00,869
What is this?

395
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,665
They asked for a pocket inside the sock.

396
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,042
It's odd, isn't it?

397
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,460
A pocket inside a sock?

398
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,880
Are they trying to hide
some sort of treasure?

399
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,340
I know, right?

400
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,009
And they asked for them
to be done by tomorrow.

401
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,011
Anyhow,

402
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,806
maybe Gwang-soon really is seeing a man.
Why is she late every night?

403
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,435
If only there was a man.

404
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,314
She's been looking a bit down recently.
I'm worried about her.

405
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,109
Actually… Me, too.

406
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,072
She keeps appearing in my dreams,
looking for shoes.

407
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,991
My dreams have been worrisome recently.

408
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,120
Shoes? Is such a dream a bad omen?

409
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,830
I'm not sure

410
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,876
if it's a bad omen or a good one.

411
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,553
Where have you been?

412
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,598
My goodness, it looks like
you even skipped dinner.

413
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,100
Wait here. I'll go set a table.

414
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,184
No.

415
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,353
It's fine. I had a bite to eat earlier.

416
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,148
Is something going on?
What's wrong with your face?

417
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,610
What? No, it's nothing. Nothing.

418
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,530
Come on, there's clearly
something going on.

419
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,157
What's the matter? What's going on?

420
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,369
-Tell us. We'll help if we can.
-Yes.

421
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,830
Well…

422
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,209
The truth is,
I'm also looking for someone.

423
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,378
-You are?
-Who?

424
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,589
My father.

425
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,553
Goodness.

426
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,348
Do you have any idea where he might be?

427
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:51,521
I heard that he moved
to a small temple near Hanyang.

428
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,441
But I'm not exactly sure which one.

429
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,738
Then we just need to search through
every small temple near Hanyang.

430
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,780
Yes, let's.

431
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,283
-Let's look together.
-Oh, no, that's fine.

432
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,453
Do you know how many small
temples there are around Hanyang?

433
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,588
-Come on.
-Come on.

434
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,759
-That's not that many.
-Not many at all.

435
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,136
And all of them are on top of mountains.

436
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,434
So you've been
climbing mountains every day…

437
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,063
Thanks for the gesture,

438
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,441
but I can do it by myself one by one.

439
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,360
This is nothing.
I bet we can do it in a day.

440
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,613
-Don't you think so, Bi-ryeong?
-Of course.

441
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,532
I use to live in the mountains.
I'm a master.

442
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,202
No, that's fine.
I'm not even sure he's there.

443
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,953
What if it's all for nothing?

444
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,414
What's the point
of worrying about it in advance?

445
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,500
And if he's not there,
we can look elsewhere.

446
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,419
Gwang-soon, I'll be by your side
until you find him.

447
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,631
Who knows?

448
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,759
I know it's unstable,
but my spiritual powers might be helpful.

449
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,265
Okay.

450
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,894
Let's do that. Whatever it may be,
let's do it together.

451
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,567
Thank you.

452
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,860
Don't worry.

453
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,571
How hard it must have been for you alone!

454
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,452
Jo-yi, your accent was like…

455
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,080
I am from Hanyang.

456
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,624
How many mountains do we need to climb?

457
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,307
This seems like the place.

458
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,897
GOKDU
TURUKSON, GUNPOWDER

459
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,279
Hey, kids.

460
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,241
Is this Tail Island?

461
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,788
Who are you?

462
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,457
Ma'am?

463
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,088
Ma'am!

464
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,423
It's you, isn't it?

465
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,426
Seung-yul, is that you?

466
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,761
Yes, ma'am. I'm Seung-yul
from Yeowul Valley.

467
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,600
Have you been well?

468
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,644
Yes, I have…

469
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,273
The air is quite clean here, ma'am.

470
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,402
We shouldn't do this out here.
We can go inside--

471
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,570
It's fine.

472
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,405
I'm perfectly fine with here as well.

473
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,573
Okay.

474
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,079
My goodness.

475
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,005
You haven't lost your touch at all.

476
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,176
So I hear you became a lawyer.

477
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,136
You knew.

478
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,807
Then, you must know
how Jo-yi is doing as well.

479
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,353
After I severed ties with her last time,

480
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,896
I haven't heard anything.

481
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,023
Severed ties?

482
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:25,652
Because I'm planning
to leave this place soon.

483
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,865
I'm nothing
but a burdensome mother to Jo-yi.

484
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,790
You don't have to worry about Jo-yi.

485
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,210
I'm sure she'll have no problems
taking care of herself.

486
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,379
She's already a famous needlewoman

487
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,214
and has customers lining up.

488
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,884
Now she even has friends by her side,
and above all else,

489
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:55,056
she has a lord that cares for her deeply
and protects her.

490
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,895
Yes. He's a busuchan at Hongmungwan,
and his name is Ra Yi-eon.

491
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,691
The two met when he was a secret
royal inspector in Chungcheong,

492
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,901
and I believe
he's been by her side ever since.

493
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:10,947
Why?

494
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,241
To live as Turukson?

495
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,370
The Uigeumbu is searching for this.

496
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,372
GUNPOWDER TRANSACTION RECORD

497
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:24,585
So that's why Jo-yi had that ledger book.

498
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:30,758
To tell the truth, that's the reason
why I came to see you today.

499
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:33,928
Lord Yi-eon is

500
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,515
pursuing a case involving
the traitor, Park Tae-seo, and his men.

501
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,936
Therefore,

502
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,063
I came to ask you for a favor.

503
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,902
Will you leaving like this
be better for Jo-yi's sake?

504
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:54,407
Or will staying by her side
to help with this investigation be better?

505
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,117
Please, reconsider it.

506
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:03,332
I may have lost the position
of Jo-yi's suitor to Lord Yi-eon,

507
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,793
but as her childhood friend,

508
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:10,048
I wanted to do something for her.
That's why I came to see you today.

509
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,431
Please reconsider, ma'am.

510
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,782
So you're saying he left nothing behind?

511
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:40,161
It doesn't matter what it is.
Anything connected to Ra Yong-gyun…

512
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,082
The only thing left
are the straw shoes he wore.

513
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,667
Then can we take a look at them?

514
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,795
But what for?

515
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,089
I don't know.
Let's just take them for now.

516
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,840
-Just a moment.
-Thank you.

517
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,391
I see it.

518
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,230
I felt something. I think he's here.

519
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,648
Here…

520
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,484
Let's hurry.

521
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,954
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

522
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,207
Wait, Gwang-soon?

523
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,208
Yook-chil?

524
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,292
Jo-yi?

525
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,669
Bi-ryeong?

526
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,587
Gu-pal?

527
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,005
What are you…

528
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,592
Lord Yi-eon sent us here
to collect some evidence.

529
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,553
But what are you doing here, Gwang-soon?

530
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm here to look for my father.

531
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,439
What's wrong?

532
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,319
By any chance, is your father's name…

533
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,489
-Ra…
-Ra Yong-gyun?

534
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,533
Yes, it is.

535
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,079
But how do you know my father's name?

536
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,820
Back then…

537
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:43,201
I just thought my father
was just losing his mind.

538
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,744
One and a half don of seohyang,

539
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,746
two dons of baeggyeong,

540
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,247
four dons of aconite…

541
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:54,128
One and a half don of seohyang, two dons
of baeggyeong, four dons of aconite…

542
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,758
How long do you plan on keeping this up?

543
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,551
Father.

544
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,678
Pull yourself together now.

545
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,597
Please, stop now.

546
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,642
Gwang-soon, I gave the right prescription.

547
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,977
I put exactly one nyang of angelica root

548
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,979
-and the aconite…
-The Crown Prince…

549
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,238
His Highness has already passed.

550
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,450
So why do you keep digging up the past
and reliving that event?

551
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,077
What if the neighbors hear you?

552
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,579
My goodness, Father, you can't.

553
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,789
Father…

554
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,582
It wasn't me!

555
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,294
Someone must've poisoned the Crown Prince.

556
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,507
or such a substance
couldn't have been found in that tonic.

557
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,133
Watch what you say!

558
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,386
What if people think it's true?

559
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,763
Please, stop, Father.

560
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,723
Gwang-soon, you must leave this house.

561
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,809
You could end up in danger, too.

562
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,435
-Father…
-Get away now!

563
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,895
-Now!
-Pull yourself together.

564
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,189
-Go on!
-Where am I supposed to go?

565
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,565
Go on and leave!

566
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,026
-Father, it's going to be okay.
-Go…

567
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,654
It will be okay, Father.

568
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,366
Father, it will be okay.

569
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,996
But my father…

570
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,707
It turns out he was right.

571
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,390
So, who did it?

572
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,184
Who dared to do that to the Crown Prince…

573
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,022
and my father…

574
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,358
Who's the bastard?

575
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,486
It's Park Tae-seo.

576
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,965
-Gwang-soon.
-I'm fine.

577
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,300
I'm fine.

578
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,345
I'm okay.

579
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,192
What…

580
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,445
What do you mean?

581
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,946
I…

582
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,077
I've committed a grave sin, Young Master!

583
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,122
Young Master?

584
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,458
Why are you calling me that?

585
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,504
Mother.

586
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,018
I might have been very young,

587
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,939
but I still remember your face, Mother.

588
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:00,856
No.

589
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,234
No…

590
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,986
I'm not your mother, Young Master.

591
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,282
If you're feeling guilty
about leaving me as a child,

592
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,159
I…

593
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,036
do not resent you, Mother.

594
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,954
I…

595
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,498
I…

596
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,628
swapped the babies!

597
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,485
It's a son, my lord.

598
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,946
A son?

599
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,033
Thank you!

600
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,328
It's a son, my lord.

601
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,791
What does that lowly girl's baby
have to do with me?

602
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,711
A son? He's just an illegitimate child.

603
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,095
Does my son have ten fingers and toes?

604
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,430
Does he look like me?

605
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,308
Yes, my lord. Sincerest congratulations.

606
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,643
Thank you!

607
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,829
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,175
I could not

609
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,135
let my child…

610
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,973
live as an illegitimate child
and become an object of scorn.

611
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,134
Young Master!

612
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,345
Young Master.

613
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,681
Young Master…

614
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,564
GAPBIGOCHA

615
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,281
TAVERN

616
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,740
My goodness.

617
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,619
You look like you suffered
some serious seasickness.

618
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,330
Hey.

619
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,626
What's the most famous
and tastiest dish here?

620
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,296
The only food we have is rice and soup.

621
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,842
-Then, give me a bowl of it.
-Sure.

622
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:26,478
You'll feel better
once you have some warm soup.

623
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:28,689
Enjoy.

624
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,821
It's a bit bland.

625
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,960
This is the stuff.

626
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,297
-I'm so tired.
-I'm exhausted.

627
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,840
-Welcome!
-I'm exhausted.

628
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:57,509
-Hello.
-Hello.

629
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,515
-We'll take some rice and soup.
-Sure. Two rice and soups.

630
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,018
By the way,

631
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,313
did you hear about what happened at Gokdu?

632
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,191
It turns out that the leader of Gokdu

633
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,903
got caught partaking in treason,
so it was completely destroyed.

634
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,406
I was wondering why
there was no trading group left.

635
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,617
So that's why it was torn down.

636
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,370
But the royal forces weren't behind that.

637
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,873
Some nobleman from Hanyang,
the Chief State Councilor,

638
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:33,170
wanted to build a villa for his son
in that spot and had it knocked down.

639
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:34,296
My goodness.

640
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,634
That trading group was doing so well
but vanished overnight without a trace.

641
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,886
Life is all vanity.

642
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:44,515
Park Seung managed
to take control of Gapbigocha already?

00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,573
They crossed the sea
to even strike deals in Gapbigocha.

648
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,575
TURUKSON

649
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,120
Someone in Gapbigocha

650
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,789
must have been working
with Park Tae-seo's group.

651
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,099
Park Tae-seo!

652
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,484
I must go.

653
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,327
I will drag you to Hanyang.

654
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,123
I need to go see my father.
I need to tell him something.

655
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,881
I must go!

656
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,165
I cannot just let you go.

657
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:35,083
Get out of my way!

658
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,532
Goodness.

659
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,498
Jo-yi.

660
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,625
Aren't they due today?

661
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,463
You can go.

662
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,675
I'll look after Gwang-soon.

663
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,302
Are you sure?

664
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,930
You said you made a promise.

665
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,308
You can't lose credibility.

666
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,395
Then, I'll be right back.

667
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,654
-Be careful.
-Okay.

668
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,671
I came to deliver some socks.

669
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,672
Come on in.

670
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,399
Please, wait here for a moment.
I'll bring the head servant.

671
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:06,151
Okay.

672
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,747
Do-soo, you might get hurt! Careful!

673
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,499
Father!

674
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,962
Do-soo, be careful! Careful!

675
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,589
Father!

676
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,716
Father!

677
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,469
-Father!
-My son, you'll get hurt.

678
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,554
Father.

679
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,223
I feel so good.

680
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:41,019
Seeing my son being so happy
makes me so happy.

681
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,735
Do-soo.

682
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,782
For all those years,

683
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,577
I've wanted to be accepted by my father.

684
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,707
But I'm the legitimate child.

685
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,086
Do-soo is not.

686
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:09,673
I am

687
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,926
the legitimate child.

688
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,347
The babies were switched.

689
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,438
I wonder what Father will say…

690
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,901
once he finds out we were switched.

691
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:37,159
That doesn't change the life you have led.

692
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,874
You can resent it, get angry,
and regret it all you want.

693
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,670
But it won't erase…

694
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,549
what you have done.

695
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,157
If you truly wish to change,

696
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,953
there is only one way.

697
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,918
You must properly pay for your crimes.

698
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,601
The last tonic…

699
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,231
was not delivered by me.

700
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,902
It was probably Do-soo.

701
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,420
Put that here and sit.

702
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,350
Feel free to come closer and take a look.

703
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,525
They say the lands and oceans have always

704
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:38,446
been joined together in a circular fashion
like this to create the shape of a ball.

705
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,908
If I have the chance,

706
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,704
I'd like to visit these other countries.

707
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,084
But I remain unwell like this…

708
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,796
Who knows?

709
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,340
There might be a nation

710
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,552
where everyone is equal
without discrimination.

711
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,558
Does…

712
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,311
Does such a nation

713
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,980
really exist?

714
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,649
I'm not sure.

715
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,236
But there must be one somewhere.

716
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,114
If it doesn't exist,

717
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:25,660
we could make this nation to be the first.

718
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,257
I'm sorry for making a silly joke.

719
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,428
Your Highness.

720
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,057
I apologize,

721
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,477
but I made a mistake
with the dosage in that tonic.

722
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,730
I'll make a fresh batch.
Please, don't drink that one.

723
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,109
It's fine.

724
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,178
Forgive me, Father.

725
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,890
I failed to follow your order
and made a mistake…

726
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,558
You damn coward.

727
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,065
Father, I took very good care of it.

728
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,947
He drank it so well.

729
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,207
What did I tell you?
Tae-seo can't do stuff like this.

730
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,173
I didn't want to get blood on your hands.

731
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,346
You stupid bastard.

732
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,141
You couldn't even take
care of a simple task

733
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,560
and had to make my Do-soo
get blood on his hands?

734
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,770
You useless bastard.

735
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,190
Get out of my house right now!

736
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,088
So…

737
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,800
Are you sure no one saw you?

738
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,053
Father, you had everything
set up perfectly.

739
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,222
I didn't even sign in and
just walked into the Naeuiwon.

740
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:56,853
My baby! I'm so proud of you.

741
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,982
You're so brave just like me.

742
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,401
-Of course.
-My goodness. My baby!

743
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,740
My goodness. My baby!

744
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,514
You're right.

745
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,851
I was wrong.

746
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,356
I've committed too many sins.

747
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,734
As you said,

748
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,904
I will pay for my crimes.

749
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,450
I will confess to everything.

750
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,250
I will take my friends
and head to Hanyang.

751
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,273
This is a written oath
containing Park Seung's seal.

752
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,325
This can't be…

753
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,995
Is this Lord Park Seung's house?

754
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,632
You are never to disclose
what you saw and heard

755
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:34,177
and to cooperate in letting the herbal
tonics into the Crown Prince's palace.

756
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,409
THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD ACTORS
IN THIS EPISODE WAS PROPERLY ENSURED

757
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,424
SPECIAL THANKS TO
LEE JUN-HYUK AND CHA HAK-YEON

758
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,138
The evidence that Lord Yi-eon
risked his life to acquire…

759
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,183
The first sponsor was
the late Crown Prince.

760
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,477
Are you Lord Ra Yi-eon?

761
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,145
This is a list of ingredients for a tonic.

762
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,022
To prove that the Crown Prince
was poisoned to death.

763
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,609
Wherever you are,
I hope you remain healthy, Mother. Father.

764
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,696
He told me this nonsense
about how this place was possessed

765
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,781
by the spirit of a son
born in this household.

766
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,116
You take lives as if they were meals,

767
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,451
so you have countless spirits
swarming all over you.

768
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,036
I'll make sure
Park Seung's arrest warrant gets issued.

769
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,496
Let's move out!

770
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:48,293
