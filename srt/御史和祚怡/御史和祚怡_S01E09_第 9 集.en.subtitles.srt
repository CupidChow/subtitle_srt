1
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,731
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
LOCALES, AND EVENTS ARE USED

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,400
IN AN ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS MANNER
AND NOT BASED ON HISTORICAL FACTS

3
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,444
I must figure out where
the entrance to Baekgwiryeong is.

4
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,695
You're not going to use it here, are you?

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,280
You might end up
blowing up all of Baekgwiryeong.

6
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,532
I could blow up something even bigger
to catch the inspector.

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,950
"Yeomcho"? Isn't that gunpowder?

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,161
They don't sound like your common thieves.

9
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,538
I know where Park Tae-seo's base
with the mine is.

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,373
There was a mine?

11
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,375
These are aconite.

12
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,043
You just wait right there!

13
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,087
I'm coming over to kill you!

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,965
This is what you get for coming after me.

15
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:49,883
Everyone get out!

16
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,720
My lord!

17
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,763
A busuchan of Hongmungwan,

18
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,683
dispatched to Left Chungcheong Province
as a secret royal inspector

19
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,226
has died in an accident.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,271
I am Ra Yi-eon, a busuchan of Hongmungwan.

21
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,108
I have returned after my inspection
in Left Chungcheong Province.

22
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,239
DAY OF THE EXPLOSION

23
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,558
My lord!

24
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,494
I have a feeling

25
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,788
something good will happen today.

26
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,749
Look at the sun halo.

27
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,135
Rings around the sun

28
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,347
have been called sun halos
and are considered auspicious.

29
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,059
There was also one
on the day I passed the state exams.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,150
My mother told me the same thing once.

31
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,070
She saw a sun halo
and said something good would happen.

32
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,073
But…

33
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,578
that was my last conversation with her.

34
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,914
That day, nine years ago,

35
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,418
she was unable to hide herself
trying to hide me

36
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,713
and ended up being dragged away.

37
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,137
Even though it was Chilseok,
the day of reunion.

38
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:01,848
So to me,

39
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,433
a ring around the sun

40
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,727
is nothing but a sad omen.

41
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,187
Unlike you.

42
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,278
I'm sure something good

43
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,780
will happen this time.

44
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,451
How can you be so sure?

45
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,286
Besides,

46
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,788
we'll be parting ways soon.

47
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,708
Once you get to Hanyang,

48
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,586
follow Cheonggye Stream,

49
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,463
and you won't lose your way.

50
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,013
Once a fruit shop comes into view,

51
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,599
then you'll see Mojeon Bridge,

52
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,559
Gwangtong Bridge,

53
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,978
Jangtong Bridge, Supyo Bridge,

54
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,855
and then Harang Bridge.

55
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,818
Once you come across the sixth bridge,
you're almost there.

56
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,906
Remember
the sixth bridge over Cheonggye Stream.

57
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,283
Hoehyeon-dong, south of Supyo Bridge.

58
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,288
If we ever get separated,

59
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,375
on Chilseok,

60
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,628
you can come and find me there.

61
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,383
That's…

62
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,553
where I live.

63
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,016
Make sure to come.

64
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,186
I'll bestow happiness upon you.

65
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,828
You said you'd make me happy,
and this was it?

66
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,624
You told me to wait and see. This was it?

67
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,129
How could you mock me like this, my lord?

68
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,215
My lord?

69
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,342
Please

70
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,553
answer me now.

71
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,432
Young Master.

72
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,517
Young Master…

73
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:13,980
My lord.

74
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,606
My lord,

75
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,276
you can't leave us like this.

76
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,822
What am I supposed to do?

77
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,168
My goodness. My lord!

78
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,380
I thought things would be different.

79
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,680
After meeting you,
my life wasn't that sad anymore.

80
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,476
So I even had hopes of happiness.

81
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,524
But you leave me with such sadness.

82
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,738
My lord!

83
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,748
Are those of lowly birth like me
not even allowed to hope?

84
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,086
You're too cruel.

85
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,546
Too cruel, my lord.

86
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,051
My lord!

87
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,719
Young Master…

88
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,556
We must find our young master…

89
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,496
SOYANG

90
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,464
I wonder if Yook-chil and Gu-pal
have arrived safely.

91
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,801
I'm sure they have.

92
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,221
My lord,

93
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,974
have you arrived safely as well?

94
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:22,984
I got you!

95
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,323
Catch me if you can!

96
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,037
Come and catch me!

97
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,314
Tae-seo.

98
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,361
Is this an escape route?

99
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,324
What a sneaky bastard,
building all this in secret.

100
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,118
It's not even yours.
It's none of your concern.

101
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,040
It is mine. You used our family name
to line your pockets behind the scenes.

102
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,875
-So that makes it mine.
-"Our family"?

103
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:26,792
Crazy bastard.

104
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,839
Father told me
everything that's yours is mine.

105
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:33,966
What?

106
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,469
Father told me

107
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,720
to kill you.

108
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,974
So why did you let things come to this?

109
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,603
If you had taken care of the inspector
and given up the silver mine sooner,

110
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,855
I wouldn't need to go this far.

111
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,241
They're over there! Get them!

112
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,789
Damn it!

113
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,559
TURUKSON

114
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,774
But,

115
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,735
will this symbol be enough to find her?

116
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,907
I have no idea.

117
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,784
But…

118
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,578
even if I end up finding nothing,

119
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,250
I must check for myself.

120
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,672
If it is my mother,
I must find out why she's there.

121
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,757
And if…

122
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,385
it's not her…

123
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,387
We're not sure of anything yet,

124
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,222
so don't worry about it in advance.

125
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,766
If it's not her,
we can move on and look elsewhere.

126
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,520
I'll be by your side
until you find your mother.

127
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,647
I don't really have anywhere to go anyway.

128
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,065
I'll help too.

129
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,650
Who knows?

130
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,652
My spiritual powers might be helpful.

131
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:28,038
Bi-ryeong, it's been a while since
you saw Moo-jeok and the kids, right?

132
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:28,956
Yes.

133
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,668
Hopefully, they're not
struggling too much on the island.

134
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,171
My brother steps up when he needs to.

135
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,173
He's probably forgotten all about me

136
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,427
and is busy playing, eating,
and sleeping with the kids.

137
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,181
I hope that's the case.

138
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,478
I'm sure it is.

139
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,525
Goodness.

140
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,278
The wind is pretty strong.

141
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,640
The mine is gone.

142
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,641
What?

143
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,727
What do you mean, the mine is gone?

144
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,812
It seems that Tae-seo blew up the mine.

145
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,815
Then what about the silver?

146
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,442
None of it was salvaged?

147
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,069
It seems so.

148
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,737
Don't tell me…

149
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,323
You collected the silver
for Turukson at least, right?

150
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,702
We're supposed to pay her today!

151
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,424
Go bring the guys.

152
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,718
I'll try to hold off somehow.

153
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,428
Are you sure?

154
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,765
You said that Turukson woman is no joke.

155
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,642
Just until the rifles arrive.

156
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,187
Once we get that shipment,
wiping out a place like Tail Island

157
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,565
will be a breeze.

158
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,651
We can just steal the gunpowder.

159
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,570
We won't need to pay.

160
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,157
We've dealt with her because
we didn't know when we'd get the rifles,

161
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,159
but once we get them,

162
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,453
it'll be a whole different story.

163
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,915
Where is the ship from Nagasaki now?

164
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,959
It passed Wolmi Island this morning.

165
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,420
It will arrive sooner than I thought.

166
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,715
You go and get Tae-seo and Mal-jong.

167
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,341
Understood.

168
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,054
Was this meant for Gokdu?

169
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,141
Yes. I don't know what's inside,
but it's quite heavy.

170
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,539
That should be double
what you were promised.

171
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,071
Goodness!

172
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,783
I knew it! You were right, after all.

173
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,869
You intercepted it
without even raising your voice.

174
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,871
If they didn't want to lose what's theirs,

175
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,123
they should've respected
what belongs to others.

176
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,249
Of course.

177
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,294
How much is all this worth?

178
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,755
Let's see.

179
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,884
It came from Nagasaki,

180
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,180
crossing the wide ocean to destroy Joseon.

181
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,307
Such devotion.

182
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
My goodness.

183
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,896
There must be at least 20 in here.

184
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,648
Goodness.

185
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,735
But I hear that Leader Kang of Gokdu
is as sly as a snake.

186
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,654
Do you think she'll keep her word?

187
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,493
Well, I guess that's why you intercepted
these so she wouldn't try anything funny.

188
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,204
Let us go home for now.

189
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:38,664
Yes.

190
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,627
My goodness.
This was done so swiftly and smoothly.

191
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,713
Let's go home!

192
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,726
GAPBIGOCHA

193
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,957
Father!

194
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,089
Master Tae-seo.

195
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,883
Master Do-soo just came in too.

196
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,634
Your father is inside.

197
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,929
"Your father"?

198
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,735
What?

199
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,783
Didn't something just wriggle in there?

200
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,950
Yes.

201
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,537
Maybe it's fish?

202
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,957
That woman must be the master.

203
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,167
Isn't that a man?

204
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,376
Isn't it a woman?

205
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:07,961
What?

206
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,445
-Anyhow, let's go and ask.
-Right.

207
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,825
Excuse us.

208
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,035
May we ask you for some directions?

209
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,329
By any chance,

210
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:46,542
do you know where
a place called Mido or Tail Island is?

211
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,837
Did you just say Tail Island?

212
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,256
-Yes, Tail Island.
-Yes.

213
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,135
Yes, I did say Tail Island…

214
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,179
People rarely go to Tail Island
unless they're fishmongers.

215
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,266
We're not fishmongers.

216
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,018
We're looking for
a woman named Turukson on Tail Island.

217
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,604
Turukson?

218
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,231
Do you know her?

219
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,276
Well, actually…

220
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,320
I'm not sure yet,

221
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,825
but this Turukson person
might be my long-lost mother.

222
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,078
I see.

223
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,248
If you could tell us where it roughly is,

224
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,208
-we can--
-I'll take you there.

225
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,589
I just happen to
have business there as well.

226
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,926
Thank you.

227
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,011
Thank you.

228
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,013
-This is great.
-It is.

229
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,015
We may find her sooner than we expected.

230
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,270
Do you by any chance
know of a man named Eo Moo-jeok?

231
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,772
I'm looking for someone as well.

232
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,526
By the way, what did you throw
into the sea earlier?

233
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,654
Fish food.

234
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,906
Fish food?

235
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,533
There's fish food that big?

236
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,538
Well, sometimes we chop it up
before we throw it in.

237
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,750
That's amazing.

238
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,968
This is it.

239
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,139
What? But this is a trading group.

240
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:29,728
Maybe your mother joined a trading group.

241
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,065
Yes. She must have been
working at a trading group.

242
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,027
Right. That must be it.

243
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,113
GOKDU TRADING GROUP

244
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:44,409
Her mark must be in the ledger
because she's working at a trading group.

245
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,496
Soyang is a trading group after all.

246
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,413
Right.

247
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,460
Right.

248
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:54,378
Let's go in.

249
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,547
Yes.

250
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,801
My mother would never do something bad.

251
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,697
GOKDU TRADING GROUP

252
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,619
If you could just wait here,
I'll go and get Turukson.

253
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,664
Thank you.

254
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,719
There are a lot of rare items here.

255
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,640
I saw these when I was in Qing.

256
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,019
This must be quite the trading group.

257
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,703
What?

258
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,414
We're not trapped in here, are we?

259
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,666
No way.

260
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,084
What?

261
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,338
-Hello?
-Excuse me.

262
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,255
Excuse me.

263
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,841
-Look here!
-Hello?

264
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:23,759
Excuse me.

265
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,261
There are people in here.
What are you doing?

266
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,558
You're back.

267
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,351
Did anything happen?

268
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,145
Gokdu sent word.

269
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,189
They're ready to pay us for the gunpowder.

270
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,649
They did?

271
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,487
You were worried about nothing.
Everything is working out.

272
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,157
I guess that Leader Kang
isn't so unreasonable after all.

273
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,118
Keep the goods hidden well.

274
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,372
If I don't return within two hours,
sink them in the Minmeoru Sea.

275
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,957
I will. Don't worry.

276
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,044
We should be able to free
a lot of the hostages with that money.

277
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,297
Get some rest.
I'll run over and get the money.

278
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,215
Yes.

279
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,634
You come with me
and carry the sack of gunpowder.

280
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,635
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,402
Welcome.

282
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,905
This tea came from Indochina,

283
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,573
would you like some?

284
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,409
A butcher like me has no use for tea.

285
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,453
I'm busy. Just make the payment.

286
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,460
In life,

287
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,672
there are times you must make a choice

288
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,925
even when you're not happy
with the available choices.

289
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,510
That's enough nonsense.

290
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,681
If you're trying
to play tricks with the silver,

291
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,182
don't bother.

292
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:58,436
I just hope that you make a wise choice.

293
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,506
I'm sure she's worth
a lot more than silver.

294
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,300
Especially for you.

295
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,058
What I need is silver to pay the ransom
for the hostages in Qing.

296
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:19,392
I don't need anything else.

297
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,520
Let's go back.

298
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,563
Really?

299
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,857
Even if she'll become fish food?

300
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,528
Maybe I'll chop her up
before throwing her in.

301
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,697
I was feeding the fish earlier,

302
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,450
and your daughter was surprised
at how big the feed was.

303
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,085
Do whatever you wish.

304
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,639
But if you do that, I'll dump
what belongs to you into the sea.

305
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,644
You should've asked him

306
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,230
whom he handed it over to
before feeding him to fish.

307
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,281
Tell me what you want.

308
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,078
Put those three on a boat
and get them off this island now.

309
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,584
I'm holding onto the rifles as security
until you pay me for the gunpowder.

310
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,508
In life,

311
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,264
there are times you must make a choice

312
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,767
even when you're not happy
with the available choices.

313
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:48,273
I just hope that you make a wise choice.

314
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,033
Get a boat ready!

315
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,624
Mom…

316
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,735
GAPBIGOCHA

317
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,462
It's Moo-jeok.

318
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,012
He really forgot about me
and is having fun with the kids.

319
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,391
Moo-jeok…

320
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,395
We should go.

321
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:54,941
For now,

322
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,194
we have to go.

323
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,536
Excuse me.

324
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,997
Can I get some aconite around here?

325
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,207
Aconite?

326
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,583
We don't have aconite.

327
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,171
I heard that you can get some
at Gokdu Trading Group on Gapbigocha.

328
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,176
Thank you.

329
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,803
Its leader is quite resourceful.

330
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,471
I hear she even deals with silver

331
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,139
-and gunpowder.
-Excuse me.

332
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,433
Where is Leader Kang Han-gi?

333
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,602
Thank you.

334
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,606
Women love this color.

335
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,484
Where are these goods from?

336
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,665
How is it possible

337
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,668
that we haven't had a single
secret royal inspector return alive?

338
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,856
I am Ra Yi-eon, a busuchan of Hongmungwan.

339
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:54,157
I have returned after my inspection
in Left Chungcheong Province.

340
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,505
He's not a ghost, is he?

341
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,842
Wait…

342
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,929
But there was definitely a funeral…

343
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,184
I confirmed it.

344
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,104
There was indeed a funeral.

345
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,903
And as the chief state councilor stated,

346
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,654
someone went after me,

347
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,074
and I was murdered.

348
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:43,081
Fortunately, I barely managed to
save myself in a life-and-death situation.

349
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,501
However, I believed I'd have to die
for the culprit to show himself.

350
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,752
So for the investigation…

351
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:53,174
I hid the fact that I was still alive
and let the funeral be held.

352
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,515
And you made such a fuss
without knowing that…

353
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,353
How could you call me out
with unverified intel after I went to bed?

354
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,776
I'll discuss with my advisors and officers
to decide what to do about this.

355
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,444
Do you understand?

356
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,534
So what did you find out?

357
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,705
A wicked group of people has colluded

358
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,334
with local magistrates
to misappropriate and pocket taxes

359
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:32,088
by stealing tributes, illegally exploiting
taxpayers, and using other methods

360
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,841
with the backing of someone powerful.

361
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,679
And I found out…

362
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,765
who was behind it all.

363
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,098
Even so.

364
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,559
You could've given me a heads-up.

365
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,227
Do you know how surprised I was?

366
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,021
I apologize, sir.

367
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,399
I had to keep it secret
for the sake of the investigation.

368
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,442
Right.

369
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,111
I'm just glad you're back safe and sound.

370
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,284
So how can I help you?

371
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,954
I need you to buy time
until I submit a report on my mission.

372
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,082
Since I informed the king
I knew who was behind it,

373
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,293
the chief state councilor must be anxious.

374
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,254
If you buy me time,

375
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,715
I will make sure

376
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:01,802
to solve the cases
and prove that he's been behind all this.

377
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,721
All right.

378
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,972
Be careful.

379
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,809
Now that it's come to this,
he won't just stand by and watch.

380
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,519
Yes, sir.

381
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,855
Now, why don't we go have something to eat

382
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,107
and talk about it in detail?

383
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,652
I'm sure you haven't eaten well
in a while.

384
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,487
I apologize, my lord,

385
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,366
but I have an urgent matter
to take care of today.

386
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,076
Right.

387
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,828
Your family must have been very shocked.

388
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,622
-Go home and--
-Yes, sir.

389
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,708
Let's talk about it more tomorrow…

390
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,554
Hey.

391
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,474
What's the date today?

392
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,358
Is it Chilseok today?

393
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,401
It's…

394
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,330
I'll see you at home later.

395
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,382
You saw it, too.

396
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,883
Yes, I saw it, too.

397
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,512
We even see ghosts now.

398
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,974
I don't care if it is a ghost.

399
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,310
I just want Lord Yi-eon back.

400
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,271
Lord Yi-eon…

401
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,779
My lord!

402
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,323
Young Master!

403
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,579
Young Master!

404
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,579
Let's sit here for a minute.
My legs are killing me.

405
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:39,877
Jo-yi.

406
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,505
Let's give her some alone time.

407
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,446
Once you get to Hanyang,

408
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,700
follow Cheonggye Stream,

409
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,036
and you won't lose your way.

410
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,873
Once a fruit shop comes into view,

411
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,625
then you'll see

412
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,877
Mojeon Bridge,

413
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,255
Gwangtong Bridge,

414
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:25,965
Jangtong Bridge,

415
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,175
Supyo Bridge,

416
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,178
and then Harang Bridge.

417
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,974
Once you come across the sixth bridge,

418
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,645
you're almost there.

419
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,190
Remember…

420
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,319
the sixth bridge over Cheonggye Stream.

421
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,115
Hoehyeon-dong, south of Supyo Bridge.

422
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,704
If we ever get separated,

423
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,373
on Chilseok,

424
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,210
you can come and find me there.

425
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,715
Make sure to come.

426
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,717
I will

427
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,012
bestow happiness upon you.

428
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,599
Have you eaten?

429
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,935
What does it matter at a time like this?

430
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,689
Didn't I tell you
my place was by the sixth bridge?

431
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,775
This is the fifth bridge.

432
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,570
You can't even count.

433
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,502
I mean,

434
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:31,048
there used to be
a noodle place right over there.

435
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,925
Maybe they went out of business?

436
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,637
Well…

437
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,683
Right, if you go about 80 steps this way…

438
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:42,434
Maybe not?

439
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,562
East?

440
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,481
West?

441
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,151
Are you really Lord Yi-eon?

442
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,821
Yes, I am.

443
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,493
What are you doing?

444
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,121
Are you really not just a hallucination?

445
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,999
Have you ever seen
a hallucination feel pain?

446
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,669
Are you really not a goblin?

447
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,839
Have you ever seen a goblin so ticklish?

448
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,592
Are you really Lord Yi-eon?

449
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,510
Are you sure?

450
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,690
You really are Lord Yi-eon.

451
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:12,691
You are.

452
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,718
Don't you think Jo-yi's taking too long?

453
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,470
Should we go look for her?

454
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,223
-Right? It's been too long, right?
-Yes.

455
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,767
Then let's go and look for her.

456
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,479
Goodness.

457
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,814
Where did she go?

458
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:56,693
It's hard to find her
because she's so tiny. My goodness.

459
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,073
Why are there so many people?

460
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:09,123
Gosh.

461
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,250
Hanyang sure is different.

462
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,584
People are really open.

463
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,464
Well, that's being too open.
I'm embarrassed for them.

464
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,220
What?

465
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,472
Is that Jo-yi?

466
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,141
What do you mean, Jo-yi?

467
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,642
It is, right?

468
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:35,399
She must have lost her mind
because she was in too much pain.

469
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,819
Coming through! My lord!

470
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,904
Young Master!

471
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,490
-My lord!
-My lord!

472
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,536
-My lord!
-What?

473
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:56,044
That's our late young master, right?

474
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,882
That tiny face on that tall body
with shoulders as broad as rafters.

475
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,176
That does seem like our lord.

476
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,802
But how…

477
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,845
My point exactly.

478
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,972
How is our late lord…

479
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,601
You think he survived?

480
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,478
That must be it.

481
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,272
You're right. We never found his body.

482
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,525
That's right.
There's no way he died that easily.

483
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,573
Hold on.

484
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,285
Does this mean
he's been fooling us all this time?

485
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,205
You're right.

486
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,040
I'm sure he had his reasons.

487
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,666
But still!

488
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,252
-This is wrong!
-This is wrong!

489
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,380
By the way,

490
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,425
doesn't that woman
seem awfully familiar from behind?

491
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,845
That physique, the hairstyle,
and even the clothes…

492
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,057
Is that Jo-yi?

493
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,935
What are you talking about?

494
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,021
Have you forgotten
she left for Gapbigocha with Gwang-soon?

495
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,903
-Gwang-soon…
-Bi-ryeong!

496
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:04,988
What?

497
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,449
-Yook-chil!
-Gu-pal!

498
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,417
-But what are you doing here?
-Pardon?

499
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:19,419
Have you gone mad?

500
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,673
How could you be having fun here
when you should be at the funeral?

501
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,384
How could you do that
to the late Lord Yi-eon?

502
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,053
She's right. The funeral
should still be going on.

503
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,806
Gu-pal, have you gone insane?

504
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,891
-Pull yourself together!
-What's with you?

505
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,268
That hurts!

506
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,353
What are you doing here?

507
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,856
-That's not it.
-Stop lying!

508
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,193
He's alive! Lord Yi-eon is alive!

509
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,988
Lord Yi-eon is alive?

510
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,823
Yes, he is!

511
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,622
Then that man next to Jo-yi
is Lord Yi-eon?

512
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,416
It is.

513
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,001
-Really?
-Yes.

514
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,049
-Gwang-soon!
-Gwang-soon!

515
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,509
-Gwang-soon!
-Gwang-soon!

516
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,885
Gwang-soon!

517
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,026
Wait, but…

518
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,283
Where are they?

519
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,368
Where did they go?

520
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,953
-Where are they?
-They were there.

521
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,253
What in the world happened?

522
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,797
Why didn't you let us know
that you were alive?

523
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,300
I had no choice.

524
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,639
I knew there would be people
digging around to make sure I was dead.

525
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,724
I had to stay dead.

526
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,270
I had no idea,
so I bawled and wailed on the ground.

527
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,273
You bawled and wailed on the ground?

528
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,112
You must have desperately missed me.

529
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,510
On the day the mine collapsed,

530
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:34,846
when I saw you get buried
under the pile of rocks, I almost fainted.

531
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,017
How did you manage to get out?

532
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,811
Did some soldier save you?

533
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,444
I was unconscious for a while.

534
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,116
Then I saw a butterfly flying by.

535
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,742
A butterfly?

536
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,328
What was a butterfly doing inside a mine?

537
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,454
I thought so too.

538
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,581
A butterfly in a mine?

539
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,376
But if a butterfly had entered,

540
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,503
then it meant there was a way out.

541
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,215
So I followed it.

542
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,435
Tae-seo.

543
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,615
I had no time to waste.

544
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,912
I had to follow them
to get to the bottom of the case.

545
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:46,793
Then have you been
secretly investigating this whole time?

546
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,718
By faking my own death,

547
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,137
I was able to
get to the bottom of this case.

548
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,142
They're just diabolical.

549
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,727
How can someone

550
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,563
be so meticulously wicked like that?

551
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:10,650
Those who commit crimes
are all meticulous.

552
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,613
How could they commit crimes
if they were lazy?

553
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:17,073
Those rotten bastards.

554
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,910
The world is so heartless.

555
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,330
I thought I'd be rewarded if I worked hard

556
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,832
and things would get better
if I did my best.

557
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,127
But the bad guys are living it up
for everyone to see.

558
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,631
I feel like everything was in vain.

559
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,385
I finally made it to Hanyang as I wished.

560
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,721
I finally met…

561
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,058
my mother whom I'd longed for.

562
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,064
But what's the point?

563
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,701
There's something I realized
after dying once.

564
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,871
Being with you in the present…

565
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,833
is quite nice.

566
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,503
Therefore,

567
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,550
you don't have to face
the world alone anymore.

568
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:18,885
From now on,

569
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,429
I'll be by your side.

570
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,019
Also,

571
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:31,189
I will catch those bad guys

572
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,734
and show you
that not everything was in vain.

573
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,906
That's right!

574
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,199
What's wrong with me?

575
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,161
Gwang-soon and Bi-ryeong must be waiting.
I need to get going.

576
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:30,665
Well, before it gets too late,
we must find a tavern to stay the night.

577
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,543
What do you mean, a tavern?

578
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:35,962
A tavern?

579
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,882
You can't stay at a tavern.

580
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,259
Who knows what scoundrels
might be staying there?

581
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,427
It's fine.

582
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,388
I have Gwang-soon and Bi-ryeong.
There's nothing to worry about.

583
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,767
Why don't you

584
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,936
just stay at my place?

585
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:58,944
I mean,

586
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:02,405
I have a lot of rooms at my house.
So let's sleep together…

587
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,406
Together?

588
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,912
No. I mean, you stay in my room
and I stay in your room… What?

589
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,288
Why would I be in your room?

590
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,502
What I mean is,
let's just spend the night together…

591
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,670
Together?

592
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,422
How could you ask me that?

593
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:22,258
Have you treated
all the women you've seen like this?

594
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,761
Have I treated
all the women I've seen like this?

595
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,013
I've never spent time alone with a woman.

596
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,056
This is my first…

597
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,936
First?

598
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,362
Anyhow!

599
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:48,368
You can't stay at the tavern forever.

600
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,037
What are you planning to do?

601
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,914
According to Gwang-soon,

602
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,583
houses around Ojangdonggye are affordable.

603
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:59,254
So even wanderers like me should be
able to settle down without much trouble.

604
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,132
I'm going to the estate agency
in that area tomorrow.

605
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,300
Ojang-dong…

606
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,971
Do you have to
go through all that trouble?

607
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:13,476
It's time for me to stand on my own feet.

608
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,611
I know you too well.

609
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,364
So I'm not going to stop you,

610
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,158
but always be careful.

611
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,994
You're in Hanyang.

612
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,540
I really need to get going now.

613
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,251
Gwang-soon and Bi-ryeong
have been waiting for a long time.

614
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:41,504
Right, Yook-chil and Gu-pal
must be waiting for me too.

615
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,548
Then hurry up.

616
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,093
No.

617
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,888
I'll walk you there. Where are they?

618
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,433
That's not necessary. You go first.

619
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,643
I'm perfectly capable of going by myself.

620
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:56,978
No.

621
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:59,314
I can't let you go
by yourself this late at night.

622
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,858
-I'll walk you there.
-It's right around the corner.

623
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,859
Don't worry.

624
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,778
I said, I'll walk you there.

625
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,988
-Lead the way.
-I said, I'm fine.

626
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,114
Lead the way.

627
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,366
Look at you two having fun.

628
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,623
Do you not care about us at all?

629
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,541
You're so cruel, my lord.

630
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,668
How could you do this to us?

631
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:24,130
Hey! Do you know how worried I was?

632
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,425
Didn't it occur to you
that we'd be worried sick?

633
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,097
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

634
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,389
My goodness.

635
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,599
-You brat…
-No…

636
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,517
-My lord!
-Come on!

637
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,643
Listen to me.

638
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,895
Do you know how worried we were?

639
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,070
My lord! Are you all right?

640
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,710
-Ganggangsulae!
-Ganggangsulae!

641
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,796
Our lord!

642
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,047
He's back!

643
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,550
-Ganggangsulae!
-The other way!

644
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,301
Here, too…

645
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:13,847
Has peace come to Joseon
while I wasn't paying attention?

646
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,453
THE SAFETY OF THE CHILD ACTORS
IN THIS EPISODE WAS PROPERLY ENSURED

647
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,637
SPECIAL THANKS TO
JO KWAN-WOO AND CHA HAK-YEON

648
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,143
We'll now go arrest the suspects.

649
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,978
Who dares to arrest me?

650
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,814
-Please, dismiss him.
-Please, dismiss him.

651
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,483
So what are you going to do?

652
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,318
How will you overturn it now?

653
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,694
We should kill him.

654
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,322
-Seung-yul, is that you?
-How could you be this cute?

655
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,991
There must be a lady you fancy. Right?

656
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:16,826
He is a lord, after all.

657
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,703
You're the dead inspector!

658
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:20,497
I'm here to catch you.
