PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,270
Why can't I get a refund?

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CENTER

5
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,732
I bought this two days ago!

6
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,318
I'm sorry, sir.

7
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,571
You lost the receipt,
so we need to check...

8
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,163
Do you think I'm lying?

9
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,123
Do I need to get aggressive?

10
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,794
I have no choice
but to get physical with you.

11
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,173
You darn little...

12
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,599
Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,157
I checked with the manufacturer

14
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,826
and this product is only sold online.

15
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,872
Sir, you got the discount online.
You can't get an exchange here.

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,918
You heard him.

17
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,880
Do you have anything else to say?

18
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,375
If you wish to get physical,
you can do so with me.

19
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,508
No, it's fine. I'm sorry.

20
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,138
Sorry about this. I'll get going.

21
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,766
Have a good day.

22
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,148
-What are you doing here?
-I should be the one asking you.

23
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:35,034
-Are you here to steal something again?
-No, I work here.

24
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,033
I'm not a fool.
You think I'd fall for that lie?

25
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,656
Let's go to Security.

26
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:48,325
Why don't you talk to me
instead of getting physical?

27
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,012
So who are you people?

28
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,340
-Sorry?
-You infiltrated a five-star hotel

29
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,676
and exposed its corruption to the media.

30
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,354
You're not
an ordinary supermarket employee.

31
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,018
Well, we're...

32
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,765
You see...

33
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,397
-We can't disclose...
-Just tell me already.

34
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,435
It's not like
you're secret agents or Robin Hood.

35
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,396
Robin Hood?

36
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,113
I wish.

37
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,029
He can target anyone whenever he wants to.

38
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,615
We're dying over here
trying to meet the quota that's been set.

39
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,701
A quota that's been set?

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,372
Do you work for the NIS or something?

41
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,883
Something like that.

42
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,884
But our operation

43
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,377
-is on the larger scale.
-Larger?

44
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,588
-Such an organization exists in Korea?
-In Korea?

45
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,680
You need to think bigger.

46
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,888
That's right. Think big.

47
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,270
Aren't we telling her too much?

48
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,730
She's a civilian.

49
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,731
She helped us score last time,

50
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,197
so this is the least we can do.
Anyway,

51
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,098
Who is this man?

52
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,683
I'm sorry, but it's better
to let her see for herself

53
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,636
instead of letting her speculate
and get ideas.

54
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,534
Why do you look familiar?
I know I've seen you before.

55
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,575
You probably saw him on the news.

56
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
Here.

57
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,287
The CIA!

58
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,665
The director of the CIA?

59
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,300
He's too low in the ranks
to know these things.

60
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,803
EMPLOYEE LOUNGE

61
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,262
Have your questions been answered?

62
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,469
Yes.

63
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,557
So mind your own business
from now on.

64
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,272
You know what'll happen.

65
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,232
You don't have to tell me twice.

66
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,823
My career's over
after I got caught up in your mission.

67
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:16,858
About that...

68
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,569
I'm truly sorry.

69
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,066
It's why I'm asking you
to not tell the others here about me.

70
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,871
Don't even acknowledge me.

71
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,371
Once people find out,
I won't be able to get a job anywhere.

72
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,957
Got it. You don't need to worry.

73
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,673
Take care.

74
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,394
We're good here now.

75
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,983
-There's no need to be tense.
-Your Korean is amazing.

76
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,555
Do you know me though?

77
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,618
Of course. What a stupid question.

78
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,735
Wait. Didn't you know it was me?

79
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,245
How can you be so dense?

80
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,633
Your temperament doesn't seem
to be your only problem.

81
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,211
I'm worried.

82
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,509
Let's finish shopping.

83
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,800
I'll get the noodles,
you get the vegetables.

84
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,312
He's even fluent in English?

85
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,780
EPISODE 4

86
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,710
Young lady!

87
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,053
You can't buy
all the noodles on the shelf.

88
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,091
Give me a few, will you?

89
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,058
No can do. Have a good day.

90
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,477
Don't be like that and hand over just one.

91
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,980
My grandchild wants noodles for dinner.

92
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,317
I have mouths to feed as well.

93
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,614
Good day.

94
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,388
Stop!

95
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,313
My gosh. You shocked me!

96
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,942
Were you about to steal from my cart?

97
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,396
Steal?

98
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,609
You haven't paid for them yet,
so they're not yours.

99
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,616
Besides, I'm an old lady who wants
to cook noodles for her grandchild,

100
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,411
but you won't even let me have one.

101
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,495
You people think
age is the card that trumps everything.

102
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,000
You really want to test me, lady?

103
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,881
Never have I had

104
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,721
such a young lady
challenging my age before.

105
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,643
Fine. Let's compare ages. How old are you?

106
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,760
Twenty? Twenty-one?

107
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,137
Seriously? You think I'm 20?

108
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,939
Gosh, do I look that young?

109
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,943
Yes, look at that taut skin you have

110
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,316
and fine soft hair on those cheeks.

111
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,446
What about your hair?

112
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,371
It's jet black and all shiny.

113
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,081
And these hands.

114
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,710
They're both soft and smooth
as if you never worked in your life.

115
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,250
See for yourself!

116
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,457
Look here, old lady.

117
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,593
-How perceptive of you.
-Of course!

118
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,643
-Ma'am!
-What?

119
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,053
You want noodles?

120
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,266
Would this be enough?

121
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:31,235
I apologize for having been rude to you.

122
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,454
It's all right.
Besides, you made it up by buying this.

123
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,504
It seems like
your parents raised you well.

124
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,165
You said you were cooking noodles.
Where are the meat and vegetables?

125
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,626
My noodles don't need any of those.

126
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,007
These days, people add eggs, meat,
the whole shebang,

127
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,851
but that was a luxury
we couldn't afford back in the day.

128
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,272
We'd wash some ripened kimchi,

129
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,725
finely chop it,

130
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,732
season it with soy sauce and sesame oil,

131
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,694
and plop it on some cooked noodles.

132
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,736
Then I pour some anchovy stock
in the bowl.

133
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,122
My grandson clears two bowls easily.

134
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,330
Ripened kimchi and sesame oil?

135
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,673
Anyway, what event
do you need all these ingredients for?

136
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,300
Well, there's a field day
and I'm going there to make money.

137
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,006
Make money?

138
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,255
You said you weren't married yet, right?

139
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,269
What if I set you up with my grandson?

140
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,599
He works in customer center here.
Why don't you meet him?

141
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,265
-Customer center?
-Yes.

142
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,359
His name is Choi Jin-dong.

143
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,859
He's sweet and works hard at his job.

144
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,031
Choi Jin-dong?

145
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,701
My gosh, look at the time!

146
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,658
I'm afraid I'm a little busy.
Take care, ma'am.

147
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,210
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

148
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,712
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

149
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,974
-What were you in your past life?
-Me in my past life?

150
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,353
Yes.

151
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,640
Hold on. What was I again?

152
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,562
Why do you ask?

153
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,765
Your good handwriting makes me wonder
if you were educated.

154
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,476
What? My handwriting?

155
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,572
This is bold lettering art.
I learned it at the cultural center.

156
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,735
I paid 30,000 won for six classes
and extra for the materials.

157
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,655
Of course.
You don't exactly strike me as a nobleman.

158
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,616
Jeez.

159
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,415
I may not seem like it, but...

160
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,339
Why do I even bother?

161
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,091
Are we all set then?

162
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,137
Let me see.
I have the true or false questions ready.

163
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,810
I didn't think you'd be this enthusiastic.

164
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,221
Why wouldn't I be?

165
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,597
It's my chance to easily score
without having to hear sob stories.

166
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,646
There's the Weol-ju I know.

167
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,685
Kang-bae can be off today
since there's nothing to do.

168
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,864
What do you mean?
There'll be a lot of people.

169
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,363
Why should I serve customers
when I have a part-timer?

170
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,529
You never give people a break.

171
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:25,164
All right then. Squeeze these people
like you would with the noodles.

172
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,504
Are you done?
We should head there and set up.

173
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,040
-What about Kang-bae?
-I already have that sorted.

174
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,141
You just heard a bell ring, didn't you?

175
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,135
It's okay. I'm ready to hear you out.
Go ahead and tell me.

176
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,403
Go on. Go ahead.

177
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,021
What bell, you pervert?

178
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,316
<i>Is she worry-free</i>
<i>or doesn't my ability work on her?</i>

179
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,623
<i>What the hell could it be?</i>

180
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,989
<i>I'll know if I touch her once more.</i>

181
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,080
<i>If only I could...</i>

182
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,674
What is this?

183
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,880
Why are you following me?

184
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,013
Following you? No, I wasn't...

185
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,090
You have been
since we left the supermarket.

186
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,637
What are you up to this time?

187
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,259
That's not it.

188
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,311
I'm just going in the same direction.

189
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,144
I mean it.

190
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,563
I do.

191
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,435
Then go first.

192
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,369
I have to ask.
Do I really not give you any feelings?

193
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,240
Feelings? Of course you do.

194
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,497
Right? I knew it.

195
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,875
Awkwardness, annoyance,
discomfort, and frustration.

196
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,589
The feelings that make me
want to stay away from you.

197
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,427
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

198
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,388
Ms. Weol-ju!

199
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,186
Ms. Weol-ju, she's immune to my touch...

200
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,149
What?

201
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,238
The dead from Seoul.

202
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,908
The dead from South Chungcheong Province.

203
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,077
What?

204
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,174
The dead from South Jeolla Province.

205
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,088
South Jeolla Province?

206
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,590
Where am I?

207
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,513
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

208
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,277
I'm at the right place.

209
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,815
What the hell is going on?

210
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,832
What is this?

211
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,909
Kang-bae, over here!

212
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,536
-You're here.
-Get over here.

213
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,083
The dead from North Jeolla Province.

214
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,883
Guibanjang, where are we?

215
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,590
The Dream World.
You know the place, right?

216
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,591
You're at the annual
Dream World Lottery Battle.

217
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,971
Think of it as a field day for the dead.

218
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,346
The dead?

219
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,936
-Are you saying that they're all...
-The dead for...

220
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,230
-They're playing the lottery?
-The winner gets to enter

221
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,492
its descendants dream
to relay the winning numbers.

222
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,570
Lotto winners
who had dreams of their ancestors

223
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:51,195
are all descendants of the people
who won the Lottery Battle.

224
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,658
The dead from North Chungcheong Province.

225
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,624
So are we here to sell snacks?

226
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,328
Unbelievable.

227
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,585
Would I be here
if that's all there was to it?

228
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,880
Everyone here constantly worry
about their descendants.

229
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,585
Escorting the winner
to the dream of one's descendant

230
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,506
will automatically count as a score.

231
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,894
It'll be the easiest score ever.

232
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,603
-The dead from Jeju Island.
-Table number three.

233
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,604
-Sure.
-Hold on.

234
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,349
Here you go.

235
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,940
The lottery numbers this year
are mine to take.

236
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,864
My grandchildren deserve to be rich too.

237
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,114
-Hey!
-Seriously?

238
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,695
Your descendants can at least afford
a yearly rent.

239
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,741
Mine is still in a small single room
with monthly rent.

240
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,236
LEE BANG-DEUK

241
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:40,167
Do you know how painful it is
to have passed down poverty?

242
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,378
At least you had something to pass down.

243
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,511
My family didn't even have that.

244
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,262
Unbelievable.

245
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,931
The rich survive three generations
after they're ruined,

246
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,971
but poverty can't be escaped
no matter what you do.

247
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,642
Here's your <i>pajeon.</i> Please enjoy.

248
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:03,438
You wait and see.
This is the day that I finally

249
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,901
sever the streak of poverty in my family.

250
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,409
Jin-dong, just you wait!

251
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,948
-What? Jin-dong?
-Here. Have a drink.

252
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,703
Choi Seok-pan?

253
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,580
Choi Jin-dong?

254
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,416
Are you by any chance related
to Choi Jin-dong who works at Kapeul Mart?

255
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,837
Yes, I am.

256
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:32,625
How on earth do you know
my great-grandson?

257
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,096
Hello, I'm Han Kang-bae.

258
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,060
I work with Jin-dong.

259
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,309
-Is that so? It's good to meet you.
-Hi.

260
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,805
Hold on.

261
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,775
Why on earth are you here though?

262
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,489
Goodness. And at such a young age too.

263
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,701
You poor thing.

264
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:58,042
-You didn't have to hurry to come here.
-Sorry?

265
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,407
Oh, well, you know how life is.

266
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,628
Right, death doesn't hit according to age.

267
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,839
Since you're here though,
do as many good deeds as you can

268
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,671
to guarantee a long and healthy life
when you're reborn.

269
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,467
-Han Kang-bae.
-Go, Kang-bae!

270
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,591
You too.

271
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,467
-Go, go.
-Good luck.

272
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,096
-Go for it.
-Go!

273
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,983
The lowlifes just can't keep it down,
can they?

274
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,902
Kang-bae, come on over and say hello.

275
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,820
2020 DREAM WORLD LOTTERY BATTLE

276
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,109
He's Death from the Yeomra World.

277
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,067
Call him Yeombujang.

278
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,526
Death?

279
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,832
-Hello, I'm Han Kang-bae.
-Right.

280
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,871
I saw you once with Ms. Choi

281
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,246
although you probably didn't see me.

282
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,962
Ms. Andong?

283
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,836
Am I able to see you
because I'm in the Dream World?

284
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,762
Bingo.

285
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,512
You'll also see me in the Living Realm
if I'm not doing Death duties though.

286
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,927
We'll grab a drink sometime.

287
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,345
It must be hard to answer
to a temperamental boss.

288
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,814
Your pale face says it all.

289
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,145
Enough with the chit-chat
and begin the race.

290
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,362
-Let's go!
-Go, go!

291
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,033
2020 DREAM WORLD LOTTERY BATTLE

292
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,198
The 2020 Dream World Lottery Battle
will soon begin.

293
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:26,455
Will the ancestors
quickly gather in the field?

294
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,130
Let's do this.

295
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,378
-First place, here I come.
-Let's go.

296
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,170
CHOI SEOK-PAN

297
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,094
Let me show them how it's done.

298
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,593
All right. Just don't hurt yourselves.

299
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,755
-Mr. Choi, good luck.
-All right!

300
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,514
May the best dead win.

301
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,217
KIM DU-YEONG

302
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,887
Gosh. Hey!

303
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,767
Oops, he's a nobleman.

304
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,149
-Mr. Choi, good luck.
-Here we go.

305
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,317
May the best dead win!

306
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,365
<i>I'm sure he had his reasons.</i>

307
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,873
-Gosh, don't eat so fast.
-Got it.

308
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,117
-Jin-dong.
-Yes?

309
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,251
Just how exactly are they related?

310
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,799
The woman's father
is actually the young guy's birth father.

311
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,091
He's being tested to see
if he could donate his liver to his son,

312
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,718
but the doctor in charge
is the son's rival.

313
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,394
Is that so?

314
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:29,062
Then this is what'll obviously happen.
The doctor would fabricate

315
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,274
the father's test results
to help out the young lady.

316
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:37,071
She'll find out and be torn
with what to do.

317
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,696
Gosh, that's the best guess ever.

318
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,735
You could be a screenwriter yourself.

319
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,204
-Right?
-Yes.

320
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,285
Anyway...

321
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,829
Here you go.

322
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,748
What's this?

323
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,048
It's for your back surgery.

324
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,931
I've been saving up
and the installments ended this month.

325
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,184
It's fine.
Your pocket money is yours to spend.

326
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,149
This isn't pocket money.

327
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,729
Besides, I'm 29 now.

328
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,484
Exactly. You're 30 soon which means

329
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,486
you should be thinking about marriage.

330
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,238
So save up as much as you can.

331
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,566
It'll be at least ten years
before I get married,

332
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,117
so let's treat your back first.

333
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,661
Hold on. I'm supposed to wait ten years?

334
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,916
You're the worst grandson ever.

335
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,788
So don't be stubborn
and be married by next year.

336
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,220
Please get the surgery
and stop enduring the pain every night.

337
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,719
The doctor said that I'm too old

338
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,512
for the surgery to make a huge difference.

339
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,269
I can manage the pain by taking it easy,
so take back the money.

340
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,024
Right now!

341
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,855
Dream World's true or false quiz!

342
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,242
First category, common knowledge.

343
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:13,327
Snails have teeth. True or false?

344
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,705
What's the right answer?

345
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,881
Is the statement true or false?

346
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,495
Go!

347
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:26,183
Snails live off grass, so of course
they need teeth. How else can they...

348
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,601
I got it. It has to be true.

349
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,480
True. It must be true.

350
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,190
It's true!

351
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,401
-Sir.
-Yes?

352
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,691
Step back into the crowd. Back!

353
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:45,068
It's true!

354
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:49,952
The answer is...

355
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,040
true!

356
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,128
Nice. I knew it.
Of course snails have teeth.

357
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,342
Snails have 10,000 to 25,000 teeth

358
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,843
which makes them
the animal with the most teeth.

359
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:11,352
Those who answered incorrectly
can hop on the Afterlife Express.

360
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,399
All right.

361
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,367
Run!

362
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,844
My gosh.

363
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,011
You can do it.

364
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,044
Damn it!

365
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,584
Seriously?

366
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,672
-Oh, no.
-You're out.

367
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,092
You're out.

368
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,673
Just a little bit more.

369
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,341
A man should have a strong back.

370
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,679
Come on.

371
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,306
-A man with a strong back!
-Good job.

372
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,517
A man with a strong back!

373
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,530
Good luck. You can do this.

374
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,033
SON JONG-SU, KIM DU-YEONG

375
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,582
You're out.

376
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,955
-Hold on.
-I wasn't watching.

377
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,419
You passed!

378
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,215
CHOI SEOK-PAN, KIM DU-YEONG

379
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,176
Mr. Choi.

380
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,058
You've got this.

381
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,269
The 2020 Dream World
Lottery Battle Finals.

382
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,773
The one-legged fight.

383
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,940
Choi Seok-pan versus Kim Du-yeong.

384
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,396
Who will win the lottery numbers?

385
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,446
The game starts now.

386
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,948
Contestants, please step into the ring!

387
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,204
-Go!
-You can do this!

388
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,906
-Go!
-Let's do this!

389
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,963
<i>A nobleman like me can't lose</i>
<i>to someone of a low birth.</i>

390
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,586
<i>I may be of humble birth,</i>

391
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,763
<i>but my love for my descendants</i>
<i>is not humble.</i>

392
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:56,511
<i>I will win this game by all means</i>
<i>and give my dear grandson a bright future.</i>

393
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:02,063
Ready, get set...

394
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,310
-Let's go!
-You can do this!

395
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,437
Go!

396
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:13,907
-Kim Du-yeong!
-Choi Seok-pan!

397
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,489
Let's do this!

398
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:18,292
-Kim Du-yeong!
-Choi Seok-pan!

399
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,539
-Kim Du-yeong!
-No!

400
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,960
Come on!

401
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,289
Like this!

402
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Come on!

403
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,749
-Kim Du-yeong!
-Choi Seok-pan!

404
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,012
What happened?

405
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,552
-Gosh!
-Boo!

406
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,469
-Come on!
-Hey!

407
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,652
-Kim Du-yeong!
-Choi Seok-pan!

408
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,364
<i>I can't give up like this.</i>

409
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,197
<i>Here's my secret weapon,</i>
<i>the hurricane windmill technique!</i>

410
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,256
No!

411
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,873
The winner
of the Dream World Lottery Battle

412
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,330
is Choi Seok-pan!

413
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:48,957
Yes!

414
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,590
-Choi Seok-pan!
-Choi Seok-pan!

415
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,921
Choi Seok-pan...

416
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:59,433
-Choi Seok-pan!
-Choi Seok-pan!

417
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,349
WINNER: CHOI SEOK-PAN

418
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,736
Thank you.

419
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,149
WINNING LOTTERY NUMBERS
IN A DESCENDANT'S DREAM

420
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,488
Yes! He did it!

421
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,373
What's with you?
It's not like you won the lottery.

422
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,963
He gets worked up over things
that don't concern him.

423
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,999
What do you mean?
I care about Jin-dong!

424
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,173
Jin-dong can finally quit his job now.

425
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,706
Mr. Choi!

426
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,130
Kang-bae!

427
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,175
I can't believe that lowlife.

428
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,108
Customer number one, how may I help you?

429
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,191
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CENTER

430
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,490
TICKET NUMBER 7

431
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,119
We're serving customer number one.
Could you wait for a moment?

432
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,873
TICKET NUMBER 11

433
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,054
What are all these numbers?

434
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,759
My dear,

435
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,925
your suffering is over at last.

436
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,684
Goodness, my sweetie.

437
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,288
Well,

438
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,578
have all the participants gone back
to the Afterlife?

439
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,377
Yes, except the ones who stayed behind
to clean up.

440
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,884
Shall we get back to work then?

441
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,551
Give me the list.

442
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,304
Sure, here's the list of people
who will die tomorrow.

443
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,063
Let me see.

444
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,191
What's this?

445
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,692
-Yeombujang, we're back!
-Hey.

446
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,861
Well, did everything go well?

447
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,778
Yes.

448
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,155
As always.

449
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,157
Anyway, when Jin-dong wins the lottery,

450
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,826
make sure my number goes up right away.

451
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,415
Of course.

452
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,960
You should hurry up
and go back to the Afterlife.

453
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,050
Spending too much time in the Dream World
clouds your spirit.

454
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,168
I will.

455
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,258
-Thank you.
-I haven't seen this before.

456
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,013
-Is it new?
-Well, yes.

457
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,144
Fancy. I guess the Yeomra Chung
has received some extra funds.

458
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,984
-Please give it back.
-Come on!

459
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,317
CHOI JIN-DONG
APRIL 21, DEATH BY ACCIDENT

460
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,529
What's this?

461
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,153
Choi Jin-dong is going to die?

462
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,202
-What?
-What did you say?

463
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,617
Jin-dong dies?

464
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,623
What are you talking about?

465
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,003
"April 21"?

466
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,376
That's tomorrow.

467
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,010
No, that can't be right.

468
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,087
He dies?

469
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:28,137
My sweet little boy, Jin-dong?

470
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,889
Why does that poor boy have to die?

471
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,893
-No way.
-Jin-dong!

472
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,305
Jin-dong dies?

473
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,017
-Why?
-What about my quota?

474
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,864
Will it go up?

475
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,279
You can forget about it.

476
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,857
I made a ton of noodles
and worked my butt off all day!

477
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,157
Ms. Weol-ju,
is that what you're worried about?

478
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,661
What about Jin-dong?

479
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:58,170
Can you please reconsider it?

480
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,668
It's...

481
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,963
not something I can decide.

482
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,046
How could you be so cold?

483
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,301
He was raised by his grandma

484
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,224
in such a shabby house,

485
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,933
but he has never done anything wrong
in his life.

486
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:18,095
He can't die before he even gets married!

487
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,864
This isn't right!

488
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,488
<i>This is bad.</i>

489
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,322
<i>I'm getting emotional.</i>

490
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,034
I beg you.

491
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,913
Please save him.

492
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,992
Well...

493
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,119
There's one thing you could try.

494
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,019
To change a person's destiny,
you have to change God's mind.

495
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:02,229
And that takes a great deed
that even God would be touched by.

496
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,476
I've already checked,

497
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,574
and the good deeds
you performed fall far short.

498
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,914
Is there anything I can do?

499
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,334
There is, actually.

500
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,463
-What's that?
-What's that?

501
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,174
-What he can do is…
-Yes?

502
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,421
-Well...
-Yes?

503
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,552
-The thing is...
-Gosh!

504
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,668
Hurry up! Are you announcing
an audition winner?

505
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,547
Who do you think you are?

506
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,684
I was about to say it. I was, right?

507
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,271
All right.

508
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,348
What you can do is acquire good deeds

509
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,976
from another dead person.

510
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:48,857
But it's illegal to acquire
good deeds for free.

511
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,109
You must give that person
something valuable in return.

512
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,831
I was a servant all my life.

513
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,329
I have nothing valuable.

514
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,336
The winning numbers.

515
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,261
What would money mean if he has to die?

516
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,931
Why don't you exchange that
with good deeds?

517
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,473
Can I do that?

518
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,846
Well, it's not impossible.

519
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,852
But money doesn't solve everything here.

520
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,942
What matters the most here
is relationships.

521
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,150
You can only acquire good deeds

522
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,914
from someone who has something to do
with your family.

523
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,954
Gosh, that's it.

524
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,448
We can't find such a person so fast.

525
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,365
Jin-dong has less than a day left.

526
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,495
Mr. Choi, you'll have to give up
this time.

527
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,920
Give the winning numbers to your grandson
when he is born again.

528
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,627
Then at least he will be rich
in his next life. Okay?

529
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,513
I should hurry up and find another case.
Let's go.

530
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,061
Please. Please help me.

531
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,608
As a dead person,
I can't travel back and forth.

532
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,232
Weol-ju, you're the only one
who can help...

533
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,737
I'm on a tight schedule myself.

534
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,450
I'm not a philanthropist
with time on my hands.

535
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,741
Without me,
he wouldn't even have been born.

536
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,536
I'd go to hell for him.

537
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:32,459
Please understand how I feel
as his ancestor.

538
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,399
Mother!

539
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,443
Mother, no!

540
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:55,032
Mother, wake up!

541
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,817
Mother!

542
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,620
In my next life,

543
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,503
I'll be your slave.

544
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,247
Please...

545
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,841
Please save my little boy.

546
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,274
Slavery's been abolished.
That's so old-fashioned.

547
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,305
Fine.

548
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,019
After all that hard work,
I can't give up so easily.

549
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,725
Thank you.

550
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,442
Goodness.

551
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,822
Thank you so much.

552
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,869
Hurry up and go back to the Afterlife now.

553
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,409
Your spirit is becoming weak.

554
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,500
Thank you so much.

555
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,131
Choi Jin-dong, Kapeul Mart,

556
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,674
11:03 a.m., an accidental death.

557
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,390
Be sure to bring good deeds by then.

558
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,222
Okay, got it.

559
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,055
Even if you're just a second late,

560
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,890
there will be nothing I can do.

561
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,152
AFTERLIFE CITY HALL

562
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,154
I need to view a family register
and the good deeds records.

563
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,158
-Can I get the keys?
-We don't have the reference room anymore.

564
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,121
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

565
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,950
What happened?
Was there a fire or something?

566
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,906
You didn't know? A new coworker
with amazing computer skills

567
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,957
computerized our old database.

568
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,498
That's him over there.

569
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,893
Can you find someone who has good deeds
and has something to do

570
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,064
with Mr. Choi Seok-pan?

571
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,481
Just a second, please.

572
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,766
CHOI SEOK-PAN

573
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,148
CHOI SEOK-PAN

574
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,994
HOLDER OF GOOD DEEDS

575
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,333
Gosh, that's fast.

576
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,500
LEE JEOM-RYE

577
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,166
"Lee Kkeut-sun."

578
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,593
She sure did many good deeds.

579
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,955
Yes. With so many good deeds,

580
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,678
she'll probably be a billionaire
in her next life.

581
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,345
A billionaire?

582
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,429
Your good deeds affect your next life?

583
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,928
That's why people regret

584
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,977
not doing good deeds while alive
when they enter the Afterlife.

585
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,481
Here, good deeds are more valuable
than anything.

586
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,284
People would steal them if they could.

587
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,203
Where can we find her?

588
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:47,529
AFTERLIFE ORPHANAGE

589
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,710
There's an orphanage here?

590
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,328
The children
who died before their parents stay here.

591
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,923
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

592
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,755
-Who are we?
-May I help you?

593
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,379
Hello.

594
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,797
We're from the Dream World.

595
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,506
Can we have a word
with Director Lee Kkeut-sun?

596
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,727
She's talking to someone right now.
You'll have to wait.

597
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,638
Have the kids eaten yet?

598
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,898
It's lunchtime soon.

599
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,824
Do we have any ingredients left?

600
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,680
Enjoy.

601
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,891
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

602
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,470
Enjoy, guys!

603
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,226
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

604
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,811
Eat slowly.

605
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,395
-Guys, eat slowly.
-There's more.

606
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,109
Tell me if you want more.

607
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,736
Is it tasty?

608
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,742
You wanted to see me?

609
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,004
Pardon?

610
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,167
Her grandson must still be young.

611
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,049
Poor Jeom-rye.

612
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,800
That's why we're here to ask you a favor.

613
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,680
Is there something I can do?

614
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,515
Please tell me what I can do.

615
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,436
We can save him
if you share your good deeds with us.

616
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:46,402
You did countless good deeds in your life.

617
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,359
I'm sure even God would be moved.

618
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,989
You can have them. Of course.

619
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:57,035
I owe Jeom-rye so much.

620
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,174
Here is

621
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,088
a winning lottery ticket
from Jeom-rye's father-in-law.

622
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,053
I can't take it.

623
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,473
You have to
according to the Afterlife law.

624
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,052
Do whatever you want with it.

625
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,723
Well, if you insist.

626
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,387
All right, here you go.

627
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,938
GOOD DEEDS

628
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,822
Please take good care of Jeom-rye.

629
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,040
Jin-dong, come have breakfast.
It's almost time for work.

630
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,656
-Grandma.
-Yes?

631
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,035
Give me a pen.

632
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,376
A pen and a piece of paper. Hurry.

633
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,340
-Why?
-A pen and a piece of paper.

634
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,880
What's with you?

635
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,593
Let me see. There they are.

636
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,260
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

637
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,554
My goodness.

638
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,972
What's that? What are you writing down?

639
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,268
In my dream last night, an old man...

640
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,356
Wait, if I talk about it,
it might become useless.

641
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,444
It's nothing. I'll tell you later.

642
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,370
How do you feel
having visited the Afterlife?

643
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,002
You must be the first living person

644
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,043
who has ever been here.

645
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,337
I don't feel very happy.
I feel sorry for those kids.

646
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,668
I know Director Lee
is taking good care of them.

647
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,005
They wait there until their parents come.

648
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,551
Will they meet their parents someday?

649
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,230
Yes, everyone dies someday,
so they eventually meet.

650
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,022
That's a relief.
It's different in the Living Realm.

651
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,435
What do you mean?

652
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,612
In the Living Realm,
most kids at orphanages

653
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,695
never meet their parents again
no matter how long they wait.

654
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,446
And I was one of them.

655
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,886
I hope we can make it.

656
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,181
Let me see. The sun is...

657
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,854
We have more than enough time
before his expected time of death.

658
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,187
I'm hot and thirsty.

659
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,404
Here's some barley tea.

660
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,254
The good deeds pouch!

661
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,581
Thief! Get him!

662
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,004
Hey, stop right there!

663
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,054
Hey, Kang-bae!

664
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,304
We need to leave.

665
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,931
-What about the good deeds?
-We don't have time.

666
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,763
Let's go back and protect Jin-dong.

667
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,387
KAPEUL MART

668
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,939
<i>I'll stop Death from the outside.</i>

669
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,284
<i>You stay inside</i>
<i>and keep an eye on Jin-dong.</i>

670
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,199
Hey, Jin-dong.

671
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,412
Why didn't you pick up your phone?
I was worried.

672
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,423
Sorry, it was on silent. Why?

673
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,252
I was just worried about you.

674
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,802
How are you?
Are you sick or anything?

675
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,764
What's with you?

676
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:38,586
You...

677
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,063
How did you know I bought this?

678
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:45,426
A lottery ticket?

679
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,147
The thing is,

680
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,690
I had an extraordinary dream last night.

681
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,569
You'll see.

682
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,527
If I win the lottery,

683
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,620
I'll take you on a trip to Hawaii.

684
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,409
Hawaii?

685
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,584
That sounds awesome.

686
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,042
I can't wait.

687
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,344
This one?

688
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,354
Wait, ma'am! I'm sorry.

689
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,482
-What's with you?
-I'm always like this.

690
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,646
Where are you going? That way, please.

691
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:40,702
Gosh.

692
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,197
What's going on?

693
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,488
I'm stretching.

694
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,367
Stretching is the best.

695
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,415
-Join me.
-Forget it.

696
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,106
Choi Jin-dong.

697
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:21,356
Life and death are in the hands of God.
There's nothing I can do.

698
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,781
I'm sorry, Seok-pan.

699
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,872
-Gosh, you startled me.
-Why are you so early?

700
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,115
A gentleman should always be

701
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,128
ten minutes early.

702
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,375
The good deeds pouch will be here soon.
Just hold on a second.

703
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,681
Didn't I tell you not to be
even a second late?

704
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,465
You're glaring again.
Are you going to hit me?

705
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,597
I've always wanted to hit you,

706
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,395
but I've never had any excuse.
But if I hit you on the job,

707
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,110
wouldn't that count
as an extenuating circumstance?

708
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,980
Hold on.

709
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,148
Why would you clench your fists?
Is that Choi Jin-dong?

710
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,115
Gosh!

711
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,797
Jin-dong, let's get out of here.
This place is too dangerous.

712
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,221
The warehouse? All of a sudden?

713
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,135
Yes. I'm getting so anxious.

714
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:31,352
If you want to get out of here,
hurry up and help me.

715
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:54,584
No!

716
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,844
Jin-dong!

717
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,389
Jin-dong!

718
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,861
Gosh. Jin-dong.

719
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,278
Jin-dong! Wake up!

720
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:27,651
Wake up!

721
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,294
Did you wake up? Do you recognize me?

722
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:37,658
I've been on 50 blind dates so far,
and I've been shut down every single time.

723
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,328
Can you believe that?

724
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,995
What? What are you talking about...

725
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,882
Am I that unattractive?

726
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,850
I really don't understand women.

727
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:53,644
I see.

728
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,312
The first girl...

729
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,310
Hey! Get off me!

730
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,693
If I do, you'll take him.

731
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,813
I have no choice.

732
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,937
It's his fate. Get off me!

733
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,444
Whatever, I don't care.

734
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,688
What? Unbelievable.

735
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,158
-Is that how you talk to Death?
-That's right.

736
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:13,618
After 500 years in the Living Realm,
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

737
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,950
My goodness.

738
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,079
-Move!
-Gosh!

739
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,377
What's taking Guibanjang so long?

740
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,135
Special larceny
and obstruction of justice.

741
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:39,347
If something happens to Choi Jin-dong,
you'll be charged with murder too.

742
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,055
TO THE LIVING REALM

743
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,606
When is the next ferry?

744
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,439
In two hours?

745
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,280
When so many people die every day,
shouldn't it run more frequently?

746
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,408
This is bad. There's not much time left.

747
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,970
Whatever, I'll give it a try.

748
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,190
Gosh, my back.

749
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,355
How could you shove me
to the floor like that?

750
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,316
You were about to run the guy over
with that cart.

751
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,616
How do you feel
now that you got your butt kicked by me?

752
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,876
Thanks.
I have to submit a written apology now.

753
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,759
Don't worry. I've submitted
countless apologies so far.

754
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,758
I'll send over the best ones
so you can copy them.

755
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:55,091
There's no need. While I'm at it,

756
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,682
one more written apology won't hurt.

757
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,256
This is all your fault.

758
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:01,599
ACCIDENTAL DEATH

759
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,564
HEART

760
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,979
HEART ATTACK

761
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,784
I changed the cause of death.

762
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,817
Why do you keep cutting in?

763
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,411
Gosh.

764
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,043
-Who's there?
-What?

765
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,923
What's wrong? Is it broken?

766
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,508
Oh, no.

767
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,427
Gosh.

768
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,312
Be quiet.

769
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,742
<i>Yeo-rin,</i>
<i>the first floor elevator is broken.</i>

770
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,655
<i>Restrict customers from using it.</i>

771
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,833
Yes, sir.

772
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,668
Gosh.

773
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,046
It used to work fine.

774
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,264
What's wrong with this?

775
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:29,314
My stomach feels bloated.
Was the food too salty?

776
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,901
Did I eat too much sodium yesterday?

777
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,817
Stop it already.

778
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,872
This time I'll blow you away at one go.

779
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,918
Wait!

780
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:23,829
Here.

781
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,910
The good deed.

782
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,945
Goodness. My back.

783
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,879
Goodness, I'm tired.

784
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,591
Jeom-rye.

785
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,559
Jeom-rye.

786
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,687
-Goodness.
-Does it hurt a lot?

787
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,939
It comes with the old age, you know.

788
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:40,244
But life is good because I have Jin-dong.

789
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,357
Yes.

790
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,237
That's good to hear.

791
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,203
You should take care of yourself.

792
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,541
Did you eat?

793
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,995
I'll make you some noodles.

794
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,579
It's okay. I already ate.

795
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,291
Goodness.

796
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,134
Thank you, Jeom-rye.

797
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,758
Thanks to you, I lived a fruitful

798
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:06,091
and worthwhile life.

799
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,715
Let's not talk about the old days.
You're making me blush.

800
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:18,523
I'm sleepy because I cleaned the fridge
this afternoon.

801
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,820
-Goodness. Come here.
-Gosh.

802
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:22,940
Goodness.

803
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,656
Everything will be fine, Jeom-rye.

804
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,789
Until you come,

805
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,919
live healthy and well.

806
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,194
Wasn't that the panacea?

807
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,635
It's hard to get.

808
00:55:56,728 --> 00:56:00,398
Yes, I bought it with the lottery numbers.

809
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,444
Because I heard Jeom-rye has a bad back.

810
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,067
-You did a good thing.
-Isn't it interesting

811
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,868
how we can help each other like this

812
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,209
thanks to our relationship
from the Living Realm?

813
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:16,827
You're right.

814
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:22,795
So everyone needs to get a hold
of themselves and live a good life.

815
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,053
Saying something nice to someone

816
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:30,552
and sincerely helping someone
all come back like this.

817
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,511
That's right.

818
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,225
That's the way to live.

819
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,986
Grandma, I'm home.

820
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,330
Goodness, I dozed off.

821
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,501
Gosh.

822
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,157
Grandma, I'm hungry.

823
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,877
I'll get you something to eat,
my sweet pumpkin.

824
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,799
LOTTERY WINNING NUMBERS

825
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,009
Darn, no match.

826
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,218
I thought my ancestors would help me.

827
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,014
I thought so, too.

828
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,562
Why did they come
and make you get your hopes up?

829
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:20,101
Grandma, leave it there. Let me do it.

830
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,225
Wait a minute.

831
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,530
-Well...
-My back doesn't hurt.

832
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,985
What? Wait.

833
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:32,661
-It doesn't hurt? Really?
-Really. Wait.

834
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,787
What?

835
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,699
It doesn't hurt.

836
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,786
-You can do this?
-Yes.

837
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:38,711
Wait. Really?

838
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,418
-Yes. It doesn't hurt at all.
-How can this happen?

839
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,629
This is strange. It's really weird.

840
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,170
The ancestor must've fixed my back
instead of letting us win the lottery.

841
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,165
That's even better!

842
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,182
Gosh.

843
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,985
Hey.

844
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,357
Are you having fun?
You should peel the onions.

845
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:16,659
I've finished.

846
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:23,368
My goodness.
You have to peel the garlic, too.

847
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,538
They're done too.

848
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,257
-What about the potatoes?
-Of course.

849
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:33,375
I see. Then,

850
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,264
remove the poop from anchovies.

851
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,522
Hey, isn't this too much?

852
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,900
I used to be a chief detective
at the Afterlife Police Agency.

853
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,899
I shouldn't be doing this.

854
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,401
But you aren't the chief now.

855
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,704
If I hadn't been transferred here,

856
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,949
I would've been the chief of police.

857
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,775
-You can complain then.
-What?

858
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,746
You can complain
when you're the chief of police.

859
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:03,786
Okay.

860
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,384
I'll remove the poop.

861
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,000
<i>If you say so, I'll have to do it</i>

862
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,382
There are so many. Gosh.

863
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,757
<i>What have I done to deserve this?</i>

864
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:22,679
<i>Remove the poop</i>

865
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,727
<i>Love, love, love</i>

866
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,021
<i>It's poop of love</i>

867
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,977
Ms. Weol-ju.

868
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,778
I finished sweeping outside.

869
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,951
-Hey. What's wrong with him?
-What?

870
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,830
-Kang-bae.
-Kang-bae. Get up. Sit here.

871
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,698
-I'm okay.
-Are you okay?

872
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,995
Wait. His body is burning up.

873
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,500
He must've worked too hard.

874
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,212
-What should we do?
-Okay.

875
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,126
I'll take him home.

876
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:53,383
You clean up.

877
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,924
-What?
-Come here. Let's go.

878
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,388
Hey. Can you take him alone?

879
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,179
-Bye.
-Okay.

880
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,432
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

881
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,433
Okay.

882
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,931
Call me if anything happens.

883
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,765
Kang-bae.

884
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:10,864
Hey.

885
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,693
Is the part-timer sick?
Where are they going?

886
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,107
Yes, I think he's sick
because he's overworked.

887
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,871
No wonder he has no energy.

888
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,035
A living person crossed

889
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,210
the River of Oblivion to the Afterlife
and came back.

890
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,751
He's really unusual, isn't he?

891
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,920
Anyway, Choi Seok-pan says thanks.

892
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,222
Kim Du-yeong was sentenced accordingly.

893
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,629
I see.

894
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:43,643
By the way, how did you end up
removing anchovy poop?

895
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,272
Say no more. I've heard enough.

896
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,689
Gosh, you used to be
a detective squad chief

897
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,234
catching evil spirits.

898
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,817
Well, this is fun, too.

899
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,614
-Would you like to try?
-No.

900
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,623
By the way,

901
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:05,409
the police chief mentioned
about your reinstatement.

902
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,249
Later. It's too soon.

903
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:16,919
Come on.

904
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,007
Well, talk of the devil.

905
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,679
Hello? Yes, Chief.

906
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,180
Where?

907
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,309
Okay. I'll be there, sir.

908
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:36,859
Hey, there's an evil spirit in the area.

909
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,357
-Let's go.
-Me?

910
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,406
Having wrestled Weol-ju at this age

911
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,042
really wore me out.

912
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,412
Think of it as being respectful
to your elders and come with me.

913
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:47,489
Gosh, my back.

914
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,474
He'll have to eat something
to take medicine.

915
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,766
Gosh, what a pain in the neck.

916
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,275
Don't go.

917
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:17,259
I could not save you after all.

918
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,361
<i>If there is a next life,</i>

919
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,410
<i>I will be sure to find you.</i>

920
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:38,291
<i>Then,</i>

921
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:43,749
<i>even if I have to sacrifice my soul,</i>
<i>I will protect you.</i>

922
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,554
SPECIAL THANKS TO JUNG EUN-PYO,
WOO HYUN, KIM MI-KYUNG, AND LEE JU-SHIL

923
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,861
Yeo-rin, you're special to me.

924
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,949
I want to be the person you need.

925
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,582
It's difficult to be in love.

926
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,833
<i>There was a man I loved.</i>

927
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:24,825
<i>-You're dating, aren't you?</i>
<i>-</i>That's just outrageous!

928
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,535
I think he likes you.

929
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,879
<i>You must be crazy.</i>

930
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,376
<i>Do your thing.</i>

931
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,803
<i>I forgot to give you this.</i>
<i>There's something on you.</i>

932
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,632
<i>Are you sure it's working?</i>

933
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,387
<i>Have you been well, Your Majesty?</i>

934
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,260
<i>I understand why you're doing this.</i>

935
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,266
Get out of his body.

936
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:42,768
-<i>I've died</i>
-Get out of the way!

937
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,980
<i>for someone I cared about,</i>
<i>someone I loved.</i>

938
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:47,858
