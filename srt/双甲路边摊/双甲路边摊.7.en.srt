1
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,467
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,966
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,621
Ms. Weol-ju!

4
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,498
Guibanjang!

5
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,312
Yeomradaewang,
of course my actions were unwarranted.

6
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,606
I admit to that.

7
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:51,185
But isn't it normal for everyone
to hit a few bumps at work?

8
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,204
A few bumps?

9
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,164
Just because I've been nice to you,

10
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:02,913
it doesn't mean
you can flout the rules of our realm.

11
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,973
Am I a joke to you?

12
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,192
Of course not.

13
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,688
I won't retrieve the child
that was already given to the parents.

14
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,356
-Thank you, ma'am!
-However,

15
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,742
the case will not be counted
towards your quota.

16
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,203
-Sorry?
-Yes, ma'am!

17
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:40,871
Of course.

18
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,496
It's only fair since we bent the rules.

19
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,792
Weol-ju and Guibanjang, you are sentenced

20
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,585
to 120 hours of community service
in the Afterlife.

21
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,964
The bar will be confiscated until then.

22
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,174
Hold on.

23
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,014
My deadline is drawing near.

24
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,513
A flogging
or days at the Hell of Oil Cauldrons

25
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,886
will be short but more effective.

26
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,097
I've been meaning to tell you,

27
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,479
but you seem to think that you're here
as a customer at some ice cream store.

28
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,443
Here you are picking out
your own punishment.

29
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,823
Why don't I introduce you
to the 31 different options we have?

30
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,284
No, of course not.

31
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,826
That's not necessary, ma'am.
She's just in a bit of a shock

32
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,661
and that led to a slip of the tongue.

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,500
She'll serve the hours.

34
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,455
Right?

35
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,304
Byun Tae-sik.

36
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,549
You fed poison to people for decades.

37
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,548
What poison?

38
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,557
All I did was sell a little junk food
here and there.

39
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,391
You waxed the surface of fruits
to give them a shine

40
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,147
and added tar dye to sweets

41
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,860
in order to color them.

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,570
If that isn't poison, what is?

43
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,240
So for that reason,

44
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,818
you are rated
to a reincarnation grade of C.

45
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,066
What's Grade C?

46
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,117
Grade A is human. Grade B is an animal.

47
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,911
Grade C is an insect.

48
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,044
An insect? Are you calling me an insect?

49
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,077
Are you people nuts?

50
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,705
There's no insect this big!

51
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,131
How dare you raise your voice
in front of the committee members.

52
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,261
-Attention. Just stand there.
-Yes, sir.

53
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,762
As someone in the food industry,
I can't condone what he did.

54
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,637
He should be made to eat dung
for the rest of his life.

55
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,976
Well, that sounds reasonable.

56
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,351
Bingo.

57
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,728
Byun Tae-sik,
you will become a dung beetle.

58
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,986
We have here such brave
and courageous firefighters.

59
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,655
You ran into a burning department store

60
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,952
and brought 300 people to safety.

61
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:51,212
Please let me express
my sincerest respect for you.

62
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,671
Grade A. There's no doubt about it.

63
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,550
Just let us know
what you'd like to be reborn as.

64
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,255
Your wish is our command.

65
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,137
We're grateful for the offer,

66
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,386
but all we wish to be
is a pleasantly cool breeze.

67
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,563
We want to become
a cool breeze that wipes away

68
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,728
the sweat off hard-working people.

69
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,190
You deserve to enjoy
what life has to offer.

70
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,824
-Being a breeze won't cut it.
-She's right.

71
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:23,031
Since you seven already have
impeccable teamwork...

72
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,365
How about they take the world by storm?

73
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,328
By storm?

74
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,998
How about you are reincarnated

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,920
as a seven-member boy band?

76
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,879
The Breeze-like Souls.

77
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,549
BLS for short. What do you say?

78
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,844
Sounds good.

79
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:45,966
The seven firefighters
will be reborn as BLS,

80
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,684
the seven-member boy band.

81
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,060
SHOWER OF OBLIVION

82
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,181
This way, please.

83
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,396
You'll go in one by one
starting with Byun Tae-sik.

84
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,574
Will my memories be washed away
once I step in the shower?

85
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,080
Why do you ask? Are you scared?

86
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,869
Yes, a little.

87
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,334
Don't be.

88
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,581
In a few seconds,
you'll even forget that you were scared.

89
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,917
Step inside. We don't have all day.

90
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,949
-Are you still scared?
-Sorry?

91
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,576
I don't quite follow.

92
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,043
Next!

93
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,710
I find myself missing Kang-bae.

94
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,878
We'd always wash the dishes together.

95
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,506
I wonder how he's doing.

96
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,846
He'd better not be crying his eyes out
because he misses us.

97
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,852
I'm sure he's busy
rehearsing for the dance competition.

98
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,395
We won't even be on his mind.

99
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,650
We need to hurry back
to the Living Realm though.

100
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,823
It's been three days, so 27 hours.

101
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,031
When will we complete 120 hours?

102
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,032
When we get back, we'll only have
a few days to complete your task.

103
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,703
-This is bad.
-Here.

104
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,004
Not for you though.

105
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,248
Even if I fail to settle 100,000 grudges,

106
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,331
you can go back to the Afterlife Police.

107
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,998
Meanwhile, I'll go straight to Hell.

108
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:47,553
Still, you were able
to settle 99,995 grudges so far.

109
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,006
Won't that reduce your final sentence?

110
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:53,642
I mean,

111
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,850
you could beg for a Grade C reincarnation.

112
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,686
I am a bit jealous of those being reborn.

113
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,899
They get to live a new life
while forgetting the past.

114
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,822
Meanwhile, I've been living for 500 years

115
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,195
feeling the pain of my actions.

116
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,200
If I could, I'd step
into the Shower of Oblivion myself.

117
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,373
Was your past that painful?

118
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,963
Painful enough to want a fresh start?

119
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,843
Yes, I want to forget about it all.

120
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,256
It wasn't a happy life.

121
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,102
I see.

122
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,734
Everything though?

123
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,608
Wasn't there a single thing
you enjoyed in your previous life?

124
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,317
No, not even one.

125
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,529
Wait, that's not true.

126
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,703
I had my mom.

127
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,123
-Your mom?
-Yes.

128
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,750
I wouldn't have survived
the past 500 years

129
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,830
if it weren't for my memories of her.

130
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,957
I was happy being my mom's daughter.

131
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,422
I wonder if she was happy too.

132
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,469
Having a child like me
would've probably been rough.

133
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,431
No way. I doubt it.

134
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,688
I'm sure your mother enjoyed her life
thanks to you too.

135
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,730
How would you know?

136
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,653
Let's just say I do.

137
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,951
My mom hasn't seen me for 500 years.

138
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,407
She won't even remember my face.

139
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,662
You never know.

140
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:43,251
She could be watching you
without you knowing.

141
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,707
As if.

142
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,840
Can you clean up here?
I'll dust the library.

143
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,281
REINCARNATION RECORDS OF THE 1800'S

144
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,741
Are these the list of the reincarnated?

145
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,702
There's a lot.

146
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,544
Gosh, it's dusty.

147
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,208
I knew Princess Pyeong-gang would do good.

148
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,464
She even transformed her dense husband

149
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,506
and now she's a successful lecturer.

150
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,386
After making all those delicious meals,
Lady U-reong became

151
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,517
the proud owner of a restaurant.

152
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,556
They all keep doing what they're good at.

153
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:48,942
<i>You never know.</i>

154
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:54,195
She could be watching you
without you knowing.

155
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,907
REINCARNATION RECORDS

156
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,496
All these files are for the surname Kim?

157
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,424
When will I go through them all?

158
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,959
These seriously need to be digitized.

159
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,612
REINCARNATION RECORDS
OF THE JOSEON ROYAL FAMILY

160
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,183
KING SUNJONG

161
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:08,023
PRINCE JEONGAN YI HON

162
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,591
You can trust me.

163
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,259
I will protect you no matter what.

164
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,597
Weol-ju.

165
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,848
-Yes?
-Yeomradaewang is asking for us.

166
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,310
Got it. I'll be right out.

167
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,647
Sure, let's hurry.

168
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,656
HAVE A GOOD DAY!
KAPEUL MART

169
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,457
Out with it.

170
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,474
You've been spacing out all day.

171
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,143
I'm worried about someone.

172
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,854
Look at you.

173
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,144
You're head over heels for her.

174
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,311
Still, you'll be meeting her
for dance practice shortly.

175
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,556
What? What do you mean...

176
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,399
-Who are you talking about?
-Isn't it obvious?

177
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,824
The one walking over here.

178
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,413
You're off now, right?

179
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,953
We need to talk.

180
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,379
Mr. Kang.
Why did you miss practice yesterday?

181
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,713
You didn't even answer my calls.

182
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,755
Sorry about that.
I went someplace to check on something.

183
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,217
Why are you being so vague?

184
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,641
What did you check and where did you go?

185
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,141
I'm sorry.
My head's just not in the right place.

186
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,845
Okay, fine. I apologize.

187
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,404
I read your message,

188
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,440
but I fell asleep
before I could answer it.

189
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,444
I thought about replying after I woke up.

190
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,028
What?

191
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,117
That's right.
You ghosted me the other day.

192
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,575
-It's not like I ghosted you but...
-I had forgotten about that.

193
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,036
What?

194
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,665
Then why...

195
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:40,875
Well,

196
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:45,182
I can't make it to practice
because of my duties with the CIA.

197
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,969
I'm sorry but I need to go.

198
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,262
-I'm sorry.
-But...

199
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,605
It's been three days already.

200
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,373
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

201
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,774
Yes! He did it!

202
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,306
Now, face me directly.

203
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,393
-Lift your arms.
-Up!

204
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,611
Good job.

205
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,206
<i>Ms. Weol-ju, Guibanjang,</i>
<i>I hope you're both all right.</i>

206
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,497
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

207
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,875
<i>Come into my dream and let me know.</i>

208
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,799
<i>I'll be waiting for you tonight as well.</i>

209
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,388
He seems to be a natural
at playing hard to get.

210
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,515
He's a player if you ask me.

211
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,981
He doesn't look like it.

212
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,688
He asked you out to the movies first

213
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,986
and then texted you when you got home.

214
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,820
But now he says
that he forgot about it all?

215
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:34,696
Only a player would light a match
and let it burn.

216
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,745
He didn't light anything, okay?
I'm not some dry wood.

217
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,790
Of course you are.
You're parched right down to the core.

218
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,714
Even at that age, you haven't even
properly dated or kissed a guy.

219
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,045
You're dryer than the Sahara Desert.

220
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,434
Well, it's not my fault, you know.

221
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,393
When I start to like someone,
he runs away.

222
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,509
What can I do?

223
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,807
Then do it before you develop feelings.

224
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,313
-Do what?
-Plant one on him.

225
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,105
A kiss.
Do it before you start to like him.

226
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,902
That's your conclusion?

227
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:09,152
Or else you're going to end up
dying a virgin.

228
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,526
By the looks of it,
you'll fall hard for this guy soon,

229
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,031
which means it'll be over.

230
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,655
Unbelievable.

231
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,040
Me and Han Kang-bae?

232
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,002
So do it before you start to like him.

233
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,961
Just kiss him.

234
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,837
Cut the crap, will you?

235
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,967
Look at all these different treats.

236
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,184
What's the occasion, ma'am?

237
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,176
Community service has been tough, right?

238
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,438
I thought you'd appreciate
a little sugary pick-me-up.

239
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,439
I smell something.

240
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,650
What do you mean?
They're fresh from the store.

241
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,699
It smells like bribes and favors.

242
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,660
Aren't I right?

243
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,531
No, of course not.

244
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,117
You see, I have a little…

245
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,785
...vor to ask.

246
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,379
A "vor"?

247
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,539
A favor.

248
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,054
A favor.

249
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,418
You need a favor from us?

250
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,506
Well,

251
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,508
I made some kind of mistake.

252
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,724
I knew it. Now we're talking.

253
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,347
You see...

254
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,060
Damn it.

255
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,279
AVICI HELL, HELL OF OIL CAULDRONS

256
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,703
Are things good here?

257
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,621
-Yes!
-Yes!

258
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,117
Right. Carry on then.

259
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,757
<i>Yeomradaewang,</i>
<i>is this the best you can do?</i>

260
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,143
<i>The evil spirit that escaped</i>
<i>should have been caught by now.</i>

261
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,718
My apologies, sir.

262
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,005
I'll get right on it.

263
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,265
<i>I'm sick of hearing that again and again.</i>

264
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,983
<i>I should strip you of your rank.</i>

265
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:14,989
My gosh.

266
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,660
<i>No, sir. I'll do my best.</i>

267
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,414
Shouldn't he know that managing Hell
isn't a walk in the park?

268
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,365
If I could, I'd just...

269
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,754
My gosh!

270
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,089
<i>I heard that the emperor</i>
<i>almost bit your head off.</i>

271
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,176
At least I have Samsin who understands me.

272
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,178
Yes.

273
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,604
HE'S DRIVING ME NUTS

274
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,102
THAT TEMPERAMENTAL JERK

275
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,024
No!

276
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,767
Did it break?

277
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,314
-You little...
-I'm sorry.

278
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,517
I should've looked where I was going.

279
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:57,067
Right. Well, it happens sometimes.

280
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,738
It's all right. You can go.

281
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,238
It's fine.

282
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,208
That bastard emperor...

283
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,377
THAT BASTARD EMPEROR

284
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,547
<i>What is this?</i>

285
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,795
What? Why's she asking me that?

286
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,015
THE JADE EMPEROR

287
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,595
You crazy bitch. What have you done?

288
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,071
Why did I send it to him instead?

289
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,568
He really might fire me at this rate.
Gosh.

290
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,201
Hold on a second. Just relax.

291
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,029
Calm down and ease your mind.

292
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:43,991
Okay.

293
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,247
"Sir, I was... I must've lost my mind..."

294
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,287
What? It's out of battery?

295
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,088
Hey!

296
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,092
You've got to be kidding me.

297
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,134
Hello? Is anybody here?

298
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,176
What the hell? He's doing his rounds?

299
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,005
What's with all the cords?

300
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,487
SHOWER OF OBLIVION

301
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,280
Am I just supposed to stand here?

302
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,790
Are we done or what?

303
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,291
Are you done?
Sorry, I had to use the restroom.

304
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,629
-Yes, I think it's done.
-Then come this way.

305
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,808
So he went back to the Living Realm
without having his memories erased,

306
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,350
but he disappeared on the way.

307
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:55,024
Could you perhaps
locate this spirit for me?

308
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,692
Shouldn't you put in a formal request
at the police agency...

309
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,735
Are you insane?
They're busy because of that evil spirit.

310
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,993
If word gets out, I'll be fired...

311
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm saying that this issue
must be handled discreetly.

312
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,918
-For what price?
-What? A price?

313
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,258
Don't play dumb with me.

314
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,625
I've been making deals
for the last 500 years.

315
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:33,137
Hold on.
Is this why you had my bar suspended?

316
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,734
I see. Is that it?

317
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,863
No. I'm not that kind of person.

318
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,200
It's a huge coincidence, that's all.

319
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,108
In order to cover up a mistake,

320
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,157
a high-ranking executive abused her powers

321
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,700
and purposely summoned
Afterlife employees.

322
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,365
I won't turn a blind eye to this.

323
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,293
I'll inform the Jade Emperor immediately.

324
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,918
Hold on. Let's sit back down and talk.

325
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,882
There you go. Let's talk. All right.

326
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,674
I'll let you reopen the bar.

327
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,011
And no more community service.

328
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,018
You have the Jade Emperor's number, right?

329
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,644
-Hand me your phone.
-Sure.

330
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,517
Wait. Hold on.
And I'll count this towards your quota.

331
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,185
-Deal?
-Deal.

332
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,244
In addition,
extend my deadline by ten days.

333
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,493
-Ten days?
-Take it or leave it.

334
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,867
Okay, deal. Sounds good to me.

335
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,254
Who is this guy?

336
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,424
-I'm out.
<i>-Subject, Jang Bok-su.</i>

337
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,253
-<i>His goal in life was to hit the jackpot.</i>
-No way!

338
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,206
<i>To feed his gambling habit,</i>
<i>he stole from family and friends.</i>

339
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,297
You traitor.

340
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,220
He died in a car accident
while running away from loan-sharks.

341
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,891
He's a lowlife thug. How about Grade B?

342
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,772
It's more than what he deserves.

343
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,772
-Grade C...
-C?

344
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,147
Are you kidding me?

345
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,895
I never assaulted or killed anyone.

346
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,237
Grade C for stealing chump change?

347
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,072
Why is this so heavy?

348
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,865
Okay, fine. I'll calm down.

349
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:21,079
I was going to pay them back.

350
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,338
Just one win.

351
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,882
Then I would have been able
to pay them all back and then some.

352
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,934
See? He still doesn't know
what he did wrong.

353
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,219
Grade C seems fitting.

354
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,722
Guys, let's not get worked up over this.

355
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,064
Let's discuss this.

356
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,639
Hey.

357
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,363
HEAD OF COMMITTEE

358
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,105
So we've decided.

359
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,527
The committee has come to a decision.

360
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,744
Subject Jang Bok-su

361
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,954
caused financial damage to others

362
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,999
and brought suffering upon them.

363
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,621
For that reason,

364
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,957
you are ordered to bring joy and happiness
to others in your next life.

365
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,959
Grade B. You will be reborn as a chicken.

366
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,304
The chicken we eat?

367
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,101
What?

368
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,364
Am I supposed to be that egg?

369
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,333
And they're my new family?

370
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,199
You crazy bastards!

371
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,787
What if they fry me for dinner tonight?

372
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,144
I could've turned my life around
if it weren't for that bastard.

373
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,680
Do it. My life is already ruined anyway.

374
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,239
My gosh, look at this.

375
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,334
You laid a beautiful egg today as always.

376
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,832
Well done.

377
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,510
What's wrong with this geezer? Hey.

378
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,470
Is he dead?

379
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,020
He's breathing. Did he pass out?

380
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,268
Being an old man is better
than being a fried egg.

381
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,146
Right?

382
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,382
Jeez.

383
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,934
I could've gone to pick up the egg.

384
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,045
-But where's the egg?
-What?

385
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,388
There wasn't any egg yet.
I didn't see one.

386
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,596
-Really?
-Yes.

387
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,515
That's odd.

388
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,766
Mr. Chairman, your meal is ready now.

389
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,437
"Chairman"?

390
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,649
Me?

391
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,381
It's back.

392
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,934
We're not open yet. Come back at night.

393
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:08,901
Okay.

394
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,412
My gosh, damn it. I already lost my spot.

395
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,332
What?

396
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,042
People just seem to know
where all the good spots are.

397
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,092
Ms. Weol-ju! Guibanjang!

398
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,875
-Hey.
-Hey.

399
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:42,054
What took you so long?

400
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,181
My. Were you worried?

401
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,388
Of course!

402
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,138
I thought you were taken
to the fiery pits of Hell

403
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,307
and had your body torn to pieces,

404
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,226
-or deep-fried in burning oil...
-Hey!

405
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,733
What on earth are you on about?

406
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,277
She has a point. Deep-fried in oil?

407
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,031
We haven't sinned that much.

408
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,948
Actually, you're the one
who seems distressed.

409
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,078
I couldn't get any sleep worrying

410
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,003
that I might never see you again.

411
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,998
My. I see. You couldn't sleep at all.

412
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,380
You shouldn't have skipped meals.

413
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,917
You have nothing to show for
than your build.

414
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,126
What will you do
with those sunken cheeks now?

415
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,836
I should feed you some meat.

416
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,350
Anyway, everything falls apart
when I'm not here.

417
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,975
How exhausting.

418
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,444
You're back for good?
They won't take you away again, right?

419
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,441
Well, we'll have to see
if we're back for good or not.

420
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,148
What is it?
Tell me what it is. I'll do anything.

421
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,657
This is the house.

422
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,998
The egg the fugitive was assigned to
is here.

423
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,289
The owner raises chickens?

424
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,877
He seems to be quite an environmentalist.

425
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,304
If we fail,
we'll have to go back to volunteer work.

426
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,853
Then, I won't be able
to settle 100,000 grudges.

427
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,349
So you're saying that we have to find
a lead from this house, right?

428
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,016
Exactly.

429
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,106
What? He's the chairman
of the supermarket I work at.

430
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,323
Really?

431
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,370
-Hey.
-What?

432
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,541
Transform into him.

433
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,457
-Hold on.
-Hey. Be quiet. You're draining my energy.

434
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,751
Are you guys busy?

435
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,747
Can I ask you just one question?

436
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,428
They must be feeling down today.
They won't talk.

437
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,852
-You should give it a try.
-Me?

438
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,766
I'm not sure
if my ability will work on chickens.

439
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,980
Try it anyway. We got nothing to lose.

440
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,560
-Hurry. Do it before someone comes.
-Okay.

441
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,112
I can do it.

442
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,571
I can do it.

443
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,447
I did it.

444
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,157
There you go.

445
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:09,892
What?

446
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,177
He went inside the body of the chairman?

447
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:20,266
Yes. The hen definitely saw it.

448
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,073
Then, what happened to the chairman?
Is he dead?

449
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,323
No. His body is just possessed.

450
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,203
He must be locked
inside his own subconscious.

451
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,369
If it were up to me,
I would've beaten the spirit out of him.

452
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,279
I wonder if he'll even listen to us.

453
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,078
For now, let's approach the chairman
when he's alone.

454
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:39,042
STORE ENTRANCE

455
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:43,884
Follow him.

456
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,564
Sir, these are the documents
for our foreign branch that you asked for.

457
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,353
What? Okay.

458
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,534
Okay. I'll read this later.

459
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,316
Yes, sir.

460
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,701
<i>Gosh, being a chairman is exhausting.</i>

461
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,672
<i>What? That's...</i>

462
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,972
Hey. Don't be like that.
Please lend me some money.

463
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,144
It's urgent this time. I'm serious.

464
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,142
For what?
So you can gamble away the money again?

465
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,057
No, I won't!

466
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,230
Cheol-gu will really kill me
if I don't pay him back by today.

467
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,147
Hey.

468
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,494
How long are you going to keep this up?

469
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,657
You're borrowing money to gamble

470
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,872
or running away from someone you owe.

471
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,582
Is this how you'll live?

472
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,746
I thought we were friends.

473
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,590
-You're the only one I can rely on.
-Exactly!

474
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,836
Damn it.

475
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,550
I'll cover for you this time with...

476
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,273
Yes?

477
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,099
No.

478
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,982
What? You're here?

479
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,531
Hey, Jang Bok-su.

480
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,778
You're some friend!

481
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,156
Traitor.

482
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,250
No. Hey, Bok-su!

483
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,082
-Hey!
-That bastard.

484
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,925
<i>Right. I died because of you.</i>

485
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,096
<i>That traitor.</i>

486
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,641
<i>I'll make you pay for what you did.</i>

487
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,188
Stop the car over there.

488
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,108
-Damn it.
-What are you doing?

489
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,442
-You're pissing me off!
-Break it.

490
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,396
-Don't do anything.
-Stop it!

491
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,948
-I'm going to crush you!
-No!

492
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,701
-Stop it!
-Get out of my way.

493
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,623
-Move.
-No!

494
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,701
-Don't move.
-Gosh.

495
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,657
- Pay back what you owe!
- My.

496
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,955
Pay us back.

497
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:29,957
Damn it.

498
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,375
Good job.

499
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,668
Thank you.

500
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,340
By the way, how did you know about me?

501
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,724
What?

502
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,010
Is it an honor?

503
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:39,965
Of course.

504
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,350
I look forward to working with you.

505
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,151
-Lower.
-Pardon?

506
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,067
-Lower your head more.
-Yes, sir.

507
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,702
-Where did he go?
-There you go.

508
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,700
-He's over there.
-This is how you'll greet me from now on.

509
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,288
You moron.

510
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,958
Bye, sir. You have my respect.

511
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,843
Should I step in?

512
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,382
Hold on.
I think something is going on there.

513
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:25,515
Given the circumstance,
he might cause more trouble.

514
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,312
Right. He has money and power.

515
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,694
Since it's his second shot at life,
he'll go nuts.

516
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,321
I feel bad for the fruit vendor.

517
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,534
The chairman used to be a nice man.

518
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,240
He'll become a criminal at this rate.
Just today alone…

519
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,945
I bet he's dying
to get out of his subconscious.

520
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,082
Unless he's spiritually gifted,

521
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,161
he can't break free of the possession.

522
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,670
We must stop him
before it gets out of hand.

523
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,957
We have to make him drink <i>ssanggapju.</i>

524
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,337
-Maybe set up shop in front of his house?
-We haven't gotten the bar back yet.

525
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,427
The bar is still suspended
until we solve this case.

526
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,314
You have to go, right?

527
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,932
Yes. Tomorrow is the dance competition,
so we have a rehearsal.

528
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,602
Let's try again.

529
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,056
Stand behind me.

530
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,396
-Okay.
-This one.

531
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,529
Just pretend to be good.

532
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,819
All right, everyone.

533
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:22,204
The chairman came by to cheer you on
for tomorrow's competition.

534
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,661
Hello, sir.

535
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,701
Everyone is working so hard.
You guys look great.

536
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,043
He's brought snacks for you here.
Please enjoy them.

537
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,500
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

538
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,455
-Thank you.
-Mr. Chairman!

539
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,673
-<i>What do I do? This might be my chance.</i>
-Mr. Chairman!

540
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:39,916
<i>Should I touch him?</i>

541
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,337
-Sir.
-Yes?

542
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,675
-What kind of wish will we get this year?
-A wish?

543
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,812
Last year,
we all had fried chicken together.

544
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:49,849
Two years ago,
you sent the employees' parents on a trip.

545
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,309
Well, to be honest,
everyone is looking forward to

546
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,016
making a wish
more than winning the cash prize.

547
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,154
That's right.
We ought to do the same this year.

548
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,866
-Get back to your practice.
-Okay.

549
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,703
Here. Try some.

550
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,791
My gosh. Look at this.

551
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,091
This is good. It's nice.

552
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,169
They gave you snacks for dance practice.

553
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,012
So, he is going to make your wish
come true?

554
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:25,295
-Yes.
-So, what's your plan?

555
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,272
It's simple. I'll win first place
at the dance competition tomorrow.

556
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,768
And for my wish, I'll ask for a drink
alone with the chairman,

557
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,062
and bring him to my house. How about that?

558
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,568
That's a good idea.

559
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,897
I agree.
Then, go back and practice some more.

560
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,406
Right? Okay. I can do this!

561
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,318
You can do it.

562
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,870
Let me take one. Just one.

563
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,950
Win first place.

564
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,869
That would be great.

565
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,663
It sounds pretty simple enough,
but will that work?

566
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,495
We'll make it work.

567
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,177
Let's take a break.
You'll pass out before the competition.

568
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,676
No. I don't have time to rest
if I'm going to win first place.

569
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,017
Why are you working so hard
all of a sudden?

570
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,024
Is it because of me?

571
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:19,936
What?

572
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,362
It's nothing.

573
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,900
<i>Damn it. What's wrong with me?</i>

574
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,857
<i>I sound like I'm self-obsessed.</i>

575
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,951
<i>This is totally humiliating.</i>

576
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,953
I really want to win first place, too,

577
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,540
for someone who's special to me.

578
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,122
<i>He's talking about me, right? No?</i>

579
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,668
<i>Gosh, it's confusing.</i>

580
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,625
<i>Is he playing hard-to-get?</i>

581
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,589
I think I memorized all the moves.
Should we try together?

582
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:46,755
Sure.

583
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,742
<i>Just kiss him</i>
<i>before you develop feelings for him.</i>

584
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,280
<i>Kiss him.</i>

585
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,129
Yeo-rin, I didn't mess up
at all this time.

586
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,545
No, you didn't. You did well.

587
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,595
I guided all of today's deceased
to the Afterlife.

588
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,062
Okay. Good job.

589
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,732
This is awful.
Since the pop-up bar is gone,

590
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,693
we now have to pay for our meals.

591
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,239
Why did Weol-ju have to break the law?

592
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,698
-Don't break the law.
-Okay.

593
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,409
Sir, did you check the profile
of the fugitive spirit I sent you?

594
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,619
I forgot about that.

595
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,541
Gosh. I have so much work
that I keep forgetting things.

596
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,870
He's not to be taken lightly.

597
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,746
He vanishes into thin air.

598
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,293
The officials are having
a hard time locating him.

599
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,748
-This is him.
-Okay.

600
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,513
EVIL SPIRIT PROFILE

601
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,517
KIM WON-HYUNG,
DIED ON NOVEMBER 30, 1520

602
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,981
Raise it way higher.

603
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,855
-Move it to the right.
-Higher.

604
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,402
-That way.
-Okay.

605
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,410
We'll start soon. Please hurry.

606
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,489
Okay.

607
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,628
Is this absolutely necessary?

608
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,670
Well, but then again,

609
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,667
I have no choice but to do this
for the greater good.

610
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,866
Ms. Kim!

611
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,908
Why don't you drink this
while you practice?

612
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,872
You didn't have to.

613
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,460
Right. Mr. Jang.

614
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,417
Did you memorize everything?
Let me see.

615
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,507
What?

616
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,641
You messed it up yesterday. Show me.

617
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,641
Why don't we do that after you drink?

618
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,391
This isn't important.
I'll drink after I check. Hurry.

619
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,314
Show me.

620
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:42,982
Wait. Gosh.

621
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,479
-Left, right.
-Right. Hold on.

622
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,775
-Let's practice after you drink it.
-Forget about the drink.

623
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,899
Do you know how much the cash prize is?
Let's try again. Start.

624
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,028
All right.

625
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,204
Left, right, right, left. Left, right.

626
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,453
There you go. Yes.

627
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,294
KAPEUL MART COUPLES DANCE COMPETITION

628
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:11,588
If it isn't working, you make it work.

629
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,679
FISH SAUCE

630
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,105
Left, right, right, left. Left, right.

631
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:32,989
-Ms. Kim, I can't do it anymore.
-No. Let's try again.

632
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,648
No, try again. One, two, three, four.

633
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,358
Left, right, right, left.

634
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,118
I can't do this anymore! My goodness.

635
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,580
My gosh. Come on.

636
00:43:56,842 --> 00:44:01,722
We will now begin
the Kapeul Mart Couples Dance Competition.

637
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,192
There you go!

638
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:57,187
Where did Guibanjang go?

639
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,950
Damn it.

640
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,823
What? She seems perfectly fine.

641
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,243
What the heck did he do?

642
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,778
Seriously?

643
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,576
Both of them are so good.

644
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,002
What is it?

645
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,503
They are too good.

646
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,466
I don't think we can win first place.

647
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:01,879
Should I give up?

648
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,267
Life is all about mentality.

649
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,478
If you're scared, you'll achieve nothing.

650
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,685
All we have to do is
just give it our best shot.

651
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,110
-We can do it.
-We can do it.

652
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,120
-Looking sexy!
-My gosh.

653
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,370
Nice!

654
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:14,582
You're doing great!

655
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,439
LET'S GO YEO-RIN

656
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,287
Did something happen to him?

657
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,761
I didn't know
medicine these days is so strong.

658
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,312
Damn it.

659
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,309
No. Wait.

660
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,983
The winning couple of the competition...

661
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,154
-Are you curious?
-Yes.

662
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,152
Right. I'm curious as well.

663
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:31,739
The winning couple is...

664
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,041
Congratulations.
It's Han Kang-bae and Kang Yeo-rin!

665
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,866
-Yeo-rin!
-Kang-bae!

666
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,001
We did it!

667
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,715
All right.
The chairman will now present the prize.

668
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,548
Winners, calm down and come forward.

669
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,559
Congratulations.

670
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,767
Thank you.

671
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,028
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

672
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,160
Congratulations to both of you.

673
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,368
WINNING PRIZE

674
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,583
The dance competition
comes with a tradition.

675
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:19,291
It's time for the chairman
to make your wish come true.

676
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,383
Ms. Kang, please share yours.

677
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,673
Okay.

678
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:27,342
I was hired as a contract worker.

679
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,507
I'd like to work here until the day I die!

680
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,683
You can't be here until the day you die.
But I like your attitude.

681
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,391
A permanent position?

682
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,440
You know what? You got it.

683
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,534
All right. Mr. Han, what is yours?

684
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,025
I would like

685
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,622
to have a drink with you, sir.

686
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,736
Could I invite you to my home?

687
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,736
A drink?

688
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,871
That's an easy one.

689
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,329
Thank you.

690
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,843
He's got quite a perseverance.

691
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,553
-What happened?
-You startled me.

692
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,394
What's wrong?

693
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,638
A lot has happened
after the forbidden door opened up.

694
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,556
What?

695
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,566
My goodness.

696
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:35,703
I cooked <i>bossam</i> with my special recipe
after I heard that you'll be visiting.

697
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,622
-It looks delicious.
-Will you wait?

698
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,326
-Eat up, sir.
-Okay, thank you so much for the food.

699
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,246
I'll use this to make a wrap
and put this on top.

700
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,497
There we go.

701
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:53,047
And I'll finish it off
with some salted shrimp.

702
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,053
Then I'll wrap it like this
and eat it all at once.

703
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,180
You really know how to eat.

704
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,636
You know your <i>bossam.</i>

705
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,899
The meat just melts in my mouth.

706
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,816
Kang-bae, your aunt is an amazing cook.

707
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,899
Yes, she is.

708
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,324
Sir, let me pour you a drink.

709
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,284
Okay.

710
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,696
-I'm so honored, sir.
-Sure.

711
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:23,581
By the way, why do you live like this?

712
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,424
You should dream big.

713
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:28,344
When I was your age,
I didn't live like this.

714
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,672
How were you?

715
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,923
Life is do or die.

716
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,674
When will you afford to get a better place
with the job you have now?

717
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,590
Don't work too hard.

718
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,546
You just need one shot.
You should dream of making a fortune.

719
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,639
"Making a fortune"?

720
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,977
I'm actually very interested in that.

721
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,441
How can I make that happen?

722
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,361
-Well, you see...
-That's a bunch of nonsense.

723
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,651
There's a process for everything
just like this <i>bossam.</i>

724
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:58,026
You must pick out the right kind of meat,
get rid of the bad smell,

725
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,485
and boil the meat as you constantly
check the meat and adjust the fire.

726
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,696
You need to be careful
with every single step.

727
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,537
Without that effort,
you won't get this kind of <i>bossam.</i>

728
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,422
"You just need one shot"?

729
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,380
That's rubbish.

730
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,205
If you go after easy money,
you'll end up in trouble.

731
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,756
Don't you agree, sir?

732
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,299
Yes, of course. You're right.

733
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,473
You'll get in trouble.

734
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,510
I knew it.

735
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,603
You and I are very similar, sir.

736
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,021
- Why don't we have a drink?
- Okay. Sure.

737
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,598
50,000 WON

738
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,041
Who dropped all this?

739
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:46,679
I went to the fruit shop to collect money,
and I ran into Jang Bok-su there.

740
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:52,444
He started running the moment he saw me
as if he ran into the Grim Reaper.

741
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,647
The owner of that fruit shop is amazing.

742
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,193
He paid off that jerk's debt
for being friends.

743
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,567
I know, right?

744
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,317
He always paid the interest on time

745
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,656
and told me not to bother
Jang Bok-su again.

746
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,872
He thinks Jang Bok-su started gambling
and took out a loan because of me.

747
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,418
He blamed me for ruining his life.

748
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,714
-It's totally crazy.
-That can't be.

749
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:19,633
-He was apparently nice and diligent.
-That can't be true.

750
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,256
Is this for Bok-su again?

751
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,354
Why do you keep doing this?
You know he's hopeless.

752
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,061
-You know why I'm doing this. He...
-Yes, I know.

753
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,193
Ten years ago,
he gave you his house deposit

754
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,271
to help your mom get surgery.

755
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,400
But this is too much.

756
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,744
How did you live after that?

757
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,489
The money you saved up for college,
a new truck for the business.

758
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,700
You'll even spend the money
you saved up for our wedding?

759
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,754
How long will you be doing this?

760
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,172
You know what?
I'll let you do what you want.

761
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:01,759
Go ahead and take care of his mess
for the rest of your life.

762
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,178
Gyeong-a, wait.

763
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,072
What do you think?

764
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,993
He's your only friend,
you've ruined his life.

765
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,530
Is life still about the jackpot?

766
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,997
Let me talk to him.

767
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:32,948
Why?

768
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:34,658
I want to apologize to him.

769
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,503
I didn't even know...

770
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,421
I had no idea
and made a huge mess of his shop.

771
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,179
Wait.

772
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,469
I'll wake up. This is a dream.

773
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,177
I'll wake up,

774
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,394
get him a bigger shop,

775
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,898
buy him a new truck,
and put him through school.

776
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,903
You still need to wake up.

777
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,152
It's the chairman's money, not yours.

778
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:07,855
Will your friend want you
to help him with someone else's money?

779
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,791
It'll only make things worse.

780
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,537
Then what should I do?

781
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,870
What do you think?

782
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,710
Just do what you can do.

783
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,129
Go back and receive punishment.

784
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,961
This time, you'll get a C instead of a B.

785
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:27,717
But instead, they'll take good care
of your friend.

786
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,142
He lived a good life.

787
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,891
Are you sure about that?

788
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,569
Okay, fine. I'll go.

789
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,363
I'll go back.

790
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,155
I don't think you're ready yet.

791
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,118
What? Why?

792
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,779
Put that down.

793
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,867
Who takes cash to the Afterlife?

794
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,785
Okay. I'll leave it there.

795
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:14,179
Are you happy now?

796
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,940
We won the competition thanks to you.

797
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,284
No, you also did your best.

798
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,201
It's nothing.

799
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,905
By the way, what are you guys going to eat
with the prize money?

800
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,912
Jin-dong keeps saying
he wants Korean beef.

801
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,076
We always had rice soup for team dinners,

802
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,875
but thanks to you,
we will get to eat Korean beef.

803
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,796
He's crazy about Korean beef.

804
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:51,724
Yeo-rin?

805
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,603
-Yeo-rin.
-What?

806
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,064
What did you say?

807
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,313
Where are you guys having
your team dinner?

808
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,439
I'm not sure. I'm sure we'll decide soon.

809
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,526
I want to tell you
that I had a lot of fun.

810
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,160
This might sound weird,

811
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,751
but it's normally impossible for me
to do anything with anyone.

812
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,576
So thank you.

813
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:07,441
How could a mere evil spirit be so strong?

814
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,975
You think I wandered around the country
because I was on the run?

815
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,149
I was devouring all the evil spirits
to gain strength.

816
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,109
That's why it took me so long.

817
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,651
This isn't enough.

818
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,534
You just wait.

819
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,373
It will be your turn soon.

820
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,425
This tastes the best
when you shake it like this.

821
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:24,056
Here's your drink.

822
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,562
I really wanted to see Kang-bae dance.

823
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,557
I heard they were really good on stage.

824
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,607
What? Okay.

825
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,154
Cheers.

826
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,282
You're totally out of it.

827
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,581
Hey.

828
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,499
Did something happen
between you and Yeo-rin?

829
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,328
No! Nothing happened!
Gosh, I spilled all the alcohol.

830
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,457
So what if something happened?
You didn't have to spill your drink.

831
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:56,593
What?

832
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,512
By the way, about that loan shark.

833
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,932
I reported him to the cops,
so he got arrested.

834
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,265
And the fruit shop owner
got his money back

835
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,730
and is back together with his girlfriend.

836
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,689
That's great.
You guys really are the best.

837
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,307
You played a big role yourself.

838
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,357
Right.
It's all because I won the competition.

839
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,696
Yes, I'll give you credit for that.

840
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,489
Yes, you're bound to get an A later on

841
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,954
when you get graded
by the Reincarnation Committee.

842
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:35,456
I wonder what I did wrong in my past life
to suffer like this in my current life.

843
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,588
-Maybe I killed someone?
-That gives you a C.

844
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,297
You would've been an insect.

845
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,679
That might have been better.

846
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,846
If you were born an insect,
you wouldn't have met me

847
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,142
or Guibanjang.

848
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,267
And we wouldn't have been able
to drink together. Is that okay?

849
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,477
No, I guess not.

850
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:59,694
My life without you guys...

851
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,612
Gosh, it'd be too boring.

852
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,494
I felt so lonely
when you guys weren't here.

853
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,663
Were you?

854
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:11,156
Well, once we settle four more grudges,

855
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:15,325
the pop-up bar will disappear,
and we'll no longer be around.

856
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,576
Dear.

857
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:21,626
I can already imagine
how sad you're going to be.

858
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,932
Can't you just stay
even after you're done?

859
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,679
I'll keep working part-time.

860
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,721
Hey, once this is over,
you'll no longer be in this state.

861
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,476
You should get yourself a girlfriend
and enjoy your life.

862
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:36,095
You deserve to enjoy your life
way more than others.

863
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,727
-Do you get it?
-She's right.

864
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,154
Once that day comes,
you won't even be curious

865
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,323
about your past life.

866
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,070
But if you ever go to the Afterlife again,
please find out what I was.

867
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,241
No, that's top secret.

868
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:51,289
And even if you find out,
it won't do you any good.

869
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:52,752
You saw Jang Bok-su.

870
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:58,667
Being born again with the memory
of your past life is the worst.

871
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:02,378
You'll be living a life
that you've already once lived.

872
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,630
It'll be impossible to live a normal life.

873
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:10,097
I personally think
the Shower of Oblivion is the best service

874
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,679
that the Afterlife provides for humans.

875
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,290
You must have suffered so much

876
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,794
for the past 500 years.

877
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,507
Your anger and resentment.

878
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,131
I will help end your pain.

879
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:51,928
Come to me,

880
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,309
Won-hyung.

881
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,818
Let's all sober up.

882
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,323
-Okay.
-Let's go for a second round.

883
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:08,531
Yes, I need to sober up.

884
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,283
Let's go. A second round is a must.

885
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:16,252
Hey, let's go to a karaoke room.

886
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,090
-I'll be off now.
-Hey, where do you think you're going?

887
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,415
That's a very popular dance
in the Afterlife.

888
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,627
It's okay.

889
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:32,387
-I'm taking you all the way to Hell.
-You jerks.

890
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,517
Yes! Nice timing!

891
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:45,149
Do you know how much I missed you guys?

892
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,025
What a joke. You didn't miss us.

893
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,528
I'm serious. I had to spend so much

894
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,873
in convenience stores
because the bar was gone.

895
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:55,829
I missed you, Mystic Pop-up Bar.

896
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,197
I knew it.

897
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,707
From now on,
you'll have to pay for your food.

898
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,750
Hey, I've been a regular for 500 years.

899
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,923
Sir, we're going for a second round.
Do you want to join?

900
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,303
You should come with us.

901
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,593
Now is your chance to buy us food!

902
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,545
Okay, it's on me.
You can eat whatever you want.

903
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:15,717
-Yes!
-Yes!

904
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,465
-Yes!
-Let's go!

905
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,726
-Let's go somewhere nice.
-Let's go!

906
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,019
-Let's eat something good.
-The karaoke?

907
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,977
-Let's go.
-My goodness.

908
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,653
Make way for me!

909
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,412
Hey, do you have everything ready?

910
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:34,619
Yeombujang, come on!

911
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:36,741
You didn't prepare?

912
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,968
GUEST APPEARANCES BY KIM YONG-GUN,
CHOI DAE-HOON, YOO JAE-MYUNG

913
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,537
I'm a fool who's taunted by fate.

914
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:24,331
I don't have feelings for you.

915
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,125
I'm a fool who's given her all for love.

916
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,129
Parcel delivery!

917
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,011
<i>A delivery guy?</i>

918
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:33,168
<i>-He's just being used.</i>
<i>-Hey!</i>

919
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:35,717
Forget about it.
Should love be conditional?

920
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,801
-But you said it was wise to...
-Shush.

921
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,967
-Wait. What's the name again?
-Ice Witch.

922
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,306
-We might read the last chapter!
-Last chapter!

923
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,935
Who are you people?
How dare you interrupt!

924
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:49,356
I needed to see the scorned woman
who was giving Hell a run for its money.

925
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,570
<i>So Bo-ra's spirit is still here?</i>

926
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,645
Was he like that? The man you loved.

927
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:58,238
<i>Weol-ju.</i>
<i>Do you know that you're like the moon?</i>

928
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:02,664
<i>You are an amazing person</i>
<i>who gave me so many happy memories.</i>

929
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,582
<i>Please don't forget that.</i>
