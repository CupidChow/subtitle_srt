5
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:20,846
For 500 years

6
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,140
you endured the tortures of Hell.

7
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,934
Finally, your sentence
is coming to an end,

8
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:28,061
so why are you doing this?

9
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:32,232
Won-hyung, come with me.

10
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,276
I will take you back myself.

11
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,778
Please step aside.

12
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:38,572
I have unfinished business
with Weol-ju and the Crown Prince.

13
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,741
What is it that you are planning?

14
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:42,910
It was the Crown Prince who beheaded me.

15
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:46,538
And with that, he put an end
to my ambition.

16
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:50,375
So isn't it only fair
that I get to end his too?

17
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,420
That wench he returned to

18
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,590
even after his death.

19
00:00:57,591 --> 00:00:59,051
When Weol-ju fails her mission

20
00:00:59,134 --> 00:01:00,886
and ends up in the Hell of Extinction,

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,430
he will cry blood and feel pain

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,058
like he never did before.

23
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,060
You have already

24
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,938
caused them so much pain.

25
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:12,814
But all that pain doesn't even come close

26
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:16,485
to the 500 years of suffering
I've endured in Hell.

27
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,115
This is only the beginning.

28
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,160
They will get what they deserve.

29
00:01:27,037 --> 00:01:28,038
All of it.

30
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:29,706
You still

31
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:32,918
disappoint me.

32
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:51,103
Don't fight it.
You're not powerful enough.

33
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:53,480
You've always sided
with the Crown Prince, Father.

34
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:57,901
Even in my dying moment.

35
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,237
Why haven't you once

36
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,740
taken my side?

37
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,953
Have you ever considered me your son?

38
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,751
Can't you see that everything I do

39
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,171
is because I want to be loved by you

40
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,134
like a father loves his son?

41
00:02:57,502 --> 00:03:01,214
Sunglasses, check. Salt, check.

42
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:02,841
I'm ready for work.

43
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,179
I think it's best
to make my feelings clear.

44
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:09,640
I don't have feelings for you.

45
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,312
I can avoid seeing ghosts
by wearing these,

46
00:03:16,938 --> 00:03:18,899
but what can I do about
seeing Yeo-rin again?

47
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,278
Mr. Han, did you get some rest
on your day off?

48
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:26,156
-You weren't feeling well.
-Well, I'm feeling better now.

49
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,825
What good will being healthy do

50
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,453
when his heart is still broken?

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,081
Didn't it work out with Ms. Kang?

52
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,958
We've even sent you home together
after dinner.

53
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:37,876
Well...

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,336
I guess it didn't work out.

55
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:41,421
That's odd though.

56
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:44,091
She seemed genuinely worried
that you were sick.

57
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:47,928
That's right. I saw her come by here
a few times yesterday.

58
00:03:48,637 --> 00:03:50,138
I'm sure it was for another reason.

59
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,724
Anyway, thank you for looking out for me.

60
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,435
Look how quick you've given up.

61
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,438
Kang-bae's not the type
to sweep women off their feet.

62
00:03:58,522 --> 00:04:00,816
He's more of the "grow-on-you" type.

63
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:05,153
Mr. Ma, the best way
for colleagues to become close

64
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:07,739
is to have them work together.

65
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:09,366
Yes, of course.

66
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:11,368
Exactly.

67
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,256
Why did Mr. Ma send me to sort the--

68
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:35,350
What you should do

69
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:39,229
is try not to make eye contact

70
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,732
and don't be startled if you do.

71
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:45,902
You should look elsewhere
as if you didn't see anything.

72
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,823
All right. I'll act like I didn't see her.

73
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:52,367
Don't be startled and look away.

74
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:11,344
Young man, can you see me or not?

75
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,433
What are you doing here?

76
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:21,271
All right, I'm sorry!
I'll be good. I promise.

77
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,110
Yeo-rin?

78
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,448
Where did she go?
She was here a second ago.

79
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,451
-Did I imagine that?
-What?

80
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:36,995
Was someone here?

81
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,247
Can you even see with those on?

82
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,709
These? Well, it's bright in here...

83
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,047
Anyway, what brings you here?

84
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,965
I was collecting the carts
while patrolling.

85
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,760
-Here. Let me.
-I'm fine.

86
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:52,761
No, let me.

87
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:03,939
Sorry about that.

88
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,942
Please stop being this way.

89
00:06:07,984 --> 00:06:10,237
-What?
-Stop walking on eggshells around me.

90
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:13,698
Why do you always keep apologizing?
I should be the one apologizing.

91
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,909
I'm to blame for all this.

92
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:18,286
What exactly did you do wrong?

93
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:20,997
I kissed you out of the blue...

94
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:29,965
Oh, that.

95
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,927
It was my first kiss,

96
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:36,513
so it hurts that you feel
you need to apologize.

97
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:45,814
-Jeez, I should have said--
-Me too.

98
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:48,191
It was my first kiss too.

99
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,734
What?

100
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:51,820
I've never kissed someone before,

101
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,197
so I just took a chance and went for it.

102
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:57,492
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't read too much into it.

103
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,953
You too?

104
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,291
-Were we each other's first--
-Just stop.

105
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,170
Let's get back to work, shall we?
You should clear those carts.

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,046
Sure.

107
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:20,765
Seriously?

108
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,101
You're friends with Samsin

109
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,312
and you can talk to
Yeomradaewang privately.

110
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:27,272
Why are you seeking a fortune-teller?

111
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,566
I want to know my odds

112
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,235
and ask if there's anything
I need to be careful of.

113
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,447
Just ask me instead.
Stay clear of alcohol and you're golden.

114
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:37,449
That must be him.

115
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:46,958
Hello, ma'am. My aunt and uncle
are here to check the room with me.

116
00:07:47,042 --> 00:07:50,795
<i>Come out wherever you are
Let me settle your grudge for you</i>

117
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,214
Him again?

118
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:56,134
Doesn't he look like the fraud
that we saw at Ice Witch's place?

119
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:57,802
It's him, isn't he?

120
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:03,475
The spirit of a young man
has been clinging onto you.

121
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,143
That's why you can't find yourself a man.

122
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:06,478
What? Really?

123
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:09,814
How about a talisman? You really need one.

124
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:12,317
-How much is it?
-Just 50,000 won.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,570
It's a bargain
considering how it'll change your life.

126
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,573
A young man's spirit, my ass.

127
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:23,078
Your grandmother passed away recently,
didn't she?

128
00:08:23,662 --> 00:08:24,871
Yes, that's right.

129
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:26,623
She's telling you

130
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:30,210
to stop asking others
why you can't find a man

131
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:31,878
and put yourself out there

132
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,755
by going on blind dates or casual parties.

133
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:35,674
-She's telling you to get a grip.
-That meddler.

134
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,052
That's what my grandmother
always used to tell me.

135
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:42,889
Is she really by my side?

136
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:45,725
Yes, so stop wasting your money

137
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:47,560
and get the hell out of here.

138
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:48,520
No, wait...

139
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:50,063
I'll do it for 30,000 won.

140
00:08:50,146 --> 00:08:52,732
-Have a good day.
-No, wait!

141
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:57,487
You're that lady from the other day.

142
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:00,365
Why do you keep chasing my clients away?

143
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:02,742
That's because you're scamming people.

144
00:09:03,034 --> 00:09:04,828
Keep running your mouth off,

145
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,288
and you'll put not only yourself
but others in danger too.

146
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,415
Understood?

147
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:11,501
Great Lady Weol-hwa,
we must leave immediately.

148
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,088
Consider this as advice
from your superior!

149
00:09:18,675 --> 00:09:21,469
I should go tarot card reading sometime.

150
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,472
To pick a fight with the tarot reader?

151
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:25,682
You're being weird.

152
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:27,767
What's gotten into you?

153
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,812
I've been having these
odd dreams, that's all.

154
00:09:30,895 --> 00:09:33,148
The doors are closed wherever I go.

155
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,694
Can't you design your own dreams?

156
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,612
It would be great to have
nothing but lucky dreams.

157
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,115
Not even hairdressers
can cut the hair on their backs.

158
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:45,744
Lady Weol-hwa.

159
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:47,746
I need your help.

160
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,789
Did he follow us here?

161
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:52,083
You helped the spirit
attached to the house.

162
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,253
Can't you help settle my grudge,
when you can even help the dead?

163
00:09:55,336 --> 00:09:56,629
A grudge?

164
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,592
I may not seem like it,
but I used to be a gifted shaman.

165
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:02,469
But I kept losing my touch

166
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,763
and now I can't even see any ghosts.

167
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:08,141
Soon I won't even be able to
make a living.

168
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,310
<i>This could count as settling a grudge.</i>

169
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:14,356
Can't you help me see spirits again?

170
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:17,692
I want to stop scamming others
for a living now.

171
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:20,612
Your spiritual vision may be gone,

172
00:10:20,695 --> 00:10:22,614
but you came to the right place
nonetheless.

173
00:10:22,697 --> 00:10:24,949
You can no longer see spirits

174
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:27,660
because the spiritual vision that connects

175
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,830
the Afterlife to the Living Realm
has been closed off.

176
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:33,208
Thank the heavens
for running into me when you did.

177
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,542
Then you'll...

178
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:36,628
Yes, I'll open
your spiritual vision again.

179
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:43,593
<font color="#ffff80">DOOR OF SPIRITUAL VISION</font>

180
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:46,137
So this is where the door is.

181
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:49,224
Like I told you,
opening and closing it is a piece of cake.

182
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:52,310
Once I come here to close Kang-bae's door,

183
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:54,020
he'll no longer be a special case.

184
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:58,316
What the hell?

185
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:00,068
Won't it open?

186
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:05,782
Pull here.

187
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,704
What the...

188
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:12,872
Let me see.

189
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,251
Hold on.

190
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,211
What's this?

191
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:20,797
It's been shut down?

192
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:23,800
-The Door of Spiritual Vision?
-Yes.

193
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:25,760
Why was it shut down?

194
00:11:26,136 --> 00:11:27,804
You must have not heard.

195
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:32,308
Well, the law has been revised
after an unfortunate incident.

196
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,601
-An incident?
-That's right.

197
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:37,313
For the first time in a thousand years,

198
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,066
the Jade Emperor had decided to send down
a powerful monk

199
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,943
to the Living Realm
in order to save mankind.

200
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,948
But last year, someone closed
his Door of Spiritual Vision.

201
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,994
I can't believe it!

202
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:54,038
Your six-year-old wants to become a monk?

203
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:58,251
You must be worried sick.

204
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:02,338
Well, have a drink first.

205
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:09,512
What? Who'd do something that ludicrous?

206
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:14,142
Beats me.

207
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:17,145
Whoever shut it didn't just shut the door.

208
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,398
<font color="#ffff80">DOOR OF SPIRITUAL VISION</font>

209
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,279
This will keep it shut forever, right?

210
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:29,616
That's another grudge settled!

211
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,244
Someone welded it shut?

212
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:35,705
What a nutjob.

213
00:12:37,498 --> 00:12:40,001
That monk would have saved countless souls

214
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,336
if that door wasn't welded shut.

215
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,633
So what can one do now
to open the door for humans?

216
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:49,052
It can't be done.
It can't be closed either.

217
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,598
Only the order from the heavens
and the force of nature

218
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,892
can open and close the door now.

219
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,228
That's the revised law.

220
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:01,314
Hold on a second. Can't you at least

221
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:04,776
give me one chance to open the door?

222
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:06,778
What? Of course not.

223
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,614
The laws of the Afterlife cannot be bent.

224
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:12,951
That's enough, Weol-ju.
Let's just send him home.

225
00:13:13,034 --> 00:13:14,619
He'll just have to find another job.

226
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,497
Have you lost your mind?
What about Kang-bae?

227
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,083
Oh, gosh. Kang-bae.

228
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:26,214
Please let us operate the door
just one more time.

229
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,051
Just this once, please.

230
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,054
Please.

231
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:34,764
<font color="#ffff80">MYSTIC POP-UP BAR</font>

232
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:39,602
Poor Kang-bae.

233
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:43,481
Why the hell did you weld that door shut?

234
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:46,234
His mother was in despair,

235
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:47,944
so I helped settle her grudge.

236
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:50,238
How could I have known?

237
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,448
There was no need
to revise the law because of that.

238
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,450
You should have checked
before signing him on.

239
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,493
Why do I bother?

240
00:13:55,576 --> 00:13:58,371
You always dive into things head-first
and cause trouble.

241
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,627
Could there be a way around this?

242
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:09,132
That contract you had him sign.
Can I see it?

243
00:14:09,632 --> 00:14:10,967
<font color="#ffff80">CONTRACT</font>

244
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,927
<font color="#ffff80">ARTICLE 2, DUTIES OF THE PART-TIMER</font>

245
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:14,929
He truly is a special case.

246
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,057
People tell him their worries
when they come into contact with him?

247
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:20,476
Ever since she recruited Kang-bae,

248
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,062
she had been steadily filling
her quota again.

249
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:25,857
He's the striker of our little team.

250
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:30,236
Yes.

251
00:14:33,114 --> 00:14:34,616
The one that scores on a soccer team.

252
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:39,912
So his service is crucial
when it comes to meeting Weol-ju's quota?

253
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:42,749
You say that like
you didn't know what he was capable of.

254
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,709
Right, of course.

255
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:47,378
Could you perhaps pull some strings?

256
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:50,089
You probably have
many connections in the Afterlife.

257
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,634
I'd love for that to be true,
but it's not.

258
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:54,594
Then give that back.

259
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:56,804
Why read the contract
when you're just as helpless?

260
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:02,685
Is she the only one that can help me now?

261
00:15:10,193 --> 00:15:11,736
That's what I'm talking about!

262
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:19,869
Okay, fine.

263
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,746
There is one way.

264
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:23,081
What is it?

265
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:27,085
A human who can
pop in and out of the Dream World

266
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,586
and also see spirits?

267
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:31,839
It means he's enveloped in yin energy.

268
00:15:31,923 --> 00:15:35,426
Partnering him with a human
who is full of yang energy

269
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,761
will neutralize his yin energy.

270
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:43,726
That's the harmony of yin and yang.

271
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:48,314
Someone with plenty of yang energy?
Someone who was born that way?

272
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,650
Or someone from
a country with a warm climate?

273
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:53,027
That won't even get half the job done.

274
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:58,157
I mean someone with a soul
that has nothing but yang energy.

275
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,036
At least someone who is
the reincarnation of the Cinnabar.

276
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,704
The Cinnabar?

277
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,152
This is the Cinnabar.

278
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:37,155
I've never encountered
such a mystical rock before.

279
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:38,906
It's beautiful.

280
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,287
When chasing spirits away from humans,

281
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:47,874
nothing works as well as
a talisman written using the Cinnabar.

282
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,626
Because of the yang energy it emits,

283
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,172
spirits can't stand to be around it.

284
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:57,300
It works even better on evil spirits.

285
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,469
The stone chases spirits away?

286
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,678
That's not all it does.

287
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:04,766
It repels pests
and even has the power to heal.

288
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,020
Then we should scrape off more of it.

289
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,314
Even rocks have souls.

290
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:17,612
A spiritual object such as this
is just like any person.

291
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,282
Humans can easily recover
from a nick here and there,

292
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,576
but what if you cut off their limbs?

293
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:27,288
Spiritual objects can't survive
if you take too much from them at once.

294
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:32,210
We must be cautious
and only use it when necessary.

295
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:34,170
Spiritual objects...

296
00:17:45,515 --> 00:17:50,102
Are you saying that the Cinnabar
was reincarnated as a human?

297
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,146
Yes, as a woman.

298
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:57,652
She suffered a lot
in her past life, you know.

299
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,031
If only she can meet
a nice guy who loves her this time.

300
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:05,576
That's actually great news.
Kang-bae's a sweetheart.

301
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,995
He's kind, diligent, and...

302
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,122
You saw him, right?

303
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:12,458
He's the type that girls dig these days.

304
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,546
Don't I know it.
He's like a sweet little puppy.

305
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:21,884
How nice would it be
for two heartbroken people

306
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:24,011
to become good friends?

307
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:25,513
Being good friends

308
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:27,348
isn't enough
to bond the yin and yang energy.

309
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:28,432
Then?

310
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:34,021
A true love's kiss.

311
00:18:43,573 --> 00:18:45,157
A true love's kiss?

312
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:49,453
So Kang-bae is like a cursed
fairy-tale princess?

313
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,665
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

314
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:54,917
Jeez, it's one hurdle after the next.

315
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:57,837
They need to be attracted
to each other then.

316
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,464
How old is this reincarnated Cinnabar?

317
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:02,133
Where does she live? What's her name?

318
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:05,219
Let me see. Her age?

319
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:10,892
Gosh, how silly of me
to yap away like this.

320
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:12,518
No way.

321
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:15,938
The reincarnation of a spiritual object
must never be disclosed.

322
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,231
Come on!

323
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:18,608
Okay, fine.

324
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:24,196
I come bearing free coupons
for the coffee truck, so take them.

325
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,783
I wasn't kidding about it being a secret.

326
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:31,621
I'd be crazy to fall for
one of your tricks again.

327
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,497
-Give up already.
-I never said it was a joke.

328
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:35,166
I couldn't be more serious.

329
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:37,543
Fine. If not the coupons then...

330
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:39,086
Name your price.

331
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:42,632
Are you seriously
trying to send me to Hell?

332
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,426
-Leave. Get out of here!
-But...

333
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,178
-Get out.
-Samsin, wait.

334
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:48,930
Don't be like this.

335
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,140
Could you please read this?

336
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:52,683
Thank you.

337
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:55,645
Could you please read this? Thank you.

338
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,522
Thank you.

-Here. Let me take some.
-But...

Could you please read this? Thank you.

346

Please take a look at this.

349
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:48,280
I'm here.

350
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:51,450
-Yeombujang. Hello.
-Hi, Kang-bae.

351
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,787
I've brought someone today.

352
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:57,915
These are the people
who find missing people.

353
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,167
Hello.

354
00:21:01,752 --> 00:21:02,753
Please have a seat.

355
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,386
We need to find someone?

356
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:14,014
She's looking for her long-lost son.

357
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,060
Guibanjang,
won't the Afterlife Police Agency

358
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:20,146
-be able to track him down?
-Yes.

359
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,981
Send them a photo.

360
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:25,901
<font color="#ffff80">MISSING: PARK JUN-U, AGE 7
WOULD BE 22 THIS YEAR</font>

361
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:59,310
Even though I didn't have much time,
I managed to make a few dishes.

362
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,020
That's how good I am.

363
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:05,024
Please enjoy the various foods.

364
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:06,984
Thank you. I will.

365
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,538
What's wrong?
Don't you like rolled omelets with cheese?

366
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:20,831
We can make one without cheese.

367
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:26,796
My son's favorite dish was rolled omelets.

368
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:30,257
I hope he's not starving somewhere.

369
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:35,596
I'd give anything
to cook this for him again.

370
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:39,683
The flyer says that
he went missing quite some time ago.

371
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:41,936
It's been 15 years already.

372
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:44,730
I lost him when he was seven.

373
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:53,572
<i>When he was five,</i>

374
00:22:54,114 --> 00:22:56,659
<i>my husband passed away from renal cancer.</i>

375
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,079
<i>I was terrified to raise him alone,</i>

376
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,666
<i>but I hung in there for Jun-u's sake.</i>

377
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,460
<i>I'm his mother after all.</i>

378
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,921
You made a rolled omelet.

379
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:11,131
You love it
even though you eat it every day?

380
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,176
Yes, I love it every time I eat it.

381
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,386
It's delicious.

382
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,931
I'll make bulgogi for dinner today.

383
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:20,307
Mom, you should eat too.

384
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:23,060
Then you'll go to work
and I'll go to preschool.

385
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:28,065
Jun-u, I may come home
later than usual today.

386
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:30,526
I'll cook dinner for you before I leave,

387
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,528
so eat it once you get home.

388
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:34,154
Sure.

389
00:23:35,322 --> 00:23:37,658
Gosh, slow down.

390
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:40,661
And I'll take your toy while you eat.

391
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:41,787
Dig in.

392
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:45,207
Goodness.

393
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,137
My gosh, slow down.

394
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,055
Good boy. Don't forget to chew.

395
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,224
Have some soup too.

396
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:08,480
Hyeon-ok, I'll leave the groceries here.

397
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:11,066
I'll tell the boss when she gets in.

398
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:15,279
Hyeon-ok, here you go.

399
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:17,573
Isn't the boss here?

400
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,326
Then how about we grab a cup of coffee?

401
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:21,911
Please stop.

402
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,788
This is where I work
and you're making me uncomfortable.

403
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:27,166
Then meet me sometime for a meal.

404
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:29,376
As if I have time to spare.

405
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,337
I'd rather spend it with my son.

406
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,546
Come on!

407
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:36,091
You can ask your boss to babysit.

408
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:38,135
Sang-cheol,

409
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:40,930
you're only someone
who I went to elementary school with.

410
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,723
I never thought of you as anything else.

411
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:46,393
Besides, raising Jun-u
is my one and only priority,

412
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,812
so don't waste my time and step aside.

413
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,983
Jun-u.

414
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,152
Jun-u, I'm home.

415
00:24:58,322 --> 00:24:59,448
Where is he?

416
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:02,534
What...

417
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:05,329
Is he at the playground?

418
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:10,000
Jun-u.

419
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:12,628
Jun-u.

420
00:25:13,128 --> 00:25:14,505
Jun-u.

421
00:25:24,765 --> 00:25:26,141
After that day,

422
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:28,811
I never got to see him again.

423
00:25:31,146 --> 00:25:33,107
I just want to know if he's alive or not.

424
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,360
If he wasn't in an accident...

425
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:39,905
Is there anyone that you're suspicious of?

426
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,326
I did suspect a man named Sang-cheol.

427
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,995
Did you talk to the police?

428
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:48,080
I did.

429
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:52,251
But on the day when Jun-u went missing,
he had an ironclad alibi.

430
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:54,420
The police let him go.

431
00:25:55,879 --> 00:25:57,297
But what's more suspicious is that

432
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:00,968
Sang-cheol cut off all of his contacts
and disappeared.

433
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:04,847
I doubt that you have a photo of him.

434
00:26:05,514 --> 00:26:08,642
You went to the same elementary school.
Tell me the school name and his age.

435
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,688
He was born in 1976.
We went to Mido Elementary School.

436
00:26:13,647 --> 00:26:14,690
But why do you need that?

437
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:17,693
Hold on.

438
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:26,660
I shouldn't have left him alone
even if I had to work.

439
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,288
It's all my fault.

440
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:32,458
If your son was kidnapped,
it's the kidnapper's fault.

441
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,084
How is that your fault?

442
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:42,509
God considers harming children

443
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:44,887
the biggest sin that a human can commit.

444
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:48,307
Those sinners face a punishment
called the Cycle of Pest.

445
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,393
This is where they are born as insects
while retaining their memories as humans

446
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,812
and repeat the cycle of life and death.

447
00:26:57,941 --> 00:27:01,111
I got you. This fly might be that jerk!

448
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,827
Jun-u will come back.

449
00:27:09,703 --> 00:27:12,581
I know it's painful to bear,
but please hang in there.

450
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,416
Thank you.

451
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,668
Please eat.

452
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:19,088
You must eat to stay healthy,
so you can look for Jun-u.

453
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,964
Okay.

454
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:24,593
Yes. Is that so?

455
00:27:26,053 --> 00:27:27,513
Thank you. I'll check on it.

456
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,223
Okay.

457
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,518
What's the word? Did you find her son?

458
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:34,937
There's no data on him.

459
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:37,648
If he's dead,
they would at least have a record.

460
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:40,317
The overseas branches
might have some information.

461
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:43,362
I sent a request for their cooperation.
So it will take a few days.

462
00:27:43,445 --> 00:27:45,656
Gosh, this is getting complicated.

463
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:49,201
For the time being, I'm going to pay
Joo Sang-cheol a visit to get some leads.

464
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:50,911
Really? Where is he?

465
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:53,622
Right here.

466
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,250
He's nearby.

467
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,670
Right. That lady has
such a heartbreaking story.

468
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,839
Escort her to her house, okay?

469
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:03,882
Sure. Will do. Bye.

470
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:05,300
Bye. I'm leaving.

471
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,136
It's cold.

472
00:28:12,641 --> 00:28:14,726
<font color="#ffff80">MYSTIC POP-UP BAR</font>

473
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,941
Kang-bae seems to

474
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,193
sympathize with the lady.

475
00:28:34,204 --> 00:28:36,248
I saw her go into her house.

476
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:40,002
She was smiling and thanking me.

477
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,920
But it looked like she was crying.

478
00:28:42,212 --> 00:28:43,505
It made me really sad.

479
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,967
How can a parent
who lost a child live a happy life?

480
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:50,470
Those who haven't gone through the agony
can't even imagine the pain.

481
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,347
Right.

482
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:55,434
Parents who lost their children
can't even die in peace

483
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,269
in case their children come back.

484
00:28:57,895 --> 00:29:00,147
I want to find her son fast.
Let's get going.

485
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,566
Kang-bae, you should go home.

486
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:05,360
Why?

487
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,946
It's getting late.

488
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,033
And you must be out of energy
now that you're seeing ghosts.

489
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:14,745
I feel safer when I'm with you guys.

490
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,164
Let me tag along. Please?

491
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:20,167
I really want to help
the lady find her son.

492
00:29:23,003 --> 00:29:26,465
Then, don't do anything.
Just stay next to us. Okay?

493
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,357
Who are you?

494
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,030
Did Hyeon-ok send you?

495
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:53,158
-Did she?
-You abandoned a boy.

496
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,410
I didn't leave him somewhere dangerous.

497
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:59,206
I left him at an orphanage.
It was at an orphanage.

498
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:02,251
Please spare me.

499
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:05,587
I'll tell you where he is. I promise.

500
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,173
No. There's no need for that.

501
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:11,051
I'm not interested in that.

502
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:15,681
I just came here to make sure
you won't be able to tell anyone.

503
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:21,979
Why don't you wait in Hell first?

504
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:25,065
I'll send someone
to keep you company soon.

505
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:49,548
This is the place, right?

506
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,471
The door is open.

507
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:06,648
What? Hey.

508
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:09,526
Hey! Joo Sang-cheol!

509
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,365
Is he dead?

510
00:31:15,449 --> 00:31:17,784
He's alive, but he'll die soon.

511
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,745
Do you think he can live?

512
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:21,538
No. He has a few minutes at most.

513
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:26,752
We have no choice, then.
We must hurry inside and find a lead.

514
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,004
This is dangerous.

515
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,089
If he dies, we won't be able to come back.

516
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:33,759
We'll be trapped forever
in his Dream World.

517
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:36,470
This might be the last chance
we have to find Hyeon-ok's son.

518
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:38,430
-I have to do it.
-Weol-ju.

519
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:49,441
-I'm coming with you, then.
-Me, too.

520
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:52,319
Kang-bae. You stay here and watch him.

521
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:56,031
Call us out when it looks as if
he'll die. Okay?

522
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,452
Okay. Be careful.

523
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:21,014
Mister.

524
00:32:22,224 --> 00:32:24,935
What are you doing here, Jun-u?

525
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:26,686
I'm waiting for my friends.

526
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,397
Your friends?

527
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:31,942
Your friends aren't coming today.

528
00:32:32,025 --> 00:32:35,654
Do you want to go to a nice place
and play with me?

529
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:40,033
No. I'll just go home
and play with my mom.

530
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,036
With your mom? Again?

531
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,706
Do you know how hard
you make things for her?

532
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:48,083
You're hurting me. Stop it!

533
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:53,714
I could have Hyeon-ok all to myself
if you weren't here.

534
00:32:55,632 --> 00:32:56,550
You...

535
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,431
-That jerk.
-Damn it.

536
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:11,106
Jun-u.

537
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:18,447
<i>Ms. Weol-ju! Guibanjang!</i>

538
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:19,823
<i>Please come back!</i>

539
00:33:21,324 --> 00:33:24,369
Hurry! He's about to die.

540
00:33:25,328 --> 00:33:27,664
What should I do? Oh, no.

541
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,918
I think his time is up.
Let's get out of here.

542
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:34,337
We have to find out
what he did with Jun-u.

543
00:34:01,156 --> 00:34:02,365
That bastard.

544
00:34:07,454 --> 00:34:10,081
Hey, we can't stay here any longer.
Let's get out of here.

545
00:34:10,373 --> 00:34:13,376
Hold on. We have to know
which orphanage he was sent to.

546
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,302
Hey.

547
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:35,607
Over there!

548
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,525
<font color="#ffff80">DURI</font>

549
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,572
That was close. Are you hurt?

550
00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:44,574
No. You're fine, right?

551
00:34:46,868 --> 00:34:48,078
Ms. Weol-ju.

552
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:50,163
This bastard abandoned Jun-u

553
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:52,457
at an orphanage, while he was injured
and unconscious.

554
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:54,084
My goodness.

555
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:57,420
How could he do something like that?

556
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:00,590
I don't know who took his life,

557
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:03,426
but I would have done it myself
if he weren't already dead.

558
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,387
But we got the name of the orphanage.

559
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:07,722
We'll be able to find Jun-u
once we call them.

560
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:09,391
That's a relief.

561
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:14,354
But he can't just die like this.
Shouldn't he pay for what he did?

562
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:16,815
The Heavens know what he did.

563
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,858
Although he wasn't punished
in the Living Realm,

564
00:35:19,442 --> 00:35:21,528
he will spend all eternity in Hell.

565
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,248
<font color="#ffff80">KAPEUL MART</font>

566
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,892
I guess you can see me.

567
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,980
Don't come near me. No, stop it.

568
00:35:57,063 --> 00:35:58,940
Play with me.

569
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:01,151
I'll be nice to you.

570
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:31,806
Sir.

571
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:40,231
Are you all right?

572
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,150
Thank you.

573
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,533
I thought this would happen,
so I came to check on you.

574
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:55,997
This won't help you at all.

575
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,127
We need to get you fixed quickly.

576
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:08,593
Being able to see the true side
of people is tough.

577
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:10,804
The truth?

578
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:13,598
It just sounds good.

579
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:16,976
But sometimes,
truth can be uglier and dirtier.

580
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:19,437
Right.

581
00:37:20,188 --> 00:37:23,149
A lot of people wanted to deceive
and take advantage of others.

582
00:37:23,733 --> 00:37:26,736
That's why I was afraid
to make any friends for a while.

583
00:37:27,821 --> 00:37:29,948
Others will be afraid of you, too.

584
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:32,617
Me?

585
00:37:33,827 --> 00:37:36,621
Everyone lives with their personal demons.

586
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:41,710
Selfishness and ugliness
that they cannot dare show others.

587
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:44,504
They try their best to keep
their demons inside them,

588
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:47,841
but you keep bringing their demons out.
Of course, they fear you.

589
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,137
So we are afraid of each other.

590
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:59,936
But thanks to Ms. Weol-ju and Guibanjang,
I began to look on the brighter side.

591
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:04,899
I've met people who truly miss others
and are concerned about others.

592
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:08,153
And when their grudges were settled,

593
00:38:08,236 --> 00:38:10,613
they were happy and grateful.

594
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,199
I could see those feelings were sincere.

595
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,871
Thanks to Weol-ju and Guibanjang?

596
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,708
What if they are taking advantage of you
and deceiving you?

597
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:24,210
Weol-ju and Guibanjang?

598
00:38:25,754 --> 00:38:27,130
My gosh, no way.

599
00:38:27,547 --> 00:38:28,840
Your touch doesn't work on them,

600
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:31,259
so you never had a chance
to look at their sincere feelings.

601
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:33,219
How can you trust them?

602
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,973
I just

603
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,102
trust them.

604
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:47,192
Didn't I tell you?

605
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:50,195
Everyone lives with their personal demons.

606
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,081
Hello?

607
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:29,375
Yes.

608
00:39:32,754 --> 00:39:34,047
Thank you.

609
00:39:34,797 --> 00:39:36,090
Thank you.

610
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:46,309
The orphanage just called.
They found Jun-u.

611
00:39:46,976 --> 00:39:49,479
He's in the States now,
but he was planning to come back.

612
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:50,521
Really?

613
00:39:51,064 --> 00:39:52,148
That's great news.

614
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,401
Right. I'm so glad.

615
00:39:59,822 --> 00:40:03,409
But I can't be happy for them because
my heart feels heavy for Kang-bae.

616
00:40:09,248 --> 00:40:11,960
When he comes later,
we have to tell him the truth.

617
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,503
Let's make him quit.

618
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:17,590
Give me some time.
After getting the call about Jun-u,

619
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:19,258
I was going to visit Samsin again.

620
00:40:19,342 --> 00:40:21,260
She said she could never tell you.

621
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:23,346
For the sake of the argument,

622
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:25,598
let's say we found out
who Cinnabar is reincarnated into.

623
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:27,642
A true love's kiss?

624
00:40:29,143 --> 00:40:32,605
Whoever she is, we don't have
enough time to help them fall in love.

625
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,571
Weol-ju, if you keep stalling like this,
you'd be deceiving Kang-bae.

626
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:45,451
I'll take care of it.
Don't say a word about this to him.

627
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:47,578
Keeping this a secret from him
isn't the problem.

628
00:40:48,705 --> 00:40:52,375
If you don't have a way to fix him,
we should make him stop working here.

629
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,502
-Listen.
-What did you just say?

630
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:57,839
You can't fix my case?

631
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:00,008
Well,

632
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:01,509
it's...

633
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:04,095
Kang-bae.

634
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:07,098
Why are you so flustered?
It's like I caught you red-handed.

635
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:08,349
Kang-bae, listen.

636
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,351
You're pulling a prank on me, right?

637
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,063
Ms. Weol-ju, you can fix me, right?

638
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:17,400
Well, that's

639
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:19,777
what we thought.

640
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,155
Are you sure there's no way to fix me?

641
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:25,324
Ms. Weol-ju, please answer me.
You said you could fix me.

642
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:26,826
I'm sorry, Kang-bae.

643
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:34,083
You can't.

644
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:39,839
You really can't.

645
00:41:41,507 --> 00:41:42,342
Then,

646
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,470
you've been lying to me all this time.

647
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,681
Was it just to use me
because you needed me?

648
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:49,807
Sit down.

649
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:51,434
-Let's sit down and talk.
-Let go of me.

650
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,271
You hated people who only exploited
and didn't appreciate others.

651
00:41:55,855 --> 00:41:57,732
How are you any different
from those people?

652
00:42:02,862 --> 00:42:03,738
I trusted you.

653
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:06,657
I believed that you and Guibanjang

654
00:42:09,452 --> 00:42:10,536
were different.

655
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,831
Kang-bae.

656
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:14,999
Kang-bae!

657
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,630
Kang-bae!

658
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,382
Kang-bae!

659
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,953
<font color="#ffff80">KAPEUL MART</font>

660
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:46,591
If you're looking for Kang-bae again,

661
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:48,134
he's on sick leave again.

662
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:49,594
Another sick leave?

663
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:51,804
Is he seriously ill?

664
00:43:52,638 --> 00:43:53,639
Well,

665
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,976
in my opinion, I think his immune system

666
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:59,145
was weakened due to stress

667
00:43:59,228 --> 00:44:01,439
because somebody broke his heart
to pieces.

668
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:05,735
I wasn't asking for your opinion.
You don't even know what's wrong with him.

669
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:07,236
What kind of colleague are you?

670
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:09,989
Next time,
I'll accompany him to the hospital,

671
00:44:10,072 --> 00:44:12,366
get the doctor's note, and give it to you.

672
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,244
As his colleague, I ought to
take care of him. Sure thing.

673
00:44:15,328 --> 00:44:16,454
Unbelievable.

674
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:18,956
Why doesn't she just go check up on him?

675
00:44:19,498 --> 00:44:21,125
Why does he keep getting sick?

676
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,211
He's making me worry.

677
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:10,383
I'm sorry.

678
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,760
I'm also responsible

679
00:45:13,803 --> 00:45:15,012
for letting this happen.

680
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,182
I guess this is what I'm destined for.

681
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:21,352
Perhaps, this is my fate.

682
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,232
My attempt to become a normal person

683
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,194
must have been an overly ambitious goal.

684
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:32,113
-Kang-bae.
-I'm fine.

685
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:35,950
Being used and abandoned like this

686
00:45:38,744 --> 00:45:40,037
is nothing new to me.

687
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,380
Don't you have a spot in your class?

688
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:52,550
Can you take Han Kang-bae?
I can't stand him.

689
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:53,718
Same here.

690
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:57,263
When I'm with him, I keep oversharing.
It creeps me out.

691
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,765
Do you think
he could be cursed or something?

692
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:02,893
You might be onto something.
That must be why his parents left him.

693
00:46:03,352 --> 00:46:04,478
Gosh, he's so creepy.

694
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:11,527
Starting now,
you will be living with us, Kang-bae.

695
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,196
I'll cook you a delicious dinner at home.

696
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:16,949
What do you think about this toy?
Do you like it?

697
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:17,992
Yes.

698
00:46:24,707 --> 00:46:27,126
If we at least have a kid,
he'll stay home some more.

699
00:46:27,209 --> 00:46:29,754
He acts like he's a bachelor or something.

700
00:46:29,837 --> 00:46:33,424
What? How could you say that
in front of a kid?

701
00:46:38,804 --> 00:46:41,891
What's the point of having a child?
He's not even mine.

702
00:46:41,974 --> 00:46:44,727
To be honest, I'm putting up
with you because of your family's money.

703
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,686
Just wait.

704
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,022
In a few years, I'll take your money
and divorce you.

705
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,024
I knew it. That's what you were after.

706
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,233
Yes, that was it.

707
00:46:51,317 --> 00:46:54,153
-Be honest. You married me for my job.
-<i>The Cursed Boy.</i>

708
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,280
-All you've got is money.
-<i>That was my nickname.</i>

709
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,783
I was creepy and unpleasant.

710
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:02,495
Who would look after someone like me?

711
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:06,749
Everyone came to me
and told me their feelings

712
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:08,918
and they hated me.

713
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:15,007
I also want someone who I can lean on
and share my troubles with.

714
00:47:17,468 --> 00:47:18,969
But why can't I do that?

715
00:47:20,096 --> 00:47:21,305
Why not?

716
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:22,306
I'll lend you my ears.

717
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:24,266
We can listen to you.

718
00:47:27,353 --> 00:47:28,354
Right.

719
00:47:29,772 --> 00:47:34,443
You and Ms. Weol-ju were the only people
whom I could trust and talk to.

720
00:47:36,904 --> 00:47:39,907
It even made me think that
this was how it felt to have a family.

721
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:45,246
Even if my spiritual vision
couldn't be closed,

722
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:48,624
I thought I'd be happy

723
00:47:52,128 --> 00:47:54,088
if I could be with

724
00:47:57,383 --> 00:47:58,968
you and Ms. Weol-ju.

725
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,180
Kang-bae.

726
00:48:05,558 --> 00:48:06,767
As for your case,

727
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,728
we'll find a way no matter what.

728
00:48:09,812 --> 00:48:11,439
-So until we do--
-No.

729
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:14,608
I won't do it.

730
00:48:15,317 --> 00:48:18,737
I don't want to trust people
only to be disappointed

731
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:21,282
and hurt in the end.

732
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:28,747
Please leave.

733
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:31,208
And I don't want you to

734
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:34,003
see you again.

735
00:48:53,272 --> 00:48:56,025
Weol-ju, please calm down. Please?

736
00:48:57,776 --> 00:49:00,404
Goodness. Calm down, will you?

737
00:49:00,488 --> 00:49:03,365
Do you know how many
conception dream marbles are inside?

738
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:05,993
I don't care how many there are.

739
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:09,079
Tell me who the cinnabar
reincarnated into.

740
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:12,458
If you don't,
I'll break everything here and go to Hell.

741
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:16,587
Do you mean that?
Are you sure you want to risk that?

742
00:49:19,882 --> 00:49:21,634
I even hanged myself on the Sacred Tree.

743
00:49:21,717 --> 00:49:23,344
Going to Hell won't be a big deal.

744
00:49:27,473 --> 00:49:30,392
If you're willing to face Hell for this,

745
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:32,019
I'll tell you who she is.

746
00:49:33,812 --> 00:49:34,647
But...

747
00:49:42,488 --> 00:49:44,865
But what made Samsin change her mind
all of a sudden?

748
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:48,536
She said it was the secret of the Heavens.

749
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:51,872
Weol-ju.

750
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:54,208
Hey, boss.

751
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,127
Yes?

752
00:49:58,212 --> 00:49:59,088
What?

753
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:01,131
What made Samsin change her mind?

754
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:06,470
I guess she felt sorry for Kang-bae.

755
00:50:06,554 --> 00:50:09,974
Then what's taking her so long?
It's so frustrating to wait.

756
00:50:10,683 --> 00:50:13,018
I'm sure we'll hear from her soon.
Let's wait and see.

757
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:17,398
I need to drop by the hospital.

758
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,732
Why?

759
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:23,779
Jun-u is apparently really sick.

760
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,740
He got hospitalized
as soon as he came back.

761
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:30,244
My gosh, what's with all the bad news?

762
00:50:31,287 --> 00:50:34,498
But he'll finally get to meet
his mother again today.

763
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,166
That's what matters.

764
00:50:37,543 --> 00:50:39,420
<font color="#ffff80">DAEHAN UNIVERSITY
DONGTAN SEONGDONG HOSPITAL</font>

765
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:36,143
Jun-u, it's me, your mom.

766
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:41,940
Jun-u, I'm...

767
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,736
I'm sorry it took me so long to find you.

768
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,783
I'm sorry I lost you.

769
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:52,326
I'm sorry

770
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,163
I gave you such a weak body.

771
00:51:56,455 --> 00:51:57,748
I'm...

772
00:51:58,666 --> 00:52:01,669
I'm sorry for everything.

773
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:05,214
From now on,

774
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,883
I'll stay by your side.

775
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,052
I'll...

776
00:52:11,178 --> 00:52:13,263
I'll always be with you no matter what.

777
00:52:19,144 --> 00:52:20,270
I'm sorry.

778
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:24,942
Thank you, my son. And I'm so sorry.

779
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:26,485
I'm sorry.

780
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:29,238
I'm sorry, Jun-u.

781
00:52:32,074 --> 00:52:33,200
This is all because of me.

782
00:52:34,034 --> 00:52:35,786
I'm sorry, my sweetheart.

783
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:52,636
I envy you.

784
00:52:53,846 --> 00:52:56,348
At least you got to see your son.

785
00:52:59,226 --> 00:53:00,310
Unlike you,

786
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:04,982
I never even got to see my son.

787
00:53:14,533 --> 00:53:16,994
Samsin, do you have what I asked for?

788
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,663
So who is Cinnabar?

789
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:33,469
Samsin, what brings you here?

790
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:37,347
My gosh, you really are handsome.

791
00:53:38,056 --> 00:53:39,349
Pardon?

792
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,809
My goodness gracious.

793
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:45,439
Oh, right. Wait. Why am I here?

794
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,775
You can't be here to give me
a conception dream.

795
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,736
Oh, I remember now.
I'm here to talk to you about Weol-ju.

796
00:53:51,612 --> 00:53:53,530
I have nothing to say about her.

797
00:53:54,072 --> 00:53:56,116
I never asked you to talk.
You just need to listen.

798
00:53:59,077 --> 00:54:01,246
Weol-ju isn't selfish enough

799
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,374
to use someone to her advantage
just so she could avoid going to Hell.

800
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:08,212
Unlike how she seems,
she's warm-hearted and loyal.

801
00:54:08,796 --> 00:54:09,713
To be more exact,

802
00:54:10,422 --> 00:54:14,927
she has a habit of sacrificing herself.

803
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:16,929
"Sacrifice"?

804
00:54:17,304 --> 00:54:18,430
Yes.

805
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:20,933
The reason she's been
doing this for 500 years

806
00:54:21,016 --> 00:54:23,685
is because she wants to save
her child's soul.

807
00:54:24,812 --> 00:54:26,021
"Her child"?

808
00:54:26,605 --> 00:54:27,981
Did she have a child?

809
00:54:30,859 --> 00:54:31,902
Yes, she did.

810
00:54:33,028 --> 00:54:34,905
But she didn't know either.

811
00:54:37,032 --> 00:54:39,993
<i>Weol-ju hung herself on the Sacred Tree
500 years ago</i>

812
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:42,996
<i>after she had been through
a terrible experience.</i>

813
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:48,085
<i>But she didn't know that she would
end up killing two more lives as well.</i>

814
00:54:48,836 --> 00:54:50,379
<i>She killed the Sacred Tree</i>

815
00:54:51,004 --> 00:54:54,091
<i>and the baby that she was pregnant with.</i>

816
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,218
<i>Due to bad luck,</i>

817
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,471
<i>the Sacred Tree's sorrow
entered the soul of the fetus.</i>

818
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:03,767
<i>And because of that,
the baby was destined to live</i>

819
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:08,605
<i>thousands of miserable lives until
the Sacred Tree's grudge was settled.</i>

820
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:18,365
Was I

821
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:22,536
pregnant with a baby?

822
00:55:23,412 --> 00:55:24,288
Yes.

823
00:55:26,665 --> 00:55:28,709
So, will you go to the Hell of Extinction?

824
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,961
The baby did nothing wrong.

825
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:33,088
It's just a pitiful baby

826
00:55:33,171 --> 00:55:36,091
who had to die
before it even got the chance

827
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,677
to be born into the Living Realm.

828
00:55:39,428 --> 00:55:42,556
How could you be so cruel
to a baby who only ended up this way

829
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,392
for having met a bad mother?

830
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:50,272
Like you said, it's just karma.

831
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:52,941
What will you do?

832
00:55:53,275 --> 00:55:55,402
I can let you be ripped to pieces

833
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,779
and disappear forever as you wish.

834
00:55:58,363 --> 00:55:59,656
No.

835
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,950
No, Yeomradaewang.

836
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:05,120
Did you say 100,000 people?

837
00:56:06,288 --> 00:56:07,456
I will do it.

838
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,876
I will

839
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:16,882
receive the punishment.

840
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:21,678
<i>That's how Weol-ju ended up
having to settle the grudges</i>

841
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:23,555
<i>of 100,000 people</i>

842
00:56:24,056 --> 00:56:27,225
<i>on behalf of the Sacred Tree
so she could save her baby's soul.</i>

843
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:31,605
I see.

844
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:34,900
So that's why she took all those risks.

845
00:56:35,943 --> 00:56:36,944
Yes.

846
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,615
That's why she's always so eager to help

847
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,700
whenever it has something to do with kids.

848
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,912
I know Jun-u's mother
searched for her son for 15 years,

849
00:56:46,995 --> 00:56:48,914
but I bet it's even worse for Weol-ju

850
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,583
considering that it's been 500 years.

851
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:56,546
I had no idea.

852
00:56:57,381 --> 00:56:59,383
Even Guibanjang and Yeombujang
don't know about this,

853
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:01,385
but the reason I'm telling you this secret

854
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,179
is because she was never like this.

855
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:09,184
I've never seen her care and worry so much
about a living human being.

856
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,728
She was worried about me?

857
00:57:12,312 --> 00:57:13,772
My goodness.

858
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:26,118
"Contract for the transfer of sins"?

859
00:57:27,786 --> 00:57:28,829
What's this?

860
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:31,623
I can tell you what you desperately

861
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,418
wish to know.

862
00:57:35,377 --> 00:57:36,503
But instead,

863
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:40,590
you must be willing to take responsibility
for disclosing what's confidential.

864
00:57:42,175 --> 00:57:43,343
What will happen to me?

865
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:45,846
You will lose your chance
to get reincarnated.

866
00:57:46,513 --> 00:57:48,473
And you will get sent
to the Hell of Extinction.

867
00:57:49,808 --> 00:57:51,101
Here's the contract.

868
00:57:56,565 --> 00:57:58,567
<font color="#ffff80">CONTRACT FOR THE TRANSFER OF SINS</font>

869
00:58:01,028 --> 00:58:04,114
I'm glad there's still a way to help.

870
00:58:06,283 --> 00:58:07,826
Are you sure about this?

871
00:58:09,077 --> 00:58:12,372
Once you hit 100,000 lives,
you'll get a chance to reincarnate.

872
00:58:12,998 --> 00:58:15,709
Do you really want
to throw that chance away like this?

873
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,965
I never wanted to be reincarnated.

874
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,051
And

875
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:26,762
I don't think it's a waste

876
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:32,225
because I'll get to keep
the promise I made to Kang-bae.

877
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:35,312
You're unbelievable.

878
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:44,654
Are you going to tell me
as soon as I sign the contract?

879
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:46,948
No, I can't tell you right away.

880
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:50,494
There's going to be
an internal screening process,

881
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,455
but you're promising to go
to the Hell of Extinction,

882
00:58:54,122 --> 00:58:55,791
so I'm sure it'll pass.

883

<font color="#ffff80">I, WEOL-JU, GIVE UP MY RIGHT TO

885
00:59:09,262 --> 00:59:10,722
Are you scared now that you have to

886
00:59:12,099 --> 00:59:13,475
sign the contract?

887
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:18,480
Nonsense.

888
00:59:20,148 --> 00:59:21,149
I'll sign it.

889
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:26,655
<font color="#ffff80">WEOL-JU</font>

890
00:59:33,662 --> 00:59:34,746
No way.

891
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:36,373
Do you get it now?

892
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:40,293
This is how much she cares about you.

893
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:47,384
Weol-ju won't be able to tell you
how to fix your condition in detail.

894
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:49,678
As you can see, it's confidential.

895
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:52,097
That's why I came.

896
00:59:52,597 --> 00:59:54,891
I figured you guys should reconcile first

897
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:58,228
in order for Weol-ju to help you
fix your condition.

898
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:03,024
No, I can't let her do this.
This is wrong.

899
01:00:03,108 --> 01:00:05,485
I'm fine living the way I am.

900
01:00:05,569 --> 01:00:07,779
So can you please undo this?

901
01:00:07,863 --> 01:00:10,532
I can't let her go to Hell
without a chance for reincarnation.

902
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:13,118
My goodness, there's no turning back.

903
01:00:14,786 --> 01:00:17,622
This is as far as I can help.

904
01:00:17,706 --> 01:00:19,332
So from now on, it's up to you guys.

905
01:00:25,589 --> 01:00:28,133
Thank goodness we got there quickly.

906
01:00:28,216 --> 01:00:30,886
If we were five minutes late,
he would've been dead.

907
01:00:33,013 --> 01:00:36,183
Then she never would've met her son,
and Weol-ju would have missed her quota.

908
01:00:37,476 --> 01:00:38,727
It would have been a disaster.

909
01:00:39,311 --> 01:00:41,813
It took you five minutes
to find all the necessary information.

910
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:47,611
About Joo Sang-cheol...

911
01:00:47,861 --> 01:00:52,199
It didn't seem like he was killed
by a human being.

912
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:53,867
-Really?
-Yes.

913
01:00:55,035 --> 01:00:56,328
I think

914
01:00:57,579 --> 01:00:59,498
he was killed by the evil spirit
that escaped.

915
01:00:59,581 --> 01:01:00,999
Should I look into it?

916
01:01:01,082 --> 01:01:03,293
No, don't worry about that.

917
01:01:04,044 --> 01:01:06,004
You should focus on Weol-ju.

918
01:01:06,421 --> 01:01:07,923
If she fails to help 100,000 people,

919
01:01:08,006 --> 01:01:09,966
she'll get dragged away
to the Hell of Extinction.

920
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:11,134
Yes, you're right.

921
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:14,095
But what if he's trying to hinder us?

922
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:15,430
Why would you think that?

923
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:17,641
I'm sure it was a coincidence.

924
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:21,436
I'll look into Joo Sang-cheol's death,
so you should get going now.

925
01:01:23,104 --> 01:01:25,649
Okay. I'll leave you to it then.

926
01:01:31,947 --> 01:01:33,657
-Bye the way, sir.
-Yes?

927
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,700
Why aren't you eating noodles?

928
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:39,246
Must I eat noodles?

929
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:42,290
This is the first time you didn't
eat noodles at a convenience store.

930
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:45,043
Oh, I already had some.

931
01:01:45,627 --> 01:01:48,129
That's probably why.
I think I had some already.

932
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:50,465
Yes, you're probably right.

933
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:54,511
Okay then. I'll be off now.
Take care of yourself.

934
01:02:12,737 --> 01:02:13,947
Kang-bae.

935
01:02:16,324 --> 01:02:17,242
Ms. Weol-ju.

936
01:02:18,743 --> 01:02:20,954
I was just about to go see you.

937
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,289
Why did you do that?

938
01:02:23,665 --> 01:02:24,499
Do what?

939
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,419
Samsin came to my workplace earlier.

940
01:02:27,502 --> 01:02:28,837
And I saw

941
01:02:29,921 --> 01:02:30,880
the contract you signed.

942
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,177
My gosh, she has such a big mouth.

943
01:02:36,261 --> 01:02:39,347
She scared me so much
saying it's confidential.

944
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,893
So did you run over here
because you got touched?

945
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,980
You don't need to go
to the Hell of Extinction

946
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,690
just so you could help me
fix my condition.

947
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:49,733
That's not necessary.

948
01:02:50,317 --> 01:02:53,737
I've been alive for 500 years,
so I don't want to get reincarnated.

949
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,364
Then just go to heaven.

950
01:02:56,448 --> 01:02:58,450
Why would you sign a contract like that?

951
01:02:58,533 --> 01:02:59,367
"Heaven"?

952
01:02:59,784 --> 01:03:00,744
Me?

953
01:03:00,827 --> 01:03:01,786
With this temper?

954
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,414
Whatever the case,
I can't let you go to hell.

955
01:03:04,998 --> 01:03:07,751
Let's find another way.
I'll do everything I can to help.

956
01:03:10,128 --> 01:03:11,588
I'll tell you what you need to do.

957
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,091
Help me soothe the souls
of 100,000 people,

958
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:17,427
fix your condition,

959
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:21,514
and assist me
so I can finally leave honorably.

960
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:24,392
Do me a favor,

961
01:03:25,352 --> 01:03:26,436
Kang-bae.

962
01:03:28,188 --> 01:03:30,190
<i>The reason she's been
doing this for 500 years</i>

963
01:03:30,732 --> 01:03:32,984
<i>is because she wants to save
her child's soul.</i>

964
01:03:41,743 --> 01:03:43,953
Okay, I'll help you.

965
01:03:44,037 --> 01:03:47,540
Okay, great.
From now on, just do as I say.

966
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:51,211
And by the way, make sure you don't tell

967
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,297
Guibanjang and Yeombujang
about this contract.

968
01:03:54,547 --> 01:03:57,717
I have no time to fight with them
over the contract.

969
01:03:57,801 --> 01:03:59,010
You know that, right?

970
01:04:00,178 --> 01:04:01,179
Okay, I won't tell them.

971
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,060
Ms. Weol-ju, what should I do first?

972
01:04:08,103 --> 01:04:09,396
First of all,

973
01:04:10,355 --> 01:04:11,981
go and buy some eggs.

974
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:13,525
We're out of eggs today.

975
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:21,658
Hey, Kang-bae.

976
01:04:22,575 --> 01:04:23,952
What are you doing here?

977
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:30,250
I'm back.

978
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:31,459
<font color="#ffff80">MYSTIC POP-UP</font>

979
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:39,592
I'm glad you're back.

980
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,595
What did I tell you?
I told you Weol-ju will find a way.

981
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:43,972
Right.

982
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:47,475
My goodness, I'm glad
Hyeon-ok got to meet her son.

983
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:49,352
Everything wrapped up nicely.

984
01:04:49,894 --> 01:04:52,439
I heard Jun-u is sick.

985
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,527
Hyeon-ok is going to get tested
for a kidney transplant.

986
01:04:58,153 --> 01:05:00,989
Family members show a high success rate,
so let's wish them good luck.

987
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,742
Her son was very close to dying,

988
01:05:04,826 --> 01:05:07,746
but she finally got to see him
after having waited for 15 years.

989
01:05:08,663 --> 01:05:10,874
I'm sure it was part of the grand plan
from up above.

990
01:05:13,835 --> 01:05:15,044
"The grand plan from up above".

991
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:19,048
Do you think I'll also get to meet
my mom one day?

992
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:25,972
I'm no longer going to think
that they abandoned me.

993
01:05:26,473 --> 01:05:27,515
Who knows?

994
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,727
They might actually be
looking for me right now.

995
01:05:31,978 --> 01:05:34,272
I feel bad for hating them

996
01:05:34,939 --> 01:05:36,357
for no reason now.

997
01:05:58,004 --> 01:05:59,756
I finally get to meet you,

998
01:06:02,008 --> 01:06:03,009
Your Royal Highness.

1003
01:06:49,597 --> 01:06:52,183
You must leave everything to me,
Ms. Weol-ju.

1004
01:06:52,267 --> 01:06:53,476
<i>So you like him.</i>

1005

-Why you...

1009
01:07:00,108 --> 01:07:02,694
Why can't you two leave me alone?
Do I look like a pushover?

1010
01:07:02,777 --> 01:07:04,237
Why would you sign a contract like that?

1011
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,780
Why are you so worked up? Do you like me?

1012
01:07:05,864 --> 01:07:08,366
Was this just work for you?
It was love for me.

1013
01:07:08,449 --> 01:07:11,703
Erase that girl's existence
from your heart.

1014
01:07:11,786 --> 01:07:14,872
She really was
the reincarnation of the queen.
