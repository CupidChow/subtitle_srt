ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,271
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,442
Did you see anything?

4
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,605
Her husband died recently, didn't he?

5
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,864
That's right.
It's been three months and a half.

6
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,368
His grave site is not good.

7
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,619
Bad energy is disturbing
his resting place.

8
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,412
-Bad energy?
-Yes.

9
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,367
He's been yelling at her in her dreams.

10
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:49,626
Moving his grave to a sunny place
will restore her health.

11
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,218
EPISODE 1

12
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,509
Weol-ju, are you on your way home?

13
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,643
Yes. Have you been sleeping well
at nights now?

14
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,681
Of course, and it's all thanks to you.

15
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:03,814
I'm glad.

16
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,984
Has your sister's engagement
been sorted out?

17
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:13,317
Yes. If it weren't for you,
he would've fooled us all.

18
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,780
He had a wife and child on the side!

19
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,703
No wonder some woman
kept popping up in your sister's dream.

20
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,203
Tell me about it.

21
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,710
You have no idea how relieved I am.

22
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:28,879
Anyway, good bye.

23
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,208
-Good day.
-You, too.

24
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,201
I've been praying with all my heart,

25
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,367
but why hasn't the crown prince
gotten better?

26
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,874
Oh, Sacred Tree,

27
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,199
please answer my prayer.

28
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,248
My Queen.

29
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,086
Really? Such a girl exists?

30
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,473
I told you to stop this.
Why won't you listen to me?

31
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,016
How can I turn a blind eye
to an old lady in pain?

32
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,519
I'm glad to have an ability like this
to help my neighbors.

33
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,482
I don't want my fate to become yours.

34
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,856
Why not?

35
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:37,237
I'm proud of myself
every time someone tells me

36
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,858
I brought them life and joy.

37
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,824
-It's electrifying.
-Unbelievable.

38
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,236
You're old enough now.
You should think about marrying instead.

39
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,285
I asked the matchmaker
to find a man for you,

40
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,382
so don't voice your resistance
and stay out of trouble.

41
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,167
But I don't want it.

42
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,133
Love is supposed to be like fate.

43
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,631
Once the love of my fate appears,

44
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,797
I'll get married even if you stop me,
so don't rush me.

45
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,636
Always so naive.

46
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,016
Forget it. It's my fault
for wanting a mature response.

47
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,902
Weol-ju, receive the royal command!

48
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,492
Are you Weol-ju?

49
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,111
Yes, Your Majesty.

50
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,027
I hear that your mother is a shaman.

51
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,371
Yes.

52
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,285
I'm ordering you to read
the crown prince's dreams.

53
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,395
What's wrong?

54
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,403
There...

55
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,695
-There are too many.
-Too many of what?

56
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,992
The vengeful spirits of those
who died in the hands of the royal family

57
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,496
are haunting the crown prince
in his dreams.

58
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,369
What? Vengeful spirits?

59
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,336
Then what can we do to get rid of them?

60
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,973
They need to be comforted instead.

61
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,887
Dig up their remains buried in the woods,

62
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,272
moving them to the sunny side,
and have a memorial service.

63
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,061
How can we find the buried bodies though?

64
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,282
Please spare me a few days.

65
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,319
I will listen to each of the spirits
and tell you where.

66
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,995
Sure. Go ahead.

67
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,290
To save the crown prince's life,
I'm willing to do anything.

68
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,404
You won't enter his chambers again?

69
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,768
Yes, I've comforted
the vengeful spirits haunting him

70
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:08,452
and his dreams seem
to be more pleasant now.

71
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,027
You're right.

72
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,786
There's color back on his face again
and he's even smiling now.

73
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,953
I couldn't be more grateful.

74
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,331
You saved him.

75
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,673
No, you save the royal family.

76
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,246
I'll compensate you well.

77
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,760
That's not necessary.

78
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,304
I'm glad I was able to help His Highness.

79
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,297
Still, it'd be wrong of me
not to thank you.

80
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,879
Your Highness,
now that you're back to full health,

81
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:08,255
His Majesty has ordered you
to proceed with your studies again.

82
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,342
Your Highness?

83
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,141
Doesn't he seem odd to you?

84
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,270
He smirks at odd moments

85
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,562
and only responds
after he's called many times.

86
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,647
It's as if he's bewitched.

87
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,317
I feel awful.

88
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,815
He's been this way for several days now,

89
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,914
but the physician said he's fine.

90
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:35,946
Could it perhaps

91
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,164
be a side effect
of the human dream catcher's service?

92
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,589
Bring Weol-ju back here.

93
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:54,296
That minx, Weol-ju, now has it good
after her trip to the palace.

94
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,505
I hear she scored
a large sum of valuables.

95
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,716
No way.

96
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,465
She got all that
for yapping about some dreams?

97
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,229
She probably serviced
the crown prince well every night.

98
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,612
I think she wants to become his concubine.

99
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,769
-What?
-That minx

100
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,397
must've seduced him in his dreams!

101
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,105
How else could the crown prince
be mesmerized by her?

102
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,566
She got him so good

103
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,407
that he comes by
to see her every night now.

104
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,374
I knew it. Those born of lowly status

105
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,325
only know how to sell their bodies.

106
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,575
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

107
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,275
Why are you telling me
to dress in your clothes?

108
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,580
Go to your uncle's in Suwon.
You're running out of time.

109
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:07,712
-You need to tie your hair in a bun.
-A bun, too?

110
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,094
Mother, why are you being this way?

111
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,339
People will point fingers
if an unmarried girl

112
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,591
ties her hair in a bun.

113
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,843
Why would they?

114
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,588
A wedding isn't the only confirmation
of a marriage.

115
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,218
What matters is love.

116
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,095
You knew?

117
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,612
I'm sure you're aware
of the vicious rumors.

118
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,071
Everyone's out
to put your neck on a stick now

119
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,856
which means
you can no longer stay in Hanyang.

120
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,618
Leave and don't look back.

121
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,950
But why are you

122
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,162
making me leave alone?

123
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,958
You won't be alone.

124
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,803
Whenever you need strength,

125
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,892
hold this <i>binyeo</i> tightly.

126
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,715
It will bring you the person

127
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,226
you desperately seek.

128
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,484
Tell me.

129
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,314
Have I ever been wrong?

130
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,201
Fire!

131
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,623
-There's a fire.
-My goodness.

132
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,372
-Fire!
-That house is on fire.

133
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,165
Everybody, there's a fire.

134
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,788
-Oh, dear!
-Fire!

135
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,767
Mother!

136
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,774
Mother, no.

137
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,436
Mother, please open your eyes.

138
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,650
Mother.

139
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,527
Please don't die.

140
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,357
Mother...

141
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,951
It's all my fault.

142
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,789
I'm so sorry.

143
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,706
Mother, no...

144
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,375
No!

145
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,348
Even in my death...

146
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,887
Even in my death, I will curse you all.

147
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,713
But I didn't order this.

148
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,835
It's a freebie for the first customer,
so eat what I give you.

149
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:48,763
Any drink?

150
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,675
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

151
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,011
You can have Like a Boss.

152
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,269
Why's that?

153
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,266
You spent all day being tossed around,

154
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,691
so you should at least drink like a boss.

155
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:07,315
<i>Bloodshot eyes, chapped lips,</i>
<i>and a yellow complexion.</i>

156
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,901
<i>She's had a nervous breakdown.</i>

157
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,451
<i>A grubby shirt and trembling hands too?</i>

158
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,413
<i>And those dark circles.</i>

159
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,622
Fine. I choose you today!

160
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,369
Sorry?

161
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,619
It's nothing.

162
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,504
Go ahead and drink. Bottoms up.

163
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,349
So what's going on?
You seem deeply troubled.

164
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,215
Does it show?

165
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,267
Of course. I'm no noob, you know.

166
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,440
I can tell by how you grab your glass.

167
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,937
-Well...
-<i>Go on. Lay it on me.</i>

168
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,491
Forget it. It's nothing.

169
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,037
That rotten face tells me
it isn't nothing.

170
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,539
Now, spill it!

171
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,669
You see, at my job...

172
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,630
What about your job?

173
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,182
It's nothing.
I guess that's how life is, right?

174
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,642
I shouldn't stress over it

175
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,563
and be glad I'm still physically healthy.

176
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,345
Forget it. Pay up before you eat.

177
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,266
You said it was on the house.

178
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,816
Why look for freebies
when you're physically fine?

179
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,730
Pay up!

180
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,740
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

181
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,782
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR 99990

182
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,493
Getting up to 100,000 is no joke, is it?

183
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,041
Serves you right for hanging yourself
to die on the Sacred Tree.

184
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:50,707
Guibanjang, you say that
like I've caused you some inconvenience.

185
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,376
If you had killed yourself
on some random tree,

186
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,965
we wouldn't have to do this.

187
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,180
And now I'm here to oversee you.

188
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,756
I went from catching ghosts
to peeling onions.

189
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,387
How is this not messed up?

190
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,016
Jeez, my eyes burn.

191
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,564
Suicide doesn't involve rational thinking.

192
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,484
Anyway, I thought about it,
and a bar won't cut it.

193
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,937
I should get into a different line
of business.

194
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,068
-How about I start my own online channel?
-What?

195
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,908
A lot of people pour out
their worries via chat.

196
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,075
They don't need to come
all the way here,

197
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,667
so it sounds perfect.

198
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,996
That's only for people
who are gifted in that way.

199
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,665
You really don't know.

200
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,549
"Greetings, guys. I'm your host Weol-ju.

201
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,930
Onion peeling Guibanjang,
thanks for the donation.

202
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,227
You'll hit like
and press subscribe, right?"

203
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,113
I sure am tempted to squash you.

204
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,147
No wonder people leave
all sorts of hateful comments.

205
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,106
-What?
-They can't physically hurt people,

206
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,407
so they use their words.

207
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,279
-Look at my fist trembling too.
-What?

208
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,076
Onions aren't balls.

209
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,423
Look at you. You've gotten better at that.

210
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,961
Are you kidding me?

211
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,470
Do you have any idea
how much pressure I'm under?

212
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,379
I need to report to the higher-ups.

213
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,548
And you do. I haven't been slacking off.

214
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,893
That can only be proved
with your achievements,

215
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,270
but you haven't even opened the door
to the Dream World for six months.

216
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,645
Tell them to try themselves.

217
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,361
It's not easy
to infiltrate a human's dreams

218
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,692
and calm their worries.

219
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,567
If only they knew what I've been through.

220
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,525
DREAM WORLD: HEUNGBU'S STORY

221
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,617
<i>Little by little</i>

222
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,662
<i>We saw and saw</i>

223
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,576
<i>Bring us the treasure</i>

224
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,035
<i>Present the treasure</i>

225
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:52,955
What the...

226
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,550
Why? What did I even do?

227
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,216
As if you don't know.

228
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,150
What's wrong is you being a selfish
and greedy bastard.

229
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,859
Kicking your brother out,
taking your father's inheritance,

230
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,820
and slapping him
when he asked for help.

231
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,070
That's not all. Blinded by greed,
you snapped a swallow's leg.

232
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,873
Now, do you know what you did wrong?

233
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,997
Chun-hyang, just look
at the state you're in.

234
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,793
I can't stand it anymore.

235
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,134
-What?
-Look.

236
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:41,679
One can't possibly tell
if Lee Mong-ryong is coming back or not,

237
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,428
so why must I wait like this?

238
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,676
He could've died
on his way to the state exam

239
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,104
or locked eyes with another girl there.

240
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,563
How can I know what happened?

241
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,944
Still, maybe you should wait
a while longer.

242
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,113
I should tell the governor straight away

243
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,994
that I'm down for tonight.

244
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,449
Chun-hyang!

245
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,779
Let's not make any hasty decisions.

246
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,525
Have a drink for now
and readdress your situation.

247
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,754
I see this is the good stuff
you've been stashing away.

248
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,165
This is the bomb.

249
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,505
No way.

250
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,054
Jeez, that's good.

251
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,770
I didn't expect him to pop up in my dream.

252
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:43,494
The paper flower hat must mean
that he passed the state exam.

253
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:45,818
All right.

254
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:50,658
I've been waiting all this time,
so I can wait some more.

255
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,042
Here comes the royal inspector!

256
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,430
General MacArthur,
you're drinking more than usual today.

257
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,728
I can think of nothing better
to solve your issues.

258
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,903
MACARTHUR

259
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,863
It's a sweet soju and beer cocktail.

260
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Go ahead. Bottoms up.

261
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,218
I went to all that trouble

262
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,603
to help out 99,990 cases,

263
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,641
but you're telling me
that I've achieved nothing?

264
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,225
You must have a death wish.

265
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,859
Still, you need to help out ten more
and complete the count.

266
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,699
Also, be more polite to your customers.

267
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,909
It's as if you're bullying them
to tell you their worries.

268
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,411
How will that ever work?

269
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,079
Being too nice
will only make them back off more.

270
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,673
Getting people to spill their guts
over a drink?

271
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,128
That's old news now.

272
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,038
People these days
don't spill their stories easily.

273
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,708
Also, I've been visiting people
in the Dream World

274
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,337
to appease their souls.

275
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,304
How does one get politer than that?

276
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,894
Damn it. If I could,
I'd never speak to these people.

277
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,715
Then at least give out more free dishes.

278
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,637
Everyone likes free food.

279
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,188
I have something to say about that.
As you know,

280
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,521
people don't often come
to food carts anymore.

281
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,937
I can't give them freebies
because they don't come.

282
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,486
How am I supposed to compete

283
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,109
with all these food delivery services?

284
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,817
If the higher-ups ask,

285
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,527
make sure to tell them
that times have changed

286
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,368
and that I haven't been slacking off.

287
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,963
You sure are commanding
for someone with a 500-year sentence.

288
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,416
KAPEUL MART

289
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,505
<i>We sincerely thank our customers</i>
<i>once again for shopping at Kapeul Mart.</i>

290
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:16,012
<i>Kapeul Mart is open today</i>
<i>until 10 p.m. in the evening.</i>

291
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,477
-<i>Second and fourth Sundays...</i>
-Jeju black pork is on sale!

292
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,899
That's 25, 26, 27,

293
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,855
28, 29...

294
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,527
One broke, so it's 29 in total.

295
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,739
You checked three times, so are we good?

296
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,992
-Then...
-Let me check one last time.

297
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,212
HAN KANG-BAE

298
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:49,713
You know, the thing is
my youngest son is 29 years old,

299
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,588
but he still hasn't gotten a job yet.

300
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,888
I see, ma'am. That must be upsetting.

301
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,351
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CENTER

302
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,970
Customer 36.

303
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,563
-Hello. Please give your ticket.
-Here.

304
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,322
That's right.

305
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,570
I am 36 years old.

306
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,489
I met a man

307
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,950
-and was madly in love.
-Pardon?

308
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,043
People may point fingers at me
and call me a homewrecker.

309
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,575
But it made our love become
more secretive,

310
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,497
yet fervent.

311
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,054
Our love was burning hot
like the magma, deep down on earth.

312
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,093
I see.

313
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,100
I will now announce
the kind employee of the month.

314
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,685
All right.

315
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,770
She won it five months in a row.
Isn't that a new record?

316
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,027
Congrats, Mi-ran from the meat section.

317
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,240
-Again?
-I know.

318
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,909
Give her a big hand.

319
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,710
That's impressive.

320
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,375
She got picked for five straight months.

321
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,883
I know. She and I started
on the same day as contract workers.

322
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,178
I bet she'll get
a permanent position soon.

323
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,850
If you're envious of her,
you should do your job better.

324
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,931
Stop chit chatting with customers.

325
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,771
I'm sorry. I'll fix that.

326
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,101
Come on, sir.

327
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,903
Kang-bae might be a bit slow
when handling his tasks,

328
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,320
but his customers were very satisfied
with his help.

329
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,070
It's a quality-over-quantity approach.

330
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,867
Don't you agree?

331
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,458
It's getting late. I have a plan.
I'll get going now.

332
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,003
-Goodnight.
-Okay.

333
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,299
Bye.

334
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,879
Why did he dodge?

335
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,758
Don't tell me

336
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,766
you're bullying other employees.

337
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,555
No. It's nothing like that.

338
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,360
Kang-bae hates it
when other people touch him.

339
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,229
Even at the supermarket,
he's like a loach.

340
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,744
He's really good at dodging customers.

341
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,624
Jin-tae!

342
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,956
Look at you, Kang-bae.
You haven't changed at all.

343
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,996
Long time no see.
I haven't seen you after we graduated.

344
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,375
Right. I forgot.

345
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,721
-Gosh, you're still the same.
-Well, you know.

346
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,354
Let's sit.

347
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,967
You're the first guy
who called me after...

348
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,519
It was nice hearing from you. Thanks.

349
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,602
Don't thank me.

350
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,607
I've been working my ass off
for my business.

351
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,070
And it got lonely.
It made me think about you.

352
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,112
-I'm sorry.
-Shit.

353
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,655
Use this.

354
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,165
Are you okay?

355
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,958
If I'm okay, why would I be here?

356
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,961
I was that desperate that I called you.

357
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,916
Only a ditsy guy like you would be

358
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,087
touched to get a call
from his high school friend and meet up.

359
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,144
No one answers my calls now.

360
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,021
Everyone is so selfish.
When I try to mention jade mats,

361
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,096
-they figure out it's a pyramid scheme.
-A pyramid...

362
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,443
But thanks for calling me.

363
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,483
It's nice to see a friendly face.

364
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,397
Friendly face?

365
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:42,278
I'm just taking advantage of you
because you're easy. Think about it.

366
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:46,242
In high school, you were always
stuck in the corner, looking depressed.

367
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,911
You were a legendary outcast.

368
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,035
I really hated you, too.

369
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,877
Okay. I see.

370
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,301
Hold on. What did I just say?

371
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,632
Gosh, I'm losing my shit.

372
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,838
Hey, I'm leaving.

373
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,763
Damn it. He was my last customer.

374
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,671
SHARE YOUR TRUE FEELINGS
AND FORGE A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP

375
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,259
<i>True feelings?</i>

376
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,885
<i>Will those true feelings</i>
<i>only be beautiful?</i>

377
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,346
<i>Here's what I realized in my 27-year life.</i>

378
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,694
<i>If you want to be on good terms</i>
<i>with other people,</i>

379
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,436
<i>it's better to be in the dark</i>

380
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,864
<i>about other people's true feelings.</i>

381
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,068
You jerks!

382
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,198
Stop. I told you to stop!

383
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,659
Damn it. Shit.

384
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,794
Now, even the taxi drivers
are ignoring me.

385
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,745
Fine.

386
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,130
You must think

387
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,716
I'm a joke because all I do
is smile like a fool.

388
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,757
Shit!

389
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,840
You!

390
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,925
Asshole.

391
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,979
I'm going to kill you!

392
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:41,977
Damn it.

393
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,704
Everyone, try a sample.

394
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,909
We got this from Jeju Island just now.
Jeju pork is on sale today!

395
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,294
Please try a sample.

396
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:54,949
Please try it.

397
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,365
The pork is very delicious.

398
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,456
The sample is always delicious.
It's nice and salty.

399
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,046
Right. This is from Jeju.
The pigs are green tea-fed, so the odor...

400
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,393
Stop talking. Just grill them quickly.

401
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,099
You're pretty slow.

402
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,062
I'm sorry.

403
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,024
You're so slow. That's not how you do it.

404
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,896
Let me see. Which one is cooked?

405
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,273
Let's make layers of meat.

406
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,738
Sir, you must give back the tongs.

407
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,528
Get off me.
Don't stop me from eating your sample.

408
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,243
You're slow and dense.

409
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,533
It explains why you work
at a place like this.

410
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,039
Seriously.

411
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,682
What is "a place like this"?

412
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,886
-What?
-This is my place of work.

413
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,564
Those are my tongs. Give it back.

414
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,807
-Have you gone mad?
-Give back my tongs!

415
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,055
-Give it back!
-Gosh.

416
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,816
-Look at her.
-Gosh.

417
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,608
My gosh. What's wrong with you?

418
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,445
-Give them back!
-Gosh.

419
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,359
Get off me!

420
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,284
-Are you okay?
-Oh, no.

421
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,946
-Is she okay?
-Shouldn't we call security?

422
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,706
-What are you doing?
-Take that!

423
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,588
Hey, take the tongs. Fine.

424
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,046
Do you even earn one million won
with this job?

425
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,716
Seriously. Those born of lowly status
make it obvious about their place.

426
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,096
I bet you didn't study
when you were in school.

427
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,693
And now that you're old,
you're grilling meat here.

428
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,229
All you've got is that temper.

429
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,482
You ought to know your place.
How dare you?

430
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,895
Do you even know who I am?

431
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,372
Gosh.

432
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,302
You're the one
with a lowly status and vulgar mouth.

433
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,208
You're a beggar who wants
to fill his stomach with free food.

434
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,760
No.

435
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,591
At least, beggars show respect
to those who feed him.

436
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:17,597
How dare you disrespect her
when you're mooching off of her?

437
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,180
You're no better than a beggar.

438
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,402
-Goodness.
-What was that?

439
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,824
-Is he okay?
-Oh my gosh.

440
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,663
-It looks like he's hurt.
-This is awful.

441
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,206
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

442
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,253
-Oh, no.
-What happened?

443
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,382
-I think he's hurt.
-Gosh.

444
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,999
Why are there so many lunatics here?

445
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,377
Get me your supervisor!

446
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,674
Yes, I'm here.

447
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,304
I'm sorry, sir.

448
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,051
It seems
we've poorly trained our employees.

449
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,219
Ms. Song, because a few people
complimented on your work,

450
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,267
you have misjudged your place.
Do you want to get fired?

451
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:07,191
Kneel and apologize to him.

452
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,397
Sir.

453
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,611
The customer used
inappropriate language as well.

454
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,033
I think they should apologize
to each other.

455
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,073
What are you doing?

456
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,784
You're a contract worker. So butt out.

457
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,084
Mi-ran, kneel right now.

458
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,591
-What?
-That lunatic.

459
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,382
-What will you do for this?
-We'll take full responsibility.

460
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:44,182
Why stop there? Why don't you just tell
people that you're a 500-year-old ghost?

461
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,017
Why don't we put up a banner here?

462
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,772
I lost my temper for a moment.
I let him go, though.

463
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,015
Why did you lose your temper?

464
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,237
Some people might think
you're a vigilante or whatnot.

465
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,105
You said you hated all humans
and didn't want to talk to them.

466
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,827
Right. I hate every human being,
but I especially hated that jerk.

467
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,285
Here's what I think.

468
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,291
I don't think you hate people.

469
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,046
From a very long time ago,

470
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,169
something has been lurking
around deep down in your heart.

471
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,683
How should I put it?

472
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,137
It's...

473
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:30,095
You were born with a nasty temper.
Your temper is beyond repair.

474
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,518
You just have one heck of a nasty temper.
That's it.

475
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,028
What? You jerk.

476
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,649
Hey, where are you going?
Aren't you going to work?

477
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,906
The higher-ups are on my ass. So are you.
Let me go out and de-stress.

478
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,538
Darn it. Whatever.

479
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
No!

480
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,412
Hey, what's your problem? Are you crazy?

481
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,703
If you want to die, die elsewhere.

482
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,163
Are you trying to ruin my life? Damn you.

483
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,843
I am sorry on multiple occasions today.

484
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,426
Get home safely.

485
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,928
Do you have anyone waiting for you
at home?

486
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,766
Like your family or a friend?

487
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:52,899
No.

488
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:00,361
Then, do you want to get something to eat?
I'm hungry.

489
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,601
I don't give out
this special <i>ssamjang</i> just to anyone.

490
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,441
Try it.

491
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,608
It's good.

492
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,030
Isn't life so shitty?

493
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,330
No, it's okay. I'm not the only one
struggling. Everyone struggles.

494
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,833
That's right.

495
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,709
Everyone struggles.

496
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,919
But that doesn't mean
everyone jumps in front of a truck.

497
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,432
Oh, that. I was preoccupied, so I didn't...

498
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,928
You have shitty customers.
They curse at you and go on a power trip.

499
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,352
Aren't you upset?
I'll resolve your worries...

500
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,271
No.

501
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,176
I can put up with that.

502
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,563
No? That's not the cause?

503
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,110
Then, why did you try to kill yourself?

504
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,067
It's nothing.

505
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,906
She's driving me mad.

506
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,872
How many times must I ask her to vent?

507
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,000
Mi-ran, I'm sorry for making you wait.

508
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,843
Aren't you the lady
from the supermarket earlier?

509
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,460
Yes, I'm that lady. Why do you ask?

510
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,087
Thank you. You were awesome.

511
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,603
Where did you go?

512
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,719
Oh, this.

513
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,641
The tongs must have scratched
your chin earlier.

514
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,886
Put on some ointment.

515
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:01,769
Thank you. I should be the one
buying you medicine.

516
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,693
I hurt your face.

517
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,276
My gosh, I'm fine.

518
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,491
No, I don't think so. Let me see.

519
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,252
I jumped in front of the truck
because of Mr. Park.

520
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,922
-Pardon?
-All of a sudden?

521
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,212
You said it was nothing.

522
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,474
If you have some time,
will you listen to my story?

523
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,470
Sure. I have a lot of time.
I can listen to you.

524
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,265
Please try some samples...

525
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,437
<i>As you know,</i>

526
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,614
<i>I started as a contract worker.</i>
<i>To switch to a permanent position,</i>

527
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,526
Thank you.

528
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:54,333
<i>I put up with countless customers</i>
<i>who were rude to me.</i>

529
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,695
<i>But...</i>

530
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,460
Congrats on being the employee
of the month.

531
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,165
Thank you.

532
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,128
I have you to thank for.

533
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,052
So you know.

534
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:08,920
Pardon?

535
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,088
I know a lot about you, Mi-ran.

536
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,101
About a few things

537
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,518
here and there.

538
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:20,435
Right. Mi-ran,

539
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,941
your parents passed away.
Your sibling is retaking the CSAT.

540
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,778
You must switch to a permanent position

541
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,112
as soon as you can
to support your sibling. Right?

542
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,826
Yes.

543
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,910
Then, you should keep
a nice reputation like this

544
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,495
for a few more months. Okay?

545
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,787
Once you do that, I'll switch you
to a permanent position.

546
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,513
Don't you know that I have

547
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,179
the deciding power?

548
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:54,852
<i>So</i>

549
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,520
<i>be nice to me, too.</i>

550
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,894
<i>-Okay?</i>
<i>-What are you doing?</i>

551
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,388
<i>What do you mean?</i>

552
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,358
<i>People might think I'm violating you.</i>

553
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,070
<i>You just remind me of my younger sister.</i>

554
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,646
<i>I adore you. That's all.</i>

555
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,031
-Enjoy your meal.
-Hi.

556
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,252
Oops.

557
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,905
Where...

558
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,625
<i>My life was like a living hell.</i>

559
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,387
<i>I tried my best to bear it,</i>
<i>but once I got home,</i>

560
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,678
<i>I exploded with anger.</i>
<i>I couldn't control it.</i>

561
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,015
<i>But this made me feel more miserable.</i>

562
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,098
<i>The next morning,</i>

563
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:46,765
<i>I had to go to work with a smile</i>

564
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,692
<i>to make a living.</i>

565
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,404
-Thank you. Try a sample.
<i>-That bastard.</i>

566
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:54,355
What? His younger sister? He adores you?

567
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,986
Why are there so many crazy jerks?

568
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,905
-I ought to...
-I ought to pull out

569
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,455
his tongue. Damn him.

570
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,713
That fucker.

571
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,924
Anyway, those who abuse their power
over someone's job

572
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,554
and take advantage of that
are the dirtiest of all.

573
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,338
So what do you want to do?

574
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,335
-What?
-What do you want to do with him?

575
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,678
I don't want to take any actions.

576
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,427
I just want him to know

577
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,595
how it feels to be cornered,
with his backs against the wall.

578
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,571
Hey, go out and turn right.

579
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,662
-Pardon?
-The restroom. Go out and turn right.

580
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,490
Go wash up.
I need to talk to her in private.

581
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,286
Wait.

582
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,035
-Take this and sober up.
-What?

583
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,758
I'll leave you two to it.

584
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:08,845
You want him to know how it feels
to be cornered with no ways to turn.

585
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,110
I got it.

586
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,777
On that note, let's drink up.

587
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,074
I don't usually share this drink
with just anyone.

588
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,578
-Bottoms up.
-Thank you.

589
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,549
Why am I so sleepy all of a sudden?

590
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,854
DREAM WORLD: MI-RAN'S DREAM

591
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:37,782
Mi-ran.

592
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,699
Everyone is gone. Are you still working?

593
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,325
No, I was waiting for you.

594
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,407
What a surprise.

595
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,576
I like this feisty side of you today.

596
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,172
Do you like it?
Should I dial it up a notch?

597
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:04,934
Who are you?

598
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,262
Who do you think?

599
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,136
I'm Weol-ju from Mystic Pop-up Bar.

600
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,060
Why is she...

601
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,846
Damn it.

602
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,575
Damn it.

603
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,535
Don't come near me.
If you do, I'll kill you.

604
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,220
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

605
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:34,806
What is that?

606
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,019
Did I drink too much?

607
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,778
Where did the owner go?

608
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,921
Mi-ran, wake up. Let's get you home.

609
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,170
Mi-ran.

610
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,854
Hey, go. Go!

611
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,181
-Go away.
-What?

612
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,305
Go away! Gosh.

613
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:17,640
No.

614
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,152
Hey. Darn it.

615
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,069
You!

616
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,319
What should I do?

617
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,593
Hey, what is this?

618
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,513
Why are you here?

619
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,723
Exactly. Why am I here?

620
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,387
I thought I entered the bar.

621
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,096
The pop-up bar?

622
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,654
You saw the bar
coming back from the restroom?

623
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,309
Yes.

624
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,606
That can't be.

625
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,901
Who are you?
Did the Inspection Office send you?

626
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,485
"Inspection Office"?
I work at the Customer Center.

627
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,661
Give me a straight answer.
A human can't come inside a dream.

628
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,371
What? I'm in someone's dream?

629
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,962
-Whose dream?
-The girl from earlier.

630
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,539
What took you so long?

631
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:25,174
I told you I needed to de-stress.
My gosh, I feel refreshed.

632
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,916
-What's he doing?
-Wait.

633
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,630
I'm in Mi-ran's dream?

634
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,262
Then, what are you two doing here?

635
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:35,853
Us?

636
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,598
Well,

637
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,194
how should we put it?

638
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,309
We make people's wishes come true

639
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,227
and help them take revenge
in their dreams.

640
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,569
To put it simply...
Right. We're like spirits.

641
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:55,163
We're in the similar line of work.

642
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,576
That's all you need to know.

643
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,331
We solve problems in dreams.

644
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,706
We don't have time to explain.

645
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,129
A human has entered the Dream World.
This is a huge mess.

646
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,215
It's because his spiritual vision
is open.

647
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,471
What? What about me is open?

648
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,648
No way. He's not some kind
of a grand shaman.

649
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:24,861
Right.

650
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,858
His spiritual vision wasn't locked
at birth. He's special.

651
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:34,074
As a kid, people complained
and asked you for favors, didn't they?

652
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,038
-Yes, that's right.
-So you think that's how he ended up here?

653
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,538
It's possible.

654
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,459
He'll forget everything
once he wakes up, so don't worry.

655
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:46,210
So it's all because
of my spiritual vision?

656
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:51,586
If you solve problems,
can you change one's temperament?

657
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,803
Of course. Nothing is impossible for me.

658
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,675
My gosh, that's amazing.

659
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,022
-Then can you help me...
-He's running away.

660
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,810
Catch him!

661
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,934
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

662
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,642
This is why I love my job.

663
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,563
Some jerks think they're above others.

664
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:48,113
And some jerks even mess around
with other people's jobs.

665
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,942
It's exhilarating to see jerks like you
shiver with fear.

666
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,953
Please forgive me just this once.

667
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,868
How does it feel to be cornered
with nowhere to turn?

668
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,656
Someone even tried to kill herself
because of you. Do you know that?

669
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,370
You're not just a horrible boss.

670
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,579
You destroy people's spirits.

671
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:10,998
Get off me!

672
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,462
Let me go!

673
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,674
That darn punk.

674
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,966
-Should I throw him?
-You know the answer.

675
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,137
Throw him!

676
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,691
Please. I swear I'll be kind from now on.

677
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,612
Okay, I'll forgive you this once
since I'm in a good mood today.

678
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,703
So I really hope you better yourself.

679
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,407
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

680
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,164
Oh, my goodness.

681
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,210
Gosh, you're disgusting.

682
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,256
<i>Did Mr. Park really fall off the rooftop?</i>

683
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,669
<i>Lucky him. He'll grow taller.</i>

684
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,717
Don't come inside.

685
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,684
You can't see this.

686
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,938
Mi-ran, come outside. It's okay now.

687
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:17,284
She locked the door.

688
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:20,321
Why? What's in there?

689
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,449
That's the CCTV Control Room.

690
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,866
The monitors are busy
playing her past memories right now.

691
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,498
Are you a fool?
Are you scared that someone might watch?

692
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,585
Are you embarrassed?

693
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,382
Why would you feel that way?
You did nothing wrong.

694
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,585
You're a victim. Don't feel ashamed.

695
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,595
Hurry and come outside.

696
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:47,468
Come outside
and show those footage to Mr. Park.

697
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,017
He should be the one
who's scared and embarrassed.

698
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,608
Don't be afraid.

699
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,994
You saw how they punished Mr. Park
on the rooftop, right?

700
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,162
Do you know he got scared
and peed on himself?

701
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,160
It was crazy.

702
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,463
You just laughed. It's funny, isn't it?

703
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,884
But unfortunately,

704
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,214
this is just a dream.

705
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,722
Once you wake up,
you'll have to punish him yourself.

706
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,225
Hey, forget it. That's enough.

707
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,058
Hey, just stay in there.

708
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,526
Live the rest of your life
getting bullied by people like Mr. Park.

709
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,857
It was completely useless
to take revenge for her.

710
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,410
You really didn't deserve any of this.

711
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,492
My gosh, you have such a bad temper.
Let's go. Come on.

712
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,195
-Let go.
-Let's go.

713
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,038
Gosh, what's with you?

714
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,456
There she is.

715
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,039
I'm sorry.

716
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,500
You still haven't gotten to your senses.

717
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:01,801
Why apologize? Don't be sorry!

718
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,183
What's the name of the bar
you drank today?

719
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,389
Pardon?

720
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,100
It's Mystic Pop-up Bar.

721
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,060
And when you drink at our bar,
you become a boss.

722
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,443
That's what we both are.

723
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,440
Why would you succumb to him?
You should be cursing at him.

724
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,822
Act like you have claws
and growl even if you don't have fangs.

725
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:23,784
You got that?

726
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,318
Okay.

727
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,202
Okay, I got it.

728
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,004
I'll do that.
I'll live like that from now on.

729
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,356
When did I come home?

730
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,826
I must've drank too much.

731
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,167
It's indisputable.

732
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,296
Not only will he be disciplined,
but you can file a criminal suit.

733
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,259
Thank you.

734
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,100
I bet it wasn't easy to tell me this.
Thank you for being so brave.

735
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,610
Excuse me.

736
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,994
I'm sorry about yesterday. I'll pay for...

737
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,610
No, it's okay. I didn't even get hurt.

738
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,826
I thought about it,
and I shouldn't have acted that way.

739
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:55,866
Pardon?

740
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,794
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have treated you that way.

741
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,341
Please forgive me. I'm really sorry.

742
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:05,464
Oh, okay.

743
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,430
Oh, gosh.

744
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,683
-Who are you?
-Me?

745
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,482
Well...

746
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,855
How should I put it? A fairy, I guess?

747
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,727
-A meat fairy.
-What?

748
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,986
I know you like meat. Here.

749
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:29,783
Eat up while you can

750
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,283
instead of causing a scene
at the supermarket.

751
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,954
Repeat after me. "I will eat at home.

752
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,156
The supermarket is only for samples."

753
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:41,787
-"I will eat at home."
-Say it properly.

754
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:44,957
Gosh, it's hot.

755
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,763
"I will eat at home.
The market is for samples."

756
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,549
If you cause another scene,
this crazy lady...

757
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,967
I mean, you'll have to talk
to a very serious lady.

758
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,893
So keep that in mind, okay?

759
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,062
Okay.

760
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:13,908
No one has ever apologized to me before.

761
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,871
Mi-ran, what's wrong?

762
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,706
No, nothing's wrong.
By the way, I'm sorry about last night.

763
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,915
I got too drunk, didn't I?
Thank you for taking me home.

764
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:33,337
-What? I took you home?
-Didn't you take me home?

765
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:38,005
I'm not sure. I blacked out as well.

766
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,481
But it feels like
something interesting happened last night.

767
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,439
Really?

768
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,649
I only remember eating grilled pork
at the pop-up bar.

769
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:50,822
Maybe it's because I ate well,
I woke up today feeling very refreshed.

770
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,779
-Let's have a great day.
-Yes.

771
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,928
What?

772
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,465
It was real.

773
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,845
No, that's impossible.
Maybe it was a dream.

774
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,079
It was real. It actually happened.
It wasn't a dream.

775
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,869
No, wait. If it was real,
then Mr. Park should be dead.

776
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,172
Does that mean
I actually went inside Mi-ran's dream?

777
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:56,184
Gosh, that's totally absurd.
But what about this <i>binyeo?</i>

778
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,776
Why the chopstick? Where's your <i>binyeo?</i>

779
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,864
I left it on the rooftop yesterday.
I should go get it later.

780
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:23,236
We finally made some progress,
so let's drink to celebrate.

781
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,408
Cheers.

782
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,708
-Yeombujang, what brings you here?
-It's okay. Sit down.

783
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,714
You didn't even get up.

784
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,259
What are you going to nag about this time?

785
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,722
What are you wearing?
Is it made out of a mosquito net?

786
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,562
As you can see,
we're having a party right now.

787
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,269
I'm celebrating my achievement,

788
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:47,889
so I figured I should wear
something fitting for the occasion.

789
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,225
It's no time for a party.

790
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,279
I have Yeomradaewang's message.

791
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,396
She sends way too many messages.

792
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:57,986
What is it this time?

793
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,320
Just wait.

794
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,909
Hear me, Weol-ju.

795
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,499
I extended your atonement period

796
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,541
due to your virtuous acts
in your past life.

797
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,915
But that can no longer continue.
I'll give you one month.

798
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:18,259
If you can't settle the grudges
of 100,000 people in that time,

799
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,340
you will perish in the depths of hell.

800
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,011
So keep that in mind.

801
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,313
The end.

802
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,731
What? One month? What's this nonsense?

803
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,145
Let's see.
You've made a progress in four months?

804
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,994
No, six months.

805
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,742
Good going.

806
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:43,121
I sent you here to supervise her,
but you're slacking off together?

807
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,159
Look. Take a look at this.

808
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,946
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR'S PERFORMANCE

809
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,329
Yeomradaewang has been getting
so many complaints

810
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,995
from the judges, so you're done.

811
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,787
Complaints about what?

812
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,464
"All she does in the Living Realm is
to drink and eat.

813
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,167
How can this be a punishment?

814
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:02,007
Stop wasting time and resources
and send her right to hell."

815
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,643
That's what they keep saying.

816
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,510
But that's not...

817
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:06,556
So what?

818
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,930
So she's going to send me to hell?

819
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,733
You know what? Tell her to go ahead.

820
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,568
I worked my ass off for 500 years.

821
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,450
And she'll send me to hell
just for being short a few people?

822
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:24,409
I feel like an intern
who's been slaving away.

823
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,026
-Hey.
-What?

824
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,577
This is an abuse of authority.
It's so fucked up.

825
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:31,911
I'm sick of this shit.
I'll just go to hell, okay?

826
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,878
Go ahead and take me right now.

827
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,288
-Come on.
-Don't even try. Move.

828
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,747
-Calm down.
-What's wrong?

829
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,457
Stop it. Hey, stay there.

830
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,717
-What's wrong?
-Hey!

831
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,338
-Hey!
-You! Who are you calling "Hey"?

832
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,847
And what's with your darn temper?

833
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,600
It's because you're taking way too long.

834
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,400
The term of punishment
for the dead ends after 300 years.

835
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:58,569
But you kept asking for an extension,
so she gave you 500 years.

836
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,776
What?

837
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,449
You're glaring again.
Are you going to hit me?

838
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:10,197
Anyway, try to do a better job.
I'll be off now.

839
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,827
-Good luck.
-Hey. No, wait.

840
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,499
Yeombujang!

841
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,882
I feel like shit because of him.

842
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,179
-A month, was it?
-What?

843
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,064
Yes.

844
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,351
-Darn it!
-Hey!

845
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:47,034
It wasn't a dream. It was real.

846
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:50,199
A dream or reality?

847
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,446
A dream or reality?

848
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:57,752
If it was real...

849
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,627
If you solve problems,
can you even change one's temperament?

850
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:02,632
Of course.

851
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:05,053
Nothing is impossible for me.

852
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,574
Where are you going?

853
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:33,327
I should give out free coupons.
What else can I do? I only have a month.

854
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:35,195
Off to the bridge again?

855
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:38,464
Yes. If I'm lucky, I'll meet someone
who's about to commit suicide.

856
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,336
It'd be great if I have a magnet
that attracts people with grudges.

857
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,010
That's impossible. There is no such thing.

858
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,889
If you have some time,
will you listen to my story?

859
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:57,443
As a kid, people complained
and asked you for favors, didn't they?

860
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,981
-Yes, that's right.
-I found it.

861
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,322
Found what?

862
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,570
-A magnet.
-What?

863
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,817
I found myself a magnet.

864
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,117
No, I shouldn't be here right now.

865
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:14,868
I'll see you!

866
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:43,560
Ms. Weol-ju.

867
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:45,651
Hey, Special Case.

868
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:49,277
-Last night was real, wasn't it?
-What?

869
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,985
You told me you're a spirit
who settles grudges.

870
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:53,493
Can you help me, too?

871
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:56,704
To me, you're my last hope.

872
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,923
I'll be your last hope.

873
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:05,294
I'll do everything I can to help you.

874
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,422
Really?

875
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,335
Yes.

876
01:06:09,423 --> 01:06:10,553
But instead,

877
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,217
I want something in return.

878
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,760
Yes, I brought it with me.
You were looking for this?

879
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,975
This was never yours to begin with.
Not this.

880
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,149
That's not it? Then what is it?

881
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,944
What do you think? Your body.

882
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,145
I need your body.

883
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,285
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

884
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:43,826
<i>Whenever you need strength,</i>
<i>hold this</i> binyeo <i>tightly.</i>

885
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,456
<i>It will bring you the person</i>

886
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:50,263
<i>you desperately seek.</i>

887
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,694
SPECIAL THANKS TO PARK HA-NA,
PARK JOO-HYUNG, AND HWANG BO-RA

888
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:37,597
<i>Sign a contract and work for a month,</i>
<i>then I'll grant your wish.</i>

889
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:40,308
<i>-What if I can't do it in a month?</i>
<i>-She can't help you.</i>

890
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,929
She'll be dragged away
if she can't make it.

891
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,187
You'll be dragged away?

892
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:48,272
I refuse to serve drinks
to a murderer like you.

893
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:50,815
You said we'll help people
and grant their wishes.

894
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,150
<i>You never said we'll scold them</i>
<i>and kick them out!</i>

895
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,235
<i>-I guess Special Case isn't coming back.</i>
<i>-I can manage alone.</i>

896
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,622
If I drink this,
I can enter people's dreams.

897
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:00,868
What? Where am I?

898
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,866
Mom, I'm so scared.
