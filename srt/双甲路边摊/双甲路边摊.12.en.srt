ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,098
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,639
FINALE

4
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,298
-We're in trouble.
-Why, ma'am?

5
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,972
Why do you think? It's Yeombujang.

6
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,305
He promised me he'd catch the evil spirit,

7
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,561
but I can't reach him.

8
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,636
Why isn't he picking up my calls?

9
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,477
He neither texted nor reported back.

10
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,863
What is he up to?

11
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,269
Really?

12
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,534
Didn't he already catch the evil spirit?

13
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:33,565
Who said that?

14
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,784
Kim Won-hyung, that asshole,
is such a headache.

15
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,445
Kim Won-hyung is still at large?

16
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:54,471
Are...

17
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,048
Are you the Sacred Tree?

18
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,676
Come out.

19
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,974
-Don't make me repeat myself.
-Kang-bae.

20
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,265
Stay back.

21
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,515
Stay back!

22
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,901
Kim Won-hyung!

23
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,804
Kang... Kang-bae!

24
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,008
Kang-bae!

25
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,472
-Kang-bae!
-Kang-bae!

26
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,330
<i>But why are you making me leave alone?</i>

27
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,949
You won't be alone.

28
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,655
Whenever you need extra strength,

29
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,830
hold this <i>binyeo</i> tightly.

30
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,384
It will bring you the person
you desperately seek.

31
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,461
I want something in return.

32
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,009
Yes, I actually brought it with me.
You were looking for this, weren't you?

33
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,798
This was never yours, to begin with.

34
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,559
-Not this.
-That's not it?

35
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,927
-Then what is it?
-What do you think?

36
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,190
Your body.

37
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,360
I need your body.

38
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,620
It was you.

39
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,961
It was you whom I'd been looking for.

40
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,468
How is he doing?

41
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,256
He fell asleep.

42
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,482
-Where's Yeombujang?
-He's at the Afterlife Hospital.

43
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,149
He's a bit shook up, but he'll be okay.

44
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,533
That's a relief.

45
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,950
What in the world is going on?

46
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,354
There's something I haven't told you.

47
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,647
What is it?

48
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,031
We had...

49
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,236
We had a baby back then.

50
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,990
What?

51
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,911
What do you mean by that?

52
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,460
I didn't know either.

53
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,578
I only found out after I died.

54
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,959
That's when I also found out
that the Sacred Tree's bad luck

55
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,550
entered our baby's body.

56
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,432
-"Sacred Tree"?
-Because of that,

57
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,509
our baby was cursed to reincarnate
and struggle life after life.

58
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,394
I didn't have a choice.

59
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,929
I had to settle 100,000 grudges

60
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,595
in order to give our baby peace.

61
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,807
Hold on.

62
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,612
Are you saying...

63
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,158
Yes.

64
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,454
Our baby's spirit

65
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,663
is in Kang-bae.

66
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,041
He's...

67
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,299
How could I have not known?

68
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,181
He came asking for help
because his life was so tough,

69
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,926
so why couldn't I recognize him?

70
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,887
He was abandoned
by his family and friends.

71
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,149
People would swarm around him
and ramble about their sorrows.

72
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,903
That was all my fault.

73
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,610
But the fact

74
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,815
that I tried to use him to my advantage

75
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,989
makes me feel...

76
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,263
We're responsible

77
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,722
for what's happened to him.

78
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,848
If his special case is rooted
in the Sacred Tree

79
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,429
and not the Door of Spiritual Vision,

80
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,723
then the kiss...

81
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,597
The kiss with the Cinnabar will be useless

82
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,185
until we can settle
the Sacred Tree's grudge.

83
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,400
Then we have no choice
but to settle 100,000 grudges.

84
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,029
Yes. That's the only way.

85
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,568
We must succeed at all costs.

86
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,394
So that kid is the son of the Crown Prince
and Weol-ju?

87
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,533
You should just lie down and rest.

88
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,607
No. Today's the last day.
I should help out.

89
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,663
I heard Guibanjang left
early in the morning.

90
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,159
Yes. How are you feeling?
Are you really okay?

91
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,122
Yes. I just have a few minor bruises,
that's all.

92
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,497
By the way, what happened?

93
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,172
Did the evil spirit
exit Yeombujang's body?

94
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,131
Yes, but we don't know what he'll do next.

95
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,382
Don't involve yourself in something
that seems off, okay?

96
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,224
I won't.
I'll just touch the customers at the mart

97
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,431
and bring the ones
who have grudges to settle.

98
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,810
Make sure you stick with Guibanjang.

99
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,969
PHARMACY

100
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,561
Hello, may I have some headache pills?

101
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,601
My head's killing me.

102
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,531
What's the point of making money
through selling medicine?

103
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,529
-Sorry?
-My wife got into a pyramid scheme

104
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,992
and brought home all sorts of medicine.

105
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,004
Kang-bae.

106
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:07,997
Yeo-rin.

107
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,800
Who is she?

108
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,966
This is Kim Da-bin. We live together.

109
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,879
This is Kang-bae. Say hi.

110
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,137
It's nice to meet you. I'm Han Kang-bae.

111
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,350
Hello. Just like she said,
you're very handsome...

112
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,728
But so what?

113
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,855
Thanks to you,
I'm so irritated these days.

114
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,270
Sorry?

115
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,738
Your relationship needs to progress more.

116
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,239
Don't you know that she lives alone?

117
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,740
No one's going to nag her

118
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,822
for spending the night out.

119
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,617
How could you be so clueless?

120
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
What's gotten into you?

121
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,197
I'm sorry.
I don't know why she's acting this way.

122
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,415
-Are you insane? See you later.
-What?

123
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,499
Okay.

124
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,222
FOR EMPLOYEES ONLY

125
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,472
What's going on?

126
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,814
I didn't even touch them, but they...

127
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,149
A spiritual vision

128
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,729
is like a passage that connects
the Living Realm with the Afterlife.

129
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,646
You're a special case
whose spiritual vision is still intact.

130
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:21,065
Working with us might cause
your spiritual vision to expand.

131
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,617
Well, it could cause people

132
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,502
to spill their guts out

133
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,499
from just brushing against you
or just looking at you.

134
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,010
Wait a minute!

135
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,274
I don't know what your story is, but...

136
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,942
He was just working out.

137
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,121
It must be tough for you.

138
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,290
Feel free to tell me about your worries,

139
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,288
-and I'll do my best to help...
-Go away!

140
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,620
Come on. Let's just chat for a bit.

141
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,616
Go!

142
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,467
Excuse me...

143
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,393
Damn it. I'm not interested.

144
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,596
Did you bring the money?

145
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,521
Hey!

146
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,022
You little fuckers!

147
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,782
Leave before I beat you up!

148
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,776
Here. Are you okay?

149
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,566
-I'm okay.
-Hold on!

150
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,198
Tell me about your worries, you asshole!

151
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,083
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

152
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,875
I couldn't find any. None.

153
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,549
Me neither. We're running out of time.

154
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,125
For now, let's focus on those
who visit our bar.

155
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,176
We should. Let's go inside.

156
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,096
-My mom caught me watching porn!
-I can't live with

157
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,389
-my mother-in-law anymore!
-They won't know I lied, right?

158
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,057
-Please say something.
-Listen to me.

159
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,352
What is all this? What's going on?

160
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,268
Guys, help me!

161
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,520
This will do.

162
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,320
My goodness.

163
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,202
We need to prepare for business,
so please leave!

164
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,070
Go outside. Please leave.

165
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,953
-I came a long way. Please hear me out.
-I'm sorry.

166
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,615
-You can wait outside.
-Hear me out.

167
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,214
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

168
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,249
Just one look at your eyes,

169
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,922
and they spill their worries?

170
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,843
Yes.

171
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,423
Then you should've run away,
not bring them here.

172
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,428
I thought maybe one of them
had a grudge to settle.

173
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,715
My god.

174
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,760
So? You allowed them to ramble on and on?

175
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:52,846
Yes.

176
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,349
But none of them really had any grudges.

177
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,605
-What is it?
-What's wrong?

178
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,991
Oh, no! He's burning up.

179
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,618
You should go home.
Have some medicine and rest.

180
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,699
But...

181
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,953
Don't worry about us and just rest up.

182
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,161
What if you collapse again?

183
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,044
-Go on, now.
-Let's go.

184
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,170
Goodbye.

185
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,948
I don't know what to say.

186
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,075
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,408
What can we do? It's already in the past.

188
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,995
By the way,
did you find your final customer?

189
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,495
No, not yet.

190
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,166
We don't know when and in whose body
Won-hyung will show himself again.

191
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:10,216
We're too anxious
to hear out our customers.

192
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,182
But then again,
we have no time to catch him.

193
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,233
There's nothing we can do,
so we can't focus either.

194
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:21,397
I guess I've given you an extra burden.

195
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,232
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:30,486
Oh. But there is one way
to solve both of these problems.

197
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,374
I can be

198
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,622
your final customer.

199
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,789
-"Final customer"?
-"Final customer"?

200
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,419
If I were to ask you

201
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,089
to settle my grudge
in failing to raise my son properly,

202
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,712
would it be too brazen of me?

203
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:55,509
I was too immersed and dedicated
to my role as the Crown Prince's mentor

204
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,098
to pay attention

205
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,022
to my own son.

206
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,944
Your Highness,
you seem to be happier these days.

207
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,779
-Is that so?
-Yes, Your Highness.

208
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,698
<i>I always told my son
about the kind of king he should become</i>

209
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,735
<i>and how he should serve him.</i>

210
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,080
<i>But I never asked him about the interests</i>

211
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,497
<i>or wishes he had.</i>

212
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,420
He was a good-natured boy.

213
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,258
I was too neglectful.

214
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,428
The wickedness he caused you and Weol-ju
was probably deeply rooted

215
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,601
in his desire to take revenge on me.

216
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,557
How can we settle your grudge?

217
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,734
Please bring him to me.

218
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,447
Let me ask him for forgiveness

219
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,079
and also take responsibility
for the sins he's caused.

220
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,619
Please do understand the heart

221
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,000
of this incompetent father.

222
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,716
Okay.

223
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,894
We'll do it.

224
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,740
Kang-bae.

225
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:22,865
Kang-bae.

226
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,501
-Kang-bae.
-Kang-bae.

227
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,550
Hello, Miss.

228
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,966
Have some more ribs.

229
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,050
Okay.

230
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,269
It's really tasty.

231
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,267
So catching the evil spirit...

232
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,691
Catching Yeombujang's son
is your last task?

233
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,743
Yes. Today was our last day
running the bar.

234
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,066
You've done your part. Here.

235
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,704
What do you mean?

236
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,831
I can see spirits too,
so I'll help you look for him.

237
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,699
Look at you. You almost died yesterday.

238
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,206
She's right.
He's not like the ones you've met.

239
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,539
Staying out of this
will be your way of helping us.

240
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,295
-Then this is...
-Our farewell party.

241
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,053
We came here to feed you
for the last time.

242
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,797
Your special case

243
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,928
will probably be fixed
in a couple of days,

244
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,095
so don't worry.

245
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,522
Thank you for everything.

246
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,779
If it hadn't been for you,
we wouldn't have come this far.

247
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,858
You don't have to thank me.
It was only for a month.

248
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,397
You have been doing this for 500 years.

249
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,117
You said you're doing this
to protect the person you love.

250
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,078
I'm sure that person will appreciate
what you've gone through.

251
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,552
It's really delicious.

252
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,059
I'm going to miss
your pancakes, meat, <i>japchae</i>,

253
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,388
and everything else.

254
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,394
You can find them at Kapeul Mart.

255
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,766
Just buy them yourself.

256
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,230
No, I meant you two.

257
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,069
I'm going to miss you two terribly.

258
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,204
Damn it.

259
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,826
I dozed off again.

260
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,750
<i>On your mark, get set, go!</i>

261
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,060
Don't!

262
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,773
Lower your voice, will you?

263
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,225
Do you really have to make loud noises
when your son's preparing for college?

264
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,936
He's the one preparing, not me.

265
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,066
Give it to me. I was having a good laugh.

266
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,453
I should throw away that junk.

267
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,320
Why don't you just go outside, then?

268
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,367
Your voice is even louder, ma'am.

269
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:53,121
I don't want to hear it. Give this to him.
Don't bother him and come right out.

270
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,333
-Here I go. I'll pass it.
-Go forward.

271
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,535
Pass it forward.

272
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,706
There.

273
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,054
Here I go.

274
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,258
-They have strong defense.
-Son Heung-min got it again!

275
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,261
Kick it, Dad! Shoot it!

276
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,980
Goal, my foot.

277
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,274
What is going on here?

278
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,395
You should be studying, not playing games.

279
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,862
It's a waste of time.

280
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,402
I only played so you'd stop.

281
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,775
I truly wanted to study,

282
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,112
but he wanted to play.

283
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:31,447
I should've known.
I can't take my eyes off of you guys.

284
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,747
You little punk.
Did you get the mock test results yet?

285
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,960
I did.

286
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,289
You punk.
You should've handed it to her sooner.

287
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,667
Be quiet.

288
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:43,876
Here you go.

289
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:53,057
My, oh, my. What is all this?

290
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,599
My handsome prince
came top of the class in all subjects.

291
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,265
Well done.

292
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,523
I'm flattered.

293
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,113
I just studied hard to repay you

294
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,230
for all the love and care you've given me.

295
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,777
Aren't you just the best?

296
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:11,031
He takes after me,
so he's kind, good-looking, and smart!

297
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,616
Look at you. That's absurd.

298
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,372
Haven't you heard of doppelgangers before?

299
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,123
Copy and paste.

300
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,463
I don't know about the other things,
but he looks exactly like me.

301
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,753
Don't we look like twins?

302
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,457
Twins, my foot.

303
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,721
Kang-bae, you tell us.

304
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,336
Whom do you take after?

305
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,474
Why am I so hungry all of a sudden?

306
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,096
Hey! Answer me first!

307
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,854
Give him a break, will you?

308
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,475
Kang-bae, why can't you say that it's me?

309
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,170
So...

310
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,042
This is near Won-hyung's home base?

311
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,167
Are you sure?

312
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,505
Yes, the information
came from a reliable source.

313
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,840
I also sensed an evil spirit there.

314
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,215
Let's head over there.

315
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,559
-Weol-ju, stay behind.
-Why?

316
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,149
There's no need to give him what he wants.

317
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,938
Still, it's too dangerous
for you to confront him alone.

318
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,903
Today's our last day and it must end here.

319
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,319
I'll be sure to capture him.

320
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,053
Just in case.

321
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,259
Stay safe.

322
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,191
My eyes still hurt,
so I took another day off.

323
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,651
I will.

324
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,452
Sure. You too, Yeo-rin.

325
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,541
<i>On the top shelf are
seasoned vegetables and a rolled omelet.</i>

326
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,628
<i>They won't last long,
so quickly consume them.</i>

327
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,755
<i>Those on the lower shelf will last longer,</i>

328
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,430
<i>but for only two weeks.</i>

329
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,219
<i>The beef bone soup in the freezer</i>

330
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,724
<i>must be thawed in the fridge
the day before you reheat it.</i>

331
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,687
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

332
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,141
Kim Won-hyung.

333
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,476
It's been a while, Weol-ju.

334
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,693
As if.

335
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,532
You've been hovering around us
while pretending to be Yeombujang.

336
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,157
Yes, that I did.

337
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,447
The tent bar closes today, doesn't it?

338
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,202
I doubt you're here to reminisce.

339
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,330
No, so don't tense up.

340
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,712
If I wanted you dead, you'd be long gone.

341
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,301
But an easy way out is no fun.

342
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,335
What?

343
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,223
Just like in your past life,
you are one lucky bitch.

344
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,217
So many are willing to die for you.

345
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,726
What an admirable mother you had.

346
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,189
Who would've guessed that

347
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,349
she'd have dressed like you
and taken your place.

348
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,515
<i>Capture Won-hyung</i>

349
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,651
<i>and bring him to me.</i>

350
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,947
That's right.

351
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,490
Parents will die for their children

352
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,411
if that could save their lives.

353
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,419
You're the lucky one here.

354
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,079
Even a piece of trash like you
have a parent

355
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,129
who's willing to sacrifice himself.

356
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,924
Yeombujang told me all about you.

357
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,428
He said

358
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,677
you used to be sweet and kind.

359
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,812
What?

360
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,064
He still doesn't know anything about me.

361
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,808
He blames himself

362
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,943
for you turning out this way

363
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,860
and he wishes to apologize.

364
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,649
That is

365
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,029
his lifelong desire.

366
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,915
What? There is no one here.

367
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,762
Are we in the right place?

368
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,348
Who the hell are you?

369
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,215
You lost

370
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,809
the moment you followed me here.

371
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,279
His lifelong desire?

372
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,490
Even in this life, he sold me out to you.

373
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,407
That's not the case.

374
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:17,876
Don't you worry

375
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,168
because I won't kill you.

376
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,174
You should learn how it feels

377
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,724
to be in despair

378
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,102
and to lose everything
you have ever wanted.

379
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,808
Just you watch.

380
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,595
You'll keep trying

381
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,728
to prevent me
from settling 100,000 grudges?

382
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,733
What?100,000 grudges?

383
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,566
That's what means the most to you?

384
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,366
No!

385
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,412
Don't you dare hurt him.

386
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,124
What happened to Guibanjang?

387
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,752
He was attacked while he was out
to capture the evil spirit.

388
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,173
-Are his injuries severe?
-I won't know until I see him.

389
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,799
-Let's hurry.
-Sure.

390
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,348
Kang-bae.

391
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,687
Kang-bae?

392
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,614
Did he go somewhere?

393
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,954
He's not answering my calls.

394
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,631
Over there.

395
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,837
Let's head inside then.

396
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,072
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

397
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,358
Excuse me.

398
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,330
Agent?

399
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,825
Agent!

400
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,081
Agent!

401
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,162
Agent!

402
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,617
Agent, please wake up.

403
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,788
Weol-ju?

404
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,585
Weol-ju!

405
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,085
Weol-ju?

406
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,181
Are you all right?

407
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,644
-Kang-bae...
-What about him?

408
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,599
He was here.

409
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,141
Kang-bae's in trouble.

410
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,276
Who the hell are these people?

411
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,661
Be careful.
They've all been possessed by spirits.

412
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,880
I can hold my own, you know.

413
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,242
I'm quite in a hurry,
so come at me all at once.

414
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,446
Jeez, they're fast.

415
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,713
No wonder the CIA recruited them.

416
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,258
I see they're relentless.

417
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,971
They just keep on coming.

418
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,341
Agents!

419
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,136
What are you doing here?

420
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,773
Isn't it obvious?
I'm here to protect my man.

421
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,482
Do they have Kang-bae?

422
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,661
What a bunch of pussies.

423
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,658
The spirits are no match for the Cinnabar.

424
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,752
Yeo-rin, are you all right?

425
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,376
Yes, you can leave them to me. Go!

426
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,059
Don't you dare.
You're not getting past me.

427
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,977
All right.

428
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,821
Bring it on.

429
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,790
Miss and Guibanjang

430
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,829
won't let you get away with this.

431
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,504
Do you even know

432
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,997
who those two really are?

433
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,546
They're the reason
you had to live in pain.

434
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,930
-They are...
-My parents from 500 years ago.

435
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,269
And the cycle of suffering I had to endure

436
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,187
began with you, not them.

437
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,441
My past memories came back to me
after I fainted.

438
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,823
Even those of the Sacred Tree.

439
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,203
You can't pit me against them.

440
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,454
Those two

441
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,122
spent 500 years trying to save me

442
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,076
while enduring the pain themselves.

443
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,915
That's too bad.

444
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:54,747
If only they knew how you feel about them.

445
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,125
That way, losing you
would bring more agony.

446
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,684
I'm going to ram you into
the spiral stairway, you see.

447
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,307
The spiral stairway?

448
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,277
The son they desperately tried to save

449
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,619
will disappear without a trace.

450
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,542
I can't wait to see
the look on their faces.

451
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,331
Step aside.

452
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,958
It's funny how you didn't
slice my head off again.

453
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,127
You've gotten weaker over the years.

454
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,005
I'm the one who killed you,
so let your revenge be pointed at me.

455
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,303
Only a coward uses others
to prove a point.

456
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,810
But you're using me too.

457
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,062
You're letting me live for now
so that Weol-ju can have her final score.

458
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,648
If I'm wrong,

459
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,323
just kill me.

460
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,777
End me right here.

461
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,864
Do it!

462
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,158
You're coming with me.
Save yourself a little by surrendering.

463
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,654
Kang-bae?

464
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,018
Kang-bae, wake up.

465
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,272
It's over, Won-hyung.

466
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,645
You sure about that?

467
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,487
No!

468
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:01,601
Weol-ju.

469
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:02,769
No...

470
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,062
This can't be.

471
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,903
Once again,

472
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,398
I wasn't able to protect you.

473
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,738
I'm sorry.

474
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,584
Please don't. You can't leave me.

475
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,333
I only just got you back.

476
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,331
You...

477
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,669
You have no idea how much I missed you.

478
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,632
You can't leave me this way.

479
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:38,716
I love you.

480
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,643
I love you.

481
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,608
Thank you.

482
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,598
No...

483
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,192
No...

484
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,270
No.

485
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,527
No...

486
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,701
No.

487
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,327
No...

488
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,432
You should be thanking me.

489
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,521
Dropping from here

490
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,981
will end your cycle of misery.

491
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,393
Miss?

492
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,886
Stay still.

493
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,019
Are you all right? Did he hurt you?

494
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,436
I'm fine. What about you?

495
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,317
Head back upstairs.

496
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,366
Didn't you see this coming

497
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,956
when entering the Dream World?

498
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,341
Don't you know who I am?

499
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,172
I know you all too well.

500
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,091
The sinner

501
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,178
who destroyed the Sacred Tree
and killed her own son.

502
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,101
That's right.

503
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,471
And I spent all my waking days in regret.

504
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,807
For 500 years,
I struggled to make up for my sins.

505
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:33,806
What about you though?

506
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,025
Rather than being ashamed
of your wrongdoings,

507
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,699
you let yourself be blinded by revenge
and hurt innocent people.

508
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,119
That was the only way to get even.

509
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,412
No, that's how you end up in Hell,

510
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,865
which is where you're heading right now.

511
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,840
Will pushing you from here

512
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,920
alleviate some of my anger?

513
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,681
During my 500 years in the Living Realm,

514
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,938
there's something I saw, heard,

515
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,229
and learned.

516
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:20,362
The words we speak
and the actions we display

517
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:21,901
will one day

518
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,815
come back to haunt us.

519
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,326
I won't

520
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,080
make the same mistake twice.

521
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,674
It isn't me bringing you to your demise.

522
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,248
The heavens will punish you instead.

523
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,048
That is the only way

524
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,509
to end this cursed fate
and save those I love.

525
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,935
Death will come for you soon.

526
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:01,357
Until they do, use the time
to look back on what you did.

527
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,487
As if.

528
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:10,116
I will never let you use me
to secure your 100,000th score.

529
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,199
Never!

530
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,171
Miss!

531
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,338
Miss, just hold on.

532
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,127
Let go or you'll fall too.

533
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,933
No way. I'm never letting go.

534
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,855
Kang-bae, open your eyes.

535
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:46,817
Open them and look at me.

536
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,951
Just live your life like you always have.

537
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,833
Be sweet and sincere.

538
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,706
And don't let go of those you love.

539
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,706
All right?

540
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,633
That's more than enough.

541
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,716
You will then

542
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,545
live your life to the fullest.

543
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,725
I'm the one letting go of your hand.

544
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,021
You didn't lose your grip,

545
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,314
so don't ever blame yourself.

546
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,114
No, please don't.

547
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,316
I enjoyed

548
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,235
our time together, Kang-bae.

549
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,539
Don't go.

550
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:38,619
Mom...

551
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:03,979
No...

552
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,162
No...

553
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,997
No!

554
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,682
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

555
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,034
<i>Since that day, I've been having
the same dream every night.</i>

556
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,079
<i>A hand that falls into darkness.</i>

557
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,497
<i>Every time</i>

558
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:06,713
<i>I fail to take it.</i>

559
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:13,085
<i>I say goodbye to the beings that are
neither deities nor humans every day.</i>

560
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:18,756
Thank you.

561
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,761
CUSTOMER SERVICE

562
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,481
Mr. Han, is it getting any better?

563
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,194
I'm sorry. It's still pretty bad.

564
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,475
That's too bad.
I thought it'd go away soon.

565
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,317
If it's too much to handle,
you can leave early.

566
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,784
No, that's not necessary.

567
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,416
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

568
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:03,178
You look very tired.
Do you have a lot to do?

569
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:06,807
Yes, there have been many old couples
getting pregnant lately.

570
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,438
It's the most wonderful thing
in the world.

571
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,650
I hear you'll be born again.

572
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,816
What? Do you want to ask me
what kind of family you'll be born into?

573
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,533
No, that's not it.

574
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,573
Before I leave,

575
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:26,163
I wanted to ask you
if you've heard anything about Weol-ju.

576
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,170
I haven't heard anything

577
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,420
since that day.

578
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,505
You must

579
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,086
miss her a lot.

580
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,484
Hello?

581
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,023
Is anybody here?

582
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,480
Somebody answer me! I'm scared!

583
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,365
My goodness.

584
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,963
Are you hurt?

585
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,431
Did I have a daughter

586
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,431
this big?

587
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,354
Mother!

588
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,813
Mother!

589
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:36,897
Mother...

590
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,692
What are you doing here, Mr. Ha?

591
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,662
Someone told me
my daughter had a car accident.

592
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,778
You're not even married.

593
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,738
That's right.

594
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,618
But I already sent 30 million won
to pay for her hospital bills.

595
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,415
I got a call that my mother
has been kidnapped.

596
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,169
She passed away three years ago.

597
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,587
That's right.

598
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,549
Then what about my money?

599
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,171
I already paid a 50-million-won ransom.

600
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:05,641
Gosh.

601
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,932
How does it feel to lose money to someone
who used your family as bait?

602
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,354
Why are you both so quiet?

603
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:18,646
Weren't you two such smooth talkers
when you were engaging in voice phishing?

604
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,187
Oh, my. You're not even married,
and your daughter had an accident?

605
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,447
-You must have been very surprised.
-I was.

606
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,319
I'm so sorry that your dead mother
has been kidnapped, you little...

607
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,198
I was just trying to make some money.

608
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,077
Can't you make money
without fooling people?

609
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,254
There are tons of other ways
to make money.

610
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,841
I couldn't find any job,

611
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,554
so I thought I'd do this
as a part-time job for the time being.

612
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:44,719
Does that make it okay
to extort money from people

613
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,589
-when they worked so hard for it?
-No.

614
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,886
Do you realize how many people
are holding grudges against you?

615
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:53,561
Let me tell you what you two are.
You two are trash. Trash!

616
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,597
Gosh, you startled me.

617
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,151
You think I miss her?
I couldn't be happier.

618
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:04,237
All she ever does is ask favors.

619
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,159
How could they do this to you?

620
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:09,488
If they went back and reopened their bar,

621
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,907
shouldn't they treat you
to some rice cakes and...

622
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,664
What's that called? A pig?

623
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:19,419
Oh, I mean pressed pig's head.
Shouldn't they treat you to some of that?

624
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,631
Don't get me started.

625
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,170
I wonder what she's up to.

626
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,384
Still,

627
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,970
she'll visit me for the holidays, right?

628
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,024
Of course. When she was
wandering in the darkness,

629
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:38,019
you were the one who filed a petition
to search for her every single day.

630
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,308
She'll come.

631
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,109
She will.

632
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:54,204
Attention, please.

633
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:57,957
A three-minute sale on toilet paper rolls
will start shortly.

634
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,669
Get 2 packs of 30 toilet paper rolls
for 12,000 won.

635
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,800
Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one.

636
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,419
Start! Grab as much as you can.

637
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,176
Get 2 packs of 30 toilet paper rolls
for 12,000 won.

638
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,009
Slow down. Don't push!

639
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,054
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-Slow down!

640
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,388
-Oh, my. Everything's already taken.
-No way.

641
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,813
-You should have hurried.
-I'm sorry.

642
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:20,652
-Wait! Excuse me!
-Wait for the next sale.

643
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,357
You looked her in the eye and ran away?

644
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,321
Just to be safe.

645
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,321
That's strange.

646
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,949
You've been taking your medicine
every day.

647
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,544
Let me see.

648
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,665
No. What if you get it too?

649
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,128
Let me have a look.

650
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,795
You look fine.

651
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,222
It's gone?

652
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,224
It was there this morning.

653
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,386
I have no sty anymore?

654
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,555
You don't. You don't have to wear
sunglasses anymore.

655
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,228
That's a relief.

656
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,806
It took way too long.

657
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,026
My boyfriend is so good-looking.

658
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,450
I missed seeing this face.

659
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,751
Weol-ju, raise your head.

660
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,223
I've been waiting for you.

661
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,221
I failed

662
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,264
to solve 100,000 cases.

663
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,724
Now that you're back,

664
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,311
let me announce my verdict
on your performance

665
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,558
during the past 500 years.

666
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,660
"For making the Sacred Tree
suffer bad luck,

667
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:57,283
you were sentenced to settling
100,000 people's grudges.

668
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:01,037
As you have settled the grudges

669
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,500
of all 100,000 people within 500 years,

670
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:10,881
your son's spirit is relieved from

671
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,091
repeating painful lives."

672
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,142
But

673
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,558
I failed to solve my last case.

674
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,061
No, you didn't fail.

675
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,516
You saved Han Kang-bae
by sacrificing yourself,

676
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:33,068
thereby realizing your long-standing wish

677
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,150
to save your son's spirit.

678
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,624
Does that mean...

679
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,741
You did not waste your 500 years.

680
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,622
Congratulations, Weol-ju.

681
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,133
Thank you.

682
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,670
Thank you.

683
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:01,142
Kim Won-hyung was found next to you
under the spiral stairway

684
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,137
and sent to Hell.

685
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:07,604
You have now accomplished your task.

686
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,766
You are allowed to be reborn
and live a new life.

687
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,572
Is there any life you wish to live
in particular?

688
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,321
Oh, I guess this is too sudden.

689
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,539
I can give you a few options.

690
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,166
A company chairman's only daughter?

691
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,251
Maybe not.

692
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,246
How about top singer EYEU?

693
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,968
<i>The thing is, I like...</i>

694
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,763
Or maybe...

695
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,636
Ma'am.

696
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:42,352
I don't

697
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:45,982
wish to be reborn.

698
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,692
If you'd let me,
I'd like to go back to the Living Realm

699
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,150
and live among humans.

700
01:00:55,193 --> 01:01:01,203
I think I'm finally ready
to listen to them wholeheartedly.

701
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,199
Are you sure about this?

702
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:09,247
Why not be reborn as the granddaughter
of the Hillton Hotel founder,

703
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,424
Paris Hillton?

704
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,922
Yes, I'm sure about this.

705
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,379
All right.

706
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,101
If that's what you really want,

707
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,518
I allow you to reopen Mystic Pop-up Bar.

708
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:32,312
As a bonus, I'd like to give you
a trustworthy partner.

709
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:33,817
A partner?

710
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,650
In addition to taking over
your responsibility unconditionally,

711
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,696
he even rescued you out of the darkness.

712
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,990
You'll be able to rely on him.

713
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:44,741
Come in.

714
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,838
<i>After Miss left,
my special ability disappeared.</i>

715
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,724
<i>It takes me more effort
to understand other people now,</i>

716
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:46,298

how to open up to people.</i>

<i>If Miss and Guibanjang saw me now,</i>

718
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,806
<i>they would be more proud than anyone.</i>

719
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:01,324
Wait.

722
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,154
Hey, try this. Is it too salty?

723
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,700
Gosh, do you expect people to eat this?
Do it again.

724
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,117
I think it tastes good.

725
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,171
That's strange. Did something happen
to your palate in the Afterlife?

726
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,133
Just do it again.

727
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:02,838
Miss.

728
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:05,011
Guibanjang.

729
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,902
I'm here.

<i>Everyone's fate is decided by the heavens.</i>

732
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,666
<i>But the heavens is more easily moved
than you might think.</i>

733
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:48,465
<i>Little things that you say and do
may change your fate.</i>

734
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,887
<i>If changing your fate is called a miracle,</i>

735
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:56,063
<i>miracles may be happening every day.</i>

736
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,849
<i>The miracle of you being alive.</i>

737
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:03,273
<i>The miracle of having that person
next to you.</i>

738
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,442
<i>And</i>

739
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,488
<i>the miracle of being able to have a drink</i>

740
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,279
<i>with that person.</i>

741
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,918
Hey, you're here. Have a seat.

742
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:25,133
It must have been a long day again.

743
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,472
Good job.

744
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:33,967
Here.

745
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,562
Do you want to have a drink with me?
