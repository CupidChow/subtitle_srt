00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,467
All characters, places,
organizations, religion and incidents

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,056
portrayed in this drama are fictitious

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,061
Juliet.

4
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,862
Your smile

5
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,109
blinds me.

6
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,694
Your beautiful voice

7
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,069
makes me go deaf.

8
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,239
Oh, Romeo!

9
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:21,254
Your gaze splits my heart in two.

10
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:26,043
Half of it is yours,
and the other half is also yours.

11
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,379
-Romeo, Romeo!
-Father.

12
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,667
Snap out of it!

13
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,930
I forbade you from loving her!

14
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,644
Father, I can no longer ignore
the cries of my heart.

15
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,429
Don't be ridiculous!

16
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,522
-Follow me, Juliet.
-Father, please!

17
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,693
-I love him.
-"Love"?

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,435
You love my enemy's son?

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,027
That is absurd. Move aside.

20
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,702
I may give you to a dirty Juliet...

21
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,702
No. I may give you to a dirty dog,

22
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,825
but I will never give you to that man!

23
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,832
Hey! I never allowed this either.

24
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,214
I know that dating younger men
is the trend,

25
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,001
but they're a decade apart!

26
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,745
My son can do better!

27
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,839
You wicked Montague!

28
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,303
You evil Capulet!

29
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,554
-Father!
-Father!

30
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,853
Father!

31
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,024
Stop it!

32
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,654
I'm a fool

33
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,149
who's taunted

34
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,988
by fate.

35
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,031
I'm a fool who's given her all for love.

36
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,287
EPISODE 8

37
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,457
Mr. Manager of Mystic Pop-up Bar,

38
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,627
how about you stop gaming

39
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,336
before I break your phone in two?

40
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,007
I'm not gaming. I'm reading.

41
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,312
<i>"Juliet's Temptations"?</i>

42
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,017
It already sounds fishy.

43
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,109
You should take up reading.

44
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,571
This web-novel is the most popular
these days.

45
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,861
I knew it. It's X-rated.

46
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,565
No wonder you were so fixated on this.

47
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,996
You lack cultural refinement.

48
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:27,828
That's not why it's X-rated.

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,788
Philosophical ideas about life
are hidden in this masterpiece.

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,085
In order to comprehend
the many layers of love,

51
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,973
you need to be a full-grown adult.

52
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,182
Hey, guys.

53
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,434
Hold on.

54
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,811
What have you done to him?
What's wrong with him?

55
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,652
He's been acting that way
ever since the dance contest ended.

56
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,978
He's been smiling
from ear-to-ear ever since.

57
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,645
Wait, that face looks familiar.

58
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,526
Didn't he look like that
when we made him kiss

59
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,164
his girlfriend in his dream?

60
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,247
You're right.

61
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,458
That's not true.
It's just that the weather's so nice.

62
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,630
As if. All that dust is suffocating me.

63
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,377
-Be honest.
-You're wrong.

64
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:23,885
Make sure the table

65
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,352
is clean enough to kiss.

66
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,523
Okay.

67
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,599
Yes, make sure

68
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,978
it's clean and lovely.

69
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,645
Don't worry about it. I'm good at this.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,150
I'm going to make some soup
that's so delicious

71
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,607
that people fall in love with it.

72
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,544
You kissed!

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,420
-You kissed!
-You did!

74
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,753
-Come clean.
-Whom did you kiss?

75
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,674
It's obviously Kang Yeo-rin.

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,210
How did you know?

77
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,934
Congratulations.
The last time I kissed was 500 years ago.

78
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,930
Lucky you.

79
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,061
You must be happy. I'm jealous.

80
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,684
It wasn't anything that great.

81
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,765
I'm sure it wasn't.
I bet you only smooched for 0.3 seconds.

82
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,314
Look at how young and virile he is.

83
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:19,187
When people his age lock lips,
there's no end to it.

84
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,487
We just touched lips.

85
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,565
What?

86
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,327
Did anything else touch?

87
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,405
No.

88
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,792
You still have a long way to go.

89
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,253
At least he has somewhere to go.

90
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,344
Take your time.

91
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,000
Good luck.

92
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,510
WATCH OUT

93
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,313
-Have a good lunch.
-Thank you.

94
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,858
What have I done?

95
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,244
I bet he'll ignore me now.

96
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,374
-Yeo-rin!
-Yes?

97
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,707
Did I startle you? Sorry.
I was just happy to see you.

98
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,288
You were happy?

99
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:19,801
To see me?

100
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,420
Why would you be?

101
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,675
Because it's you. We're partners.

102
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,257
And...

103
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,717
That's enough. I'm busy, so I should go.

104
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:32,979
Wait.

105
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,399
Do you want to have lunch?

106
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,901
You want to have lunch with me?

107
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,025
Yes, I'd like to treat you
to something delicious.

108
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,735
I'm sorry, but I'm going to eat
with my friend.

109
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,076
That's a shame.
Then we'll take a rain check.

110
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,906
Have a good day. Good luck!

111
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,600
"Good luck!"

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,890
All the men I've liked so far

113
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,558
ran away the moment we touched.

114
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,477
But this time, you guys smooched,

115
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,647
and yet he's still wagging his tail
whenever he sees you.

116
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,526
That means I don't like him, right?

117
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,781
I was pretty sure you did, though.

118
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,247
Then why did you even kiss him?

119
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,209
It was all because of you.

120
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,880
You said if I was destined
to remain single forever,

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,500
that I should at least kiss.

122
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,547
You're right. I did say that.

123
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:48,176
So it was kind of an accident
because my words triggered

124
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:51,969
all your pent-up lust to burst, right?

125
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,177
Yes, exactly that.

126
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,562
It was merely an accident.

127
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,771
What do you think?

128
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,060
The room is nice,

129
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,518
but I'm getting the chills.

130
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,780
That's just because it's vacant.

131
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,531
It's southward,
so you'll get a lot of sunlight.

132
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,363
It's perfect for one person.

133
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,618
I'm sorry, but it doesn't feel right.

134
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,503
-Goodbye.
-But...

135
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,670
-Hello.
-Hey, Mr. Rooftop.

136
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,299
Wait. Come here for a minute.

137
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,968
We have a vacant room.

138
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,302
Would you like to check it out?

139
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,059
Thank you, but I don't have the money.

140
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,483
Come on. I'll give you a cheaper offer.

141
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,981
How about half the original price?

142
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,901
It'll be much better than the rooftop.

143
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,565
Half the original price?

144
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,069
Wow, it's nice.

145
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,486
It's more spacious than I thought.

146
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,924
<i>Get out. This is my house.</i>

147
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,713
<i>Get out.</i>

148
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,592
What? You want me to get out?

149
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,922
No. You should get it
before someone else does.

150
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,764
<i>I said, get out!</i>

151
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,183
<i>If I see you in here again, I'll kill you.</i>

152
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,733
I don't think the walls are soundproof.

153
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,733
I can clearly hear
the people upstairs fighting.

154
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,985
It's chilly here.

155
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,289
The contract for the rooftop
hasn't ended yet, so I should go.

156
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,198
Thank you.

157
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,581
Wait...

158
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,638
Let's see.

159
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,848
"Ice Witch"?

160
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,017
Who is this?

161
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,440
There's so much mail.

162
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,491
Juliet!

163
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,411
I got myself a job
so that we could be together.

164
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
A job?

165
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,455
MYSTIC DELIVERY

166
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,673
Please don't tell me you're a deliveryman.

167
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,433
Don't worry about
your father's disapproval.

168
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,888
I left my family yesterday,

169
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,348
and I no longer care about
my family's wealth, reputation, or honor.

170
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,142
I'm happy as long as I have you.

171
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,904
But still, you shouldn't have left home.

172
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,147
You should take over
your father's business.

173
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,069
It's worth a hefty sum of money.

174
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,855
Don't you worry.

175
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,742
I also have my own business.

176
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,828
I'm a businessman myself!

177
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,094
Oh, come on. This isn't right.

178
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,958
Did I bewitch him too much?

179
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,670
This is exactly why
women shouldn't date boys.

180
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,008
Juliet Capulet.

181
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,307
I heard that your father's business
went south.

182
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,896
Here. Take this...

183
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,229
and stay away from us.

184
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,441
What do you take me for?

185
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,319
Can you really not understand
my sincerity?

186
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:42,076
Don't tell me you're still going on
about love or fate.

187
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,502
Don't be foolish!

188
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,334
That is right.

189
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,166
I'm a fool.

190
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,626
I've turned my eyes away from the truth

191
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,843
and hid in the shadows like a coward.

192
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,165
But I won't hide my feelings any longer.

193
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,086
It's not Romeo whom I love.

194
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,097
Montague.

195
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,021
It's you.

196
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,688
No way.

197
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,441
My palms are sweaty.

198
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,567
There are numerous twists.

199
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,490
Isn't this so shocking?

200
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,243
But most of all, I love the character.

201
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,076
What an amazing character

202
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,292
-Romeo is.
-Juliet is.

203
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,462
You're amazed by her?

204
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,291
Yes. She's so wise and realistic.

205
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,417
At the mere age of 16,

206
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,014
she knew that love
wasn't the answer to everything.

207
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,550
I should've been like her.

208
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,635
-Hello.
-Hey.

209
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,474
-Oh, you're here too.
-Hey.

210
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,055
Kang-bae, stick the fish cakes
onto the skewers.

211
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,484
Okay.

212
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,847
-Would you like anything to eat?
-I'm good.

213
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,072
How is everything? Good?

214
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,857
Yes, but I guess you have something.

215
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,855
You've been visiting us more often.

216
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,657
Well, I found an evil spirit,
and it's been in full swing lately,

217
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,124
so I was just checking in.

218
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,576
The one that escaped from the Afterlife?
You still haven't caught it?

219
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,415
-No.
-Then you should go get it,

220
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,381
not loiter at our bar.

221
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,301
How could you say that?

222
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,589
I voluntarily came all the way here
to check if you were safe.

223
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,894
I'm warning you to stay safe
since the evil spirit may be around.

224
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,362
CUSTOMER SERVICE HAN KANG-BAE
SECURITY KANG YEO-RIN

225
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,577
Are you that elated?

226
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,409
I thought you didn't like
physical touches.

227
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,406
But that proved to be wrong last time.

228
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,338
Right, you were
very passionate and touchy.

229
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,628
That was...

230
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,798
I just wanted to win.
I had no other intentions.

231
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,381
You can be honest with me.

232
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,795
You dreamed about our conception dream.

233
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,552
I should repay you for that.

234
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,097
-Really?
-Yes.

235
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,520
So come clean.
How close are you two as of now?

236
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,930
Well...

237
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,937
Ever since the dance contest,
we didn't really get to talk much.

238
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,941
I feel like the timing isn't right.

239
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,533
Timing. Life is all about timing.

240
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,779
So you mean you need some sort of a reason

241
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,412
to upgrade yourself from a colleague
to someone she flirts with, right?

242
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,617
Come to think of it, shouldn't we have
a get-together with the prize money?

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,410
Kang-bae.

244
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,792
Let me help you this time.

245
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,179
Here you go.

246
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:47,974
You're a professional.

247
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,313
Someone taught me that.

248
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:55,225
Congratulations to Security
and Customer Service for their victory.

249
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,271
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

250
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,568
-They're cooked now.
-They are.

251
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,038
Yeo-rin, have some.
They're perfectly cooked.

252
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,535
-Okay.
-Hold on.

253
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,923
It'll taste better if you dip it in this.

254
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,554
Guys, let's give a round of applause

255
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,803
to Han Kang-bae and Kang Yeo-rin

256
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,635
for allowing us to gather together
and eat Korean beef.

257
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,351
Han Kang-bae!

258
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,524
-Kang Yeo-rin!
-Enjoy the meat.

259
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,351
Han Kang-bae! Kang Yeo-rin!

260
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,033
What should I do?

261
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,775
I'm trying to ignore him,
but he's treating me so well.

262
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,493
Yeo-rin, have some.

263
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,779
And what about those hands?

264
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,329
They're so white, long, and pretty.

265
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,459
Thank goodness I don't like him.

266
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,329
If I did, I would've grabbed it.

267
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,130
Snap out of it.

268
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,718
Gosh, why would he look at me like that?
Did he think my heart would flutter?

269
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,973
He has the face of a cute Fennec fox
and kept smiling at me.

270
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,136
Gosh, thank goodness I don't like him.
If I did, I would've...

271
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,692
This won't do. I should make myself clear
before he gets even more hurt.

272
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,234
-Have this.
-No, you can.

273
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,242
Yeo-rin.

274
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,325
That one's not cooked...

275
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:40,665
You know, rare tastes the best for beef.

276
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,917
It's so juicy and nice.

277
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,462
You eat so deliciously.

278
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,798
You eat so well. Right?

279
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:51,798
What?

280
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,177
Shot glasses are too small.

281
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,694
She can drink well.

282
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,654
How's your liver so strong?
You're so amazing.

283
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,358
Right?

284
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,321
Before we move...

285
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,908
-Here, have one each.
-Thanks.

286
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,076
You, too.

287
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,293
-Take this.
-Thank you.

288
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,882
Eat it and sober up.
We're going to the karaoke now.

289
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,708
-Let's go!
-Yeo-rin, are you okay?

290
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,340
I should go home first.

291
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,087
Let me take you home.

292
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,764
No, I'm okay.

293
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:35,012
You can trust him.
He'll take you home safely.

294
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,225
We'll be going now. Goodbye.

295
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,604
Let's go.

296
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,859
That's the wrong way.

297
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,073
Be careful.

298
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,355
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

299
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,620
<i>Damn it. How long do I have to pretend?</i>

300
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,752
<i>Whatever.</i>

301
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,418
Kang-bae, I was just pretending
to be drunk.

302
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,587
I think it's best
to make my feelings clear.

303
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,840
I don't have feelings for you.

304
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,552
Right, so...

305
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,102
What?

306
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,805
Then why...?

307
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,061
I do admit that what I did last time
on the rooftop

308
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,903
could've given you the wrong impression.

309
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,308
I'm sorry about that.

310
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,609
The dance contest made me all excited.

311
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,903
I misinterpreted my feelings
and thought that I liked you.

312
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,704
Perhaps, you're wrong.

313
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,907
No one else understands me better
than I do.

314
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,121
I'm grateful for the way
you've been treating me,

315
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,537
but I'm sure you don't feel that way
toward me.

316
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:50,881
After all, there's not much
that we know about each other.

317
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,258
That's how all couples are
in the beginning.

318
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,050
Can't we just get to know each other?

319
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,811
The closer we become,

320
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,219
the less you'll like me.

321
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,601
Then we'll just get hurt.

322
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,976
How are you so certain?

323
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,571
I just am.

324
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,688
I'm that kind of person.

325
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,067
So

326
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,912
let's stop being confused.

327
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,250
I'm truly sorry.

328
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
What?

329
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,943
What did you just say?

330
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,949
You two are getting married?

331
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,280
That is right.

332
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,778
Say hi

333
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,794
to your stepmother.

334
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,498
Hi, Romeo. I hope we get along.

335
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,330
Why are you doing this to me?

336
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,669
This is all a lie, right?

337
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,500
Tell me the truth.

338
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,628
My son. To be honest,

339
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,012
I'm in the last stage of cancer.

340
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,312
-I have three months left.
-What?

341
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,265
I'd like to love passionately
before I die.

342
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,060
Hello, Father!

343
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,016
Hi, sit down.

344
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,652
-Hello.
-I said, sit down!

345
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,105
-Okay.
-Sit down.

346
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,490
What are you looking at?

347
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,485
So I hear that you love my daughter.

348
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,867
Yes, sir. There's no doubt about that.

349
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,081
Mr. Capulet, you and my father
are archenemies.

350
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,463
Will you truly allow this marriage?

351
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,174
Of course! There's no better man than him.

352
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,472
He's wealthy, dying,
and in love with my daughter.

353
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,129
What's there not to like?

354
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,049
No!

355
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,681
Juliet.

356
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,811
What happened to our love? Tell me.

357
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,399
You're my burning heart.

358
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,149
My true love.

359
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,358
What an impudent brat you are.

360
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,526
Watch what you say to your mother.

361
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,947
What? "Mother"?

362
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,581
Yes. From now on, I am your mother.

363
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,963
-What?
-I'm your mom.

364
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,180
No!

365
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,733
This isn't right.

366
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,062
They can't do this.

367
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,306
What do you mean?
This is the right thing to do.

368
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,517
The writer knows
a thing or two about life.

369
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,743
What about Romeo's pure love?

370
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,487
That is the most useless thing
in this world.

371
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:06,196
If Romeo was smart enough,
he would've convinced his parents first

372
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,783
and gained power.

373
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,788
After that, he would've introduced her
to his family.

374
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,831
He's just acting like a whining baby

375
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,044
by being so reckless.

376
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,970
Was he like that? The man you loved.

377
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,181
I guess he was similar.

378
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,314
He didn't care about his surroundings
and only cared about his feelings.

379
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,520
Countless people suffered because of him.

380
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,018
You must resent him.

381
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,114
How could I not?

382
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,529
He sounded like he'd do anything for me
and told me to trust him.

383
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,358
I cursed and resented him.

384
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,284
I'd like some water.

385
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,949
Coming.

386
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,159
Anyway, when will the next episode
come out?

387
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,003
It's the final episode.

388
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,499
You're right.

389
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,670
It should've been released already.

390
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,507
There's an announcement. What is this?

391
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:08,009
"Rest in peace"? What does it mean?

392
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,638
"Due to Ice Witch's passing,
the series has ended."

393
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,020
How could this be? This is absurd.

394
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,855
Does this mean the final episode
of <i>Juliet's Temptations</i>

395
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,531
will never be published?

396
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,903
This is unbelievable.

397
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,162
Hello.

398
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,116
I thought you had a get-together today.

399
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,163
I'm here as a customer.
One soju bottle, please.

400
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,923
What's gotten into you? You rarely drink.

401
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:48,509
So she rejected you
even before you could confess

402
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,006
your feelings?

403
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,061
Yes.

404
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,220
I can't understand her.

405
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,017
Was she toying with you or what?

406
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,851
Then why did she even kiss you?

407
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,109
No wonder she rejected you.

408
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,730
You look so pale for a man.

409
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,951
She said she misinterpreted her feelings.

410
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,699
Also, she said the closer we got,
the less we would like each other.

411
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,243
But then again, what do I have?

412
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,118
What's wrong with you?

413
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,171
I'm an orphan and was bullied in school.

414
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,040
I'm a part-time worker,

415
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,468
-and have been single all my life.
-Hey! Forget about it.

416
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,128
She's obviously the demanding type.

417
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,139
I hope she breaks her nose.

418
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,386
That was a bit harsh.

419
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,482
Not at all. Look at how heartbroken he is.

420
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,099
How dare she judge him?

421
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,477
Should love be conditional? Should it?

422
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,190
There's no point in dating someone
who knows nothing about love.

423
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,357
But you just said it was wise to...

424
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,657
Shush.

425
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,990
It's okay. It only hurts in the beginning.

426
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,868
Get rejected a few more times,
and it'll feel like nothing.

427
00:24:56,953 --> 00:25:00,423
You look like you're destined to live
the single life

428
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,339
until the day you die just like me.

429
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,964
Sir, why have you been talking nonsense?

430
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,668
Aren't you done drinking?

431
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,886
I was about to leave anyway.

432
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,637
You should be grateful for my advice.

433
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,183
Thank you.

434
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,402
Were you able to hear him?

435
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,605
-Could you see him?
-Yes.

436
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,494
He's unbelievably rude.

437
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,028
He's

438
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,162
a spirit.

439
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,326
He stopped by for some udon
before moving to the Afterlife.

440
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,826
He's a spirit?

441
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,245
That can't be. I could see him.

442
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,336
Sir? Wait!

443
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,755
-What do you want?
-Just a second.

444
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,310
I need to head upstairs.

445
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,015
-I'm already late.
-What?

446
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,610
Then are you really...

447
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:28,552
Popping back and forth from
the Living Realm and Dream World

448
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,879
must've widened your spiritual vision.

449
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,094
You're now seeing
those from the Afterlife.

450
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,715
This is the side-effect
you warned me about, right?

451
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,258
You said I'd see spirits

452
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,716
and people would spill their secrets
when we made eye contact.

453
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,482
Is this how it all begins?

454
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:46,556
Kang-bae, this will soon be over anyway.

455
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,936
Once I settle 100,000 grudges,

456
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,983
I'll enter your Dream World
and close your spiritual vision.

457
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,027
That will put an end to everything,
so don't worry.

458
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,824
Right? We only have
four more grudges to go,

459
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,736
so I'll be as good as new again.

460
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,999
CUSTOMER SERVICE

461
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,593
Why isn't he here?

462
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,600
Did he not come in today?

463
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,260
Are you here for Kang-bae?

464
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,523
No, I was just doing my rounds.

465
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,805
Have a good day then.

466
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,107
Just so you know,
Kang-bae called in sick today.

467
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,781
He's sick? Why? Is it bad?

468
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,819
What? I don't know the details.

469
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:40,525
How can you not know
when you're his colleague?

470
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,581
-What?
-Unbelievable.

471
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,624
Why has he fallen sick?

472
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,337
My gosh.

473
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,551
Why are you here at this hour?
What about your day job?

474
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,387
I took the day off.

475
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,179
Why?

476
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,388
Because you couldn't face Yeo-rin?

477
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,307
Yes. And I'm scared that
I'll see spirits again.

478
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,066
Right. Of course you're confused.

479
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,616
Kang-bae,

480
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,447
I've been thinking about it,

481
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,248
and if you don't want spirits
to circle around you,

482
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:32,091
you have to hide the fact
that you can see them.

483
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,838
-How?
-Well, relax first.

484
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:42,467
What you should do
is try not to make eye contact

485
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,724
and don't be startled even if you do.

486
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,104
Also, you should look elsewhere
as if you didn't see anything.

487
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,902
-Close your eyes for me.
-My eyes?

488
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,320
Open them after counting to three.

489
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:01,699
One, two, three.

490
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,280
I'll open them.

491
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,713
Guibanjang?

492
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,209
Guibanjang?

493
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,311
What the hell? Shit...

494
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,649
What the hell did I just see?
You've got to be kidding me.

495
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:40,896
Guibanjang...

496
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,075
You scared me!

497
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,460
This is exactly what you shouldn't do.
I told you to ignore them.

498
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,868
How can I when they're that scary?

499
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,170
This is bad.

500
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,214
I guess I have no choice.

501
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,127
Take this.

502
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,474
It's one of my treasures,

503
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,431
but you can have it. Here you go.

504
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,227
Wait.

505
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,387
Seriously?

506
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,652
Yes.

507
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,284
Not seeing the spirits
will definitely help.

508
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,109
Thanks, Guibanjang.

509
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,701
-By the way, where's Miss?
-Beats me.

510
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,237
She went somewhere yesterday
but still isn't back.

511
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,366
Jeez.

512
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,245
Gosh, this is heavy.

513
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,251
Where the hell were you
and what did you bring?

514
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,923
-Get me a glass of water.
-Sure.

515
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,211
Salt?

516
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,340
My back's killing me.

517
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,428
Are we out of salt?

518
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,052
It's for you, you dolt.

519
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,891
This salt was harvested from
the most pristine village down south.

520
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,305
It's 99.9 percent sodium chloride,
free of impurities.

521
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,105
In other words, pure salt.

522
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,688
That's where you went last night?

523
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,358
My goodness.

524
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,072
What can I do
when he's scared out of his mind?

525
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:08,323
Carry around a handful of salt and
sprinkle it at spirits when you see them.

526
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,738
They'll run for their lives
since it's of good quality.

527
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,962
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble for me.

528
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,167
Thanks, Ms. Weol-ju.

529
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,464
So what's with the shades?

530
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,797
-These?
-Cool, right?

531
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,428
I gave them to him so that
he could avoid eye contact with spirits.

532
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,509
As if he'd be able to do that.

533
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,597
Being the softy that he is,

534
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,890
he'll end up listening
to every sob story that comes his way.

535
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,272
He would've never ended up here

536
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,733
if he were able to turn
a blind eye to people.

537
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,357
Was yesterday the first time
you saw a spirit though?

538
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,074
Nothing weird happened before that?

539
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,526
I think I heard a weird sound.

540
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:51,989
-A sound?
-Yes.

541
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,946
When I went apartment hunting,

542
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,827
I heard her voice telling me to get out,
that it was her place.

543
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,456
I guess that spirit must have
attached itself to the apartment.

544
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,553
But her name was eerier.

545
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,669
I saw the name on her mail,
and it was Ice Witch.

546
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,548
Hold on. What's the name again?

547
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,545
Ice Witch.

548
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,216
That's the author of <i>Juliet's Temptations.</i>

549
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,845
She died recently...

550
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,270
No way. And she got herself
attached to the house?

551
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,814
We might be able to read...

552
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,778
-the last chapter!
-The last chapter!

553
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,528
<i>Dongdongdari</i>

554
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,115
<i>Come out, come out wherever you are</i>

555
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,623
Boo!

556
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,787
Is there really a spirit here?

557
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,460
Yes, a poor soul is occupying this space.

558
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,169
Can you tell me your name?

559
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,052
Oh, my god!

560
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,344
Mr. Rooftop?

561
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,893
Hello, ma'am. My aunt and uncle
are here to check the room with me.

562
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,023
Who's he?

563
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,023
You see, the previous tenant died.

564
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,070
I just had this eerie feeling
so I hired an expert to cleanse the space.

565
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,818
-Please have a look around.
-Sure.

566
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,203
<i>Where could you be?</i>

567
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,701
Guibanjang, can you see her?
She's right over there.

568
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,124
Yes, that's her.

569
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,504
Quiet! Can't you see
I'm talking to the spirit?

570
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,378
The guy seems too upset
to leave this place.

571
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,257
It's so sad that he died
at such a young age.

572
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,046
I'm afraid you'll have
to comfort his soul.

573
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,258
But I died of a heart attack.

574
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,177
She's a young woman in her twenties,

575
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,137
and died of heart failure.
What are you saying?

576
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,226
That's right! The tenant was a young lady.

577
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,984
She died of a heart attack.

578
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,194
Who are you people?
How dare you interrupt?

579
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,107
May I present the Great Lady Weol-hwa.

580
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,365
She trained for ten years
up on Mount Gyeryong...

581
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,199
and another ten up on Mount Jiri.

582
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:05,289
I needed to see the scorned woman
who was giving Hell a run for its money.

583
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,336
No wonder it has been so chilly in here.

584
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,088
Lady Weol-hwa,

585
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,931
I'm glad you're here.
Could you please help me out?

586
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,851
-Why not?
-Thank you.

587
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:21,016
What are you going to do
with that guy over there?

588
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,350
Get out of here!

589
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,646
-I'm just tired today, that's all.
-Unbelievable!

590
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,610
Get the hell out of here, you fraud!

591
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,981
How dare you try to fool me.

592
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,198
I'm just tired these days, that's all.
Hold on a second.

593
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,568
Damn it. There goes another score.

594
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Who the hell are those people?

595
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,463
Hi, there.

596
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,877
You're Ice Witch, right?
The author of <i>Juliet's Temptations.</i>

597
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,301
Who are you people?

598
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,797
If you're here to drive me out, forget it.
I'm not leaving.

599
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,264
That's not the business we're in,
so don't worry.

600
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,060
I know it's not my place to ask this,

601
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,642
but did you write the last chapter
before passing away?

602
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,559
The curiosity is killing me.
Could I perhaps read it?

603
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,817
Must you be so insensitive, too?
She just passed away.

604
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,357
Kang-bae, please.
We're not asking for personal reasons.

605
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:19,235
I feel like we have a duty to
let her grand work see the light of day.

606
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,660
Don't you worry.
We'll make sure it's published.

607
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,251
So where's the manuscript?
Is it with your other belongings?

608
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,004
How about we go and look for it?

609
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,464
Forget it.

610
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,343
Parcel delivery!

611
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,588
It's here!

612
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:59,703
Can you ask the landlady
if any parcels were sent to this address?

613
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,214
Who orders this stuff online?

614
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,791
The same with this.
Shipping would've cost more.

615
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,588
Gosh.

616
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,973
Please know that
we're not here to remove you.

617
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,427
We're here to help.

618
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,691
These two are huge fans of your work

619
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,810
and experts at settling grudges.

620
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:33,975
Experts...

621
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,437
at settling grudges?

622
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:42,866
There must be a reason
why you ordered so many items online.

623
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,624
If it's okay with you,
we'd like to hear your story.

624
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,889
I went by the name of Ice Witch,

625
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,772
the author of X-rated web-novels.

626
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:21,114
<i>Because of my heart condition,</i>
<i>I had to stay home most of the time.</i>

627
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,737
<i>So I didn't have many friends.</i>

628
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,077
<i>Still, I was happy when writing my novels,</i>

629
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,503
<i>because they would take me</i>
<i>to all kinds of places</i>

630
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
<i>and a passionate love was possible.</i>

631
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,335
<i>That's when I met him.</i>

632
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,512
Parcel delivery!

633
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,431
My gosh. Did you pull your back?

634
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,716
Wait here.

635
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,400
You're all set.

636
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,940
Gosh.

637
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,650
Thank you.

638
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,204
Parcel delivery!

639
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,259
It's delicious.

640
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,971
<i>Before I knew it,</i>

641
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,886
<i>I looked forward to receiving parcels</i>
<i>because it meant seeing Do-yeong.</i>

642
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,269
<i>We soon became friends.</i>

643
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,438
So you're an author.

644
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,772
No wonder I detected this special aura.

645
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,074
A calm and intelligent vibe.

646
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,106
Oh, please. I haven't even
published any work yet.

647
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,647
Still.

648
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,869
I find it hard to write
more than three sentences.

649
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,793
What's the genre?

650
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,410
Mystery? Romance?

651
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,084
Fantasy?

652
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:00,342
I guess it falls under romance.

653
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:04,301
It's a literary piece
like <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

654
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:09,391
Gosh. Just as I suspected,
you have such elegant taste.

655
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:15,016
I'd love to read
some of your work sometime.

656
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,774
Wow, this looks delicious.

657
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,015
Dig in before it gets cold.

658
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,819
Sure.

659
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:30,867
Is it okay to meet more often
and enjoy meals like this...

660
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,581
at restaurants?

661
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,834
What, often?

662
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,786
At restaurants?

663
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,647
-Bo-ra...
-A delivery guy?

664
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,609
Of course he has no chance.

665
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,190
He's just being used,

666
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,605
but he's getting clingy,
and it's just so annoying.

667
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,197
Exactly. Of course.

668
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,235
Of course, it is.

669
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,496
It's why Juliet
pushed Romeo away at first,

670
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,553
but he won her over in the end
with his love.

671
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:27,719
The pure love of a man
changes a girl's view on life.

672
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,054
How cool is that?

673
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,718
Anyway, I'd better go.
I have a date with my boyfriend.

674
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,522
Sure thing. We'll talk again.

675
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,901
He should be here by now.

676
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,990
I haven't been able
to reach him ever since.

677
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,576
He changed his phone number

678
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
and someone else
took over his delivery route.

679
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:59,078
He must've misunderstood
what I was saying that day.

680
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,882
My gosh.

681
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,591
If only you had been honest with him
from the get-go.

682
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,633
I just couldn't tell him
that I was the author

683
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,796
of <i>Juliet's Temptations.</i>

684
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,967
It was too embarrassing.

685
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,894
I thought that he'd judge me.

686
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,690
No way. I'm sure
he still would've liked you.

687
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,691
When you truly like someone,

688
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,114
you find that person to be pretty, cute,

689
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,110
and admirable.

690
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,327
Because of what I write,
I may seem like an expert on love.

691
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,249
But I've never been loved
by anyone else before.

692
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,754
That's why I couldn't be honest.

693
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,922
My life may have ended,

694
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,129
but I want Do-yeong to know the truth.

695
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:51,092
He's the first man I loved
and someone precious to me.

696
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,141
I can't let our relationship end this way.

697
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,640
Juliet from your novel
is a smart and confident woman,

698
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,428
but you're the opposite.

699
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,935
And love is keeping you here
in this realm.

700
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,185
What can we do to help you?

701
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,651
Any misunderstandings will be cleared up

702
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,819
if he reads my novel.

703
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,986
I especially wrote the last chapter
while thinking of him.

704
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,701
Could you get him to read it?

705
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,629
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

706
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,724
TODAY'S MENU: SANDWICH

707
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,822
You can't set up your bar here.
It's in the way of my truck.

708
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,438
Finally, you're here. Mr. Kim Do-yeong?

709
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,360
Do you know me?

710
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,860
Who are you people?

711
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,656
We are acquaintances of Ms. Shin Bo-ra.

712
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,742
We came to give you something.

713
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,535
Bo-ra?

714
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:08,125
We're not involved anymore,
so please move your bar.

715
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,090
<i>Juliet's Temptations</i> by Ice Witch.

716
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,881
It's the novel written by Ms. Shin.

717
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,047
Read it and we'll move the bar.

718
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,466
I'd rather not.

719
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,218
I'm done for the day anyway,
so I'll move the truck tomorrow.

720
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,603
Wait. Hold on a second.

721
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,404
At least stay for a sandwich.

722
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,769
We came out here just for you, you know.

723
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,200
I bet you worked on an empty stomach.

724
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,909
I speak from experience.

725
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,332
He's right, so have a seat.
We won't bother you with anything else.

726
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,068
It's not poisoned, you know.

727
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,910
Oh, right.

728
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,825
It's delicious.

729
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,921
I bet your mouth's drying up.

730
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,131
Here. Have some milk.

731
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,342
Thanks.

732
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,613
I'm more tired than usual today.

733
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,105
That's odd. Why am I feeling so drowsy?

734
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,124
Juliet.

735
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,378
Your smile blinds me.

736
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,287
Your beautiful voice

737
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,126
makes me go deaf.

738
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,927
Oh, Romeo!

739
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,385
Your gaze splits my heart into two.

740
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:25,927
Half of it is yours,

741
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,805
and the other half is also yours.

742
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,095
Juliet!

743
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:33,768
Juliet.

744
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,359
I got myself a job
so that we could be together.

745
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,608
A job?

746
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,741
Please don't tell me

747
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,817
you are a deliveryman.

748
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,026
Don't worry about
your father's disapproval.

749
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,487
I left my family yesterday,

750
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,617
and I no longer care about
my family's wealth, reputation, or honor.

751
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,617
I'm happy as long as I have you.

752
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,746
What did you just say?

753
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:57,418
You're getting married?

754
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,336
Say hi to your stepmother.

755
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,511
Hi, Romeo. I hope we get along.

756
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:08,224
No!

757
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,387
All right.

758
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,611
My guide to the bitter afterlife.

759
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,113
My guide to an ugly death.

760
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,284
Shatter me into pieces!

761
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,702
Cheers,

762
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,703
my love.

763
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,912
Romeo, no!

764
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,748
What happened?
Did you drink it? Did you swallow it?

765
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,634
No.

766
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,208
Spit it out right now!

767
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,545
Juliet, what are you doing here?

768
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,973
Isn't today your wedding day?

769
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,352
There's only one person who should
be standing next to me at the altar.

770
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,897
It's you.

771
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,400
Juliet.

772
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,271
At first, I did it for the money.

773
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,940
My father and I came up with a plan

774
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:05,407
for me to join the House of Montague
and take it for ourselves.

775
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,276
But Romeo,

776
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,115
you're the reason
why my heart started to beat again.

777
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,453
Juliet,

778
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,915
you should've told me sooner.

779
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,458
The secret must've been
eating away at you.

780
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,344
I couldn't say anything

781
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,051
because I didn't want you to despise me.

782
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,627
But now I'm going
to be honest with myself.

783
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,892
I promise you this.

784
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,306
Romeo,

785
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,096
I...

786
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,849
love you.

787
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,566
I also...

788
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,151
love you...

789
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,356
for the way you are.

790
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,039
A deliveryman and Juliet?

791
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,046
Is this story about us?

792
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,432
So Bo-ra's spirit...

793
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,980
is still here?

794
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,384
Parcel...

795
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,456
delivery.

796
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,190
I've been waiting for you, Do-yeong.

797
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,650
Bo-ra, I'm sorry.

798
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,567
It...

799
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,236
took me too long, didn't it?

800
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,203
I couldn't swallow my pride.

801
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,416
Bo-ra's sorry

802
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,549
that she wasn't honest with you.

803
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,008
She was embarrassed

804
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,512
to show you her work.

805
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:37,018
Nonsense. I enjoyed your novel, Bo-ra.

806
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,178
It made me laugh...

807
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,308
and also cry.

808
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,068
I finally know how you truly feel.

809
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,912
If only I had said this sooner, too.

810
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,967
I bought it for you

811
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,178
so that

812
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,559
I could tell you how much I like you.

813
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,859
But I thought you were a bad person

814
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,783
and hated you over a misunderstanding.

815
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,490
Will you forgive me?

816
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,874
I don't care if you think
I'm a bad person.

817
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:51,467
"But I didn't want you to feel hurt

818
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:56,761
for the rest of your life
because of a misunderstanding.

819
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,179
That's what I was worried about.

820
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,350
You were truly loved,

821
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,112
and you are

822
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,645
an amazing person who gave me

823
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,489
so many happy memories.

824
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,532
Please don't forget that."

825
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,654
Thank you, Weol-ju.

826
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,185
If only I'd had a friend

827
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,819
who could listen to me like you do

828
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,279
when I was alive.

829
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,657
Thanks to you,
I can leave without any regrets now.

830
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,944
We all need

831
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:33,069
someone who listens to us.

832
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:03,759
Your Highness.

833
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,308
It was you.

834
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,813
I heard you comforting vengeful spirits
in my dream.

835
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,977
Raise your head.

836
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,938
It is okay. Come on.

837
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,579
I wanted to see your face.

838
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,655
Thanks to you,
I feel more and more at ease every day.

839
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,879
That is great to hear.

840
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,421
If you are feeling better,
I will be going...

841
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:41,684
Tonight, I would like you to listen to me
instead of them.

842
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:48,345
But I am not allowed
to have a conversation with you.

843
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,560
We are the only ones here.

844
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,068
It will stay between you and me.

845
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,444
I see, but still...

846
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,476
Come on.

847
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,582
Does it look like me?

848
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,287
Well...

849
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,075
You are prettier.

850
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,049
Weol-ju.

851
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,729
Do you know that you are like the moon?

852
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,944
What do you mean?

853
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,937
The moon shines so bright and is so small
that it fits between my fingers,

854
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,486
but I can never bring it home.

855
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:30,744
Whenever I see it,

856
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,833
I marvel and despair at the same time.

857
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,455
It is also only seen at night.

858
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:42,712
Because you are so fond of the moon,
I am not getting enough sleep at night.

859
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,301
I am sorry.

860
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,426
Thank you for being my excuse
to leave the palace at night.

861
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,595
Do not worry.

862
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,730
I quite enjoy telling her
about all the mischievous things

863
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,061
you did as a child.

864
00:55:58,646 --> 00:56:02,186
What? Did you two talk behind my back?

865
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,447
When?

866
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:07,735
When did that happen?

867
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:11,992
He always walks me home
every time we meet.

868
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,365
That's right.

869
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,840
I do not wish to see you again.

870
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:23,671
If I happen to see
that face of yours again,

871
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,514
you will not be able to go back alive.

872
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:40,188
<i>Was this just work for you?</i>

873
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,692
But I fell in love with you.

874
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,316
So, please...

875
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,833
accept my love.

876
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,827
Who could it be at this hour?

877
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,749
-Is it you, Mother?
-Weol-ju.

878
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,554
It is me. I came to see you.

879
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,228
Your Highness.

880
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,520
What are you doing here?
Did you come by yourself?

881
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,320
What if someone saw you?

882
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,858
Why are you not saying anything?

883
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,240
It will take me all night
to explain why I am here.

884
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,412
I just want to look at you like this.

885
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,040
If you do this,

886
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,710
you will get not only me,
but also my mother, in serious trouble.

887
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,299
Do not worry.

888
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,716
I will have to protect
the whole kingdom in the future.

889
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,052
I can, of course,
protect the woman I love.

890
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,221
Trust me.

891
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,596
I will protect you...

892
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,351
by all means.

893
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,100
Master. Master!

894
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,637
Master!

895
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,686
My mother has been murdered.

896
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,813
My mother...

897
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,815
What...

898
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:54,322
I got into a fight with an assassin
that came out of your house.

899
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,533
When I got back there,

900
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,912
the house was on fire.

901
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,753
And your mother...

902
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,923
The assassin was there to kill me.

903
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,294
But my mother got killed instead.

904
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,838
You have to leave this place right now.

905
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,469
Please bring me to His Highness.

906
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,263
I beg you.

907
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,766
You cannot meet His Highness again.

908
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,432
Pardon?

909
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:24,849
-What do you mean?
-His Highness...

910
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,774
is going to marry a woman
chosen by Her Majesty.

911
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,614
He wanted to meet you

912
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,994
one last time tonight,

913
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,738
to tell you that.

914
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,542
Oh, the number went up.

915
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,048
Only three more cases to go
until we reach 100,000!

916
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:59,965
Kang-bae, you can finally start
a new life soon.

917
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:03,848
<i>On this happy day</i>

918
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,598
Why are you drinking soju?

919
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:11,322
Hey, eat some food, too.

920
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,571
You'll get cirrhosis.

921
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,989
I've already died once.
It's not like I'm going to die again.

922
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,204
No, you aren't,
but you'll still get a hangover.

923
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,116
Gosh, you don't want to work tomorrow?

924
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,369
He's right.

925
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,917
Bo-ra was so grateful to you
for listening to her

926
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,421
and settling her grudge.

927
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:33,667
Don't you feel proud?

928
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,511
Do you?

929
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,047
I think it's ridiculous.

930
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,349
Sorry? You think it's ridiculous?

931
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,725
Here's something I realized
while doing this

932
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,478
for the past 500 years.

933
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,691
People can live

934
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:55,857
as long as they have one person
who listens to them.

935
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:58,490
The thing is,

936
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:02,832
I had no one.

937
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:08,293
The whole world turned away from me.

938
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,495
They never listened to me
and only criticized me.

939
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:17,165
One of the two people
I trusted the most died.

940
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,594
The other...

941
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,840
betrayed me.

942
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:29,101
And here I am listening to others
even after I've died,

943
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,305
and being thanked for it.

944
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,651
Isn't that ridiculous?

945
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,358
No, it's not ridiculous at all.

946
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,533
I'm proud of you.

947
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,536
I always hated

948
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:50,543
my ability to make people
speak their minds.

949
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,253
I thought I was cursed.

950
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,917
Even after hearing everything,
I couldn't help them.

951
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,462
It only made me feel bad.

952
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,512
But you can actually help them.

953
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,886
Every time someone thanks you at the bar

954
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,049
and the number on the screen goes up,

955
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,602
I couldn't feel more proud of you.

956
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:18,483
You seem to become a better talker
when you talk back to me.

957
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:20,193
Do I?

958
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,663
From now on, tell me
whenever you need someone to talk to.

959
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,910
I will listen to you.

960
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,909
So will I.

961
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:33,121
Gosh.

962
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,338
I wanted to be a bit sentimental tonight,

963
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,420
but you guys ruined it.

964
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:43,133
I want to drink alone.
You guys can go home.

965
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,887
No way. Let's drink together.

966
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,142
No.

967
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,522
You don't know what she's like
when she's drunk. You should go.

968
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,140
Wait, you might see a spirit again.

969
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,897
I'll come with you. Let's go.

970
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:57,109
I'll be going then. Don't drink too much.

971
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,977
Do you have the salt with you?

972
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,322
Of course. You went to so much trouble
to get me this.

973
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,528
Don't drink too much.
I already cleaned up.

974
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,326
Let's go.

975
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:25,513
By the way, you're going to see Yeo-rin
at work tomorrow, aren't you?

976
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,465
What are you going to do?

977
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,677
Guibanjang.

978
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,022
Why do you suddenly bring that up?

979
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,226
What?

980
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,311
Well, I'm just worried, that's all.

981
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,693
I'm really worried, I mean it.

982
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:46,741
Stop feeling so upset about it.

983
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,100
Father.

984
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,812
Good night.

985
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,313
Good night. See you.

986
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,345
See you.

987
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:21,475
Kang-bae.

988
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,278
Yes?

989
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:24,935
Never mind.

990
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,408
See you.

991
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,755
Hey, moon.

992
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,429
It must be hard for you, too.

993
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:01,109
I'm sure so many people

994
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:04,648
must have made wishes upon you so far.

995
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,106
But you know what?

996
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:09,738
I'm just like you.

997
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,658
<i>Just like you keep waxing and waning,</i>

998
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:20,576
<i>I keep changing my mind between hating him</i>

999
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,835
<i>and longing for him.</i>

1000
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,340
<i>I should completely give up</i>

1001
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,261
<i>to finally be free.</i>

1002
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,138
<i>But that's</i>

1003
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,644
<i>not so easy.</i>

1004
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,386
Wow.

1005
01:05:42,688 --> 01:05:45,938
<i>Love, hatred, longing...</i>

1006
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,985
<i>Each and every relationship I form</i>

1007
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,907
<i>eventually adds to my karma</i>
<i>and hits me back.</i>

1008
01:05:56,535 --> 01:06:00,405
So let me make a wish upon you.

1009
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,750
Just one.

1010
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:18,391
Please set me free...

1011
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:24,362
from this misery, before I become

1012
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,277
attached again.

1013
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,782
Okay?

1014
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:45,670
THANKS TO SHIN HYEON-SU AND
HAN SO-EUN FOR MAKING A GUEST APPEARANCE

1015
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,820
Let me open
the Door of Spiritual Vision for you.

1016
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:15,784
-We can do it!
<i>-You can't open that door.</i>

1017
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,325
-And you can't close it either.
-Could you please give us a chance?

1018
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,500
Well, it was my first time, too.

1019
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,499
<i>A kiss of true love.</i>

1020
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,631
<i>Please take a look at this flyer.</i>
<i>I've got a new customer.</i>

1021
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,170
<i>-She's looking for her long-lost son.</i>
-Hello.

1022
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:33,674
<i>You're right. I... I abandoned Jun-u.</i>

1023
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,428
<i>If he dies, we won't be able to come back.</i>

1024
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:36,889
<i>We'll be trapped forever</i>
<i>in his Dream World.</i>

1025
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,099
Ms. Weol-ju! Guibanjang!

1026
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:39,889
<i>-Please come back!</i>
-Weol-ju.

1027
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,272
-Please calm down.
-Tell me.

1028
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:44,479
<i>Tell me who the cinnabar</i>
<i>reincarnated into.</i>

1029
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,690
<i>I finally get to meet you,</i>

1030
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:48,112
<i>Your Highness.</i>

1031
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:51,279
So you've just been deceiving
and using me so far.

1032
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,816
Was it just to use me
because you needed me?

1033
