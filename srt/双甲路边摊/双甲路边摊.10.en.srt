1
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,562
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,969
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,895
I have encountered my fair share of people
living in this palace.

4
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,490
Do you know
of the most foolish kind though?

5
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,199
Those who wish for things
they can never have

6
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,831
and end up losing all that they have
as a result.

7
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,374
You are just like them.

8
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,789
Did my acknowledging

9
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,964
your help in saving the royal family
go to your head?

10
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,094
My Queen,

11
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,546
I was only...

12
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,803
I do not wish to see you again.

13
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,509
If I happen to see
the face of yours again,

14
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,556
you will not be able to go back alive.

15
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,849
What do you mean marriage?

16
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,645
-It does not make sense.
-Of course it does.

17
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,861
It was only pushed back
until you regained your health.

18
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,783
But...

19
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,744
I am not...

20
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,911
Do not worry.

21
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,825
Your bride-to-be has already been chosen
as Lord Kim Jin's daughter

22
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,499
whom you have always been fond of.

23
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,536
Mother,

24
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,552
you should know
that my heart beats for another.

25
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,344
My son,
in order to strengthen royal authority,

26
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,467
you need power and armed forces.

27
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,968
Let your feelings for that girl
only remain in your heart.

28
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:19,927
Better yet,

29
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,687
erase her existence from your heart.

30
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,353
Erase her existence?

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,860
-How could...
-If you will not,

32
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:31,859
I will do it for you.

33
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,421
Do you finally believe me, Crown Prince?

34
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,718
EPISODE 10

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,322
I once woke up from a coma
after being in an accident.

36
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,900
Ever since then,

37
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,324
I've been able to remember my past life.

38
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,623
The memories are vivid
as if I experienced them yesterday.

39
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,870
How did you recognize me though?

40
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,497
Because I'm your mother.

41
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,633
Because I was your mother.

42
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,671
You take after your father a lot.

43
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,473
However, your eyes were a dead giveaway.

44
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,307
I could tell you aren't
from the Living Realm.

45
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,425
I see.

46
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,555
Ever since I began
to remember my past life,

47
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,018
I thought about my son who lived

48
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,355
a heart-aching life.

49
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,107
Has he been reincarnated?

50
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,283
If he has,

51
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,985
would he be living peacefully?

52
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,253
But then again, I even worried

53
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,127
if he'd be haunted by his past life
like I am.

54
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,927
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

55
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,013
It's my fault for not realizing
the extent of my son's feelings.

56
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,307
I'm the one to blame.

57
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,402
No.

58
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,032
Please don't.

59
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,526
There's no need to apologize
for what happened 500 years ago.

60
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,320
I don't deserve it anyway.

61
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:48,202
I'm the son who did the unthinkable
and broke his parents' hearts.

62
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,120
It's me who should apologize.

63
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,341
I must've been reincarnated

64
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,589
so that we could meet again.

65
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:06,095
But may I ask why you're living this way

66
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,393
without being reborn?

67
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,598
I'm trying to keep the promise

68
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,065
I wasn't able to in my past life.

69
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,908
You came alone? Where's Guibanjang?

70
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,785
He met a friend on the street.

71
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,623
He doesn't have any friends.

72
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,417
I know what's going on.
Which spirit was it?

73
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,418
It was actually a human.
An ordinary woman.

74
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,343
A woman?

75
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,666
Unbelievable.

76
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,876
He thinks he can slack off
now that I only have two more to go?

77
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,604
You're right.
You only have two more to go.

78
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,348
At the beginning,
even one seemed impossible.

79
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,231
Right.

80
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,103
Remember how you used
to bring over just about anyone?

81
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,443
And you also stole my <i>ssanggapju.</i>

82
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,440
I still remember
you weeping in the Dream World.

83
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,026
-Unbelievable.
-I did that, didn't I?

84
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,952
Miss, what if we keep on doing this?

85
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,502
I'm sad to see it end
when I've just gotten the hang of it.

86
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,748
You wouldn't say that
if you helped 100,000.

87
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,290
Talk about it being tedious.

88
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,959
How about another 10,000?

89
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,924
No, just about 1,000 more.
I know I can do even better now.

90
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,138
Is this because you know
I'll be going to Hell?

91
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,104
You'll be doing a good deed,
so why can't you ask...

92
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,433
It's like I said.

93
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,108
I'm no longer attached to the Living Realm
and have no desire to be reborn.

94
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,568
It may be like that for you,
but I don't want to see you go.

95
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,727
I really don't.

96
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,029
Even if we never meet again,

97
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,945
I want you to live a peaceful life

98
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,539
or a happy one as someone new.

99
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:56,576
That's what I want.

100
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,878
I didn't agree to serve this punishment
so that I could stay away from Hell.

101
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,431
There's another reason.

102
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,766
Because of my actions,
someone precious to me

103
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,885
has been suffering for 500 years.

104
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,608
That person's suffering will finally end
once I reach my quota.

105
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:25,949
However,

106
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,490
there's no way for me to make up

107
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,081
for the 500 years of agony.

108
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,119
That is why I have no one
but myself to blame

109
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,996
for ending up in Hell.

110
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,210
So let's not talk about it anymore, okay?

111
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,459
Got it?

112
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,567
How dare you!

113
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,232
You are not royalty down here, my boy.

114
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,031
Who do you think you are
choosing your own destination?

115
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,493
You must've lost your mind.

116
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,953
You can throw me
in a pit of fire or vipers.

117
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,794
All I want is to be with Weol-ju.

118
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,449
Please let me be with her.

119
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,407
Shut it!

120
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,497
You're a murderer who not only
beheaded your childhood friend

121
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,753
but also took your own life.

122
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,249
You're going to the Hell of Repetition.

123
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,263
There, your flesh

124
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,509
will be scored and slit

125
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,103
and you will sit in your own feces
while insects eat away at you.

126
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:49,364
However, had that Won-hyung lived,

127
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,532
many more would have died.

128
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:57,200
You eliminated a threat
which I am willing to take into account.

129
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,252
Then...

130
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,000
Yi Hon, you do not hesitate
to fight against injustice

131
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,544
and are a skilled warrior.

132
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,507
It is why I am sending you
to the Afterlife Police Agency.

133
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,879
Repent of your sins as you uphold the law.

134
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,219
I am truly grateful.

135
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,887
However, I would still like to know
where Weol-ju is.

136
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:26,187
She is also serving the punishment
that she was sentenced to,

137
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,734
so there is no need to worry.

138
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,782
Instead, focus on your task at hand.

139
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,450
I will keep tabs on you

140
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,702
and send you to Weol-ju

141
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,865
if you do your due diligence
and serve the agency well.

142
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,081
Do you mean that?

143
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,207
Thank you, Yeomradaewang.

144
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,432
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

145
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,739
A young man and woman
should want to be connected at the hip.

146
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,526
Don't give up on Yeo-rin
and try again with her.

147
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,117
I haven't given up.

148
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,207
I heard that I'm the type
that slowly grows on people,

149
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,419
so I'm taking my time.

150
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,919
You perhaps don't approve though, right?

151
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,255
What? Why would I not approve?
Saying that would land you in Hell.

152
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,009
Didn't you say

153
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,760
that Yeo-rin seemed like the type
to string men along.

154
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:38,974
My gosh.

155
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,809
That was my way of complimenting her.

156
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,435
Girls should know how to play hard to get.

157
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,649
Not being able to do so like me
won't get you very far.

158
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,186
You don't know how to play hard to get?

159
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,197
I think you're as sly as a leopard cat.

160
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,913
A leopard cat? What's that?

161
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,489
He's talking about a wildcat.

162
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,246
And he's not wrong.

163
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,126
How am I a wildcat
when I'm this innocent and naive?

164
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,173
I mindlessly believed
a man's confession of love

165
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,764
and believed him
when he said he'd protect me.

166
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,550
I'm in this mess right now
because I blindly trusted the man.

167
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,466
The man who betrayed you?

168
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,470
"Betrayed her"?

169
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,481
Jeez, it's dusty in here.
Did you mop the floor today?

170
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,107
I'll just have to do it again.

171
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,450
Guibanjang, you dropped your necklace.

172
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:42,906
What?

173
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,249
What's that? Isn't it a jade ring?

174
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,964
Is it for this woman you're seeing?

175
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,745
Of course not.

176
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,092
Gosh, you're old-fashioned.
Who likes jade rings these days?

177
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,838
There should at least be a diamond.

178
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,717
As if I have the money.

179
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,393
It's not like you pay me, Weol-ju.

180
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,182
The salary you owe me
would be enough to buy trucks of diamonds.

181
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,435
She's Weol-ju?

182
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,734
My son,

183
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,065
you're with Weol-ju
like you have always wanted.

184
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:26,251
<i>Ladies and gentleman,</i>
<i>thank you for shopping at Kapeul Mart.</i>

185
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,288
Customer Service is currently holding
onto a book

186
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,289
called...

187
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,877
It's called <i>On the Express Train to Hell.</i>

188
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,966
If this is yours,

189
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,141
please pick it up at Customer Service.
Thank you.

190
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,398
KAPEUL MART

191
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,939
I'm glad he's here today.

192
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,486
What the hell?

193
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,860
You startled me.

194
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,738
So you like him.

195
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,947
-Sorry?
-You like Kang-bae.

196
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,164
I just saw you smile while looking at him.

197
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,664
-I didn't.
-As if.

198
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,368
You're head over heels for him.

199
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,956
Anyway, this is great.
He likes you and you like him.

200
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,335
So what's the problem?

201
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,921
Start dating as of today.

202
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:19,916
Unbelievable.

203
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,887
The CIA must be bored
to meddle with others' love lives.

204
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,848
Don't exhaust yourself
by trying to play hard to get.

205
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,931
Life is short
and you never know when it'll end.

206
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,727
You should enjoy a tasty romance
while you're still young. Okay?

207
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,863
What?

208
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,939
-You're not just old but also weird.
-Hey!

209
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,989
Who are you calling "old"?

210
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,659
Really?

211
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,615
That little minx Kang Yeo-rin
is the reincarnation of Cinnabar?

212
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,958
Of course.

213
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,714
No wonder Kang-bae's ability
didn't work on her.

214
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,468
Yeombujang couldn't overpower her either.

215
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,721
The rock that chases away spirits

216
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,807
was reborn as a human being.

217
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,023
That makes her a walking talisman.

218
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,648
Anyway, I can't believe
they're actually colleagues.

219
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,573
This must be Heaven's blessing.

220
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,149
As if.

221
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,944
She already turned Kang-bae down.

222
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,147
And now he has to smack one on her lips?

223
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,525
No, it must be a kiss.

224
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,161
One that's sticky and wet.

225
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,292
A deep kiss of true love.

226
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,631
Being a former rock makes sense
given how you're as stiff as one.

227
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,547
Is she the Cinnabar?

228
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,473
What?

229
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,640
She is!

230
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,265
Yeo-rin's the Cinnabar?

231
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,309
That's secret...

232
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:59,816
Actually, I didn't say anything.
It was your guess, okay?

233
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,364
How can one not know
when you're forcing them together?

234
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,534
Does it mean they need to kiss?

235
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,410
Gosh. This must be a joke.

236
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,907
It's not. I'm sure she likes Kang-bae too,

237
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,785
so we just have to give them a nudge.

238
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:19,003
1. SHOW OFF HIS BICEPS

239
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,214
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

240
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,670
What now? Where are you going?

241
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,755
It'll only take a second.
I just need a favor.

242
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,140
Kang-bae, the lid won't open.
Can you help me?

243
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,559
You dragged me here for this?

244
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,607
Stop talking and just do it.

245
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,403
That's odd. Hold on a second.

246
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,740
My goodness.

247
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,004
Look at your muscles! That's right.

248
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,539
Strong and muscular
is how we like our men.

249
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,707
My gosh.

250
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,127
This seems to be glued on tight.

251
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,971
-Let me get you another bottle.
-Sure. What?

252
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,350
-Try again, Kang-bae.
-May I try?

253
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,733
Look, it's open. Thank you.

254
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,228
Here you go.

255
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,855
Are you sure you shut this properly?

256
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,238
She opened this?

257
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,870
But I made sure to glue it on tight.

258
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,664
Kang Yeo-rin isn't some ordinary girl.

259
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,745
Showing off his muscles won't work.
Let's try something else.

260
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,382
Like what?

261
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,796
There's a post online

262
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,378
that lists the moments
girls fall for guys.

263
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,762
Really?

264
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,636
What about this one?

265
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,642
<i>Driving in reverse</i>
<i>with the parking stub between his lips.</i>

266
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,490
We took our car to the auto shop recently,
so no.

267
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:12,986
Then...

268
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,453
2. FAB ABS

269
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,991
How about this one?

270
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,407
The bigger one might be better.

271
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,826
What about this?

272
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,504
-The one on the top.
-This one?

273
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,713
Yes, that one. Yes!

274
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,005
My goodness,
I didn't know you two were here.

275
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,813
This is where you can find the pots.
I'll leave you to it then.

276
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,187
Seriously?

277
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,979
What the hell are you wearing?

278
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,239
Where do you even buy things like this?

279
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,033
3. THE CART MANEUVER

280
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,947
-Are you off to lunch too?
-Yes.

281
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,131
Goodness me. Sorry about that.
Coming through.

282
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,634
-Excuse us.
-Sorry.

283
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,087
-Goodness.
-What's this?

284
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,847
This elevator is tiny!

285
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,252
You easily catch on with other things,

286
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,498
so why couldn't you do so
with Yeo-rin at the mart?

287
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,631
I didn't know you were trying to help.

288
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,589
It's our fault
for trusting an online post.

289
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,920
Women don't fall
for a man's biceps or abs.

290
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,802
-Then what?
-They like humorous men.

291
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,845
Why do you think comedians marry so well?

292
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:03,023
He doesn't have
a single funny bone in him though.

293
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,730
He only knows how to be diligent

294
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,770
and talk back to me with clever remarks.

295
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,315
He can always learn how to be witty.

296
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,491
As of today,

297
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,905
consider me as your coach.

298
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,743
Coach Gui...

299
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,584
Please guide him, Coach Gui.

300
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:31,959
You must leave everything to me,
Ms. Weol-ju.

301
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,625
I will. I certainly will.

302
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,335
Will you put up with everything?

303
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,047
I'm asking you if you're sure

304
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,058
you won't regret this.

305
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,810
I am ready to do anything
if it can lead to him getting the girl.

306
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,274
Constantly doubt yourself.

307
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:54,067
First, let's start off with a simple test.

308
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,911
What do you call a <i>doljanchi</i> in English?

309
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,818
A <i>doljanchi?</i>

310
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,067
In English?

311
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,084
- "A first birthday."
- Dear.

312
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,962
A <i>doljanchi</i> in English is called...

313
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,593
Unbelievable. Shall I rip your jaw open?

314
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,795
Ms. Weol-ju, please calm down.

315
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,177
Miss...

316
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,433
-What a load of crap.
-I should take out the trash.

317
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,151
<i>"Dol"</i> means rock in English.

318
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,992
<i>TTEOKBOKKI</i>

319
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,799
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

320
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,258
Welcome.

321
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,358
Is Guibanjang here?

322
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:22,954
Hello.

323
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,491
Handsome young man, we meet again.

324
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,195
-Is this where you work?
-Yes.

325
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,873
Do you know her?

326
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,498
Yes, she's Guibanjang's friend.

327
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,630
He just left to take out the trash.

328
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,094
Then I'll wait.

329
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,563
Could I get some <i>tteokbokki?</i>

330
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,477
We're closing up.

331
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,349
Sorry? Don't tent bars usually open
around this time?

332
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,648
That's for the owner to decide, so leave.

333
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,776
No, I'll get it for you.

334
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,027
Ms. Weol-ju, you shouldn't be rude
to Guibanjang's friend.

335
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,326
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

336
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:15,082
By the way, don't you have
the Royal tteokbokki instead of this one?

337
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,301
I can't eat spicy dishes, you see.

338
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,625
You know what that is, right?

339
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,434
-The one served in the Royal...
-Royal, my ass.

340
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,088
No, we don't serve that here.

341
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:29,182
"Royal" is the word I hate the most
and hearing it makes me want to puke,

342
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,644
so leave if you'll say it.

343
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,192
All right.

344
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:38,154
Wait, these are flour rice cakes.
I prefer those made from rice.

345
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,572
-Why you...
-Ms. Weol-ju, please don't do that.

346
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,861
Her face creeps me out.

347
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,736
Me?

348
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,741
Is it me you're talking about?

349
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,826
The mother of the man who betrayed me.
The bitch who killed my mother.

350
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,874
She looks exactly like her.

351
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,495
What?

352
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,259
Actually...

353
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,391
Weol-ju, Yeombujang cracked up
at the rock festival joke.

354
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,389
Isn't that right?

355
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,394
Yes, it was a good one.

356
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,266
Shin Ji-hye?

357
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,937
How

358
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,403
do you know her?

359
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,608
Her?

360
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,947
She's a fashion designer.

361
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,832
I met her when I went to buy an outfit.

362
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,870
-Right? What brings you by?
-That's right.

363
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,209
I was hoping to talk
to the owner of the bar.

364
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,918
You must be here to see me.

365
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,460
Shall we take it outside?

366
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,377
Let's go.

367
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,215
Go on.

368
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,721
Weol-ju isn't aware
that you're the crown prince?

369
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,647
Shouldn't you have cleared

370
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,398
the misunderstandings she has
regarding our family?

371
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,322
What misunderstanding?

372
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:04,859
I'm the reason...

373
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,112
Weol-ju died.

374
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,834
I promised her I'd protect her
but I couldn't which makes it a betrayal.

375
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,463
Still, this isn't right.

376
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,964
Is there anything I can do to help?

377
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,671
I'll do anything
to bring you two together again.

378
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,250
No.

379
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,176
I can't get into any details,

380
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,969
but she's been repenting of her sins
and she's almost done.

381
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,314
Opening up old wounds
might make her lose her focus.

382
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:41,061
But she's the one
you've been desperate to be with.

383
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,110
What Weol-ju needs right now

384
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,690
isn't a lover but someone who assists her.

385
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,903
I'm happy

386
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,447
with being the latter.

387
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,952
KAPEUL MART

388
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,456
Kang Yeo-rin?

389
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,804
Aren't you Yeo-rin?

390
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,601
It's just that you gave me the creeps.

391
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,019
The moment you touched me,
it creeped me out.

392
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,441
Whatever, I'm scared.

393
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,783
What is <i>doljanchi</i> in English?

394
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,031
It's been so long.

395
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,825
I didn't expect you to work
at a place like this though.

396
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,874
Don't people naturally avoid you?

397
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,375
Honey, what's up?

398
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,666
Who's she?

399
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:49,172
Remember that girl I mentioned
who used to give me the creeps?

400
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,836
That creepy girl?

401
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,468
She actually existed?

402
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,140
My fear of physical contact
was brought on by her.

403
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,928
But you fixed me, darling.
I'm scared it might come back.

404
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,347
Yeo-rin.

405
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,978
Yeo-rin, is something wrong?

406
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,072
-Who's he?
-What?

407
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:10,192
We went to the same college.
And who might you be?

408
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,411
I'm her boyfriend

409
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,695
and I heard what you said.

410
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,696
Please apologize
for speaking about her in such a way.

411
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:25,746
I was only reminiscing since I was happy
to see her after all this time.

412
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,418
You were reminiscing?

413
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:33,879
Would you think so if someone
from your past called you creepy too?

414
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,216
What creeps me out even more are people
like you who make fun of other people

415
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,063
by bringing up their past.

416
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,686
-Honey, you should apologize.
-Right.

417
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,023
Yeo-rin, I'm sorry.

418
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,034
It hurts.

419
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,492
Sorry about that.
I was just really pissed off.

420
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,342
Did I mess up again?

421
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,821
Gosh.

422
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,611
-Hi, sir.
-Hey.

423
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,855
-You're here.
-Hi.

424
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:38,777
Hold on.

425
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,238
Where did Weol-ju go?

426
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,116
She went to spot a new site for the bar.

427
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,825
Because Ms. Shin could come back.

428
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,037
She must still be in pain

429
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,915
to have a similar-looking person
open up old wounds.

430
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,723
The grudge one harbors as they die

431
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,841
stays vivid

432
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,300
as if it happened yesterday.

433
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,390
But with two more scores,

434
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,983
she'll be able to forget about her past
and live a new life.

435
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,770
Welcome!

436
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,817
A table for one? Please have a seat.

437
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,738
-Can I get a bowl of udon?
-Coming right up.

438
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,821
-I'll have a bottle of soju first.
-Sure.

439
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,277
Here you go.

440
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,670
He seems to be troubled.

441
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,561
Kang-bae.

442
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,647
I need to go to the restroom.

443
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,365
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

444
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,488
Kang-bae,

445
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,490
what's wrong?

446
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,998
Why did you let all those customers go?

447
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,214
What is it? Did Weol-ju say something
to upset you again?

448
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,674
No, that's not it.

449
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,630
If I keep doing this...

450
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,976
I know.

451
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,601
You've been seeing spirits,
so you're scared to use your ability.

452
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,901
But we only have two more to go.

453
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,361
Once you're done, Weol-ju will fix you up.

454
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,362
It's not easy to restore trust
after it breaks.

455
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,196
She didn't tell you
how she'll fix you, right?

456
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,036
How can he get to work
when he can't trust her?

457
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,326
That much trust lies between us for sure.

458
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,131
He would never purposely

459
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,000
let Weol-ju go to Hell
because of that. Am I wrong?

460
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,585
No, you're right.
I'm trying not to send her to Hell.

461
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,307
You're trying not to send her to Hell?
What do you mean?

462
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,150
What are you talking about?

463
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,977
Kang-bae, tell me!

464
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,190
Well...

465
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:24,985
You see...

466
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,735
I can tell you what you desperately

467
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,544
wish to know.

468
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,368
But instead,

469
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,713
you must take responsibility
for disclosing what's confidential.

470
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,463
What will happen to me?

471
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,966
You will lose your chance
to be reincarnated

472
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,375
and will be sent
to the Hell of Extinction.

473
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,467
CONTRACT FOR THE TRANSFER OF SINS

474
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,602
I'm glad there's still a way to help.

475
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,230
WEOL-JU

476
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,439
<i>Is this true?</i> <i>Weol-ju truly did that?</i>

477
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,975
Samsin told me in person.

478
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,235
Anyone who discloses the secret
will end up in the Hell of Extinction.

479
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,241
In exchange for the secret
Samsin told her,

480
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:11,493
Weol-ju wrote a contract that guaranteed
a spot on the express train to Hell.

481
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,751
Yes.

482
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,503
She did it to find a way to fix me.

483
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,464
So it doesn't matter
if Weol-ju settles 100,000 grudges.

484
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,384
She'll end up

485
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,474
in Hell either way.

486
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,389
She'll be taken there right away
when it's done.

487
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,221
No wonder Kang-bae
has been refusing to make people talk.

488
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,806
Why does she always act as she pleases?

489
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,435
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR 99,998

490
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,526
<i>Only two more to go...</i>

491
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,334
Can't you see that my disgraceful behavior

492
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,379
is a way for me to be loved by you

493
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,757
like a father loves his son?

494
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,877
She's not afraid of going to Hell?

495
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,801
I can't make it so easy for her.

496
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,506
Will she be able to leave behind
the person

497
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,059
she's been pining for so easily?

498
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:47,321
I can't wait
to watch the heart-rending sight.

499
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,894
Hey, how about here?
Many people are passing by.

500
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,444
What? Wait,

501
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:28,107
did Kang-bae find a client?
All right, let's go.

502
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,857
Are you crazy?
Why would you sign a contract like that?

503
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,372
Gosh, I can't believe Kang-bae.

504
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,792
If you'll go to Hell anyway,

505
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,210
what's the point of the quota
and running the bar?

506
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,119
Calm down.

507
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,964
I'm responsible for both Kang-bae
and the Sacred Tree. I should fix it.

508
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:52,215
Who cares about that damn Sacred Tree?

509
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:54,678
You never know.

510
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,968
Someone might be suffering somewhere
because I brought the Sacred Tree

511
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,021
bad luck.

512
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:01,929
Cut it out.

513
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,016
Stop solving cases until I find a way
to nullify the contract.

514
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,314
Why are you like this?
Who do you think you are?

515
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,158
What do you think?
I'm the manager of the bar.

516
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,779
Exactly. As the manager,

517
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,905
focus on meeting the goal of the bar,
solving 100,000 cases.

518
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,827
-Who cares if I end up in Heaven or Hell?
-Just do as I say.

519
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,384
I can't let you end up
in the Hell of Extinction.

520
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,378
My goodness. What's the matter with you?

521
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,295
Do you like me?

522
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,933
Do you have any idea
why I was a detective for 500 years

523
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,600
and what I went through to be here?

524
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,425
I'm not giving up.

525
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,899
Gosh, you're one elite detective.

526
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,645
What? Are you worried
I'll leave a stain on your career?

527
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,696
Settling the grudges of 100,000 people?

528
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,990
I didn't know
Weol-ju was being punished that way.

529
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,955
What happens after she pays for her sin?

530
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:09,708
Both Weol-ju and the crown prince

531
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,545
will be born again,

532
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,875
and they'll never see each other again.

533
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,801
Isn't that such a shame?

534
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,336
That's it?

535
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,177
I hope they can at least clear up
the misunderstanding before that.

536
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,733
How about you help them?

537
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:29,981
Me?

538
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,475
I doubt Weol-ju will believe me
even if I tell her the truth.

539
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,358
She won't if you tell her.

540
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,776
But you can still show her the truth.

541
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,204
Memory never lies.

542
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,958
Lure Weol-ju into your Dream World.

543
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,671
Your memory of your previous life

544
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,090
will show her that the crown prince
didn't do anything wrong.

545
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,881
After that, we'll let her know
that Guibanjang is the crown prince.

546
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:03,548
The two can go back
to the way they used to be.

547
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,027
Stop, that's enough.

548
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,201
Gosh!

549
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,488
Why can't you two leave me alone?

550
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:25,452
Do I look like a pushover?

551
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,164
Where's the contract she signed?
Give it to me right now!

552
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,540
I said, it's not here.

553
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,785
It's already been approved
by Yeomradaewang.

554
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:43,144
You're lying.
I'm sure it's hidden here somewhere.

555
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,679
It has to be.

556
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,889
Hon. Yi Hon!

557
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,602
I can't let her go

558
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,190
without telling her the truth,

559
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,820
without doing anything,

560
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,368
again.

561
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,249
I'm sorry.

562
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,291
How could you, of all people, do this?

563
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,883
You know Weol-ju.

564
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,341
I do.

565
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:28,007
I know her better than anyone.

566
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,347
Then why did you do that?

567
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:33,811
You should've stopped her.

568
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:36,524
No matter how determined Weol-ju was,

569
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,731
you should have stopped her by all means.

570
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,817
I didn't want her
to sign that contract either.

571
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,492
But I had to because I know her.

572
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,951
I know her too well.

573
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,169
You should stop.

574
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,585
You've done enough.

575
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,843
No.

576
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,838
If I can't save her,

577
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,337
I might as well have done nothing.

578
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,978
What should I do with those two?

579
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,368
Yeo-rin.

580
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,997
You're not having lunch?

581
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,538
I don't have an appetite.

582
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,262
There's a really nice cake shop near here.
Do you want to go?

583
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,401
It's very good.

584
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,067
That's great.
You should eat even if you don't want to.

585
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,817
You have to work all afternoon.

586
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,735
I looked like an idiot yesterday,
didn't I?

587
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,077
It's all that jerk's fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.

588
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,040
Kang Yeo-rin the Date Bully.

589
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,085
That was my nickname.

590
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:27,216
Every time I asked a guy out,
they all ran away.

591
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,129
Why?

592
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:29,886
I don't know.

593
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,558
They said I gave them the creeps.

594
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,852
They'd turn pale
as if they'd seen a ghost.

595
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,644
In the end, I gave up on dating.

596
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:44,154
I didn't want to be hated
by someone I like anymore.

597
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,568
That's also why I turned you down.

598
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,004
Do you know what my nickname was
at the orphanage?

599
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,918
The Cursed Boy.

600
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,420
What?

601
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,922
They said I bring bad luck to people.

602
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,842
That's why I've always avoided people.

603
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,676
Like a hermit crab.

604
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,978
Is that a turtle?

605
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:27,105
But I've decided not to hide my feelings
or run away from people anymore.

606
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,025
And you're the first person
that I want to get close to.

607
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,069
Me?

608
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,292
But you said you didn't feel anything
when you touched me.

609
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,706
What I meant was...

610
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:44,207
I was relieved that nothing bad happened
when I touched you.

611
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,547
I see.

612
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,594
Ridiculous. How could I not feel anything?
Just sitting in front of you

613
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,557
makes me so nervous and happy.

614
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,023
Then I'll tell you how I feel too.

615
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,317
I like you. I want to like you.

616
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,284
Can I like you?

617
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,013
Hey, that's great.

618
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,755
I'm so happy for you.

619
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,596
No matter what I did,
she wouldn't admit her feelings for you,

620
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,811
but I could see right through her.

621
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,142
It's all thanks to you and Guibanjang.

622
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,523
-Stop peeling the eggs. You can leave.
-What?

623
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,398
This is such an important day.

624
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,703
It's the very first day
of your very first relationship.

625
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,369
You shouldn't be peeling eggs here.
Go on a date with her. Go now.

626
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,372
I'll be going then.

627
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,752
See you tomorrow.

628
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,290
My goodness.

629
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,126
Why are you back?

630
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,298
Hello.

631
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,716
What are you doing back here?

632
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:24,771
I just remembered that I never got to try
your <i>tteokbokki</i> last time.

633
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,439
Can you make some more?

634
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:31,029
Hey, there's a snack bar
across the street. Try that place instead.

635
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,360
It's just that I don't want to eat alone.

636
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,781
Isn't a bar like this a place for people
who have no one to turn to?

637
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,582
It'd be even better
if you could drink with me.

638
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,789
Why would I drink with you?

639
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,956
Then can you at least keep me company
while I wallow in self-pity?

640
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:57,837
When you're wearing designer clothes
and I'm wearing an apron?

641
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,354
Well, wearing expensive clothes

642
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,519
can't seem to fill the void in my heart.

643
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,191
It's about this man.

644
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:20,156
We were deeply in love,
and we even got engaged.

645
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,664
But his parents didn't approve of me.

646
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,371
It's the same old story.

647
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,287
What was the reason?

648
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,087
They made up all kinds of excuses.

649
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,010
They didn't like what I do,

650
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,588
the way I look, and everything.

651
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,506
I agreed with everything they said,

652
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,974
and they thought I had low self-esteem.

653
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:47,135
In the end, they even disapproved
of what my parents do.

654
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,855
What can you do, get new parents?

655
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,151
What makes them think
they're so much better than you?

656
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:59,114
The guy took my hand and told me

657
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,566
I could trust him.

658
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,492
He said he'd protect me.

659
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:06,789
That's the only reason
why I stayed in that relationship.

660
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,960
And?

661
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,668
He suddenly announced
that he was marrying another girl.

662
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,915
That was the last I heard from him.

663
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:17,263
That's crazy.
Why did he even tell you all those things?

664
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,342
Why did he do that to me?

665
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,970
I still wonder.

666
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,262
What did I do wrong?

667
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,307
You did nothing wrong.

668
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,481
After betraying you, he didn't have
the courage to face you and disappeared.

669
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,482
But how can I be sure?

670
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,526
Unless he tells me himself.

671
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,243
So? You want to know why he left you?

672
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,615
This is unbelievable.
Have a drink. It's on the house.

673
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,094
Drink it.

674
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,222
You'll feel much better afterward.

675
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,260
Thank you.

676
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,283
Fine, I'll find out why he deceived her.

677
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,453
If he tries to make up some lame excuse,
I'll...

678
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,128
This place is...

679
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,802
I do not wish to see you again.

680
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,641
If I happen to see
the face of yours again,

681
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:53,103
you will not be able to go back alive.

682
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,316
I hear that your mother raised you alone.

683
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,486
After all she has done for you,

684
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:06,319
you should not do anything
that might harm her, should you?

685
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,868
She...

686
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,704
really was the reincarnation of the queen.

687
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,085
The crown prince's wedding
is only five days away.

688
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,706
Make sure everything goes perfectly.

689
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,337
Yes, Your Majesty.
You do not have to worry.

690
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,799
We are welcoming
the beautiful and bright daughter

691
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,394
of the well-respected Kim Jin
into the royal family.

692
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,060
It is truly a blessing to the country.

693
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,773
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

694
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:40,444
I can't wait to see the crown prince
next to the crown princess.

695
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,600
You look absolutely majestic
and dignified.

696
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,269
All my wishes have come true now.

697
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,823
It is for the country
and the royal family.

698
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,494
So you lived happily

699
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,662
even after I died.

700
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,291
Why did you do that to me?

701
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,495
Why...

702
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,844
-Let's get out of here.
-Just a second.

703
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,589
I have to ask him something.

704
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,217
I told you not to do this. Let's go.

705
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,526
Your face,

706
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,065
your voice...

707
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,452
I knew it was you.

708
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,950
Why are you here?

709
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,294
What more do you want from me?

710
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,672
After trampling on me and my mother,

711
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,250
you want to see me being punished?

712
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,836
You want to laugh at me?

713
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,261
It's only in my memory,
but it's all my fault.

714
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,474
There's something you should know.

715
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,550
-I came to show you the truth...
-Enough.

716
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,654
Ms. Shin, please leave now.

717
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,574
No.

718
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,783
Tell me.

719
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,988
What's the truth?

720
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,828
-The crown prince, 500 years ago...
-Leave!

721
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,315
What do you think you're doing?

722
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,318
Lord Kim Jin told me

723
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:38,985
that Weol-ju can access people's memories
in their dreams.

724
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,455
I wanted to let her know the truth.
It's for you too.

725
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,964
You haven't

726
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,378
changed a bit.

727
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,012
If you two get back together,

728
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,184
my long-held grudge will be settled,

729
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,550
and Weol-ju will get closer
to her 100,000th case.

730
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,847
It's good for everyone, don't you think?

731
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,561
If she settles more grudges now,

732
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,813
she'll be sent to Hell.

733
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,692
Please listen to me.

734
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:12,321
You're neither the queen
nor my mother anymore.

735
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,778
So please stop meddling in our lives

736
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,664
and live as Shin Ji-hye.

737
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,237
I beg you.

738
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,298
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

739
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,497
You can't enter here!

740
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:14,166
I know that. Let go!

741
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,625
YEOMRADAEWANG

742
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,390
I'm sorry.

743
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,893
I know I shouldn't barge in like this,
but I'm in a hurry.

744
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,635
You're in a hurry? Why?

745
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,727
Do you remember me being transferred

746
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,693
to the Mystic Pop-up Bar a year ago?

747
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,983
When I asked you
what you wanted as a reward

748
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,817
for making the most arrests
as a detective for 500 years,

749
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,993
you asked to be sent to Weol-ju.

750
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:44,834
Yes, and you were the one who told me
Weol-ju might be sent to Hell

751
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,461
because it was taking her too long
to solve the cases.

752
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,880
I know you sent me to her
because you were worried about her.

753
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,923
So how could you do this?

754
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:59,966
Is Weol-ju's sin so grave
that she deserves to be sent to Hell

755
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,016
even after being punished for 500 years?

756
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,983
Disclosure of secrets is a grave sin.

757
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,690
Someone must take responsibility.

758
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:15,731
Don't you know
that's the law of the Afterlife?

759
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,782
And Weol-ju took over the responsibility
out of her own will.

760
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,162
How can I stop her from doing that?

761
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,659
You can't stop her?

762
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,198
Then

763
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,371
I guess you can't stop me either.

764
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,883
I'll take over the responsibility
from Weol-ju.

765
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,590
What?

766
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:43,219
You already paid for your sins
by working at the Police Agency.

767
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,513
You even volunteered
at the bar after that.

768
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,427
You've done everything you...

769
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,516
I may have paid

770
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:55,113
for killing my childhood friend
and taking my life,

771
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,778
but not for making Weol-ju

772
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,782
die alone.

773
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:14,168
Is it Weol-ju again?

774
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,088
Please

775
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,641
allow me.

776
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,024
Let me

777
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,313
go to Hell for her.

778
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:59,206
Well, did Ms. Shin ever come back here?

779
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,676
She did. It doesn't end there.

780
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,813
She lured me into the Dream World

781
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,890
and showed me
that she's the reincarnation of the queen.

782
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,015
Really?

783
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,480
Did you see anything else?

784
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,438
Guibanjang interfered.

785
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:22,356
Darn it.

786
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,320
Why did she do that, by the way?

787
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,827
She said she wanted to show me the truth.

788
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,867
I don't know what she meant by that.

789
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,075
It's been bothering me.
I think I should go see her.

790
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,416
That's a good idea.
You don't want it to keep bothering you.

791
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:43,419
Why don't you get going
before Guibanjang shows up?

792
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,336
Weol-ju!

793
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,219
-Yeombujang.
-Yes?

794
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,640
Everything's okay now. Everything's okay.

795
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,563
What do you mean?

796
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,597
Weol-ju's contract

797
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,273
-has been nullified.
-What?

798
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,107
Gosh, what's wrong?

799
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,241
I'm sorry. I got too excited.

800
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,649
What did you say?

801
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,826
Who am I? I confronted Yeomradaewang,

802
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,830
negotiated, and solved everything!

803
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,543
Explain so we can understand.

804
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:19,213
It couldn't have been that easy.

805
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,585
Of course, it wasn't easy.

806
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,223
That's why I stepped in.

807
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:31,677
There's something that fell into my hands
while I was working as a detective.

808
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,270
-Boom!
-A nuclear bomb? What do you mean?

809
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,364
Well, as a detective,

810
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,360
you happen to find out
about the higher-ups' dirty secrets

811
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,823
even if I did not intend to find out.

812
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,164
A detective's instinct.

813
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,159
I had put together
all those secrets into files,

814
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,203
and I handed them over.

815
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:57,826
Hey.

816
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,422
You were holding on to those?

817
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,125
Yes,

818
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,261
and I gave them up for you.

819
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,883
You owe me big-time.

820
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,049
I know. Thank you.

821
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,723
Hold on.

822
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:20,270
So Weol-ju doesn't have to go to Hell
even if she solves 100,000 cases?

823
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:25,862
She has to solve 100,000 cases
in order not to end up in Hell.

824
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,192
We have to hurry.

825
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,913
We wasted too much time
on that darn contract.

826
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,713
Where are you going?

827
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,050
I'm going to meet the queen.

828
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,255
What? Why?

829
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,481
Ms. Shin is on a business trip to Paris.

830
00:57:58,558 --> 00:57:59,888
-Really?
-Yes.

831
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,193
She called me
and said she was feeling bad.

832
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:05,981
She said she'd be abroad for a while

833
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,533
and asked me to cheer you up.

834
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,617
Something doesn't feel right.
She knew that I didn't like her.

835
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,333
Why would she show me her previous life?

836
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,501
When will she be back?

837
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,712
Just let it go.
We have to solve more cases.

838
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,383
You almost ended up in Hell.
Don't get in trouble again.

839
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,048
Can you go grocery shopping?

840
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,801
Salt, garlic, green onions...

841
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,589
We're out of ingredients.

842
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,392
While you're there, tell Kang-bae
that you won't go to Hell.

843
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,473
He must be worried.

844
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,233
All right, see you.

845
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,231
See you.

846
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,319
She should never meet Shin Ji-hye.

847
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,033
Where did I put her business card?

848
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,038
<i>Settling the grudges of 100,000 people?</i>

849
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:05,165
What happens after she pays for her sin?

850
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,380
Both Weol-ju and the crown prince

851
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,837
will be born again.

852
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:15,007
Weol-ju will get closer
to her 100,000th case.

853
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,103
It's good for everyone, don't you think?

854
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,808
If she settles more grudges now,

855
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,228
she'll be sent to Hell.

856
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,266
<i>The crown prince has no reason to lie.</i>

857
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,403
<i>Did Lord Kim Jin lie?</i>

858
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,611
<i>Why? What for?</i>

859
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,990
I should meet the crown prince first.

860
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,116
Lord Kim, what brings you here?

861
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:46,329
Are you going somewhere?

862
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,206
Yes, I failed last time.

863
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,455
I'll meet Weol-ju
and try to clear up her misunderstanding.

864
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,347
What's the matter?

865
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,231
Because the crown prince
has been acting up,

866
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,269
my plans have changed.

867
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,364
I'm here to tell you

868
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,031
that you won't be able to clear up
the misunderstanding.

869
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,440
Pardon?

870
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,741
I'm going to

871
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,413
get rid of you.

872
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,905
What do you mean?

873
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,371
Who are you?

874
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,672
Now that I look like this,

875
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,459
everyone seems to tell me what they think.

876
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,547
Everything's become so easy.

877
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,051
My father is quite useful
for the first time.

878
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:52,016
Won-hyung, how...

879
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,940
I quite enjoyed my time in Hell.

880
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:00,236
So much so that I'm here to take your son
and Weol-ju with me.

881
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,238
Isn't that nice of me?

882
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,290
After all these years,

883
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,575
you're still only good at deceiving
and tormenting people.

884
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,745
I didn't expect your last words
to be such a compliment.

885
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,838
Goodbye.

886
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,061
-Do you want to do this now?
-No, I'll do it later.

887
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,765
Look at those lovebirds.

888
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,109
Being all lovey-dovey...

889
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,491
Kang-bae,
this is supposed to be your break.

890
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:39,534
Thanks for your help.

891
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,617
Was this just work for you?

892
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,784
It was love for me.

893
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:46,953
What?

894
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,791
<i>Was this just work for you?</i>

895
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,668
It was love for me.

896
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,092
Do you know that you're like these carts?

897
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,005
I'm like these carts?

898
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,637
I want to take you everywhere

899
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,510
and give you all the nice things,

900
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,563
but I can't bring you home.

901
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,944
You make me marvel and despair
at the same time.

902
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:15,477
Weol-ju.

903
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,645
Do you know that you're like the moon?

904
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,780
What do you mean?

905
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:30,617
The moon shines so bright and is so small
that it fits between my fingers,

906
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:36,247
but I can never bring it home.

907
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:42,256
Whenever I see it,
I marvel and despair at the same time.

908
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,602
Stop teasing me.

909
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,848
Ms. Weol-ju, are you grocery shopping?

910
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:55,767
Where

911
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,574
did you hear those words?

912
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:01,283
-What do you mean?
-The thing you just said.

913
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,609
"Was this just work for you?
It was love for me.

914
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,907
I despair because I can't bring you home."

915
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,493
You just said that.

916
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:12,076
That? What do you think?
Do you think she liked it?

917
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,667
Where did you hear it? Who said that?

918
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,376
Who else? Guibanjang told me.

919
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,755
He said it worked very well for him.

920
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,628
Isn't it much better
than that rock festival joke?

921
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,546
What...

922
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,889
<i>When you want someone, tell them,</i>

923
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:37,856
"I want to be the person you need".

924
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,278
He must've wanted to be with someone
he loves...

925
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,569
<i>"In her final moments,</i>

926
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:49,986
<i>what was I doing?</i>

927
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,869
I didn't know anything."

928
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,624
He'd feel sorry

929
01:03:55,456 --> 01:03:56,706
and powerless.

930
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,747
<i>Now there are two people</i>

931
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,092
who understand you.

932
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,594
Was your past that painful?

933
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,676
Painful enough to want a fresh start?

934
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,222
<i>Was he like that?</i>

935
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,853
The man you loved.

936
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,098
You must resent him.

937
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,770
Do you have any idea
why I was a detective for 500 years

938
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,107
and what I went through to be here?

939
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,574
I can't let you end up
in the Hell of Extinction.

940
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,626
This number should be right.

941
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,168
Why isn't she picking up?

942
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,259
What happened?

943
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,430
Why are you back already?

944
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,353
What about the groceries?

945
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,652
What's wrong? Did something happen?

946
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,117
Who

947
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:13,989
are you?

948
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,250
What are you talking about?

949
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:18,786
Who are you?

950
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,329
You guys dated in your previous lives?

951
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:58,658
Hey.

952
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,666
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Did I do something wrong?

953
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,537
-Yes. You're handsome.
<i>-</i>I asked if I look good in this outfit.

954
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:05,877
Yes, you look incredible.

955
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:07,964
<i>No! Don't you dare!</i>

956
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,337
What in the world are you talking about?

957
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,136
<i>Show yourself.</i> <i>I said, show yourself.</i>

958
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,136
<i>Who are you?</i>

959
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,178
<i>Please tell me. Who are you?</i>

960
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,984
<i>-The poor mother and the daughter.</i>
<i>-</i>His name is...

961
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,649
Please. Trust me this once and...

962
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,690
