1
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,467
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,056
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,293
Ms. Weol-ju?

4
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,730
What are you waiting for?

5
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,523
Eat up and take your medicine.

6
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,980
I don't want to.

7
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,228
What?

8
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,033
I've worked so hard to cook you this.

9
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,453
-It may not look like much, but...
-That's not it.

10
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,615
It's too precious to eat.

11
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,000
This is the first time
anyone has cooked for me at home.

12
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,631
I'm touched, Ms. Weol-ju.

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,974
I need you to get better
so that we can get back to work.

14
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,644
Being all sentimental
is a luxury we can't afford.

15
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,720
Right? We have a job to get back to.

16
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,483
It's tasty, Ms. Weol-ju.

17
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,613
I mean it.

18
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,443
I'm glad you have a good palate.

19
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,743
So what's your favorite dish?

20
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,738
My favorite dish?

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,000
I like dumplings.

22
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,787
-Dumplings?
-Yes, they're tasty.

23
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,292
They're packed with meat and vegetables,

24
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,547
and all you have to do
is simply steam them.

25
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,129
Is that what you think?

26
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,844
Do you have any idea
how much work goes into making them?

27
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,352
I only buy frozen dumplings at the market.

28
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,228
Me?

29
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,896
It has to be me?

30
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,356
That's right.

31
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,616
Out of all of us, you're the fittest.

32
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,409
Wait.

33
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,252
-The fittest?
-Come on.

34
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,869
Consider your feeble seniors.

35
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,961
Mr. Ma suffers from a sore back,

36
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,752
and my knees aren't what they used to be.

37
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,416
Didn't you injure them
playing soccer in the military?

38
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,719
Whatever.

39
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,844
So how could we possibly
enter the competition?

40
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,853
You, on the other hand,
have a straight spine

41
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,970
and healthy joints.

42
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,767
The grand prize is two million won
to spend on a team dinner.

43
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,859
Can't we enjoy
an all-you-can-eat beef barbecue?

44
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,319
No.

45
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,862
No way.

46
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,070
I'm not good at being in the spotlight

47
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,862
and being in close proximity to others.

48
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,737
We can't only do the things we like
while at work.

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,700
I remember how you always made excuses

50
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,456
to get out of participating
in company events.

51
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,131
Consider this as your chance
to make up for all those instances.

52
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,218
The company's in-house
couples dance contest

53
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,635
is an event to improve communication
and synergy between the teams.

54
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,849
The winning department
will win two million won,

55
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,232
and how well you do

56
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,018
will be considered
in your performance review.

57
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,693
Please choose partners among yourselves

58
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,572
and hand in the application forms.

59
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,359
I can't even dance.
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

60
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,066
I need to settle in,
so I should be up for anything.

61
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,971
Why exercise all of a sudden?

62
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,516
You saw Kang-bae pass out.

63
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,811
Well, it's not just him.
When I get exhausted these days,

64
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,024
I get lethargic and highly irritable.

65
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,435
It's probably
because I'm getting out of shape.

66
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,364
It's just your nasty temper.

67
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,359
-What?
-Yes, exercise.

68
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,525
Being fit is the most treasured quality.

69
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,787
That reminds me.
Is it true you made porridge for Kang-bae?

70
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,084
Yes.

71
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,040
Well,

72
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,419
don't you think you should
take care of me better too?

73
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,090
Let's face it.
I'm the one who does the heavy lifting.

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,840
You didn't even care
when I pulled my back the last time.

75
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,842
It happened because you lack
muscle strength, so work out more.

76
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,894
Lift your elbow at 90 degrees
and squeeze your core.

77
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,392
Is that how it's going to be?

78
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,519
Fine.

79
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,202
Jeez.

80
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,660
I'm too tired to go grocery shopping now.

81
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,544
I can't take another step.

82
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,040
Carry me back, will you?

83
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,378
I can't even feel my own arms and legs,
so move!

84
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,512
Carry me back.

85
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,718
Please carry me!

86
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,589
-Unbelievable.
-Aren't we going to open today?

87
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,758
-Faster!
-Off we go!

88
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,650
Why is it so difficult to pedal?

89
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,699
Is the bike broken?

90
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,910
Are you sure you're pedaling...

91
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,513
You must be in a good mood.

92
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,063
What was that?
Did you say something to me?

93
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,609
I said...

94
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,608
I'm dying trying to pedal for us both.

95
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,242
Lose some weight why don't you?

96
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,608
I'll return to the Afterlife soon,
so what's the point?

97
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,736
I'm going to eat everything I want
before my time is up.

98
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,263
Hey.

99
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,468
I want a bite.

100
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,429
This again?

101
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,403
Stick to yours.

102
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,900
It's so good. It's octopus-flavored.

103
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,736
Do you want to swap?
I'd rather have that instead.

104
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,583
Why not get this in the first place
instead of asking for mine?

105
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,873
I didn't know it was octopus-flavored.

106
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,674
Unbelievable. Fine, go ahead.

107
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,551
Gosh.

108
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,507
What are you guys doing here?

109
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,176
-Yeombujang, what brings you by...
-No, please sit.

110
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,732
Shouldn't you get ready
to open the bar for tonight?

111
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,102
Did you come all the way here
to spy on us?

112
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,728
-Well, we were getting some exercise.
-Exercise?

113
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,987
On this?

114
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,946
Are you two on a date?

115
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,822
That's just disgusting.

116
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,999
So what brings you by?

117
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,869
Oh, well. Hold on, why am I here?

118
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:02,628
Right, I had a favor to ask.

119
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,129
I've been having trouble
tracking down a wandering spirit.

120
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,052
I need to be at the Death Workshop
for the entire Asia Branch

121
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,431
so I don't have the time
to track it down myself.

122
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,721
Can you idiots...

123
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,142
I mean, can you help me out?

124
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,011
As if I have the time for that.

125
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,848
I'm still far off from meeting my quota.

126
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,603
The clock's ticking and Kang-bae is sick.
I'm antsy as hell.

127
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,057
-Then let me...
-Don't you dare.

128
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,817
You always leave your post
to chase spirits.

129
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,229
Just go back to being a cop, then.

130
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,317
In the meantime,
I'll report you for neglect of duty.

131
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,986
What's with that temper of yours?

132
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,244
At least hear me out
before you bite our heads off.

133
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,996
I'm not asking you to do this for free.

134
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,410
The Death in charge of this spirit

135
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,867
said that she took off

136
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,998
because she didn't say goodbye
to her family.

137
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,545
So instead of bringing the spirit to me...

138
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,130
I can help her enter
her family member's dream

139
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,087
and score easily by settling her grudge.

140
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,307
Exactly. That's what I mean.

141
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,218
So do the math.

142
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,426
You'll score another soul
and my problem will be solved.

143
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,305
Where does she frequent?

144
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,292
It's been some time
since my mother passed.

145
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,043
Do you think she's resting in peace?

146
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,168
We can only hope that she is.

147
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,672
I still remember the moment she passed.

148
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,594
Even with her last breath,

149
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,007
she kept calling out for you.

150
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,022
That's how much she wanted to see you.

151
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,811
I was too busy at work...

152
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,153
to be by her deathbed.

153
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,236
That reminds me.

154
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,278
Where are you meeting your sister?

155
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,525
I'm meeting her at her house.

156
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,207
You know how she is.

157
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,792
Whenever we go somewhere,

158
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,170
she always brings beverages and snacks.

159
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,714
She'll need help carrying them.

160
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,340
Don't worry about the money

161
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,176
and enjoy a delicious meal
with your sister.

162
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,430
-You should get going.
-I'll drop you off at work.

163
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,426
Don't worry. It's only a short cab ride.

164
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,016
Go on.

165
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,652
Sure thing.

166
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,265
Drive safely.

167
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,271
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

168
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,732
Thank you.

169
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,270
Poor guy.

170
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,072
Do you perhaps

171
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,541
know that man?

172
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,633
-It's me.
-Hi.

173
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,259
There's no need to be moved again.

174
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,889
I'm making them
because I want to eat them myself.

175
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,192
I'll sort out the cutlery.

176
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,267
What's going on?

177
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,444
I thought you loved dumplings.

178
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,940
It's nothing.

179
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,989
Don't be like that and tell me.

180
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,575
Well, I entered the company's
couples dance competition.

181
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,044
-A dance competition?
-It's not just dancing.

182
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,699
It's a couples dance competition.

183
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,373
There's no way I can do this
without physical contact.

184
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,837
What if everyone at work
finds out about my condition?

185
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,219
How on earth did you
end up in a dance competition?

186
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,385
Didn't I tell you to fly under the radar
and keep to yourself?

187
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,679
You need to conserve your energy there
for when you come to work here at night.

188
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,475
There are some things you can't help
as a mere employee.

189
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,811
I was forced
since I'm the youngest and fittest...

190
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,984
-Is that why Yeo-rin entered too?
-Yeo-rin?

191
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,856
The girl who isn't susceptible
to your touch?

192
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,574
You can partner up with her, then.

193
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,994
She acts like I don't exist,
so she'd never agree to it.

194
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,283
You said you can't get out of it,
so what other option do you have?

195
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,201
I guess you're right.

196
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,908
Anyway, you'd better focus

197
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,377
because today's mission
is a million times more important.

198
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,999
Why are we at an apartment complex?

199
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,170
<i>This is where</i>
<i>the wandering spirit used to live.</i>

200
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,553
<i>All we need to do is wait here</i>

201
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,183
<i>and get her</i>
<i>when she comes to see her family.</i>

202
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,932
TODAY'S MENU: DUMPLINGS

203
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,237
It's nice and plump.

204
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,989
They're delicious.

205
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,164
Of course they are.

206
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,957
Why? Because I made them.

207
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,253
You deserve to boast about them.

208
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:43,716
I love dumplings
so my wife makes them for me often.

209
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,589
Her shrimp dumplings are the best.

210
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,474
You're right about them being delicious.
I love them too.

211
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,845
My mother also enjoyed them as well.

212
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,984
Even while she was battling her illness,

213
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,311
she'd easily empty a plate
of my wife's dumplings.

214
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,739
It was also the last meal she had
before passing away.

215
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,198
It must have been hard for you.

216
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,490
My wife was the one
who had it the hardest.

217
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,907
She had to look after
her sick mother-in-law.

218
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,995
By the way, has anything strange
been happening to you

219
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,094
at home or at work?

220
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,804
What do you mean?

221
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,126
Have you been seeing things

222
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,967
or feeling chills down your spine?

223
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,642
Sorry?

224
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,681
It's nothing.

225
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,807
Do your thing. It could give us a lead.

226
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,518
Sure thing.

227
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,699
I forgot to give you this.

228
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,907
Thank you.

229
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,170
There's something on you.

230
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,690
I searched the area but found nothing.

231
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,480
-Did you see anything?
-Nope. Nothing.

232
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,574
The lady at the grocery store out front

233
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,025
told me that
he always used to return home late.

234
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,032
But the funeral must've left him
empty inside

235
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,575
because he's been
coming home early ever since.

236
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,411
What if the wandering spirit
isn't following him around

237
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,035
but waiting for him at home?

238
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,082
Has she attached herself
to the house, then?

239
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,841
I'm afraid we'll have
to search inside the house.

240
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,894
Sorry to bother you
so late in the evening,

241
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:56,099
but the unit below yours
has been complaining about a water leak.

242
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,481
Could I perhaps check
if everything's all right?

243
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,600
-Sure thing.
-Thanks.

244
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,439
Let me see.

245
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,531
Maybe it's the bathroom pipe.

246
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,785
Could it be one of the pipes in the rooms?

247
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,294
Everything seems fine to me.

248
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,920
Sir, could I perhaps check
the master bedroom?

249
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,918
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

250
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,605
That's odd.

251
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,823
She's not at the house.

252
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,064
Unbelievable.

253
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,852
Where do we search now?

254
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,484
Why didn't Kang-bae's touch
have any effect on him, though?

255
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,694
I'm just as baffled.

256
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,113
Are you sure it's working?

257
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,895
It didn't work on that Yeo-rin girl.

258
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,157
It's happened twice already.

259
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,083
I don't know what's going on.

260
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,498
I'm sorry for not being any help.

261
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,788
If only I could see spirits too.

262
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:48,133
Kang-bae, if you had the ability
to get people to spill their beans

263
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,090
and see spirits,

264
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,590
you would've been better off
working as a shaman.

265
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,511
-Imagine the dough you'd rake in.
-The dough?

266
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,295
Talk about being a bad influence.
Being a shaman isn't easy, you know.

267
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,013
People curse you out

268
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,678
and come at you with knives.

269
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,307
What? Knives?

270
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,312
How do you know all this stuff?

271
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,944
Well...

272
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,397
How could I not know everything

273
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,867
when I've spent 500 years here already?

274
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,622
Right.

275
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,539
If this spirit
wanted to say goodbye to her family,

276
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,961
she should be trying
to get in touch with them,

277
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,380
not wandering around.

278
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,498
That's what I find odd.

279
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,166
Starting tomorrow, we'll have to
put him under proper surveillance.

280
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,575
Not even a wandering spirit
would voluntarily get on this bus.

281
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,351
Focus, Weol-ju.

282
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,928
Don't fall and draw unnecessary attention.

283
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,440
You're lucky to be so tall.

284
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,237
What the hell? Why isn't he getting off?

285
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,119
This is where his office is.

286
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,626
What is it? Did you see something?

287
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,088
Don't look.

288
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,351
-It's here.
-Really?

289
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,720
So now what? Do we go after it?

290
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,636
It's in possession
of another human's body.

291
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,436
We'll cause a scene by going after it now.
When people get off at the next stop,

292
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,899
we should...

293
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,154
Shit!

294
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,487
-Hold on. Sir, the door.
-Let us off!

295
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,133
Damn it.

296
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,153
Shit.

297
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,852
Get out of his body, evil spirit.

298
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,018
What? That's not the spirit we're after.

299
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,211
Watch out!

300
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,769
What are you doing?

301
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,360
Hey.

302
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,025
Are you all right?

303
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,156
What?

304
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,245
It's just a scratch.

305
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,369
I got lucky
considering it was an evil spirit.

306
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,590
I see that being a cop
isn't a walk in the park.

307
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,051
Hold on! Have you been whining
that the work at the bar is tough

308
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,393
when you used to do
something even more dangerous?

309
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,351
Of course.

310
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,062
You were genuinely worried about me,
but it only lasted for about ten seconds.

311
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,097
I'll take him back to Afterlife,

312
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,935
-so get some rest at the bar.
-No.

313
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,439
No, I should follow
the guy back to his office.

314
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,244
Could the wandering spirit
have turned evil already?

315
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,113
-Boo!
-Damn it.

316
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,038
What the hell? Is he still not at work?

317
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,505
-Sir...
-Sorry about this.

318
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,589
I don't usually take the bus

319
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,755
-so I missed my stop.
-I see.

320
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,684
-You need to be at the executive meeting.
-Got it.

321
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,340
Hey. Hey, you. Can we talk for a second?

322
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,299
I already found you.
We'll get you even if you run away.

323
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,881
Come here. Okay?

324
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:13,506
Okay. Fine. I got it. I won't go near you.

325
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,176
Then please hear me out
from where you are.

326
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,234
I understand why you're doing this.

327
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,350
I've also

328
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,855
left behind someone

329
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,237
who I cared about and loved when I died.

330
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,032
But this won't change a thing!

331
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,532
This will make things harder for you
in the Afterlife.

332
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,372
Take a look at yourself now.

333
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,700
You can't even talk to him.

334
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,455
What else can you do
except for hovering around him?

335
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:45,344
Why don't we make this
into a win-win situation for both of us?

336
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,415
I'll help you settle your grudge.

337
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,468
Stop running away. Come with me.

338
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,390
We should

339
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,811
go to my pop-up bar together.

340
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,598
We can...

341
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,026
Damn it!

342
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,700
Are you the one who gave this out?

343
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,914
-Hey, get out. Get out of here.
-Gosh.

344
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,447
I'll smack you if you come back again.

345
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,157
This is my training session.
It's just for today.

346
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,618
A training session?

347
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,998
How dare you set up shop on my turf?

348
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,955
I ought to... Get lost!

349
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,258
I'm watching you.

350
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,261
-You...
-Excuse me.

351
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,301
-Excuse me.
-Let me in.

352
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,345
-Let me get in, too.
-I'm going down.

353
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,012
-Don't push me.
-I must hurry.

354
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,097
Let's go upstairs first.

355
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,686
Yeo-rin.

356
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,233
What is it?

357
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,483
Did you find a dance partner yet?

358
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,475
No, not yet.

359
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,187
Same here.

360
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,161
So let me ask.

361
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,986
-Well...
-What is it?

362
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,617
So if you decided to participate
in this event anyway,

363
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,584
do you want to make this easy
and partner up with me?

364
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,876
"Make this easy"? Easy for who? Me?

365
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,050
Well, since we know each other...

366
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,630
Look, Kang-bae.

367
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,925
Pairing up with me

368
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,555
might be easy for you
because I know you're in the CIA.

369
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,560
But knowing your secret
makes me uncomfortable.

370
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,602
No, that's not why I said it.

371
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,478
It's a personal reason.
How should I explain this to her?

372
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,240
Yeo-rin, you're special to me.

373
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,712
You're the only person who doesn't feel
a thing when you touch me.

374
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,803
So I have to partner up with you.

375
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,468
What?

376
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,717
Kang-bae.

377
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,140
If my fist touches your face,

378
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,721
my knee touches your solar plexus,

379
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,899
or my foot touches your shin,
how will that feel?

380
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,693
So she rejected you.

381
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,954
Yes. It's not easy as expected.

382
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,954
It'd be better if someone else...

383
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,240
You're bound to face hard tasks at work.

384
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,414
If you have a problem,
you need to solve it.

385
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,413
He's right.

386
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,913
In my opinion,

387
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:29,791
the problem with you is that
you are so used to accommodating others.

388
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,043
A man who begs to partner up
isn't attractive at all.

389
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,383
Women prefer bad guys over timid guys.

390
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,512
He's right.
Men are all about their confidence.

391
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,814
-How do you show your confidence?
-For example...

392
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,273
Yeo-rin, do you want me?

393
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,230
I haven't found a partner yet.

394
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,864
But I still don't want to
partner up with you.

395
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,065
-I doubt that.
-What?

396
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:04,365
I doubt that. You will want to partner up
with me in three seconds.

397
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,451
Wait and see. Three, two, one.

398
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,174
Kang-bae, you're so cool.
Please be my partner.

399
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,299
Did you see that?

400
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,049
You'll want to do it with me
in three seconds.

401
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,466
Wait and see.

402
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,520
Three, two,

403
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,768
one.

404
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,641
Are you out of your mind?

405
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,947
That method might be dangerous.

406
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,079
Yeo-rin.

407
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,047
Can I sit with you?

408
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,380
-Other tables are open.
-I'm just glad to see you.

409
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,141
Excuse me.
A bowl of hangover soup, please.

410
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,510
Hello. Is there a table for me?

411
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,767
Yes, come this way.

412
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,770
Thank you.

413
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,138
Thanks.

414
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,311
Goodness.

415
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,824
How could he bring a dog to a restaurant?
That's so inconsiderate.

416
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,276
The dog's hair got in the <i>kkakdugi.</i>
I lost my appetite.

417
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,084
I'm sorry.

418
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:35,286
You don't need to be sorry.
Enjoy your meal here.

419
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,785
GUIDE DOG

420
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,344
Ma'am, guide dogs are allowed by law
to enter restaurants.

421
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,052
Our law guarantees the right
to use public transportation

422
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,223
and to enter public places
and accommodation facilities.

423
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,263
That's absurd.

424
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,555
What kind of crappy law is that?

425
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,143
Even if that's the law,

426
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,595
people should come first.
How can we put dogs over us?

427
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,145
People must come first.

428
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,282
Ma'am, we human beings are considered
to be the lords of all creation

429
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,584
because we can understand
and help each other.

430
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,828
Even that dog is helping someone.

431
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,910
Why don't you behave like a human being

432
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,121
if you want to be treated like one?

433
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,366
What?

434
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,339
Okay.

435
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,174
Apologize to him.

436
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,048
Hey.

437
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,259
I'm sorry.

438
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,719
I guess I was wrong.

439
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,465
Enjoy your food.

440
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,062
Excuse me. Get his order, please.

441
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,643
Okay.

442
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,115
Yeo-rin, you are really cool.

443
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,872
"The lords of all creation."

444
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,786
How did you know the laws
about guide dogs?

445
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,462
Oh, that.

446
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,794
By nature, I have a hard time
being around people,

447
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,758
but I'm comfortable around animals.

448
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,220
So I studied a bit about animals

449
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,509
and did a bit of volunteer work.

450
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,744
-I don't want to.
-Look at your fingers.

451
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,779
They'll come right off when I work.

452
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,952
Shut it. Tell me more about that guy.

453
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,581
I think he likes you.

454
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,037
As if.

455
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,118
He wants to partner up with me because...

456
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,753
You're the only person who doesn't feel
a thing when you touch me.

457
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,417
So I must partner up with you.

458
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,422
Forget it. Anyway, he's out.

459
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,535
You can't work at a bar
with your hand like that.

460
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,411
I'm only doing this
because you have to work.

461
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,457
I don't want to scare away the customers.

462
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,210
I didn't say anything.

463
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,502
My goodness.

464
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:30,128
All right. I should peel
all the onions I didn't get to.

465
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,513
Hold on.

466
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,389
Do you want to eat meat?

467
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,722
Meat? All of a sudden?

468
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,228
We exercised a lot today

469
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,899
and went all around town
for the case, so I'm a bit tired.

470
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,314
I need a boost of energy.

471
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,692
I can't have barbecue alone. Come with me.

472
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,323
Why is she so talkative today?

473
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,237
Gosh.

474
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,758
What was the passcode?

475
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,110
Honey.

476
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,031
Why did you come home so early?
You should have stayed out a bit longer.

477
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,077
Socializing can be exhausting.
Staying at home is the best.

478
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:44,964
If I didn't come home tonight,
you would have spent the night out there.

479
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,955
You're right.

480
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,002
My gosh, thank you.

481
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,087
-I must be getting old.
-What?

482
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,802
I'm becoming more forgetful.

483
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,892
I even got off at the wrong stop
this morning when I was distracted.

484
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:59,638
Really? You're too young for that.

485
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,265
Could it be because you're getting weak?

486
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,680
Do you want some herbal tonics?

487
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,358
No. The food you cook for me
will be more than enough.

488
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,477
Okay. Go and wash up quickly.

489
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,686
I'll set the table to restore your energy.

490
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,509
Gosh, that was so close.

491
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,723
That wandering spirit...

492
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,176
I almost persuaded the spirit

493
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,426
by appealing to her
with kindness and tolerance.

494
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,398
You didn't yell, threaten,

495
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,648
-or scare her?
-No.

496
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,018
I'm serious.
I was just like Oprah Winfrey.

497
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,688
I was really empathetic
when I was talking to her.

498
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,529
I can picture how it went.

499
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,243
You probably drove her crazy
with your words.

500
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,414
That must be why she ran away from you.

501
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,163
You should have waited until I got there.

502
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,205
You should stay put
or you'll mess it up again.

503
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,079
I just felt bad for her.

504
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,037
I pity her.

505
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:16,166
The trip to the Afterlife
is already scary as it is.

506
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,465
But she has to leave behind
her loved one in this world.

507
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,394
That must be utterly painful.

508
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,852
Personally, I feel more sympathetic

509
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,522
for Mr. Oh Sang-gun
since he's the one left behind.

510
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,146
"In her final moments,

511
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,864
what was I doing?

512
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,362
Was I eating at a restaurant?

513
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,704
Or was I working at the office?"

514
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,738
He will be living his life
tortured by these thoughts in his head.

515
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,080
It must be scary for him too.

516
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,042
"But in her final moments...

517
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,340
I didn't know anything."

518
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,223
He would feel sorry

519
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,180
and powerless.

520
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,137
He's not the only one
with the painful thoughts.

521
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,641
You know that death doesn't mean the end.

522
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,771
Even when you're dead,
you can see and feel everything.

523
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,475
I'm sure you know it's just as painful
as being left behind.

524
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,533
Ms. Weol-ju. Guibanjang.

525
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,239
You're here.

526
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,951
Why aren't you guys eating?
There's so much meat left.

527
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,754
We already finished a plate.
You have this.

528
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,828
Okay.

529
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,585
Can I have some soju?

530
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,839
What a surprise.

531
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,010
She turned me down
when I asked her to be my partner.

532
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,552
Hey, slow down. You'll get drunk.

533
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,444
Here. Have this before you drink.

534
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,395
Thank you.

535
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,908
You know what?
She shouldn't play so hard-to-get.

536
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,989
She seemed very heartless.

537
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,624
That's not true. Yeo-rin is really cool.

538
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,872
She may seem cold and indifferent,

539
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,874
but that's because
she just has a clear boundary.

540
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,746
She takes the initiative
when she sees people who need help.

541
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,000
She's charismatic.

542
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,916
Then why doesn't she like you?

543
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,915
You're the guy who needs the biggest help.

544
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,801
What did you tell her
when you asked her to be your partner?

545
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:28,724
Well, I told her
that she was special to me,

546
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,143
and it's nice that she doesn't feel
a thing when she touches me.

547
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,574
You're so frustrating.
Are you trying to start a fight?

548
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,363
What am I supposed to say?

549
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,446
Listen up, Kang-bae.

550
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,033
When you want someone,

551
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:52,121
you don't say that you need that someone.

552
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:54,789
Tell them,

553
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,839
"I want to be the person you need."

554
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,838
That's what you say. Okay?

555
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,218
"I want to be the person you need."

556
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,975
When I am with you,

557
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,561
I am the most peaceful.

558
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,234
If I could spend
the rest of my life with you,

559
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,029
I wouldn't have any other wish.

560
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,485
You should not say such things.

561
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,041
I'm not just saying it.

562
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,537
I mean it.

563
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,338
You must spend the rest of your life

564
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,755
with a lady from a respectable
and virtuous family, Your Highness.

565
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,511
Being with a girl of a lowly status
like myself would be preposterous.

566
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,102
Since you have recovered,

567
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,482
you don't have to keep me
by your side now.

568
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,765
I'm not keeping you by my side
because I need something from you.

569
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,146
It's because

570
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,855
I want to be someone you need.

571
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,741
Do you consider yourself indebted to me?

572
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,542
If so, please do not worry about that.

573
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,791
I only fulfilled the task
that was given to me.

574
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,628
Was this

575
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,093
just work for you?

576
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,719
It was love for me.

577
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,224
I don't consider myself indebted to you.

578
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,141
I just want to love you.

579
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,305
From that day

580
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,268
I heard your voice in my dream,

581
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,436
my heart belonged to you.

582
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:47,862
So...

583
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,695
I ask that you accept my love.

584
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,347
Hey.

585
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,760
Ms. Weol-ju.

586
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,773
Hey, aren't you going to eat more?

587
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,310
What?

588
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,105
I'm done eating.

589
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,906
Finish your meal.

590
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,203
What?

591
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,634
OH SANG-GUN

592
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,539
Mr. Oh.

593
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,499
What on earth are you doing here?

594
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,921
Are you out of your mind?

595
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,045
-Sir.
-The chairman from China

596
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,724
had to wait for three hours.

597
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,513
He's livid right now.

598
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,346
He said he wouldn't proceed
with the contract.

599
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:01,231
What are you talking about?
The meeting with him is tomorrow.

600
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,271
There's no way I would forget...

601
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,984
His company sent you an email
to reschedule the meeting for today.

602
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,856
They even received
a confirmation email from us.

603
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,531
Didn't you send it?

604
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:12,822
Hold on.

605
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,195
Gosh.

606
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:23,542
Mr. Han, don't just stand there.
Go and stop him from leaving. Okay?

607
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,626
Yes, sir.

608
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,538
Wait. Let me go with you.

609
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,999
-I should...
-Where do you think you're going?

610
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,458
Unbelievable.

611
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,180
I want you in my office.

612
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,484
Mr. Oh.

613
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:50,031
I'm sorry for yelling at you
in front of your subordinates earlier.

614
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,149
It's all right, sir.

615
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,408
I made a huge mistake. I am sorry.

616
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:00,292
Why did you want to see me in your office?

617
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,909
Okay. There's no point in stalling now.

618
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,879
The company will undergo
restructuring soon,

619
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,590
and your name will be on the list
of laid-off employees.

620
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,473
Before that happens,
why don't you resign voluntarily?

621
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,969
Wouldn't it be better to receive
half of your annual salary?

622
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:21,889
Sir.

623
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,854
I have dedicated my youth to this company.

624
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,193
I know I made a mistake,
but I don't think I deserve this.

625
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:33,114
No. It's not just
about the mistake you made.

626
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,571
Well, actually, from what I've heard,

627
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,075
people are saying
you've been acting weird.

628
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,499
I read the reports and proposals that
you looked over before handing them to me,

629
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,709
but they are incoherent.

630
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,828
And you're making many mistakes
unlike before.

631
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:47,955
Well,

632
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,709
I've become a bit forgetful these days.

633
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,180
I'm just fatigued, but I'll be fine
once I rest up for a few days.

634
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,139
I can finally afford

635
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,007
to send my wife on a trip.

636
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,430
I still have so much to do.

637
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,386
You...

638
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,687
What are you going to do?

639
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,771
We thought you were just shocked

640
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,693
from losing your wife,

641
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:15,605
so we overlooked your mistakes
and tried to be understanding.

642
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,244
Get a grip.

643
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,788
What are you talking about?

644
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,294
My wife

645
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,382
didn't die.

646
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,045
<i>Don't tell me that you also forgot</i>
<i>what happened to her.</i>

647
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,768
<i>I'm sure your wife went to a good place.</i>

648
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,486
Bye.

649
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,714
<i>I believe you have vascular dementia.</i>
<i>You need to receive treatment.</i>

650
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,464
<i>Why do I...</i>

651
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,785
<i>Why?</i>

652
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,765
You made dumplings.

653
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,395
Your dumplings...

654
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:26,279
You know, don't you?
That I love your dumplings.

655
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,856
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

656
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,864
My heart breaks for my husband.

657
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,084
How is he going to live alone?

658
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:35,328
But you can't just wander around here.

659
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,123
I'm sure you know
if you become a wandering spirit,

660
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,786
you won't get a favorable ruling

661
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,537
in the Afterlife.

662
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,127
I'm sorry.

663
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,629
I just couldn't leave him
all alone like that.

664
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,507
We promised each other

665
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,270
to live with one another
until the end of time on our honeymoon.

666
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,638
But now,

667
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,773
I just want to bid him farewell.

668
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,826
Gosh.

669
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,872
Where are you going?

670
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,665
I'm glad you're here. Come with us.

671
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,038
Where are we going?

672
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,165
To say goodbye for the last time.

673
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,012
What's with the screen?

674
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,880
I guess this is how his mind is right now.

675
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,968
His past memories are all mixed together.

676
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,390
Maybe that's why
he didn't react to my touch.

677
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,425
Yes, probably.

678
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,055
He must've had a tough time.

679
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,400
Hey, there they are.

680
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,032
This is really nice.

681
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:57,701
I'm sorry I didn't bring you earlier.

682
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,331
I'm just happy
that we finally got to come here.

683
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:16,971
Honey.

684
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:22,943
I'm really happy
that we got to live together.

685
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,775
That's nonsense.

686
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,993
I put you through so much hard work.

687
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,992
My goodness.

688
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,742
I'm glad you know.

689
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,159
I begged you to quit smoking and drinking,
but you never listened.

690
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,672
You're nagging until the very end.

691
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:55,506
Yes.

692
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,894
Today is really our last day together.

693
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,806
You know that, right?

694
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,858
I shouldn't have

695
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,686
sent you on that trip.

696
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,358
You died because of me.

697
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,620
What are you talking about?
It wasn't your fault.

698
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,535
Please do me a favor.

699
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,252
Please accept the fact
that you're not well,

700
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,463
and start receiving treatment, okay?

701
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,379
Don't ever think about giving up.

702
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,341
Okay.

703
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,677
Good.

704
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,646
I promised to grow old with you
when we got married.

705
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,942
I'm sorry I couldn't keep that promise.

706
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,660
If I knew this was going to happen,

707
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,155
I should've asked you

708
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,090
to drive me to work that day.

709
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:13,295
I should've talked to you more.

710
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,217
I should've looked into your eyes
for a closer look one last time.

711
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,180
I should've done that.

712
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:27,885
I was so lucky to have
a woman like you as my wife.

713
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,816
And I fear that I might forget that.

714
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,653
I'm so scared.

715
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,695
I'll remember everything.

716
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,619
Once you grow old,
and we meet again after you die,

717
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:47,714
I'll remind you of everything.

718
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,579
From start to finish.

719
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,341
So don't worry.

720
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,795
My goodness!

721
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,474
You're such a crybaby, honey.

722
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:05,968
I'm sorry.

723
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,444
I love you, Jin-suk.

KAPEUL MART

725
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,261
This can't be.

726
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,844
I swear I saw him.

727
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,102
What did you see?

728
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,346
There's nothing in here!

729
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,061
How could you say that right now?

730
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,519
I'm sorry, sir.
She must've been greatly mistaken.

731
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,020
I want you to fire her right now.
If you don't, I swear I won't stay still.

732
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,240
I'm sorry.

733
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,988
I'm very sorry.

734
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,990
An apology won't cut it.

735
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,704
I want you to get on your knees
and beg for forgiveness.

736
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,334
Then I might let you off the hook.

737
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:52,461
If you don't,
I'll write about this online!

738
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,724
Wait.

739
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,347
Sir.

740
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,885
Are you really not lying?

741
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:14,977
Mr. Han.

742
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,941
Are you guys kidding me?
What do you take me for?

743
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,106
Look inside! Look!

744
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,872
You're right. It's not in here.

745
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,368
Of course it's not in there.

746
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,788
If I put it in that bag, the alarm
would go off, and I'd get caught.

747
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:45,586
When we do stuff like this,
we normally do it in pairs.

748
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,635
I steal something
and switch the bag with my partner.

749
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,310
Then my partner hides, takes off the tag,
and quietly leaves.

750
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,771
Then where's your accomplice?

751
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,071
There he is. You have the liquor, right?

752
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,322
What the...

753
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,570
Are you crazy?

754
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,948
-Check the bag.
-Let me go!

755
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:10,874
Hey, let go of me!

756
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,331
Let me go.

757
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,077
It wasn't me. It was him!

758
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,595
Here.

759
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,852
Why did you do that?

760
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:42,074
You could've gotten fired as well
if you weren't lucky.

761
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,479
But of course I'm grateful.

762
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,937
Because you needed me.

763
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,606
You needed someone to trust you
at that moment.

764
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,032
When we first met,

765
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,450
you trusted me
even though we were complete strangers.

766
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,424
So when I met you again at the mart,
I told myself

767
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:04,046
that I'll also do the same for you

768
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,959
when you need someone to trust you.

769
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,759
I see.

770
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,603
I'll be off.

771
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,897
Mr. Han.

772
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,114
Did you find a partner?

773
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,319
No, not yet.

774
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,778
Me neither.

775
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,992
Would you like to be my partner?

776
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,076
What?

777
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,251
Really?

00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:23,584

781
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,362
There.

782
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,486
Are you going somewhere nice?
You look awfully happy.

783
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:54,569
Yes, I'm on my way to meet a friend.

784
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,283
I'm moving to his neighborhood.

785
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,788
You must be happy.

786
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,710
Where are you moving to?

787
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,290
Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province.

788
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,254
Don't you have a family?

789
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,416
I do.

790
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:11,801
My son is in the States.

791
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,131
He's planning to come back to Korea soon.

792
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,177
As for my wife,

793
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:24,063
she's no longer alive.

794
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,479
But she's a very cheerful woman

795
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:32,284
so I'm sure she'll be fine
until we meet again.

796
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,028
My goodness, I'm sorry to hear that.

797
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:40,084
Here are your shrimp dumplings. Enjoy.

798
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,248
What do you think?

799
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,260
The dumplings taste nice and warm.

800
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:02,215
They taste familiar for some reason.

801
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,689
I can't remember.

802
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,496
I enjoyed the food.

803
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,497
You're going to Yangpyeong, right?

804
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,219
I actually have business there myself.

805
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,756
This is great. Let me give you a ride.
We can go together.

806
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,885
No, it's okay.

807
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,103
I'm asking you for a favor.

808
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,982
It's boring to drive alone.
Come with me and keep me company.

809
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:50,145
Then thank you for the ride in advance.

810
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,809
Sure. Let's go.

811
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,044
Are they gone?

812
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,790
Yes, come on out.

813
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,540
They're gone, right? They're gone.

814
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,123
They're gone now. Come on.

815
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:19,426
Do you feel better now?

816
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,549
Yes, thank you so much.

817
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,393
It was very nice to see him

818
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,265
eat so well.

819
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,858
Okay, then.

820
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,443
We should go now.

821
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,777
Okay.

822
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,072
Wait.

823
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,281
You should wipe off your tears
before you leave.

824
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,276
Your makeup is all smudged.

825
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:53,714
It was very hard to leave behind
the person I love.

826
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,764
But thanks to you, I got to say
farewell to him for the last time.

827
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,419
Thank you.

828
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,553
Don't mention it. This is my job.

829
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:08,272
You told me you also had to leave behind
someone precious, right?

830
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,097
What?

831
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:12,064
You act all tough.

832
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,941
But I can tell by the look in your eyes
that you're lonely.

833
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,238
I hope you'll one day

834
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:25,526
be able to meet the man you loved.

835
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:04,661
Weol-ju.

836
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,994
Where are you, Weol-ju?

837
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,042
Is she not here yet?

838
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:43,900
Your Royal Highness.

839
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,872
Please forgive me for leaving you

840
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,366
without saying goodbye.

841
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,121
If fate really exists,

842
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,587
we will surely be able to meet again.

843
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,744
-<i>Samsin.</i>
-My gosh, you made me drop it!

844
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:15,536
Come on. Please.

845
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,830
What? A conception dream?

846
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,713
<i>My mom dreamt of a jade ring</i>
<i>before she had me.</i>

847
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:22,459
-Can I get a different one?
-You can't trade a conception dream.

848
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,753
Excuse me.

849
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:25,666
<i>No matter how hard I try,</i>
<i>I can't get pregnant.</i>

850
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,965
I don't see any babies
for this couple yet.

851
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:29,759
-Can't you just give them one?
-Hey!

852
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,222
-No!
-<i>I'm sorry.</i>

853
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,394
-Hey!
-<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

854
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:36,891
<i>Why are you trying so hard</i>
<i>to help this person?</i>

855
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:38,024
Tell me.

856
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,853
<i>I was once in love with a man.</i>
