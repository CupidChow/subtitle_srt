00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,557
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,269
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,693
Who

4
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,437
are you?

5
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,607
What are you talking about?

6
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,192
Who are you?

7
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,490
What do you mean?

8
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,485
What's gotten into you?

9
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:22,917
Weol-ju, are you all right?

10
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,514
Weol-ju...

11
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,576
What is it? You're scaring me.

12
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,251
Forget it. It's nothing.

13
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,707
That's just anticlimactic.

14
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,720
What about groceries?

15
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,470
Didn't you get any?

16
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,989
But we're out of cucumbers,
carrots, and everything.

17
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,908
I should go and get some.

18
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,579
I'll go get them.

19
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,363
I'm glad.

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,450
Then Ms. Weol-ju
won't be going to Hell, right?

21
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,122
You're the best, Guibanjang.
Thank you so much!

22
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,499
Didn't Weol-ju tell you though?

23
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:27,964
She went grocery shopping.

24
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,633
-She did but...
-But?

25
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,705
She left after seeing
Yeo-rin and me together.

26
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,550
She just left?

27
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,548
Just a second.

28
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,546
-Can we get some soju?
-Sure.

29
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,098
Udon for table two.

30
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,146
What's up with her?

31
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,321
How should I know?

32
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,331
Hurry up and serve the eggs.

33
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,579
-Sure, I'll...
-Let me...

34
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,620
I'll do it.

35
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,075
-No, let me.
-But it's my job.

36
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,797
EPISODE 11

37
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,883
-Guibanjang, here you go.
-Right. Thank you.

38
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,941
-Miss, are you not feeling well?
-I'm good.

39
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,435
-I see. Is something troubling you...
-No.

40
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,699
Then why are you in a sour mood
on this happy day?

41
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,782
-A happy day?
-Of course.

42
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,655
Guibanjang saved you
from the Hell of Extinction.

43
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,749
The camaraderie pumping through his veins,

44
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,330
his sense of responsibility,
and problem-solving skills.

45
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,134
Admirable, right?

46
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,505
Shouldn't he get
a delicious meal in return?

47
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,588
You're making it sound like a big deal.

48
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,425
Which it is.

49
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,430
Calling me admirable though?

50
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,601
You're most certainly right.

51
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,903
Don't you think it'd be great if we had
radish <i>naengmyeon</i>?

52
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,940
-I certainly do.
-That sounds delicious.

53
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,194
Kang-bae, did you make contact
with the customers today?

54
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,784
Well, I couldn't since there were
too many people here.

55
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,735
There's only four days left
until my deadline.

56
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,036
I need to settle
two more grudges during that time.

57
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,042
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,829
I should hand out
the rest of these coupons then.

59
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,504
Go back to your conversation.

60
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,087
Ms. Weol-ju. Guibanjang
did something wrong, didn't he?

61
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,922
What was it? Did he not recycle?

62
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,641
Wait, I bet he threw out
chicken bones with food waste.

63
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,099
I told him countless times...

64
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,849
-Shut it and get out.
-Sure.

65
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,807
Jeez, it's cold out there. Gosh.

66
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,778
Ms. Weol-ju sure is acting strange today.

67
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,155
Did you two fight or something?

68
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,874
As if I'd be a match for her.

69
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,917
Before you know it, I'll be...

70
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,053
flat out on the ground.

71
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,045
I agree.

72
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,549
She's been in a sour mood
ever since her trip to the market.

73
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,644
-Did something happen there?
-At the market?

74
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,309
I was saying the lines
that you taught me to Yeo-rin.

75
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,645
Maybe she found it too corny.

76
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,731
The lines?

77
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,204
"Was this just work for you?
It was love for me."

78
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,743
That was quite a line.

79
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,200
Yeo-rin seemed to like it.

80
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,414
Hold on a second.

81
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,002
You haven't told her, have you?

82
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,462
Did you tell her
that I taught you that line?

83
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,001
What? Of course I told her.

84
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,295
I clearly informed her

85
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,339
that it was you
who coached me those lines.

86
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,351
What's wrong?

87
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,197
Really...

88
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,951
How can he?

89
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,576
How dare

90
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,127
he come to me?

91
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,261
He has some nerve to think he could
stay by my side like this.

92
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,014
Shouldn't you be saying this to his face?

93
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,812
You're right.

94
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,596
But I couldn't find the words
when I saw his face.

95
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,607
I don't know what to be mad at first
or even what I should be telling him.

96
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,569
I have so much that I want to say

97
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,454
and my heart feels like
it's going to explode,

98
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,911
but the words won't come out.

99
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,496
Maybe it's because I Ioathed him too much.

100
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,513
Or it could be that
you missed him too much.

101
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,679
What?

102
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,930
It's nothing.

103
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,931
I'm just saying that love and hate
are like two sides of a coin.

104
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,475
Love and hate, my ass.

105
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:40,098
When it comes to him,
all I have is hatred and resentment.

106
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,443
Hold on. Have you always known?

107
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,239
Did you know who he was?

108
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,162
Of course not!

109
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,987
I had no idea.

110
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,998
Talk about a twisted fate.

111
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,964
Leaving the Living Realm
is the only way to end it.

112
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,263
What are you doing here?
Women's clothes are over there.

113
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,635
Are you showing off that you're dating?

114
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,603
I just wanted to return the favor
for the gift he bought me.

115
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,515
Did you find anything good?

116
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,857
Yes, can you help me decide?

117
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,071
Won't he look adorable in this?

118
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,487
But he'll look hot in this though.

119
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,453
How can I possibly choose
when he'll look good in both?

120
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,456
So? Do they look good on me?

121
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,328
Yes, you're so handsome.

122
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,923
I asked if the clothes looked good on me.

123
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,264
Yes, you look incredible.

124
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,553
We're here to grab lunch,
but it feels like a date. Right?

125
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,757
Yes.

126
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,097
My life has changed
ever since we started dating.

127
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,353
Going home and coming to work
seem different to me now.

128
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,524
I'm more excited to come to work
than to go home.

129
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,654
Really? When did this start to happen?

130
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,355
-This is bad.
-What?

131
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,453
Why is it bad?

132
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,951
Because the symptoms only get worse.

133
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,544
Soon, you won't be able to sleep

134
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,079
because you're too excited
about coming to work.

135
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,417
I know since I've already experienced it.

136
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,878
What?

137
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,216
We still have 20 minutes left.
Shall we walk some more?

138
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,469
Sounds good.

139
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,068
<i>No, don't you dare!</i>

140
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,370
What's wrong?

141
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,776
It's nothing.

142
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,721
<i>Get away from him!</i>

143
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,973
Yeo-rin, are you all right?

144
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,564
I'm sorry, but I need to head back first.

145
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:52,959
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

146
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,056
Damn it.

147
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,059
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

148
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,569
Where are you going?

149
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,775
The weather...

150
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,161
What?

151
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,943
So you know.

152
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,435
-Know what?
-That I know.

153
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,373
I'm sorry.

154
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,414
Was it fun for you?

155
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,290
I won't even dare make an excuse.

156
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,787
Is it why you came to me?

157
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,711
In my past life, I was naive enough
to believe that you'd protect me.

158
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,723
This time around, I begged you
to help me settle 100,000 grudges.

159
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,430
How foolish I must have looked.

160
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,719
You must think that I'm nothing
without you.

161
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,972
It's not like that.

162
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,388
I came to help you.

163
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,854
You weren't there for me
when it mattered, so why now?

164
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,848
Is messing with my life
some sort of game to you?

165
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,018
You have it all wrong.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner,

166
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,477
-but...
-Because of you

167
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,819
I died and ended up serving
a 500-year punishment.

168
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,239
Is that a joke to you?

169
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,622
What about the lives that were lost?

170
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,329
I saw you in your wedding attire.

171
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,410
-Was I mistaken?
-It's not what you think.

172
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,957
The story ends there for me.

173
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,500
My life ended that moment,
so what more is there?

174
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,803
Marrying someone else
as per your parents' wishes

175
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,968
was something I could accept.

176
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,010
I would have made peace with the fact

177
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,722
that our love was only a dream.

178
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,354
But why did you have
to make me such a promise

179
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,981
and then shatter my heart into pieces?

180
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,139
-Weol-ju...
-Why did you kill me?

181
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,194
What heinous crime did I commit?

182
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,061
What did my mother ever do wrong?

183
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,518
You...

184
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,195
You should have at least stopped that.
My mom shouldn't have died!

185
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,740
Why did you have to take
everything from me?

186
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,954
I had nothing to live for.

187
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,995
Actually, it wasn't just me.

188
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,871
My...

189
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,333
My...

190
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,934
That's it.

191
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,506
I couldn't save you then,

192
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,183
so I came to save you now.

193
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,600
You can beat me up for all I care.

194
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,604
Just let me be by your side

195
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,653
until you settle 100,000 grudges.

196
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,067
Even after 500 years, you haven't changed.

197
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,619
Those of noble blood

198
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,659
still believe that
the life and death of others

199
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,833
should be theirs to dictate.

200
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,038
Now that you've chosen to save mine,

201
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,998
should I get down on my knees
and express my gratitude?

202
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,752
Who are you to make such decisions?

203
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,205
Please, Weol-ju.

204
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,917
What you think you know
isn't the whole truth.

205
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,836
Trust me this once and...

206
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,930
Get out.

207
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,849
I don't ever want to see you again.

208
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,058
To me, you and the Queen
are one and the same.

209
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,867
Good luck with the night shift, everyone.
See you tomorrow.

210
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,173
Have a good day, sir.

211
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,539
CUSTOMER SERVICE

212
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,270
-Kang-bae, I need a favor.
-Sure thing.

213
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,439
My grandma isn't feeling good.

214
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,850
Could you take my night shift instead?

215
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,938
-Sure thing. You should head home.
-Thanks.

216
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,190
-I'll fill in for you later.
-See you tomorrow.

217
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,366
<i>No, don't you dare!</i>

218
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,585
<i>Get away from him!</i>

219
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,708
<i>What was that? What was that voice?</i>

220
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,764
<i>I'm pretty sure I heard it.</i>

221

MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

222
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,108
Hello.

223
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,704
What on earth are you doing here?

224
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,294
What brings you by?

225
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,911
I dropped by for a glass of soju.

226
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,617
Have a seat then.

227
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,916
Is this the CIA home base?

228
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,634
Are you working undercover?

229
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,134
Sure, why not.

230
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,520
Thank you.

231
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,840
I see you like to drink.

232
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,086
Just a little.

233
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,126
It's sweeter than usual.

234
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,215
Alcohol tends to taste sweeter
the bitter your life is.

235
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,677
Why would it be sweet for you
when you're in a new relationship?

236
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,517
Is Kang-bae causing you trouble?

237
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,058
Is he being clueless?

238
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,820
I'm the issue, not Kang-bae.

239
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,530
In what way?

240
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,570
You see, I was about
to lock arms with Kang-bae's earlier today

241
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,237
when I heard a voice.

242
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,541
"No, don't you dare."

243
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,079
I heard it clearly in my head.

244
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,329
It was eerie.

245
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,214
What kind of bullshit is that?

246
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:36,224
She suffered a lot
in her past life, you know.

247
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,601
I don't know what's going on either.

248
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,465
All I want is to be with Kang-bae.

249
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,483
But I guess I'm destined to die alone.

250
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,244
It's not exactly your fault.

251
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,610
Sorry?

252
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,616
How about another round?

253
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,948
What the fuck is this?

254
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,043
-Shit.
-Damn it.

255
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,213
-Hold on a second.
-You didn't have to kick it.

256
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,538
Stop it.

257
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,383
No wonder your wife
is sick and tired of you.

258
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,935
-Damn it.
-Do you have a death wish?

259
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,271
-Stop it.
-Go for another round.

260
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,476
-Just go home if you've had enough.
-Come on. Let's go.

261
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,356
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

262
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,794
Who on earth are you?

263
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,122
Where's the young lady that was here?

264
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,881
What? "Bullshit," you say?

265
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,801
Sorry?

266
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,756
You said what I said was bullshit.

267
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,558
So this is the liquor that opens
the door to the Dream World?

268
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,059
Well, since she drank some,
I took the liberty of occupying hers.

269
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,895
Are you the Cinnabar?

270
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,242
Yes, that's me. So what?

271
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,866
Being a spiritual object
doesn't give you the permission

272
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,620
to pop in and out of the Dream World.

273
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,872
This is my jurisdiction.

274
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,208
I see you like whelks.

275
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,877
They're so plump and juicy.

276
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,715
Anyway, why have you been
interfering with my...

277
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,179
I mean, Kang Yeo-rin's life.

278
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,219
What do you mean?

279
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,602
Why are you trying to pair her up
with that guy, Kang-bae?

280
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,517
I didn't make her do anything.

281
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,885
They're in love,

282
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,636
so I only gave them a nudge.

283
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,516
I can't believe you yelled at her
so she couldn't hold hands.

284
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,896
I just hate men, that's all.

285
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,654
I've been scaring away
the other guys that liked her,

286
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,407
but my tricks don't work on Kang-bae.

287
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,278
So I had no choice but to warn Yeo-rin.

288
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,410
As if holding hands
is something to warn her against.

289
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,420
Look here. I don't know
what grudges you have,

290
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,292
but just leave them be.

291
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,745
-No.
-Why not?

292
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,166
Because dating...

293
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,836
I mean,

294
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:22,967
I'm...

295
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,431
scared of men.

296
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,863
Here I come.

297
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,525
<i>I'd get stuffy
staying in the cave all day,</i>

298
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,286
<i>so I headed to town at night as a woman.</i>

299
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,115
<i>I played my role as a spiritual object
and secretly healed the sick</i>

300
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,077
<i>while also chasing away spirits.</i>

301
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,546
<i>But then I met a man</i>

302
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,005
<i>and fell in love at first sight.</i>

303
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,443
Here you go. I brought some more for you.

304
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,943
Due to the rock's immense powers,
these sell at a high price.

305
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,618
I will make sure the powers
are used to benefit the sick and the poor.

306
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,369
Being able to help you brings me joy.

307
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,251
Things were going great then.

308
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,955
There's more to the story.

309
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,166
As soon as I stopped seeing him,

310
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,427
he showed his true colors.

311
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,770
<i>No!</i>

312
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,816
How did you find this place?

313
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,488
Did you follow me here?

314
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,860
You wouldn't meet me,
so I came to you instead.

315
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,697
The fragments of the rock
you've been giving me

316
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,789
were nowhere enough for me.

317
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,081
I am Cinnabar itself.

318
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,705
If you shatter it into pieces,
I will no longer exist.

319
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,463
Is that so?

320
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,844
But I

321
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:27,965
couldn't care less.

322
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,346
What I need right now is money
to hire soldiers and buy weapons.

323
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,759
Soldiers and weapons?

324
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,307
Are you planning an uprising?

325
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,851
Didn't you say you were using the Cinnabar
to help the sick and the poor?

326
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,015
Peace for the people can only come
with the right king.

327
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,191
The current king
shows no promise for the future.

328
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,494
That is why a new king is the best way
to help the people.

329
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,616
No, this rock must not
be used in this way!

330
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,083
No!

331
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,455
My gosh.

332
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,415
So that's how you died.

333
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,508
Now you know why I hate men.

334
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,259
No wonder you're pissed.

335
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:15,138
Neither you nor me
have been lucky when it comes to men.

336
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,063
The fight over a throne.

337
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,391
Those who are mad for power are scarier
than evil spirits if you ask me.

338
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,058
-Did a man ruin your life too?
-Yes.

339
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,017
It was more than just ruined.

340
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,191
Because of one man,
I had to suffer for 500 years.

341
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,239
You can never be nice to those bastards.

342
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,782
They keep wanting more from you
and then stab you in the back.

343
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,367
But there's more.

344
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,952
There's this jerk

345
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,747
who came to watch me suffer
after betraying me.

346
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,081
What? That jerk did what?

347
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,587
It's pointless to talk about him.

348
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,714
By the way, why did you stop seeing him
when you enjoyed his company?

349
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,628
He followed you to the cave
because of that.

350
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,427
That.

351
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:58,097
Something was off about him,
so I had been keeping my distance.

352
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,602
Something was off?

353
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,805
I was walking
around the neighborhood at night.

354
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,858
<i>I saw him coming out of a house.</i>

355
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,032
<i>Gosh, he was cheating on you.</i>

356
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,574
<i>No, he was wearing a mask
and had his sword with him.</i>

357
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,422
What? He even robbed houses?

358
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,883
That shrine seemed pretty shabby.
There was nothing to steal.

359
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:32,264
Seeing how he killed the shaman
and set the house on fire,

360
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,299
he must have held a grudge.

361
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,599
-Did you say "shaman"?
-Yes.

362
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,598
She was a good shaman
who used to visit me from time to time.

363
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,192
The mother and the daughter
had such a tragic end.

364
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,981
Her only daughter hanged herself
not long after.

365
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,859
Is...

366
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,112
that guy's name

367
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,405
Kim Won-hyung?

368
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,995
Do you know him, too?

369
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,637
POLICE

370
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,932
What is this about?

371
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,352
-I...
-It's all right.

372
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,023
I'm a detective
at Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

373
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,187
Are you here to see Shin Ji-hye?

374
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,105
Yes. But did something happen?

375
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,490
I was right, Yeombujang.
Didn't I tell you before?

376
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:43,044
I told you this bastard was trying to get
in the way of solving cases.

377
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,789
Look. He's been murdering people

378
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,962
who need to settle grudges
or could help settling grudges.

379
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,962
He's been making his moves
while observing us.

380
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,634
Tell me who he is.

381
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,220
Please?

382
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,234
Or I'll ask the Death.

383
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,731
Sit down.

384
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,935
Why are you so impatient?

385
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,151
Of course, I'm impatient.

386
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,611
He could kill our next target
for all we know.

387
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,691
That won't happen.

388
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,026
I caught him myself
and handed him over to Hell yesterday.

389
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,492
Yesterday?

390
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,414
Really?

391
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,240
Yes. So you don't have to worry.

392
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,996
When you had to catch an evil spirit,
you always asked for my help.

393
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,424
You took care of him without my help?

394
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,424
Sir, what is this about?

395
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,585
Who on earth is that evil spirit?

396
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,836
It's Won-hyung.

397
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,637
Won-hyung?

398
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,018
Kim Won-hyung?

399
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,555
Yes, it's Won-hyung.

400
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:55,283
He escaped from hell because he wanted
to make you two suffer.

401
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:04,083
That's more the reason
you should have told me.

402
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,579
No matter how grave his crime is,
he is still my son.

403
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,495
How could I stand by and watch
as someone kills him?

404
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,079
And twice at that?

405
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,625
It's my karma to bear.
I had to end it myself.

406
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,723
I'm sorry.

407
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:25,811
I could have saved Her Majesty
if I caught him sooner.

408
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,687
This is a pity.

409
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,771
She was the only woman who could
show Weol-ju her past life.

410
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,775
Aren't you trying to clear up
the misunderstanding?

411
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,642
I wonder who's next.

412
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,567
Good going.

413
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,941
Where did you get so wasted last night?

414
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,610
At a pop-up bar.

415
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,069
But how did I get home?
I don't remember anything.

416
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,776
I'm sure your boyfriend
probably brought you home.

417
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,997
Now that you have a man to rely on,
you drank until you blacked out.

418
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,909
No. I went to the bar alone.

419
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,287
Why would you drink alone?

420
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,424
You were so happy to buy clothes for him.
Did you two already have a fight?

421
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,092
No. It's not that.

422
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,120
I have a trauma about being touched.

423
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,865
I think it's because of that trauma.

424
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,369
I'm still a bit scared and terrified
to be touched.

425
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,665
I see.

426
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,918
I'm taking a half day off,
so I can go see a doctor.

427
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,666
I might be able to get better
once I talk to someone.

428
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,875
Should I go with you?

429
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,006
No. I'd prefer to go alone.

430
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,427
Then, call me when you're done.
I'm getting off early today.

431
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,972
-Why?
-Just because.

432
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,519
So we can spend a bit more time together.

433
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,730
Okay.

434
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,694
Anyway, I hope you won't get
the wrong idea about yesterday.

435
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,569
My gosh, I would never.

436
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,033
Let's take things slow.

437
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:51,115
I can wait until you get better
and feel ready to move on.

438
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:56,155
I have waited 27 years to meet you.

439
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,333
Waiting a bit more
won't be a problem at all.

440
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,263
And when you go to the pop-up bar today,

441
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,180
can you thank Agent Weol-ju for me?

442
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,719
What? You know about the pop-up bar?

443
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,023
Actually, I stopped by
on my way home yesterday.

444
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,978
But I passed out while I was there.

445
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,148
I think Agent Weol-ju brought me home.

446
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:24,066
Then, did you drink
from a bottle shaped like this, too?

447
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:29,242
I see. That must be it. I knew it.
It did taste a bit too strong for me.

448
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,994
I passed out from a single shot.

449
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,575
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

450
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,882
I got into a fight

451
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,262
with an assassin
that came out of your house.

452
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,511
When I returned,

453
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,338
the house was on fire.

454
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,473
And your mother...

455
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,769
That's odd.

456
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,726
He definitely told me
he had to fight an assassin.

457
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,410
Seeing how he killed the shaman
and set the house on fire,

458
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,414
he must have held a grudge.

459
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,412
<i>Is it possible that Cinnabar was mistaken?</i>

460
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:24,044
<i>But he was plotting an uprising when
he was best friends with His Highness?</i>

461
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,799
What on earth happened?

462
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:07,173
SHIN JI-HYE
PAID BY KIM MI-SUK

463
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,360
I found out when I went to see Ms. Shin.

464
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,151
I can't believe this.

465
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,609
I don't know what to say.

466
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,372
Okay.

467
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,329
Thank you

468
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,785
for coming to see her.

469
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,540
I...

470
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,289
wanted to ask you something.

471
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,301
I was in Yeo-rin's Dream World.

472
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,387
And I met Cinnabar.
And what she told me didn't add up.

473
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,390
What do you mean?

474
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,269
Is it true

475
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,891
that Kim Won-hyung

476
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,272
plotted an uprising and killed my mother?

477
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,492
I'm sorry. I found out too late.

478
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:04,868
I see.

479
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,583
But why...

480
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,170
After losing you like that,

481
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,919
when I looked into it,

482
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,424
he was even planning to marry off
his younger sister to me

483
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,876
to become a royal family member.

484
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,886
I must have been a thorn in his side.

485
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,770
And he only became more rash

486
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,641
because I had been hurrying to marry you.

487
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,658
<i>The day Kim Won-hyung raided your house</i>

488
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,534
<i>was the day I was going to propose to you.</i>

489
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,878
I was going to do the same thing to him.

490
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,503
In his happiest moment,
I wanted him to lose the most precious...

491
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,458
No.

492
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,175
I wanted him to know how painful it was
to lose everything.

493
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,890
I wanted him to feel
exactly what I had felt.

494
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:24,367
The Crown Princess will come out
and stand on the south-west corner.

495
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,120
-Stop.
-Your Highness.

496
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,542
I ordered you to stop.

497
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,304
Bring me the man responsible
for the uprising now!

498
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,589
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

499
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,841
What are you doing?

500
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,562
Do you not know who I am?

501
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,599
I am the older brother
of the Crown Princess. Get off me!

502
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,740
Your Highness, "uprising"?

503
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,160
That's impossible.
Don't you know how loyal I am to you?

504
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,913
I'm your oldest friend, Won-hyung.

505
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,408
You have disrespected me.

506
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,456
I only did what was the best
for our kingdom.

507
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,290
Are you condemning my effort
to attain prosperity and military power?

508
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,087
You bought off my loyal subjects

509
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,460
and bought weapons to grow an army.
Is that loyalty?

510
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,298
You sold off your father and sister
to become a royal family.

511
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,301
On top of that, you killed
an innocent mother and daughter.

512
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,305
How is that an action of a loyal man?

513
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,306
Was I supposed to just watch?

514
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:34,228
You were head over heels day and night
for that daughter of a lowly shaman.

515
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,112
How could you expect me
to do nothing about it?

516
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,818
Shut your mouth!

517
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,565
You have committed treason

518
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,395
and murder.

519
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,567
You should thank me.

520
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,906
I eliminated Weol-ju

521
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,746
out of my loyalty to set
a strong foundation for the kingdom.

522
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,602
<i>I...</i>

523
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,693
<i>I have failed to protect you.</i>

524
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,335
<i>If there's a next life,</i>

525
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,257
<i>I will find you no matter what.</i>

526
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,006
<i>When I do,</i>

527
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,595
<i>even if I have to sacrifice my soul,
I will protect you.</i>

528
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,862
Why didn't you tell me?

529
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,490
I had no idea.

530
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,575
For 500 years,

531
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,959
I resented and hated you.

532
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,920
Your 500-year resentment

533
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,673
wouldn't have been settled
with a few words.

534
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,259
You would probably have thought
I was lying to you.

535
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,564
And you wouldn't have let me
stay next to you.

536
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,268
Even so.

537
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,345
If I couldn't stay by your side

538
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,359
or protect you,

539
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,689
the truth wouldn't matter at all.

540
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,653
I wanted to show you
with my actions this time around.

541
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,704
Not as the weak prince
who made empty promises,

542
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,779
but as the Guibanjang who protected you.

543
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,950
I know it's late,

544
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,630
but I really wanted

545
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,337
to make good on my promise.

546
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,807
I'm sorry it took so long.

547
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,190
Two bags of seaweed.

548
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,117
Thank you.

549
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:42,914
My gosh!

550
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,412
Sir.

551
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,415
You have a lot of stuff here.

552
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,462
We have a lot of returns today.

553
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,251
What brings you here?

554
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,129
Are you

555
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,219
taking someone from here today?

556
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,932
It's not that.

557
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,809
I went to the pop-up bar,
but it was locked.

558
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,680
Did Weol-ju go somewhere?

559
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,269
I can't reach her today, either.

560
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,439
Sir, do you know

561
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,441
-what the story is with Yeo-rin?
-What?

562
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:14,113
I'm certain she was
in Yeo-rin's Dream World yesterday.

563
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,450
But I have no idea what's going on.

564
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,953
Well, she didn't tell me anything.

565
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,794
By the way, who's Yeo-rin?

566
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,293
She's my girlfriend.

567
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,423
You also saw her in the warehouse before.
She's the security guard.

568
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,670
I see. Okay.

569
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,878
Multipurpose knife.

570
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,850
Yeo-rin.

571
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,649
You took a half day off, right?
You can get off work now.

572
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,357
Okay. I'll get going, then.
Have a good day.

573
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,815
Good work.

574
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,893
Yeombujang?

575
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,235
Yeombujang.

576
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:42,948
What brings you here?

577
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,660
I need to take away the deceased
around here later today.

578
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,116
I was just killing time. What about you?

579
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,671
I see. I came here to meet with
Ms. Kang Yeo-rin here. She works here.

580
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,843
I think I just saw her here.
She was here, right?

581
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,006
Yes. She just left that way.

582
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,591
You know her?

583
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,050
Wait.

584
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:08,925
Yes, Weol-ju.

585
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,436
Okay. She just left.

586
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,899
Okay.

587
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,942
So you made up with Weol-ju?

588
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,652
Yes. We did.

589
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,236
There's only one more
after we settle Yeorin's.

590
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,490
We should focus.

591
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:27,446
<i>I see. One case.
They'll only have one case left to go.</i>

592
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,696
If you need to kill time, why don't you
come with me to shop?

593
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,578
I have a lot to tell you today.

594
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,542
Let's go.

595
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,271
-Yeo-rin.
-Agent Weol-ju.

596
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,596
Where are you headed?
I'll give you a ride.

597
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,059
You see the coffee there? Drink it.

598
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,362
Thank you. You're giving me coffee, too.

599
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,284
Can you make a right turn over there?

600
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,374
What? Shouldn't I go straight
to get to your house?

601
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,491
Well, actually,
I'm on my way to see a doctor.

602
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,909
Aren't you going to drink it?
It's expensive. Drink it up.

603
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,627
Thank you for the coffee.

604
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,918
This is a unique flavor.

605
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,677
Why do I feel so sleepy all of a sudden?

606
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:36,516
Yes. Take a long nap.
By the time you wake up,

607
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,442
everything will be all right.

608
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,403
-Hey!
-What?

609
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,033
What did you put in this coffee?
Did you spike it with <i>ssanggapju</i>?

610
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,029
My gosh, I'm already in her Dream World.

611
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:51,485
She knows right away
because she's a spiritual object.

612
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,447
Why are you here again?

613
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,869
Why do you think?
I came here to pay you back.

614
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,964
Pay me back?

615
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:03,594
Thanks to you, I resolved
a misunderstanding of 500 years.

616
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,762
So I ought to help you with your pain.

617
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:10,602
My gosh.
A shot of liquor won't ease the pain.

618
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,009
You saw him, didn't he?

619
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,219
You don't

620
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,234
have any friends, right?

621
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,479
Friends?

622
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,364
Friends.

623
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,729
I knew it.

624
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,993
When you're pissed off at a man,

625
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,698
you're supposed to let it out
with your girlfriends.

626
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,949
If you don't do that,
it could last 500 years.

627
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,992
Just trust me and come with me.

628
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,905
I prepared three ways
to get over your heartache.

629
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,377
-Hey, Samsin.
-Hey.

630
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,103
Everyone, make some noise!

631
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,236
<i>Let's say nothing happened to me</i>

632
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:10,449
<i>We were never together</i>

633
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:16,370
<i>Can you just let me go?</i>

634
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,918
<i>You must forget about me now</i>

635
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,085
<i>I know it will be hard</i>

636
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:29,798
<i>I know that you're still waiting for me
And that breaks my heart</i>

637
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,086
It breaks my heart!

638
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,927
<i>If you can, you should just hate me</i>

639
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,765
-Hate me!
-Hate me!

640
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,860
<i>Don't cling onto me now</i>

641
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:51,149
<i>You should never look for me</i>

642
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,786
<i>Because I will only end up hurting you</i>

643
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,084
Let's go!

644
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,712
<i>-Don't call</i>
-Don't!

645
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,079
<i>-Me cruel</i>
-Me!

646
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,748
<i>Don't call me such names</i>

647
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:12,511
<i>I decided to end it for your sake
For the time being</i>

648
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,893
<i>-Don't forget</i>
-Don't!

649
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,720
-<i>My love for you
-</i>You!

650
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:20,635
<i>You're in my heart</i>

651
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,146
<i>It won't take long</i>

652
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:26,108
<i>For my sadness to fade away</i>

653
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,442
<i>Forever</i>

654
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,106
Everybody, jump!

655
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,207
Now, scream!

656
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,633
-Yes!
-Yes!

657
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:51,511
I feel so much better.

658
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:56,551
See? "Tears" is the best song to listen to
when you're going through a heartache.

659
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,756
It works best.

660
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,136
It's strong enough to get rid of
a 500-year-old resentment.

661
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,563
Thank goodness I picked Chan-whee
before she was born.

662
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:09,573
Do you know what her conception dream was?
It was a tiger chewing on a microphone.

663
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,859
-My goodness.
-My gosh, really?

664
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:17,367
But wait. You told me you prepared
three things to get over my heartache.

665
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,949
It's all here.

666
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,544
We sang, I prepared sweets,

667
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,209
and you also have your friends.

668
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:24,955
There you go.

669
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,086
You're right.

670
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:30,918
It's all here.

671
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,304
It would have been nice
if you had a friend to talk to

672
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,928
and to console you back then.

673
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:42,854
It's always hard to endure your hardships
when you're alone.

674
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:47,272
From now on,
forget about that piece of trash.

675
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,074
Don't waste your reincarnated life
on a guy like him.

676
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,856
From this moment on,

677
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:58,573
just live a happy life,
and feel free to love someone.

678
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,285
And if you break up?

679
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,787
Then you can come back
and have fun with us again.

680
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,880
Really? Are you really
going to spend time with me again?

681
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,880
Of course.

682
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,838
But don't break up on purpose.

683
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:15,723
Kang-bae

684
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,885
is a really great guy.

685
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,689
Hey, Yeo-rin. Gosh, I'm sorry I'm late.

686
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,571
Did you go to the hospital?

687
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,318
No, I couldn't.

688
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,663
I ran into Weol-ju,
and she offered me a ride.

689
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,368
But I fell asleep in her car.

690
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,240
And I missed my doctor's appointment.

691
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,447
You fell asleep in her car?

692
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,617
Hey.

693
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,417
Let me fix your buttons.

694
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,298
Sorry. I mean, thank you.

695
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,892
Hey, come to think of it, it's weird.

696
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,353
-What?
-I don't hear anything.

697
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,814
I wonder if it's because
I've had a good sleep.

698
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,064
What do you mean?

699
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,897
Let me link arms with you.

700
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,232
What?

701
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,940
What? Hey!

702
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,488
I'm okay. I'm fine.

703
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,066
You're okay?

704
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,947
Give me your hand. Hurry.

705
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,788
My gosh, I'm holding your hand!

706
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,752
Yes, you are.

707
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,081
Wait a second.

708
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,326
Get up.

709
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,513
You need to hug me back.

710
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,723
Really? Should I really hug you?

711
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:45,564
Not if you don't want to.

712
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,892
Why wouldn't I want to?

713
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,271
You can stop now.

714
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,321
Says who?

715
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,704
What?

716
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,750
Samsin was there, too?

717
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:12,961
Yes.

718
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:17,379
<i>Don't call me cruel</i>

719
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:20,672
<i>Don't call me such names</i>

720
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:25,680
You guys must've had a blast.
I'm so glad I wasn't there.

721
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,851
So what happened?
Did you settle the Cinnabar's grudge?

722
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,638
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

723
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,977
-Hey!
-Hey!

724
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:36,694
We did it!

725
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,733
Wow.

726
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,856
I guess they got pretty close
as soon as they met up.

727
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,491
I'm glad she finally got to settle
her grudge of 500 years.

728
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,738
Great job, Weol-ju.

729
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,830
You know what? Let's go.

730
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,001
Go where.

731
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,750
Like you said, I did a great job.

732
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,332
I'm also very proud of myself.

733
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,555
Did I do something wrong?

734
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:15,556
No, just think of it as my way
of encouraging my employee.

735
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,517
I'm the CEO.

736
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,567
We only have one more left,

737
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,030
so you want me to eat this
and get it over with?

738
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,781
Yes, there's just one more left.

739
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,450
If we fail, all our hard work
will end up going down the drain.

740
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,083
So let's do a good job.

741
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:34,793
Okay, Ms. CEO.
I'll eat this meat and do my job.

742
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,293
Gosh.

743
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,012
My goodness, that baby is adorable.

744
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,845
Babies are adorable aren't they?

745
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,139
How can they not be?

746
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,820
Do you think

747
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,404
you would have been a good dad
if you had a child?

748
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,155
Of course. There's no question about that.

749
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,124
-You see...
-But not you.

750
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,627
What? Me? Why?

751
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,709
It's obvious, isn't it?

752
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,665
"Wake up early. Study hard.

753
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,085
Stop playing games.
Why are your clothes so dirty?"

754
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,384
You'll nag at your kid so much.

755
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,638
I get dizzy just by thinking about it.

756
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:33,219
That's not true.
I can also be a good parent.

757
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,636
Sure. Whatever.
You can be one in your next life.

758
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:45,318
Didn't you want to be reincarnated?

759
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,912
You could have gotten married
and had kids.

760
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,124
You're right.

761
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,947
I should have ditched you
and gotten married.

762
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:01,424
I should just focus on protecting the lady
who's in front of me.

763
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,745
Why worry about a baby
that we don't even have.

764
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,761
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

765
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,228
So that's why Yeo-rin's better now.

766
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,654
-Miss, thank you...
-Gosh.

767
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,900
-What's wrong?
-That hurts.

768
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,022
My goodness.

769
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,525
Let me see.

770
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,906
You'll need a Band-aid for this.

771
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,491
-Hold on.
-It's okay.

772
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,446
Let me see.

773
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,792
It's just a small cut.

774
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,919
I'm okay.

775
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:58,179
What's going on?
I'm just imagining things, right?

776
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:02,305
What? He was just looking after me
because I cut my finger.

777
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,475
Hey, stop.

778
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,315
This right here.

779
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:10,695
Yes, this is what I'm talking about.
This is Guibanjang's necklace.

780
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:14,488
Why are you wearing this?
It's what he used to wear as a necklace.

781
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,830
Gosh, I just took it from him
because it looked pretty.

782
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:19,542
Just get back to work.

783
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,502
Yes, we only have one more to go.
Let's do our best!

784
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,132
-<i>Let's do our best
</i>-Best!

785
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,589
-<i>Let's do our best
</i>-Best!

786
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,378
No, I don't buy that. Something's up.

787
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,342
I sensed something was weird
the moment I came in here today.

788
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:33,887
You know what?

789
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,304
I can't work like this.

790
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:39,966
Do you want me to leave again,
or will you just tell me?

791
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,308
The choice is yours. Go ahead and choose.

792
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,279
You used to date in your past life?

793
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:56,953
Hey.

794
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,659
Then what about,

795
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:02,245
"Was this just work for you?
It was love for me." Was that also...

796
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,173
Gosh, that's so creepy.

797
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,552
You actually said that to her?

798
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,681
My goodness, it was 500 years ago.

799
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,719
No, I can't believe this.
I don't care if it was 500 years ago.

800
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,854
I can't believe
the two of you were a couple.

801
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,062
I can't seem to accept this.

802
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:28,227
I guess this is why people say
office romance is bad for the coworkers.

803
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,776
I'll go hand out some coupons.
I don't think I can stay here.

804
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,324
- Gosh.
- Are you leaving for work?

805
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,736
-Yes.
-Good luck.

806
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:39,913
What?

807
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,743
Wait for me, Kang-bae.

808
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,578
-Enjoy your food.
-Okay.

809
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,871
Kang-bae.

810
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,039
They're all so busy.

811
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,958
Do you want a bowl of udon?

812
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,304
Sure.

813
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,637
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

814
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,767
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

815
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,522
Seriously? My gosh.

816
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:11,231
What's wrong?

817
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,189
Are you that shocked?

818
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,816
I mean, I can't stop imagining things.

819
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,486
My gosh. I'm sorry.

820
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,791
It was when we were young.
It's all in the past now.

821
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,251
We were able to meet again
because of that.

822
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,922
And back then, Weol-ju didn't have
such a horrible temper.

823
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,712
With the temper she has now...

824
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,505
Gosh, I can't date her.

825
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,844
But aren't you here to protect her?

826
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,301
You tried so hard.

827
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,467
Could you tell?

828
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,692
What can she do without me?

829
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,943
She needs someone to take care of her.

830
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:55,859
But she also has
a great sense of responsibility.

831
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:58,113
"A great sense of responsibility"?
What do you mean?

832
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,696
Is she responsible for anything else
other than the 100,000 lives?

833
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,159
Me.

834
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,171
She signed the agreement to go to hell
so she felt responsible for me.

835
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,212
Right.

836
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,880
Weol-ju tends to be very loyal.

837
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,342
We need to succeed no matter what.

838
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,891
Okay, we have two days.
We have two days to get one more job done.

839
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,389
Do you think we can do it?

840
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,599
It should be.

841
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,944
I wonder what's going on.
Yeomradaewang is calling me.

842
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:34,821
Yes, ma'am.

843
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,989
Right now? No. Okay.

844
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,492
I need to go up there for a moment.

845
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,957
I heard you made up with Guibanjang

846
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,001
and also heard about me.

847
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,093
Yes.

848
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:03,007
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

849
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:06,764
But I heard you caught Kim Won-hyung.

850
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,104
I heard you helped me
because you felt responsible

851
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:11,984
for what happened in our past lives.

852
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:15,733
A parent always feels responsible
for their child's wrongdoings.

853
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,355
I know, right?
It's so funny that parents feel that way.

854
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,236
I understand

855
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:24,950
how you must have felt.

856
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,291
To be honest,

857
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,617
I'm also doing this for my child.

858
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,964
Hello. Come visit the bar some time.

859
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,423
Thank you.

860
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,630
Hello. Come visit the bar some time.

861
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,251
You guys should come to our bar.

862
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,257
Thank you.

863
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,723
I'm out of coupons.

864
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,555
Gosh, how am I going to face
Ms. Weol-ju again?

865
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,563
I didn't know that.

866
01:02:56,981 --> 01:03:00,741
I can't believe the Sacred Tree's soul
ended up entering your child.

867
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:03,650
Exactly.

868
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,526
Because of that,
my child keeps suffering endlessly

869
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,906
every time it is reincarnated.

870
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:15,415
I feel bad for both you and your child.

871
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,796
By any chance,
did you also volunteer to work as Death

872
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,549
in order to pay for your son's sins?

873
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,468
What if I did?

874
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,259
I'm just wondering if your son
is worth the sacrifice.

875
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,054
He killed people, committed conspiracy,

876
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,887
escaped from hell,
and became an evil spirit.

877
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,676
Even 5,000 years won't be enough
for him to pay for his sins.

878
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,522
What can I do?

879
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,364
That's just something I have to live.

880
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,484
I can't believe a great man like you

881
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,203
ended up with such a bastard of a child.

882
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,158
A "bastard"?

883
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:48,486
A "bastard" you say?

884
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,374
I'm just saying that
because I feel so bad for you.

885
01:03:51,452 --> 01:03:54,082
Does Won-hyung really deserve
to be called that?

886
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,543
Of course.

887
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,628
If you think about it,

888
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,338
all this happened because of him.

889
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,961
Me, Guibanjang, my mom, and even you.

890
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,467
He ruined all our lives.

891
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,549
That's your fault, not mine.

892
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,560
-What?
-You're the one who committed suicide.

893
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,308
Who

894
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,646
are you?

895
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,152
I guess you finally recognize me.

896
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:25,322
Long time no see, Weol-ju.

897
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,614
I was also wrongfully murdered
by the Crown Prince.

898
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,828
My life was also ruined because of you.

899
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,288
If it weren't for you...

900
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,698
If you hadn't gotten involved,

901
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:35,706
I would have been able to have everything.

902
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,828
I would have had
the entire world at my feet!

903
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,165
Ms. Weol-ju, I need more coupons.

904
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:42,842
Ms. Weol-ju.

905
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,260
Hey, let go of her.
What's the matter with you?

906
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:55,017
Let her go!

907
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,557
Ms. Weol-ju.

908
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,318
Let her go! You'll kill her!

909
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,373
Let her go.

910
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:21,878
I said let her go!

911
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,883
GUEST APPEARANCE BY SO CHAN-WHEE

912
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,164
