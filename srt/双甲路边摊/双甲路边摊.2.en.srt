ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,

00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,139
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,942
This is only our third date.

4
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,938
Don't you think we're moving too fast?

5
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,579
Do you still want me to wait
when I've already held back twice?

6
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,953
How can I when I have such

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,330
a beautiful girlfriend?

8
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:23,285
Your girlfriend?

9
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,835
Does that mean
this is our first day as a couple?

10
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,516
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

11
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,315
He sure is enjoying himself.

12
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,409
Poor thing...

13
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,246
Wake him up already.
It's time to sign the contract.

14
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,328
Isn't that a bit too mean?
He's just getting started.

15
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,588
I'm sorry, Special Case.

16
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,890
I don't want to do this, but...

17
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,559
Hey, wake up!

18
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,765
Where is she?

19
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,555
Where did she go?

20
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,898
How was the dream I designed for you?

21
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,232
Didn't it make up
for all those missed chances?

22
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,567
What?

23
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,163
Have I been cured then?

24
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,488
Not exactly.

25
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,834
That was just a sneak peek.

26
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,038
Sign the contract and work for a month,

27
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,369
then I'll grant your wish.

28
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,914
Work for you for a month?

29
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,417
What's with that sigh?

30
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,795
You only have to touch nine people.

31
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,129
No? Forget it then.

32
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,923
That's not it.
Let me at least read it first.

33
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,934
I don't know
if I should be doing this though.

34
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,388
Some people may want
to keep their worries hidden,

35
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,226
so who am I to make them talk?

36
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,233
Come on, now.

37
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,074
What's the problem
when I'll be solving their issues

38
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,940
right away?

39
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,647
We're doing them a favor. Don't you agree?

40
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,027
I'm right, aren't I?

41
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,533
Yes, of course. You're absolutely right.

00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,162
ARTICLE 4: DURATION, ARTICLE 5: OBLIGATION

43
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,115
ARTICLE 6

44
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,627
"Your spiritual vision may be enhanced
during work

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,550
and the effects may be permanent."

46
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,666
-What does this mean?
-Well...

47
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,175
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

48
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,393
It doesn't seem like "nothing."

49
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,897
Your ability doesn't work on us.

50
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,686
Let me be brutally honest with you.

51
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,936
A spiritual vision

52
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,356
is like a passage that connects
the Living Realm with the Afterlife.

53
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,451
You're a special case
whose spiritual vision is still intact.

54
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,288
Working with us

55
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,539
might cause your spiritual vision
to expand.

56
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,081
Even though we enter dreams,

57
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,495
we still travel back and forth
on the road that leads to the Afterlife.

58
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,995
What will happen to me then?

59
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,467
Well, it could cause people

60
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,878
to spill their guts out

61
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,258
from just brushing against you
or just looking at you.

62
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,810
What?

63
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,097
Just by looking at me?

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,600
That'll never happen, so don't worry.

65
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,647
Bring me nine people within one month

66
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,270
and I'll fix this condition for you.

67
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,487
Must I tell you again
that it's my specialty?

68
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,359
What if I can't do it in one month?
Won't you help me then?

69
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,527
It's not that she won't,
she can't help you.

70
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,866
This hag will be dragged away
if she doesn't meet quotas.

71
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,911
You'll be dragged away?

72
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:52,043
It's the same story for any employee.

73
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,707
Even in our world,
if you can't meet your quota,

74
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,091
you're forcibly transferred.

75
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,132
Then what about me?

76
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,755
You'll be stuck like that forever.

77
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,972
Forever in a worsened state?

78
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,427
What the hell?

79
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,392
I'm sorry, but I can't agree to this.

80
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,185
I wouldn't have come
if I knew there was a catch.

81
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,647
I'm telling you not to worry.

82
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,243
I solved the issues of
99,991 people until now.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,490
Nine more is a piece of cake.

84
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,116
But you're trying to hire me
because you can't do it.

85
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,617
Anyway, I'm out.

86
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,125
Hey.

87
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,585
You.

88
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,087
Me?

89
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,641
Yes, you.

90
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,434
I'm going to kill you tonight

91
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,480
and walk into hell myself.

92
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,267
-Don't come any closer.
-Let go of this.

93
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,607
-Get away!
-You're dead.

94
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,992
-Wait.
-Get back here!

95
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,486
Goodness.

96
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,368
Just by looking at me?

97
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,164
I can't let that happen.

98
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,504
It's too much of a gamble.

99
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,629
-<i>Kang-bae, are you in there?</i>
-Ms. Andong?

100
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,296
-Ma'am, come on in.
-<i>Right.</i>

101
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,967
-Goodness.
-Good evening.

102
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,063
I thought you'd be a little peckish,
so I brought you these.

103
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,847
They look delicious.

104
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,643
Thank you for always looking out for me.

105
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,477
It's my pleasure to help out
a hard-working young man.

106
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,226
Thank you for the food.

107
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,323
Eun-su's wedding is on May 9, right?

108
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,533
Isn't that on her birthday?

109
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,447
That's right.

110
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,327
She's getting married on her birthday.

111
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,576
Are you going to come to the wedding
instead of seeing your girlfriend?

112
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,537
How can I miss Eun-su's wedding?

113
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,955
Besides, I don't have

114
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,458
a girlfriend.

115
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,646
But Weol-ju...

116
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,725
What?

117
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:23,232
Is there even a way to cure Special Case?

118
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,242
All I have to do is
take him to the Dream World

119
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
and shut down his spiritual vision.

120
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,486
That's simple enough.

121
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,830
All he needs to do is sign the deal,

122
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,291
but how do I get him to do so?

123
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,707
Don't I know it.

124
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,092
Right?

125
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,797
-It's good.
-It's a proper meal...

126
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,630
Ms. Weol-ju?

127
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,853
You guys must have had
a tough day at work.

128
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,232
Please dig in.

129
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,021
Who is she?

130
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,483
She's someone I know.

131
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,823
May I ask how you know
our employee Mr. Han?

132
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,653
Me?

133
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,074
I run a small business in the neighborhood

134
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,985
and I'm here to offer Mr. Han a job.

135
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,084
A job?

136
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,078
We're not in the same business,
so don't worry.

137
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,582
We'll have him work briefly
at night with me,

138
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,634
so he can work both jobs.

139
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,668
At night?

140
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,211
What kind of business
are you talking about?

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,800
Well...

142
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,638
I...

143
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,519
will wait for you in the car, ma'am.

144
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:40,979
Hey.

145
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:46,856
I can't go into any details,

146
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,703
but I offer comfort to customers
by serving them alcohol.

147
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,445
So a bar

148
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,282
-that only opens at night?
-It's obvious.

149
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,619
Mr. Han is just the talent
that I've been looking for,

150
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,713
so I have taken the liberty of
offering him the job in person.

151
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,787
Talent? Kang-bae?

152
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,246
What kind of a talent?

153
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,208
It's not about what he's good at.

154
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,586
Let's just say that
he has the perfect physical trait.

155
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,720
He wins over my customers
like nobody's business.

156
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,723
-The perfect physical trait?
-No way.

157
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,428
Could we talk in private?

158
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,653
Enjoy your lunch then, everyone.

159
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,978
-Have a good day too.
-Come on!

160
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,065
I already said no.
You can't come in here like this.

161
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,363
It's a crime to let talent go to waste.

162
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:37,237
True happiness finds you
when you do something you're good at.

163
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,950
And this can help you.

164
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,286
You'll be happy, I'll be happy,
everyone will be happy.

165
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,674
No matter how hard it is for me,
I'm going to live my life as it is.

166
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,343
I've been coping
without my limbs just fine.

167
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,590
I don't want to gamble and go blind.

168
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,295
You should leave.

169
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,099
If I were going to cave in easily,
I wouldn't have come.

170
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,192
Here we go.
The surprise discount starts now.

171
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,574
Marinated pork!

172
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,450
Sold to just five people for only 990 won.

173
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,699
Hurry up, everyone.
Run, ladies. Yes, run for it.

174
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,617
Five, four, three, two, one.

175
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,542
Let the discount begin!

176
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,753
What the hell are you doing?

177
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,214
This.

178
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,258
-A discount?
-What?

179
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,394
Young man, hear me out.

180
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,845
I think my husband is cheating on me.

181
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:45,765
Move!

182
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,363
I think my kid is going
to flunk the entrance exam again.

183
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,939
My mother-in-law is driving me nuts.

184
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,318
-Young man!
-Hear me out too.

185
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,492
Over here.

186
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,992
-Hear me out.
-Me too.

187
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,783
My husband...

188
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,236
-I'm sorry.
-Young man!

189
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,168
-At least hear me out.
-Let us talk.

190
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,593
-Don't go.
-Stop running.

191
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,250
-Come on.
-Where are you going?

192
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,106
Should I tell them where you are?

193
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,266
You're unbelievable.

194
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,651
The ladies are coming.

195
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,449
Where did he go?

196
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,359
I wasn't done talking.

197
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,117
I need 15 more days

198
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,199
to tell him about my evil mother-in-law.

199
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,664
I have a lot to tell him too.

200
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,416
-Ladies!
-Okay, fine. I'll do it.

201
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,036
I'll do it.

202
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,637
I'm glad you changed your mind.
You can't live like this.

203
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,183
Do you need a pen?

204
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:04,934
Okay, fine.

205
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,725
How about a test run first?

206
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,941
-What?
-We'll try it with one person

207
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,441
and think of it as an internship.

208
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,278
Then I'll be able to know

209
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,318
if I'm cut out to meet your quota.

210
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,820
We'll finalize the deal afterwards.
What do you say?

211
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,116
Jeez.

212
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,789
Your cautiousness will be your downfall,

213
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,119
but fine.

214
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,171
Be at the bar later then.

215
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,172
Why on earth would you buy me
something so expensive?

216
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,256
You know I can't even wear makeup.

217
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,342
These are organic products
that are mild enough

218
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,558
for people who are allergic to cosmetics.

219
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,679
You need a pop of color
since it's my wedding day.

220
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,557
It doesn't make a difference
if they're organic or not.

221
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,363
Use these yourself

222
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,820
and explain my condition
to your future in-laws

223
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,781
so that they don't get the wrong idea.

224
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,113
I won't be wearing any makeup

225
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,987
because I'm allergic to cosmetics.

226
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,584
My gosh.

227
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,657
All right, fine.

228
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,325
Jeez, I'm famished.

229
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,748
Mom, this place serves grilled mackerel.

230
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,256
It smells incredible.
Let's eat here, okay?

231
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,879
Come on, let's eat. It smells delicious.

232
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,137
TODAY'S MENU: GRILLED MACKEREL

233
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,469
It's the oil that
makes a grilled mackerel perfect.

234
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,851
The taste of grilled fish
and the crunchy skin.

235
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,443
Mom, here you go. All right.

236
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,228
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

237
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,855
Moist and strongly seasoned.

238
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,440
It really is delicious.

239
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,409
Kang-bae, why haven't you told us that
you work at a bar with delicious food?

240
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,365
It's my first day today.
It could just be a temporary job.

241
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,366
Then we should come by often.

242
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,787
It's even better than grilled beef.

243
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:00,006
I've always been known
for my grilled mackerel.

244
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,586
It's not as good as
what my mom makes though.

245
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,138
Eun-su, don't be rude.

246
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,720
You have way more experience
cooking mackerels.

247
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:13,523
She raised me by herself
while running a grilled fish restaurant.

248
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,403
Isn't she incredible?

249
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,518
Don't praise me
for something everyone does.

250
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,192
She's right, you know.
It truly is admirable.

251
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,277
Right?

252
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,580
Hi, honey.

253
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,288
That was today, wasn't it?

254
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,745
Gosh, I totally forgot.
I'm with my mom right now.

255
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,879
Sorry. I'll be right there.

256
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,840
Mom, I'm sorry.

257
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,682
I forgot that I had dinner plans
with his friends.

258
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,178
How could you let that skip your mind?
You should get going.

259
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,812
Make sure you stay and finish this, okay?

260
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,604
Kang-bae, look after my mom for me.

261
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,734
Sure thing. Don't worry. See you around.

262
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,106
Your daughter seems like the sweetest.

263
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,978
There's no doubt
you did a good job raising her.

264
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,738
You're wrong.

265
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,279
I have never been a good mother.

266
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,498
Can I have some water?

267
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,250
Water?

268
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,927
Here you go.

269
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,637
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

270
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,033
This is a plate for the bones.

271
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,162
Who told you to serve water
and give out empty plates?

272
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,331
You're supposed to touch
the person I choose

273
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,834
and make them tell their story.

274
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,916
What?

275
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,498
Ms. Andong?

276
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,875
Of course.
Do we have another customer here?

277
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,216
Now go over to her. Come on!

278
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,341
Get going.

279
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,182
So how much is everything?

280
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,483
I'd better get going.

281
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,360
Ms. Andong, please stay a little longer.

282
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,235
Sure.

283
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,240
Why not?

284
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,037
I have wronged my dear Eun-su.

285
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,791
You wronged her?

286
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,209
I'm not even sure where I should begin.

287
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,887
<i>I became a widow at a young age</i>

288
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,401
<i>and opened a grilled mackerel diner
to make a living.</i>

289
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,153
<i>A young woman by the name of Lee Sun-hwa</i>

290
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,479
<i>helped me out.</i>

291
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,155
<i>She was an orphan and quite lonely too.</i>

292
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,368
<i>That's how we bonded so quickly.</i>

293
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,752
ANDONG BAR

294
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,119
Why haven't you married yet?

295
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,418
Have you even had a boyfriend?

296
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,882
I'm too shy, you see.

297
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,299
I've been moving from place to place
working as a housekeeper, so no.

298
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,010
You can't die a virgin though.

299
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,273
What if

300
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,476
I got married and gave birth to a child

301
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,194
only to let it become an orphan like me?

302
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:53,163
Gosh. Why would you say such harsh things?

303
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,453
If that happens by any chance,
I'll take care of the kid for you.

304
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,874
So just find someone already.

305
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,252
Your only worry should be
about snagging the right guy.

306
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,460
I got married once,
but I wouldn't mind doing it again.

307
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,335
You should go for it.

308
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,878
<i>Then a guy entered the diner.</i>

309
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,513
We're closed...

310
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,124
<i>I fell for the guy hard.</i>

311
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,533
<i>He was tall, handsome,</i>

312
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,908
<i>kind, and sincere.</i>

313
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,705
<i>I wanted to make him mine.</i>

314
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,537
Is Sun-hwa not here today?

315
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,625
Yes, she went to the sauna.

316
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,748
I see.

317
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,392
It must be exhausting
to drive the truck around the country.

318
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,060
Mr. Ko, go ahead and have some.

319
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,982
But I didn't order any oysters.

320
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,942
Dig in.

321
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,109
I hear that oysters are good for men.

322
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,649
<i>Whenever he was in town,</i>

323
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,782
-<i>he came by my diner.</i>
-I'll eat it myself.

324
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,450
-No, let me.
-<i>I thought he had feelings</i>

325
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,616
<i>for me too.</i>

326
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,195
-<i>Boy, was I wrong.</i>
-How fascinating.

327
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,000
You've been bragging
about that new camera of yours,

328
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,666
so make us look good, okay?

329
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,211
All right then.

330
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,875
There we go.

331
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,641
Make sure you develop one for each of us.

332
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,049
Sure thing. I'll take the photo then.

333
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,638
In one, two, three.

334
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,692
-Thank you for doing this.
-Don't mention it.

335
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,861
We have something to tell you.

336
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,400
What? We?

337
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,400
Sun-hwa is with child.

338
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,528
It's been three months.

339
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,783
We're planning to get married soon.

340
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,538
No wonder Sun-hwa has been
rejecting all the men around here.

341
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,082
She was already taken!

342
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,206
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

343
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,165
There you go.

344
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,463
-<i>My blood boiled.</i>
-All right.

345
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,467
-Bottoms up.
-<i>I couldn't keep a straight face.</i>

346
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,679
<i>Congratulations.</i>

347
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,549
<i>So I applied layers of makeup
to mask my expression.</i>

348
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,182
<i>Darker, thicker, and more colorful.</i>

349
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,809
<i>It was as if I was mad.</i>

350
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,731
<i>Sun-hwa gave birth to a girl,</i>

351
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,475
<i>but I never visited.</i>

352
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,906
<i>I hated her guts for stealing my man,
so how could I?</i>

353
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,032
Is that so? There, there.

354
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,708
<i>It was a disgusting act of jealously.</i>

355
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,619
Damn.

356
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,840
Good evening.

357
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,638
Goodness, it's you, honey.

358
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,928
Or should I say Baby Daddy?

359
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,234
Congratulations.

360
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,694
I stopped by to show my gratitude.

361
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,990
Thank you for taking
good care of my Sun-hwa.

362
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,648
Your Sun-hwa?

363
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,908
Your Sun-hwa?

364
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,833
Look here, Mr. Ko.

365
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,369
I'm glad that you two
are in love and all, but...

366
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,421
Should I tell you this?

367
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,380
No, I shouldn't.

368
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,426
Did something happen to Sun-hwa?

369
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,515
Your problem is that you're too naive.

370
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,057
Come on.

371
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,439
Do you really believe
that you're the father of the baby?

372
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,784
-What?
-You two had a long distance relationship.

373
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,197
You don't even know
anything about her past.

374
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,700
Well,

375
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,704
how could you know

376
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,582
when that minx never told you?

377
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,333
What do you mean by that?

378
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,248
I'm only telling you this
because you're like a brother,

379
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,298
so take what I tell you to heart.

380
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,547
What happened is that...

381
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,274
Honey, that's not true.

382
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,146
Rumors don't come out of nowhere.

383
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,863
That's ridiculous!

384
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,403
Honey, please...

385
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,619
Damn it.

386
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,949
You crazy bitch.

387
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,618
What did my drunk brain yap about?

388
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,961
I need to go over there
and tell him that I lied.

389
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,509
Honey!

390
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,184
Dong-gil!

391
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,262
-Sun-hwa...
-Dong-gil!

392
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,718
-Sun-hwa...
-Honey!

393
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,799
<i>The door to hell opened there and then.</i>

394
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:56,556
<i>The baby only had me to take care of her,</i>

395
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,023
<i>so I had to raise her
even though I wanted to die myself.</i>

396
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,154
<i>As Eun-su grew up,
she resembled her mother more and more.</i>

397
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,989
<i>The amount of guilt it brought</i>

398
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,832
was truly too much to bear.

399
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,912
What I said while intoxicated

400
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,037
put me in Hell forever.

401
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,169
My dying wish

402
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,553
is to have Eun-su meet her birth father,

403
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,677
but I've had no luck finding him.

404
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,022
It's frustrating
because this lung cancer I have

405
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,061
will take my life soon.

406
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,516
Cancer?

407
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,574
Don't tell Eun-su.

408
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,857
My poor daughter

409
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,569
shouldn't have
the best day of her life ruined.

410
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,487
Unbelievable.

411
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:57,793
Think about it.

412
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:01,923
That girl has been calling her mom
all this time,

413
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,540
not knowing what she had done.

414
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,630
You're a fraud. Your daughter...

415
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,335
Actually, she's not even your daughter.

416
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,926
Aren't you sorry for what you did?

417
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,478
Gosh, what on earth did I say?

418
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,862
Get out.

419
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,357
I refuse to serve drinks
to a murderer like you.

420
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,235
Ms. Weol-ju, how can you say that?

421
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,244
She's not a murderer.

422
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:38,291
Swords and guns are not
the only weapons that can kill.

423
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,245
You?

424
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,246
It was your tongue that killed her

425
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,543
and destroyed a family.

426
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,296
She probably serviced
the Crown Prince well every night.

427
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,221
I think she's on a path
to becoming his concubine.

428
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,100
I knew it. Those born of lowly status

429
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,428
only know how to sell their bodies.

430
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,385
And all you do

431
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,598
is apologize?

432
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,773
Do you think you can avoid going to hell
if she forgives you?

433
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,533
That won't happen.

434
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,614
You should carry your sins with you
until you die

435
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,445
and be judged at the gates of hell.

436
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,620
I think that's enough.

437
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,497
Please.

438
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,286
I'm sorry.

439
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:31,632
I shouldn't have said that.

440
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,176
I'll be going now.

441
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,061
Ms. Andong.

442
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,311
Ms. Andong.

443
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,440
Don't you think you were being too harsh?

444
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,106
She's dying. Shouldn't we try to help her?

445
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,315
Just because she's dying doesn't mean
we should go easy on her.

446
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,699
Why did you even want me to work here?

447
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,584
You said we'll help people
and grant their wishes.

448
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,371
You never said we'll be scolding them
and kicking them out!

449
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,497
Are you going to take responsibility
if she collapses from shock?

450
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,877
"Take responsibility"?

451
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,932
She's the one
who should take responsibility.

452
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,181
You reap what you sow, got it?

453
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,547
What are you doing?
Why did you skip lunch?

454
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,803
Are you tired?

455
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,641
Is it because you have
that side job at night?

456
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,215
I'm quitting that job for good today.

457
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,637
Why? You said you had
the perfect body for it.

458
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,306
There's nothing I can do alone.

459
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,268
I need that drink.

460
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,565
That's right.

461
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,239
With that drink...

462
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,120
I guess Special Case isn't coming back.

463
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,792
We don't need that idiot.

464
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,535
Are you sure?

465
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,375
I can manage alone.

466
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,837
Welcome.

467
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,679
A bottle of soju, please.

468
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,758
-Soju?
-Anything else?

469
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:48,727
That jerk. I'm going to grill him alive.

470
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,308
That's it. Let it all out
and it will make your drink taste better.

471
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,161
He fooled me.

472
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,910
Apparently, he's married.

473
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,577
His wife showed up at work today.

474
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,461
She pulled out my hair

475
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,919
and accused me of being a homewrecker.

476
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,131
Okay, got it.

477
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,047
Let me pour you one.

478
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,173
That jerk.

479
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,465
Let's teach him a lesson.

480
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,142
I loved him.

481
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,808
I loved him with all my heart!

482
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,610
I get it, but try not to spill the drink.

483
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,784
No, you shouldn't...

484
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,874
Oh, my.

485
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:51,578
You sure managed yourself just fine.

486
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,170
Well...

487
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,923
It was a bad case.

488
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,171
Whatever.

489
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,172
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

490
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,051
-Darn it.
-Gosh, she's heavy.

491
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,723
Why did she drink so much?

492
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,602
-Put me down!
-What's with her?

493
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,231
-Hey!
-Fine, I get it.

494
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,598
Pull yourself together. Hey!

495
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,388
My goodness.

496
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,815
If I drink this,
I can enter people's dreams.

497
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,454
Ms. Andong.

498
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,673
Ms. Andong, wake up!

499
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,585
Cancer?

500
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,881
You have cancer?

501
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,097
Why didn't you tell me?

502
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,393
Why did you suffer alone?

503
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,290
Hey, Special Case.
By any chance, did you...

504
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,331
Why did you do that?

505
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,343
You are never to use that drink
no matter what.

506
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,592
Understood?

507
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,471
Don't drink and don't touch it, okay?

508
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,050
That brat.

509
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,800
Hey! Where are you?

510
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,816
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,002
Gosh, this is bad.

512
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,344
Eun-su!

513
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,377
Eun-su!

514
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,642
What? Where am I?

515
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,813
Gosh.

516
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,315
Gosh, I'm scared.

517
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,832
Hello? Anybody here?

518
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,839
I knew this would happen.

519
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,471
Mom, I'm so scared.

520
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,153
Is anybody there?

521
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,019
Excuse me! Help!

522
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,068
You fool.
Why didn't you turn on the light?

523
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,124
How dare you steal the <i>ssanggapju</i>?

524
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,118
Ms. Weol-ju.

525
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,913
Ms. Weol-ju. You came for me.
I was scared.

526
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,367
Why didn't you listen?

527
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:05,497
If you enter the Dream World
before I plan it thoroughly,

528
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,835
you could end up trapped
in the person's subconscious forever!

529
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,677
So we are in Eun-su's dream?

530
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,932
This looks like a movie theater.
Is this also your design?

531
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,427
This is just a basic template.

532
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,226
You can see what goes through
the person's mind on the screen.

533
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,770
Forget it. I don't know
why I'm telling this to a thief like you.

534
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,234
Oh, the movie is starting.

535
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,914
Since we're already here,
let's watch a little bit, shall we?

536
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,122
<i>Eun-su, hang in there.
Mommy is taking you to the hospital.</i>

537
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,037
<i>My baby.</i>

538
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,090
<i>Discipline your kid better, woman.</i>

539
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,588
People say she's a spoiled brat
because she has no father.

540
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,800
Fine! Then why are your kids such
spoiled brats when they have a father?

541
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,103
Stay away from my daughter,
or I'll teach you a lesson!

542
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,468
Goodness, what exactly
are you going to do?

543
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,845
-I said, stay away from her!
-Break it up!

544
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,555
What are you talking about?

545
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,306
No way.

546
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,688
My restaurant is still doing pretty well.

547
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,485
A high school student shouldn't work.

548
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,607
Just focus on your studies, okay?

549
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,660
SAVINGS ACCOUNT

550
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,542
Here. Use this money.

551
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,327
<i>Get everything you need for your wedding.</i>

552
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,209
Ms. Andong

553
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,587
was a real mother.

554
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,091
It's the least she should do.

555
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:36,838
Still...

556
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,720
What happened?
Is there a fire or something?

557
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,858
Mom!

558
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,568
Doctor! Help!

559
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,569
Mom!

560
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,454
Mom!

561
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,121
Excuse me.

562
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,739
Please wait outside.

563
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,872
Ma'am, can you hear me?

564
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,460
Ms. Weol-ju, shouldn't we grant
Ms. Andong's wish before she...

565
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,915
Cut it out.

566
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,842
Steal my <i>ssanggapju</i> again,
and you're dead meat.

567
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,772
Mom!

568
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,482
Ms. Weol-ju

569
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,857
Wait!

570
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,824
I'll do it.

571
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,487
I'll sign the contract.

572
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,660
Nine people within a month.
I'll sign the contract.

573
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,705
So please grant Ms. Andong's wish.

574
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,500
<i>Gosh, what should I do?
He wants to sign the contract?</i>

575
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:54,746
<i>That changes everything.</i>

576
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,337
<i>Should I forget everything and help her?
But that hurts my pride.</i>

577
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,183
<i>Wait, who cares about pride
when I'm so close to my 100,000th case?</i>

578
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,259
Ms. Weol-ju?

579
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,521
Let's sign it right now.

580
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,808
Well?

581
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,807
Fine, wait here.

582
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:16,727
I'll go get the contract
and <i>ssanggapju</i> from the bar.

583
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,196
Look who's here.
I didn't expect to see you here.

584
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,786
What are you doing here?

585
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,791
Can't you see my uniform?

586
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,328
What do you think Death is doing
at the hospital?

587
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,091
Let me see.

588
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,712
The name of the deceased is...

589
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,767
Mom, no!

590
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,279
Mom, don't leave me!

591
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,744
There's some time left
until the funeral anyway, right?

592
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,285
Everyone says they need just a few days.

593
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,173
In the end, I have to chase them.

594
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,090
Come on, I'll be with her all the time.

595
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,629
Also, Guibanjang at the bar
will make sure she doesn't disappear.

596
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:25,183
If I don't grant her wish, her spirit
will wander the Living Realm forever.

597
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,471
Right?

598
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,137
I really shouldn't.

599
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,190
Why are you glaring at me?
Fine, you can take her.

600
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,944
But she has to be back by morning
the day after tomorrow.

601
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,027
Don't be late.

602
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,201
Okay.

603
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,906
Don't be late.

604
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,497
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

605
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,420
-So you're going to look for her father?
-Yes.

606
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,844
After you've lashed out at her like that?

607
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,554
I guess you're that desperate, huh?

608
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,434
It's not just one case.

609
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,136
Nine cases depend on this.
He signed the contract.

610
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,519
You didn't have to.

611
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,726
Now that you're dead, let me pour you one.

612
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:36,455
Are you saying
Ms. Andong is here sitting with us?

613
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,710
Yes.

614
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,464
Is she a ghost now?

615
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,634
That's right.

616
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,144
Thank you so much for being nice to me.

617
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,350
I'll never forget your kindness.

618
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,364
Rest in peace.

619
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,280
My goodness.

620
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,540
I'm the one who should thank you.

621
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,711
I know it's shameless of me,

622
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,457
but please help me.

623
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,837
When I'm gone,
my daughter will be left all alone.

624
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,888
Please tell us everything you know
about Mr. Ko.

625
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,522
All I know is that his name is
Ko Dong-gil.

626
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,148
I don't even know
his birthday or hometown.

627
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,435
Oh, wait.

628
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:51,319
It's an old photo of him.
I'm not sure if it'll be of any help.

629
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,831
This is more than enough.

630
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,627
What's this?

631
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,750
Wait.

632
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,214
Unbelievable. It actually works.

633
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,136
Did you get it?
I'm looking for a man called Ko Dong-gil.

634
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,179
The photo was taken 30 years ago. Okay.

635
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,484
-What is he doing?
-He's tracking down Mr. Ko.

636
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,015
The Afterlife Police Agency
has an incredible network.

637
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,852
With a name and a photo,

638
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,727
they can find anyone in no time.

639
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:27,316
I might not look it, but I used to be
in the Criminal Department.

640
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,700
Mr. Ko has a daughter?

641
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,872
Yes. He never told you?

642
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:37,579
Who knows anything about his past?
Not even he does.

643
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,951
What do you mean?

644
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,708
He tried to take his life once.

645
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:46,301
He did survive, but he lost his memory.

646
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,378
When he first came here,
all he remembered was his name.

647
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,677
He's in that room. Go talk to him.

648
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,090
Thank you.

649
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,102
He lost his memory?

650
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,729
What should we do?

651
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,058
Let's see what we can do.

652
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,902
Go get some mackerel first.

653
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,368
Oh, my. This is delicious.

654
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,618
You're a good cook.

655
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,329
But why are you making all this for me?

656
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:21,913
That's not the point.

657
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:25,714
Does the mackerel remind you of anyone,
by any chance?

658
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,337
Not really.

659
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,921
It should.

660
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,966
A long time ago, you met your wife
at a mackerel restaurant,

661
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,551
do you remember?

662
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,433
I've never been in a relationship
my whole life.

663
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:43,345
You must be mistaken.

664
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,346
We have no choice.

665
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,322
Sir, eat slowly.

666
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,384
The mackerel

667
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,458
does remind me of something

668
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,718
-What is it?
-What is it?

669
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,470
It was a long time ago.

670
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,762
After that day, I couldn't eat
mackerel for quite a while.

671
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,136
While

672
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,055
having mackerel,

673
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:31,278
a huge bone got stuck in my throat.

674
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:35,898
I tried eating rice, drinking water,
and all that, but I couldn't get it out.

675
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,488
I thought I was going to die.

676
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,446
Other than that?

677
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,202
Other than that?

678
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,285
Nothing.

679
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,880
He doesn't seem to remember anything.

680
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,707
What if we get into his dream?

681
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,877
Ms. Andong's funeral is tomorrow.

682
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,930
Before that, we have to take him
to the bar, make him drink <i>ssanggapju</i>,

683
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,011
and refresh his memory.

684
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,556
Do you expect him to follow us
all the way to Seoul?

685
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,641
I don't think so.

686
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,560
Right.

687
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,531
Well, the thing is...

688
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,358
I still have the <i>ssanggapju</i>
I stole yesterday in my bag.

689
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,406
I thought Ms. Andong's daughter drank it.

690
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,330
She did, but there's some left.

691
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,245
Just a tiny bit. A small glass, maybe?

692
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,331
Bravo!

693
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,536
Were you going to steal that too?

694
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:32,633
I'll let it slide this time.

695
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,632
If you don't, what can you do?

696
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,184
Kang-bae, the relationship
between you and Mystic Pop-up Bar

697
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,508
can be compared to that of
the red bean paste and a bun

698
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,724
or FC Barcelona and Messi
in terms of soccer.

699
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,096
In other words, you're completely equal.

700
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,725
Sorry?

701
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,727
Cut it out. Let's go inside.

702
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,673
What's the point of living like this?

703
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,404
You've lived such a lonely life.

704
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,979
Is this his first memory?
Where could his wife and daughter be?

705
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:40,074
Should we go deeper into his subconcious?

706
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,494
Gosh.

707
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,033
I really

708
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,163
didn't want to do that.

709
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,722
Are we in Mr. Ko's subconcious now?

710
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,734
We're even deeper than that.

711
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,484
We are beyond his deepest subconscious.

712
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,441
We're looking for the memories
that have been locked away by Mr. Ko.

713
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,572
Be quiet and focus.

714
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,198
-A cockroach!
-Gosh!

715
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,695
-Hey!
-Be careful!

716
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,117
Stop pushing me!

717
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,487
My gosh.

718
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,369
It's okay. Keep going down.

719
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,079
How deep is this place anyway?

720
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,542
-It's infinite.
-There's no end?

721
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,923
So be careful.

722
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:42,174
If you lose your footing,
you'll fall into the infinite darkness.

723
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,183
You'll keep falling until your ego
and your soul disappear.

724
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,430
It's like the black hole of the soul.

725
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,846
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

726
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,313
Keep going down.

727
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,329
Gosh, unbelievable.

728
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,177
Come here.

729
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,851
You have to enter a password.

730
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,098
Why does this have to be so high-tech?

731
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,194
I wish we could just knock down the door.

732
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,520
Do you know the password?

733
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,858
I don't. Should we try "1111"?

734
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:42,992
"1111"?

735
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:49,584
<i>Authorization failed.</i>

736
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,752
-What's going on?
-No!

737
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,709
It's crumbling away!

738
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,423
It's collapsing!

739
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:04,054
How could you be so reckless?
You should use your head.

740
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,131
But we have nothing to go on.
We'll just have to take a wild guess.

741
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:12,138
At least try to think what's
the most commonly used password.

742
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:13,853
What's that?

743
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,100
-<i>Authorization failed.</i>
-No?

744
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,648
What's happening?

745
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,071
-No!
-Gosh.

746
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:26,112
I don't want to die.

747
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,613
<i>You have one more try remaining.</i>

748
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,867
-Gosh.
-Hey.

749
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,540
What? The "most commonly used password"?
"Use your head"?

750
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,791
Hey, stay still. We might fall.

751
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,504
Calm down, Ms. Weol-ju. Please.

752
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,007
Could it be his birthday?

753
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:52,385
It might be in Mr. Ko's profile
from the Intelligence Agency.

754
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,471
Let me see.

755
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,064
Where's my phone?

756
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:56,979
Gosh.

757
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:01,095
I can't move right now.
Can you two look for my phone?

758
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,058
Okay.

759
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,437
Is it in my pocket?

760
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,154
I don't think so.

761
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,154
Hold on. Not there.

762
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,527
-Where is it?
-Is it there?

763
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,493
This is your phone, right?
I'll take it out.

764
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:15,118
-Please don't touch my armpit.
-Why isn't it coming out?

765
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,122
-Not my armpit!
-Hold on.

766
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,334
Hey!

767
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,505
I'm sorry.

768
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,596
I should have stayed still.

769
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,095
But my armpits are extremely ticklish.

770
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,348
Don't worry.

771
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,768
I'm sorry I've been so harsh on you.

772
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,444
If only I had known
things would end like this.

773
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,488
Goodbye, friend.

774
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,568
What?

775
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:54,954
What do you mean?

776
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,790
It's too crowded here.
Shouldn't you go first?

777
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,461
-Hey!
-Wait!

778
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,961
Hold on!

779
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,502
You said his birthday, right?

780
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,628
Eun-su's wedding is on May 9, right?

781
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,296
Isn't that on her birthday?

782
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,758
I think I might know the password.

783
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,484
Wait!

784
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,145
Just a second.

785
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:24,895
What if it's wrong?

786
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,904
This is probably right.

787
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,817
Mr. Ko is a father after all.

788
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,201
Try it.

789
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,790
<i>Access granted.</i>

790
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,922
-It worked!
-Yes!

791
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,542
-You did it!
-Hey!

792
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:50,336
You aren't completely useless.

793
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,616
As expected,

794
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,867
it remained in the depths
of his subconscious.

795
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,673
That's a relief.

796
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,339
Now we have to pull it up.

797
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:52,275
It's okay. Goodness.

798
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:35,356
That is why

799
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,490
it's only now that I'm here.

800
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,322
It's okay.

801
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,247
I don't know
what to say to you now though.

802
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,328
After the funeral,

803
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,092
after I pick up the pieces,
I'll get in touch with you.

804
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,926
This is Sun-hwa,

805
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,387
your real mother.

806
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,980
She looks like me.

807
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:11,652
And

808
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,939
this is Ms. Andong when she was young.

809
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:22,122
My mom can't wear makeup
because she has allergies.

810
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,158
That must've been

811
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,040
an atonement for her.

812
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,406
Perhaps

813
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:34,745
she didn't have the courage
to face her foolish self

814
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,554
just like me.

815
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,683
Was that why you didn't wear makeup?

816
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,390
Was it?

817
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,814
You had been suffering alone
all your life,

818
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:02,112
but I had no idea
and told you not to come to school.

819
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,987
I even said you embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

820
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,582
I'm sorry, Mom.

821
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,881
I'm so sorry.

822
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:26,138
Thank you for raising me.

823
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:30,177
I was so happy to be your daughter.

824
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:36,268
I love you, Mom.

825
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,067
What am I going to do?

826
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,866
I miss my mom already.

827
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,072
Let's go.

828
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,277
Now I have no regrets
even if end up in hell.

829
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,229
Ms. Andong.

830
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:38,977
Sun...

831
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:40,899
Sun-hwa.

832
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,573
Sun-hwa.

833
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,820
I

834
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,027
am sorry.

835
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,964
It was all my fault. I'm sorry.

836
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,461
It was my fault.

837
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,553
Thank you

838
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,469
for doing a great job
raising Eun-su for me.

839
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,389
No.

840
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,557
It was my fault.

841
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:23,611
I'm sorry.

842
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,664
It's fine.

843
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,491
Don't worry anymore,

844
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,327
and rest in peace.

845
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:44,748
Okay?

846
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,370
Guibanjang, what brings you here?

847
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,236
I came here to play basketball.

848
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,736
Do you play basketball, too?

849
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,957
There is no reason not to.

850
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,205
Here I go.

851
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,018
A three-pointer!

852
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,240
Tell me the truth.
You aren't human, are you?

853
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,242
Are you a shooting machine?

854
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,874
You should play in the NBA.
What are you doing here?

855
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:01,997
You know,

856
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,410
if I play, people will chase me

857
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,792
instead of the ball.

858
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,053
You're right.

859
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:17,012
All I know in basketball
is how to shoot the ball.

860
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,845
Because that's all I can do alone.

861
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,560
You're here for the contract, right?

862
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,734
I was going to go see you anyway.

863
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,980
Won't you regret it?

864
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,071
I'm used to failing

865
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,904
whether it's sports or relationships.

866
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,823
That's why I hesitated to take the offer.

867
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,197
The price of failure was too much.

868
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:41,583
Life is about living with other people.

869
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,411
You can't just practice
shooting alone forever.

870
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,957
A real game.

871
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,383
You have to live a real life.

872
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,514
A real life?

873
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,094
You did a great job

874
00:59:58,553 --> 00:59:59,683
with Ms. Andong today.

875
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,389
You and Ms. Weol-ju did all the work.

876
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,388
We couldn't have started it
if it weren't for you.

877
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,608
We were a pretty good team.

878
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,728
A team?

879
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,654
-It's mine.
-Pass.

880
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,114
Shoot it.

881
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:18,780
-Nice!
-Yes!

882
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,945
Yes!

883
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,294
Nice!

884
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,793
Okay.

885
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,131
I'll join the game.

886
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,838
The real game.

887
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:39,512
CONTRACT

888
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,596
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR OWNER WEOL-JU

889
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,267
PART-TIME EMPLOYEE HAN KANG-BAE

890
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,073
WEOL-JU

891
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,565
Here.

892
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:02,701
You'll keep one each.

893
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:07,914
Special Case, you are Mystic Pop-up Bar's
official part-time employee as of today.

894
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,172
I'm happy to work with you, Ms. Weol-ju.

895
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,714
-You, too, Guibanjang.
-Okay.

896
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:17,553
Don't you dare steal <i>ssanggapju</i> again.

897
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:22,052
If you do, I'll replay the moments you've
been dumped repeatedly in your dream.

898
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,849
I will never steal it again.

899
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,182
Don't scare the kid.

900
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:32,397
Aren't we going to throw a welcome party
for the new employee?

901
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,520
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

902
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,168
Here you go.

903
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,844
Gosh, it's beautiful when a professional
pours a drink.

904
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,013
It's her job.

905
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,931
It's nothing. Don't flatter her.

906
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,339
What do you mean it's nothing?

907
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,473
This is how you should pour beer.

908
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,976
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

909
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,824
What?

910
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,161
We're just getting started.
Are you drunk already?

911
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,082
I'm sorry.

912
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,792
You guys work at a pop-up bar,

913
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,504
but you can't even handle a drink or two.

914
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,875
I've drunk you both under the table.

915
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,800
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

916
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,762
Ms. Weol-ju.

917
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,050
I have a question.

918
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,138
Why does it have to be 100,000 people?

919
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,729
Isn't that too many?

920
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,355
Do you think so?

921
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,488
Yes, it's way too many.

922
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,162
Hundred-thousand people?

923
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:06,279
How can you handle that?

924
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:08,872
It's ridiculous.

925
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,952
How is that even possible?

926
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,578
It's because

927
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,551
I killed 100,000 people.

928
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,680
What?

929
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,869
Because of your fault,

930
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,287
the Sacred Tree
that has been defending the country

931
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,207
suffered bad luck.

932
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,371
You're aware of that, aren't you?

933
01:03:57,041 --> 01:04:00,631
That is why I've been stuck
in the Hell of Oil Cauldrons for months.

934
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:03,671
Yes, however,

935
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,796
the Hell of Oil Cauldrons alone
is not enough to cleanse you of your sin.

936
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:12,812
The country that had been relying
on the Sacred Tree waned

937
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,980
and was invaded by a neighboring country.

938
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,899
Hundred-thousand people died in this war.

939
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,646
Hundred-thousand!

940
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,029
What will you do about that?

941
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:35,496
Go down to the Living Realm and settle
the grudges of 100,000 people.

942
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,326
Listen to their stories and comfort them.

943
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,840
That will be your punishment.

944
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:45,919
No.

945
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,217
I will gladly take any other punishment
apart from that.

946
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:53,353
What? I did not ask for your opinion.

947
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,391
That was an order!

948
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,394
I took my life because I hated humans.

949
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,402
Yet you want me to live again for humans.

950
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,270
How can you be so cruel?

951
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,319
If making the Sacred Tree suffer bad luck
is such a great sin,

952
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,281
I'd rather be thrown
into the Hell of Extinction

953
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,242
and be ripped to pieces and perish.

954
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:14,623
Is that so?

955
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,414
The Sacred Tree
isn't your only sin though.

956
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,677
Have a look.

957
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:15,264
So, will you go to the Hell of Extinction?

958
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,640
I can let you be ripped to pieces

959
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,018
and disappear forever as you wish.

960
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,024
No.

961
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:25,404
No, Yeomradaewang.

962
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,228
Did you say 100,000 people?

963
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,106
I will do it.

964
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:34,908
I will

965
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,623
receive the punishment.

966
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:18,908
I have to bring in customers?

967
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,663
I'm going to make use of your talent
every way I can.

968
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,497
<i>-I have a problem...
-Come visit our bar.</i>

969
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:27,922
<i>The owner there
is an amazing problem solver.</i>

970
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,132
Can I have a bottle of soju?

971
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:33,086
What is the requirement for passing?

972
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,224
He was born a failure. What can I do?

973
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:36,591
<i>That bastard, Chairman Choi.</i>

974
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:39,387
-I'll deal with him myself.
<i>-I didn't order any drinks.</i>

975
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:42,022
It's on the house.

976
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:44,638
<i>Where's this onion smell coming from?</i>

977
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,232
<i>There must have been a misunderstanding.</i>

978
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,943
<i>I came to the wrong room.</i>

979
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,403
<i>Give me back the thing
you stole from this room.</i>
