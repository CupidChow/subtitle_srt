1
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,597
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES,
ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGION AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,271
PORTRAYED IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,350
Are you Weol-ju?

4
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,026
I hear you're opening a bar
in the Living Realm.

5
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,777
Yes.

6
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,501
Why do you need
this much water from the Afterlife?

7
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,923
When the living drink this water,

8
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,669
their souls linger momentarily
in the Dream World

9
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,206
between the Afterlife
and the Living Realm.

10
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,215
Since I have the ability to travel
the Dream World freely as I wish,

11
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,350
I am planning to settle the grudges
people hold in the Dream World.

12
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,431
Is it 100,000 souls?

13
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,934
You took your life
out of hatred for humans.

14
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,061
-Are you sure you'll be okay?
-What if I'm not?

15
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,515
I don't have a choice.

16
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,395
Anyway, who are you and why
are you asking all these questions?

17
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,396
Me?

18
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,743
I am Junior Manager Yeom.

19
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,778
You may also know me as Death,

20
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,909
but I was ordered to watch over you
whenever I visit the Living Realm.

21
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,670
That's not necessary.

22
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,004
There's no need to get all prickly.

23
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,797
Just think of me as a liaison.

24
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,799
If it turns out to be too much,

25
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,719
-I will...
-Stop right there.

26
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,218
I'll succeed no matter what.

27
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,892
I'll lie to them, scam them,

28
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,020
or use another human

29
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,228
if that's what it takes.

30
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,078
EPISODE 3

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,450
-Don't.
-Make way, will you?

32
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,577
-There's no room.
-Get off that way.

33
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,084
Coming through.

34
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,173
-What a jerk.
-Stop it.

35
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,461
Stop leaning on me!

36
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,843
<i>When I commute to work,</i>
<i>I want to ride on the subway.</i>

37
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,885
<i>It will be amazing.</i>
<i>Think of how alive it will make me feel.</i>

38
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,851
That's how I would like to celebrate
my new life as a normal human being.

39
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,056
You're a weird one, you know that?

40
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,654
You're going through this much work
to be normal again,

41
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,650
and all you want to do is ride the subway.

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,940
Kang-bae, forget the subway.

43
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,027
Head to a sauna first.

44
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,283
-Have you ever had your body scrubbed?
-No.

45
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,079
You poor thing.

46
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,657
Getting a body scrub when you're tired

47
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,290
is like being in Shangri-la.

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,419
-Really?
-Of course.

49
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,749
How about a demonstration?

50
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,216
-Turn to the side.
-To the side.

51
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,429
How's that?

52
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,218
-Turn around.
-Around.

53
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,005
-There we go.
-That feels great.

54
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,387
Now, face me directly.

55
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,394
-Lift your arms.
-Up!

56
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,015
-Say, "Ho."
-Ho!

57
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,312
Just thinking about someone
scrubbing every inch

58
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,528
-of my body...
-Hey!

59
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,819
People will think you're a pervert.

60
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,488
You don't get this for free.

61
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,121
You have a job to do

62
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,158
and it all starts
by bringing in customers.

63
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,202
-I have to bring in customers?
-Unbelievable.

64
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,157
-What's your day job?
-Customer service.

65
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,248
What's your ability?

66
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,132
People spill their worries on me
when they touch me.

67
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,130
Exactly.

68
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,091
You have everything you need
to bring people in,

69
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,882
so what are you doing
loitering around in here?

70
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,347
I'm going to make use of your talent
every way I can.

71
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,261
Every way?

72
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,059
Hello.

73
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,225
-May I have your ticket?
-Sure.

74
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,824
I've been dating a younger man these days.

75
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,861
I don't know what to do.
It's my son's birthday soon.

76
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,373
I want to get a decent job!

77
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,950
Come visit our bar.
Drinks and snacks are on the house

78
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,496
and the owner there
is an amazing problem solver.

79
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,790
What's wrong with me? I have a problem.

80
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,134
Of course.

81
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,919
-A pop-up bar?
-Yes.

82
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,172
Drinks and snacks are on the house.

83
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,375
Keep it just in case.

84
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,216
Kang-bae.

85
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,677
That thing you've been
giving out to the customers.

86
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,095
Is it a coupon for the place
you work at during the night?

87
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,596
Yes.

88
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,192
I'd appreciate it if you kept it a secret
from Mr. Ma.

89
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,025
Don't you worry.

90
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,319
If you're in charge
of quality control at a bar,

91
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,276
shouldn't you be handing them out
to good looking people?

92
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,873
The people you gave the coupons to
look rather depressed mostly.

93
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,867
My boss likes people
who have a lot on their minds.

94
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,917
Apparently, they're easier to work on

95
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,501
-and to take advantage of.
-What?

96
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,131
-Take advantage?
-Yes.

97
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,586
-Would you like one too?
-What?

98
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,758
No, I'm good.

99
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,847
I don't have any worries at all.
It's all rainbows and sunshine for me.

100
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,021
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

101
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,563
No matter what she does,
she can't seem to lose weight.

102
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,937
She's now seeing a psychiatrist
for her depression.

103
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,904
I only eat minuscule portions.

104
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,195
I gain weight from just drinking water.

105
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,700
But people say that I'm weak,
that I have no self-control

106
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,994
-and that I don't take care of myself.
-Really...

107
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,924
Miss, I'd like another bottle.

108
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,332
-Sure.
-Are you sure this is on the house?

109
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,378
Yes. Eat and drink as much as you want.

110
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,258
Can I get another <i>pajeon?</i>

111
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,216
She's already had five of them.

112
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,299
-Get out.
-Sorry?

113
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,885
Stop stuffing yourself and leave.

114
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,971
Get out there and run!

115
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,346
Ms. Weol-ju, she's in a lot of pain...

116
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,313
-You too!
-But...

117
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,145
So you and your husband
haven't been connecting lately?

118
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,652
My husband must not
love me as much anymore.

119
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:27,284
You see, we used to do it
seven times a week.

120
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,872
Now, that number's gone down to five.

121
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,618
How we've aged...

122
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,541
Five times a week is just as admirable.

123
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,040
His stamina...

124
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,214
My gosh, it must be terrible.

125
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,916
-Ms. Weol-ju.
-You call that a grudge?

126
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,125
It looks more like she's blessed.

127
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,428
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

128
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,111
Don't let her push you around like that.

129
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,738
Didn't I tell you
that you're the red bean paste

130
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,742
and this bar is the bun.

131
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,279
How can I not be intimidated?
She's really scary.

132
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,786
I heard she killed 100,000 people
in her past life.

133
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,416
What?

134
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,794
Says who?

135
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:21,787
Didn't you know?

136
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,456
She said so herself
when we got drinks last time.

137
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,142
-And you believe her?
-Yes, she said it's true.

138
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,429
She's no Genghis Khan or Hitler.

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,430
She lied to straighten you out
nice and early.

140
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,189
Kang-bae.

141
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:44,066
This is the time for you to be strong
and hold your ground.

142
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,109
We don't have to let her boss us around
because we're her employees. No way.

143
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,445
Come to think of it, being the boss

144
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,412
doesn't give her the right to give orders

145
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,082
without doing anything herself.

146
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,997
You know what? I'll show her...

147
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,706
<i>How many breaks do you two take in a day?</i>

148
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,712
<i>Get back to work!</i>

149
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,674
Coming.

150
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,006
You heard her. Come on.

151
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,589
Get back in there.

152
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,175
<i>Kang-bae, peel some onions.</i>

153
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,679
Kang-bae.

154
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,270
Do you not understand what a grudge is?

155
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:28,028
I do. It's a feeling of anger,
frustration and things like that.

156
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,439
And yet you still bring in
useless people like that.

157
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,408
-People like them don't even count!
-Gosh.

158
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,568
Calm down, will you?

159
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,906
There's no need to bite his head off.

160
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,332
You can teach the boy one step at a time.

161
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,871
Let's start with what qualifies
as a grudge.

162
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,456
He needs a guideline of sorts, right?

163
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,503
Here. Have a seat.

164
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,259
Then listen up.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,510
First of all, a grudge is something
that cannot be settled by one's own will.

166
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,308
Others can't help you lose weight.

167
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,851
Weight-loss is an arduous journey
that one must take alone.

168
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,896
That's how you lose weight.

169
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,150
I see.

170
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,148
You should take notes.

171
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,154
Don't let her words of wisdom go to waste.

172
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,486
Here. Write it down in red.

173
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,243
"A journey that one must take alone."

174
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,575
Two,

175
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,580
they must not desire
more than what others have.

176
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,663
That's not a grudge.

177
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,959
It's greed.

178
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,169
She's right. It's greed.

179
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,172
Winning the lottery, a nine-figure salary,

180
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,964
or doing it seven times a week.

181
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,885
All of those cases fall short.

182
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,425
Third.

183
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,970
And this is most important.

184
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,266
They must be desperate.

185
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,613
They should either be desperate
enough to kill

186
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,688
or they can't die because of their grudge

187
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,114
or be in a life and death situation.

188
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,647
That's what you call a grudge.

189
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,157
Got it?

190
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,993
-It won't take long.
-No can do.

191
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,165
I just need to ask HR something.

192
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,748
I said it's out of the question.

193
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,090
The results have already been announced.

194
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,549
That's how desperate I am.

195
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,799
Please just let me in.

196
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,642
The Chairman is coming.

197
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,823
Chairman Choi!

198
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,228
I'm Park Byeong-jae
who applied for an opening here.

199
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,237
I at least need to know
why I didn't make the cut.

200
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,950
If you tell me why...

201
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,202
Let go of me!

202
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,004
What is the requirement for passing?

203
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,035
How dare you get your filthy hands on me.

204
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,294
Sir, please!

205
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,380
Let go, you bastard!

206
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,842
Where do those rats even come from?

207
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,298
Are you all right, sir?

208
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,300
I apologize for not seeing him coming.

209
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,969
It's not your fault.

210
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,057
The men outside
should've dealt with him sooner.

211
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,766
They're hardly worth the money I pay them.

212
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,361
Meanwhile, you're quite useful.

213
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,149
Definitely worth the fat paycheck.

214
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,912
Look at how fresh the octopus is.

215
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,115
Don't be too harsh on Kang-bae.

216
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,115
No one is good right off the bat.

217
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,036
Look at the clients he's bringing me.
How can I not be on his case?

218
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,415
I'll take a peek later
to see how he's doing.

219
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,085
Just let him be for a while.

220
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,681
-Ms. Weol-ju?
-It's been a while.

221
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,219
-Hello.
-Hi.

222
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,305
I see you're grocery shopping
with your husband.

223
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,562
That's nice.

224
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,611
You must have it easy these days.

225
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,612
-Sorry?
-Have you been bored

226
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,900
because the customers
haven't been bothering you?

227
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,744
Then how about this?

228
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,989
How dare you call him my husband?

229
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,991
Again with the temper. Cool down a little.

230
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,663
All you have to do is correct her,
not bite her head off.

231
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,083
She's the boss and I'm just an employee.

232
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,499
Gosh, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

233
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,671
It's okay.

234
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,749
Anyway, are you done
with the free samples?

235
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,460
-You must be good.
-Actually,

236
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,011
companies have been
announcing their new recruits lately.

237
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,681
The moms must be
going the extra mile for dinner.

238
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,430
So, the moms whose sons were accepted
are throwing a party,

239
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,431
while the less fortunate
are eating their sorrows away.

240
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,558
More or less, yes.

241
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,693
-Company recruits?
-Yes.

242
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,447
Why Noryangjin of all places?

243
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,277
Because companies
are announcing their new recruits.

244
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,446
The streets are filled
with men and women who were turned down.

245
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:51,656
You're right.
There's only a slim chance of getting in.

246
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:52,916
Exactly.

247
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,088
And all the depressed souls
will be gathering where?

248
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,338
Right here.

249
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,550
<i>Come on and take a pick</i>

250
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,801
It will be harder not to score today.

251
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,223
Come on. These guys already have it tough.

252
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,426
He's right.

253
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,056
Your attitude is a little disturbing.

254
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,429
My attitude? What about it?

255
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,023
It's called strategizing.

256
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,351
All you two do is follow orders,

257
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,056
so what would you know
about the big picture?

258
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,764
MY LOVE YU-MI

259
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,468
DECLINE

260
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,609
NORYANGJIN STATION

261
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,572
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

262
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,866
Can I have a bottle of soju?

263
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,916
See what I mean? Right on the mark.

264
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,924
Hold on.

265
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,210
He's crying. Maybe it's too spicy.

266
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,587
It's a stir-fried octopus.
Of course, it's spicy.

267
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,392
Is it spicy enough
to bring someone to tears though?

268
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,688
Gosh.

269
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,822
Water.

270
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,032
-What the...
-Oh, no.

271
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,663
I'll go buy some milk.

272
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,040
Here.

273
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,224
If it's too spicy, have this with it.

274
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,432
I wanted to

275
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,269
have it with Yu-mi.

276
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,895
Stir-fried octopus.

277
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,284
Byeong-jae, it's been a while.

278
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,082
Hi, I'm sorry about that.

279
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,825
Since you're sorry...

280
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,627
I'm sorry about that too.

281
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,751
I'll pay the rent by this month.

282
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,005
Come on. You haven't paid
your rent for three months now.

283
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,050
If you don't pay this month,
you'll be thrown out.

284
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:34,675
Sure.

285
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,060
<i>Here you go.</i>

286
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,719
-Have a good day.
-You too.

287
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,693
Welcome.

288
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,652
-Hi, Yu-mi.
-<i>It's me. Is your shift over?</i>

289
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,985
Yes, the manager just arrived.
I'll be off soon.

290
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,319
Why?

291
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,946
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>
<i>I want to have dinner with you.</i>

292
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,874
Dinner?

293
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,002
I have a lot of studying to do today.

294
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,957
<i>It's our seven-year anniversary.</i>

295
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,591
-<i>You'll make your girlfriend eat alone?</i>
-No,

296
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,756
of course I'll join you.

297
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,048
Sure thing.

298
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:12,762
Got it.

299
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,563
<i>I've been studying for years</i>
<i>to find a job.</i>

300
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,441
<i>puts a toll on your finances.</i>

301
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,980
<i>My part-time job</i>
<i>couldn't even cover the rent</i>

302
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,990
<i>and soon it became harder for me</i>
<i>to meet up with my girlfriend.</i>

303
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,199
<i>SSANGKWANJANG</i>

304
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,408
Promise me that you'll take one
every day until the interview.

305
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
Sure. Thanks again.

306
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,325
I was too busy studying
to buy you a present.

307
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,751
Don't sweat it.

308
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,286
Dinner will be on me though.

309
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,292
We're here.

310
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,247
Hold on.

311
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,207
Is this where we're going?

312
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,466
The place is all over social media.

313
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,336
Really?

314
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,968
STIR-FRIED OCTOPUS
23,000 WON PER PERSON

315
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,972
You love spicy food too. Come on.

316
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,723
What's wrong?

317
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,178
Are you sick?

318
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,228
My stomach has been acting up lately.

319
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,484
I don't think I can eat
anything spicy today.

320
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,188
Byeong-jae?

321
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:16,864
It's good to see you.

322
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,368
Has it been two years
since our study group?

323
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,292
Sounds about right.

324
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,039
We're here to eat too, so join us.

325
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,003
I'm sorry, but you caught us
on our way out.

326
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,590
Really? That's too bad.

327
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,839
Where did you say you worked again?

328
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,513
Well...

329
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,591
Are you still searching?

330
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,973
Sangil Hotel.

331
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,968
The results will be announced soon.

332
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,726
We'll get together once they're out.

333
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,019
Sure, we'll meet up then.

334
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,396
Let's head inside.

335
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,355
Byeong-jae, let's go.

336
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,371
Come on.

337
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,667
Gosh, it's good.

338
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,957
-Why aren't you eating? It's delicious.
-Nothing.

339
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,128
I just have an upset stomach, that's all.
You go ahead.

340
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,318
What a good-looking couple.
We offer cheap rooms.

341
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,624
Will you be staying overnight
or for a few hours?

342
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,368
We were just passing through.

343
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,410
Come on, brother.
I can tell you don't have a lot of money,

344
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,502
so let me offer you something cheap.

345
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,463
Will you let your girlfriend down?

346
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,050
What? It's just...

347
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,926
I am kind of tired today though.
Maybe it's the heels,

348
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,972
but my legs feel bloated.

349
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:02,932
Really?

350
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,971
-Why didn't you tell me sooner?
-Well...

351
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,015
Come on. I'll take you home.

352
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,059
What? Byeong-jae, come on.

353
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,135
I mean...

354
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,194
you've been under a lot of stress lately,

355
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,316
so it doesn't seem

356
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,154
like a bad idea
to squeeze in some shut-eye.

357
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,737
Here you go.

358
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,084
I have a lot to go over tonight.

359
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,699
Books aren't the only source of education.

360
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,456
Life lessons are taught
in these alleys every day.

361
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,039
Everyone knows that these places

362
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,665
offer more insight than schools.

363
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,002
That's enough.

364
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,797
-Let's go.
-But...

365
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,347
They used to say
that you can't put a price on love.

366
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,679
I guess it's no longer true these days.

367
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,394
We're offering cheap rooms tonight!

368
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,062
Still, when you're young you should...

369
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,942
Right. It must've been hard for you two.

370
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,189
I feel

371
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,155
bad for her.

372
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,663
Because she's dating me,
she has to be self-conscious all the time.

373
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,994
What kind of a man

374
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,537
doesn't have the money
to buy his girlfriend stir-fried octopus?

375
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,052
You applied for a job
at Sangil Hotel for three years?

376
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
Yes.

377
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,128
Working there is a dream
for people who studied hotel management.

378
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,684
It's a public enterprise

379
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,973
and has a decent salary.

380
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,139
Why couldn't you settle on a job
that had less competition?

381
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,145
You wasted all those years
because of your greed.

382
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,937
I could have settled on a lesser job.

383
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,565
But most people who do quit
after four to five years.

384
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,452
Once you're 40,

385
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,030
you have to worry about
when you'll get the boot.

386
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,662
I have to get married, have kids,
and save up for when I retire.

387
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,213
Finding a lesser job won't cut it.

388
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,750
Right, everyone has it hard these days.

389
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,455
I know because I saved a couple of people

390
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,416
who tried to commit suicide
after their companies went under.

391
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,176
So? What happened with the job?

392
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,307
Well, I aced the written exam

393
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,103
and I thought I had nailed the interview.

394
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,280
SANGIL HOTEL HR DEPARTMENT

395
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,115
THE RESULTS OF THE SANGIL HOTEL
OPEN RECRUITMENT FOR 2020

396
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,629
WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO RECRUIT YOU

397
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,071
YU-MI'S MOTHER

398
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,736
You're a sweet boy with a good heart

399
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,870
and that's why I saw a future in you.

400
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,370
But I see no end to the tunnel you're in.

401
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:20,995
I'm sorry.

402
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,628
I'm just worried that Yu-mi might end up
wasting all of her good days

403
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:31,717
to take care of her boyfriend.

404
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:35,352
I hope you don't take this personally.

405
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,096
This is how any mother would feel.

406
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,688
I'll leave then. Goodbye.

407
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,083
What's the occasion?

408
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,535
Is it to celebrate your new job?

409
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,169
Let's talk after we eat.

410
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,053
You got it, right? You got the job.

411
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,759
I knew you would get it. Congratulations.

412
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,352
I didn't get it.

413
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,312
What?

414
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,676
I didn't get the job.

415
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,061
Yu-mi.

416
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,653
I want to break up.

417
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,612
You should date other men.

418
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,622
I can't do this any longer.

419
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,867
What are you talking about?

420
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,583
Aren't you sick and tired?

421
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,173
"Let's go someplace nice when I get a job.
Let's have an expensive meal then.

422
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,340
We should get matching rings
when I get a job.

423
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,298
Once I get a job, let's do this and that.

424
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,422
Once I get a job..."

425
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,181
We've been saying that for three years.

426
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,013
The sooner I let you go,
the better it is for you.

427
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,428
That's the least I can do for you.

428
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,265
That doesn't make any sense.

429
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,770
Is it because you didn't get the job?

430
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,769
I understand that it's tough for you.

431
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,574
Let's not do this.

432
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,953
I'm going to be by your side
whether you get the job or not.

433
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,696
You've been through a lot to date
a guy like me. Thank you.

434
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,292
Thank you.

435
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,582
But when I'm with you,

436
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,007
it makes me feel pathetic and useless.

437
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,892
I can't date you anymore.

438
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,175
I'm sorry. Bye.

439
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,518
Byeong-jae!

440
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,002
Hey, Byeong-jae.

441
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,384
I got it. Fine. I'll move out, man!

442
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,589
No.

443
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,836
I wanted to let you know
that I got the rent.

444
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,586
Some girl came by and paid it yesterday.

445
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,091
She paid all the rent you owe
plus this month's.

446
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,467
I think she said her name was Yu-mi.

447
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,524
<i>So I broke up with her.</i>

448
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,694
<i>It was actually my pride that made me</i>
<i>feel pathetic and useless.</i>

449
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,653
<i>I couldn't accept that</i>
<i>and ended up hurting Yu-mi.</i>

450
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,411
<i>She was a really kind girlfriend</i>
<i>who always put me ahead of herself.</i>

451
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,040
Hey, this is so sad.

452
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,512
It's heartbreaking.

453
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,675
Why does love always hurt so much?

454
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,725
If love hurts too much,

455
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,942
it wasn't love.

456
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,645
It sounds like
you've been hurt by love before.

457
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,076
Go on. Embarrass yourself some more.

458
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,539
No.

459
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,079
Not me.

460
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,706
I was thinking about my friend.

461
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,617
So tell me.

462
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,418
Is your wish to get back together
with your girlfriend?

463
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,382
No.

464
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,632
I didn't get the job.
How could I want that?

465
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,966
Nothing would change
even if we got back together.

466
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,891
Then what is it?

467
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,219
I at least want to know
why I didn't get the job.

468
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,925
I thought I did everything I can,
but I don't know what the problem was.

469
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,266
I have to know so that I can try again.

470
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,991
Then, I can go back to Yu-mi
without feeling sorry for myself.

471
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,361
That's simple. It's a piece of cake.

472
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,319
Pardon?

473
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,408
It's nothing.

474
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,867
I want to pour you this drink
to cheer you up.

475
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:52,753
Take it.

476
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,707
Thank you.

477
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,770
If I know why,

478
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,647
I'm sure I'll...

479
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:31,327
Please introduce yourselves in English.

480
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,501
-Mr. Han Kang-bae.
-Yes?

481
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,000
Me? Must I do that, too?

482
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,045
If you don't want to, why are you here?

483
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,208
Please leave
if you don't want to participate.

484
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,969
INTERVIEWER

485
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,554
No, I'll do it.

486
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,351
Gosh, an introduction...

487
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,819
His level is elementary.

488
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,155
It's not that bad.
It's easy to understand.

489
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,153
Awesome.

490
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,157
-Is that all?
-Yes.

491
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,035
Excellent, indeed.

492
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,796
I can sense your confidence
just from a single sentence.

493
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,630
Simple is the best. Yes.

494
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:12,311
All right. Please tell us
about our hotel's characteristics

495
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,178
and its unique selling points.

496
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,847
Sangil Hotel is the best tourist hotel

497
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,935
that features a casino, water park,
and a full-scale concert venue.

498
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,321
This is an achievement of Sangil Hotel

499
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,778
whose vision is to expand the hotel

500
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,359
into a landmark
for culture, leisure, and entertainment.

501
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,355
As a future employee of Sangil,

502
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,077
I would like to lead tourism and culture.

503
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,529
Thank you.

504
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,129
Well,

505
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,918
I...

506
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,425
I agree with him.

507
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,724
My goodness. What a weirdo.

508
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,812
All right. What about you,
Mr. Byun Sang-ho?

509
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,404
I don't know much about the hotel,

510
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,402
but the food here is good.

511
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,778
Who is this idiot?

512
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,781
Impressive, indeed.
He knows what's important.

513
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,123
Of course.

514
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:16,195
He's the ideal type of person
that Sangil wants to hire.

515
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,333
Something doesn't add up.

516
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,417
He killed that interview.

517
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,962
It doesn't matter if he did well.
Those jerks weren't even listening to him.

518
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,591
I heard the other applicants talking
on the phone in the restroom.

519
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,296
They said this was only a formality.
They said their parents got them the jobs.

520
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:40,386
This definitely looks suspicious,
but how deep do you think it goes?

521
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,519
Does Byeong-jae have any other memories
regarding Sangil Hotel?

522
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,025
We need to dig a bit more.

523
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,204
Please stop.

524
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,115
I just want to talk to HR
about the interview.

525
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,415
I said no.

526
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,498
<i>The results are out.</i>
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

527
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,634
What's going on?

528
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,711
He probably wasn't
recruited for the opening.

529
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,466
I don't know if he's dense or naive.

530
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,678
How could he apply
without having a connection?

531
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,299
Why not? You don't need
a connection to get a job here.

532
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,136
Even if he does,

533
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,641
he'll end up breaking his back
and never get promoted.

534
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,978
I heard a son of an assemblyman
was hired this year.

535
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,861
There's more. A prosecutor's daughter and
niece of a newspaper agency's director.

536
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,689
-All of them had impressive connections.
-All of them?

537
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,862
Then, did all the new hires
have connections?

538
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,743
So they all got the job based on favors?

539
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,405
They never hired employees
based on grades anyway.

540
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,325
Come on, this isn't your first day here.

541
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,750
But who are you?
I've never seen you around here.

542
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,211
I...

543
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,171
<i>The Chairman is coming.</i>

544
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,505
-Hey, let's go.
-Hurry.

545
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,973
Sir! I applied for an entry-level job
this year. I'm Park Byeong-jae.

546
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,635
I would like to know
why I didn't get the job.

547
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,023
I just want to know why I didn't get it.

548
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,070
What is the requirement for passing?

549
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,608
Sir! Please!

550
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,281
He was born a failure.

551
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,361
What can I do?

552
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,986
He has no one to blame but his parents.

553
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,462
<i>Please! Please I'm begging you.</i>

554
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,580
I told you no.

555
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,957
What is all this fuss about
at this late hour?

556
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,507
Lord, my mother has been murdered.

557
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,509
Someone set the temple on fire
and stabbed...

558
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,295
Please find the culprit!

559
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,682
Perhaps it happened
because she deserved it.

560
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,138
How could you say such a thing?

561
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,557
An innocent woman was wrongfully murdered.

562
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,727
No.

563
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,362
Not everyone is born equal.

564
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,525
Must my sleep be interrupted
because a mere shaman died?

565
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,164
What?

566
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,159
"A mere shaman"?

567
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,959
How can you say that?

568
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,921
A woman died.

569
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,709
A woman died!

570
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,252
You bitch.

571
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,385
You have no one to blame
but your ancestors.

572
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,928
Your mother who is low of birth.

573
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:25,017
And all of her ancestors
that came before her.

574
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,482
You shouldn't have been born
in such a vile family.

575
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:31,903
Am I right?

576
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,777
Don't just stand there.
Get her out of here.

577
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,071
-Yes, lord.
-Yes, lord.

578
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,324
-Get out.
-Let go of me!

579
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,076
-Get out of here.
-Get off me! Let go!

580
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,695
-My gosh. Just get out of here.
-Let go!

581
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,365
-Bitch.
-Goodness.

582
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,653
Hey, wake up. Wake up now.

583
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,202
I must have fallen asleep. I'm sorry.

584
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,281
That's fine.

585
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,699
Do you recognize him?

586
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,959
Yes. He was at the interview with me.

587
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,090
He made a social media post
that he got the job at Sangil.

588
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,881
He got the job?

589
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,165
It makes no sense.

590
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,547
Yes, it does. Why? Look.

591
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,513
He's the son of an assemblyman.

592
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:47,224
Doesn't it look like his father is chummy
with the chairman of Sangil?

593
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,811
You never had a fair chance at the job.

594
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,023
Do you get it?

595
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,523
No. How could this be?

596
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,478
But Sangil Hotel is a public enterprise.

597
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:58,935
This makes no sense.

598
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,236
No, it doesn't.

599
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,028
The thing is
that some things in this world

600
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,451
don't make sense.

601
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,290
Then,

602
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:15,375
you're saying that hundreds of applicants
including myself were just fillers.

603
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,545
And I made my parents and my ex-girlfriend

604
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,010
go through all that trouble
when I was just a filler.

605
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,346
Byeong-jae, you at least know that
it wasn't because you were lacking.

606
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,144
It'd be better

607
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,102
if I wasn't good enough for the job.

608
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,194
To fix this,

609
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,935
I would have to die and be born again.

610
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,907
Why is it so hard to get a goddamn job?

611
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,170
Ms. Weol-ju.

612
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,589
You startled me.

613
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,587
Be ready tomorrow.

614
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,847
Be ready? Be ready for what?

615
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,099
-Sangil Hotel.
-To help Byeong-jae?

616
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,810
What do I need to do?
Just tell me what to do.

617
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,603
You really shouldn't.

618
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,936
If you want him to be punished for it,
we need to secure evidence.

619
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,823
You know that we can't solve this problem
by doing a few tricks in the Dream World.

620
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,322
Politicians and businessmen
are involved in this, too.

621
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,164
Do you want to turn this country
inside out just to help him?

622
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,161
I don't care who's involved.

623
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,582
I don't care if this country
is turned inside out.

624
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,411
That bastard, Chairman Choi.

625
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,581
I'll deal with him myself.

626
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,959
What are you talking about?

627
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,126
I can't do it.

628
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,719
Please get me another client.

629
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,679
I don't want to waste my talent.

630
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,839
"Waste your talent"?

631
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,047
Have you been working for free?

632
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,967
Have they been paying you
with toilet paper instead of money?

633
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,727
Chairman Choi is a criminal.

634
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,059
The people who really to be protected
are his victims.

635
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,442
How can I keep guarding him knowing this?

636
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,863
I cannot work
while cheating my conscience.

637
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,112
I can neither eat nor sleep
because of this.

638
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,244
Kang Yeo-rin.

639
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,700
I've been nice to you because you're good.
But you may have the wrong idea.

640
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,874
You're not a police officer,
you're a bodyguard.

641
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,412
A bodyguard who protects a client
in exchange for money.

642
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,327
People like Chairman Choi
are our clients and our meal tickets!

643
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,587
-But at least...
-Can you pay for breaching the contract?

644
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,512
Come on.

645
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,549
If you're a professional, act like one.

646
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,473
Don't cause trouble and do your job
until the contract is over.

647
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,008
Got it?

648
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,081
What? I said no interruptions!

649
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,307
Wait,

650
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,314
I didn't order any drinks.

651
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,402
We happen to receive
a very special bottle of liquor.

652
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,695
I brought it here because I personally
wanted to serve you a glass.

653
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,872
It's on the house.

654
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,122
My gosh.

655
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,665
Is that so?

656
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,457
All right. Why don't I have one?

657
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,491
Hello, sir.

658
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,866
Don't you have a meeting this afternoon
with Assemblyman Byun?

659
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,044
Yes. Right.

660
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,120
I needed to grab something.

661
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,422
Wait. I don't think I've seen him before.

662
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,420
Where's Ms. Kang Yeo-rin?

663
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,087
What? Well,

664
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:37,142
I see. I heard he's better than her,
so I hired him instead.

665
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,273
Look at him.
Doesn't he look strong and reliable?

666
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,725
Yes, he sure does.

667
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,323
All right. Let's get going.

668
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,985
Hello, sir.

669
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,742
Hello. Thank you for your hard work.

670
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,208
Well, let's see.

671
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,420
Which floor

672
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,554
was my office on?

673
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,218
Pardon?

674
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,302
I'm sorry. I'll press it for you.

675
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,316
Excuse me.

676
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,204
Where's this onion smell coming from?

677
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,087
Wow.

678
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:03,428
Oh, my.

679
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,484
Goodness.

680
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:10,725
By the way, you really look like him.

681
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:12,779
Right?

682
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,026
But I can't hold this appearance for long.

683
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,244
It drains my energy.

684
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,880
My gosh, it feels tight.

685
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,915
-It's amazing, huh?
-I can't believe what I just saw.

686
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,223
By the way, any word from Weol-ju?

687
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,302
No, not yet. Did something happen?

688
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,398
Sir. A suspicious individual
has entered the hotel.

689
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,645
The individual
might be after the VIP list.

690
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,154
What?

691
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:12,002
What is this? Look at this.
What was my security team doing?

692
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,427
Ms. Kang.

693
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,982
Browse the security footage
and catch the intruder.

694
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,812
Yes, sir.

695
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,110
Could someone have
switched out the flash drive?

696
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,316
-Would you like to check?
-Yes. Give it here.

697
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,208
What? Who's waking him up?

698
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,125
<i>Sir.</i>

699
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,418
<i>Sir!</i>

700
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,217
-Sir
-Yes?

701
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,931
-Sir.
-Hey. You.

702
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,215
Who are you?

703
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,305
And what about you?

704
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,563
He's taking a nap.
You shouldn't wake him up like that.

705
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,690
What did you put in his food?

706
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,350
So what?

707
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,228
He does whatever he wants
with other people's lives.

708
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,937
-Sir. Please wake up.
-Yes.

709
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,198
Seriously? I told you not to wake him up.

710
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,617
Look at you. It's been a while
since I've had a good fight.

711
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:31,874
What's going on?

712
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,711
Why is it so loud?

713
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,791
-Sir.
-What?

714
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,464
Yes. It's in a book.
There's a USB flash drive in the book.

715
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,416
But I couldn't see the title of the book.

716
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,217
He woke up now. So make it quick.

717
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,848
It's not here.

718
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,874
-Goodness.
-Damn it.

719
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,997
Hello, sir. What?

720
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,000
Sir, you went up to your office
just a while ago.

721
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,705
What? Who went up to my office?

722
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,916
You went up to your office, sir.

723
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,133
But here you are again.

724
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,048
What are you talking about?
Send my bodyguards upstairs now.

725
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,177
Okay.

726
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,481
My goodness. What's going on?

727
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,192
Hey.

728
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,898
I found it.

729
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,278
We found it.

730
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,657
<i>Hey, hurry!</i>

731
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,655
What's that sound?

732
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,366
What should we do now?

733
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:58,456
-Run.
-Hurry up.

734
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,205
Damn it.

735
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,853
There must have been a misunderstanding.

736
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,258
I came to the wrong room.

737
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,314
Don't just stand there. Get him!

738
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,043
Catch him! Catch him or you're all fired!

739
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,224
My gosh, where did he run off to?

740
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,315
Oh, my gosh!

741
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,447
Give me back the thing
you stole from this room.

742
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,090
We're on the same side.

743
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,378
My gosh.

744
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,719
I'm sorry!

745
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,430
Where are you going?

746
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,569
-What are you...
-It's okay.

747
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,534
Tell me what's on your mind.

748
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,414
What do you think you're doing?

749
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,245
You just heard a bell ring, didn't you?

750
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,261
It's okay. I'm ready to hear you out.
Go ahead and tell me.

751
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,629
Go on. Go ahead.

752
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,507
What bell, you pervert?

753
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,483
What are you doing?
I said you can tell me everything.

754
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,770
Tell you what?

755
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,272
Just give me what you stole.

756
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,645
That's weird.
You're supposed to feel something.

757
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,193
-Didn't you feel anything?
-Cut the crap.

758
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,317
You can't just touch me
all over the place.

759
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,605
No, not there.

760
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,487
Stay still if you don't want
to fracture a bone.

761
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,170
Do you even know what that is?

762
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:48,378
It's evidence to prove that the chairman
hired people based on connections.

763
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,472
Every new recruit this year was hired
because of their connections.

764
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,804
We're just trying to expose that.

765
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,974
We're doing it for a good cause.

766
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,053
My job

767
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,061
is to protect my client
and his belongings.

768
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:04,518
<i>Ms. Kang, we lost the guy. What about you?</i>

769
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,063
-I just...
-Is it okay to ruin

770
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,936
people's lives as long as you get paid?

771
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,608
Are you willing to ruin lives
just so that you can protect your client?

772
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,317
A guy who graduated from college
as the top student

773
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,414
got a perfect score on the entrance exam,

774
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,241
and earned multiple qualifications
but he still wasn't hired.

775
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,365
He was born a failure.

776
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,456
What can I do?

777
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,996
He has no one to blame but his parents.

778
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,963
-Chairman, sir!
-<i>He was fooled by the chairman.</i>

779
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,296
He wasted years of his life

780
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,932
and lost someone he loved.

781
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:40,175
Is it your job to make sure that his life
remains in ruins?

782
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,143
Are you going to let the chairman
continue to ruin

783
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,845
thousands of other people's lives?
Is that your job?

784
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,310
<i>Ms. Kang.</i>

785
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,730
<i>Ms. Kang.</i>

786
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,855
With that, we can set things straight.

787
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,653
Please help us.

788
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,756
Are you giving me this?

789
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,849
You're going to let us do this?

790
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:28,984
Thank you.

791
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,819
Hey.

792
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,200
There's a stairway for employees
on the far left of the corridor.

793
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,287
Use that to open the door.

794
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,044
GANG HAN GUARD
KANG YEO-RIN

795
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,215
He's over there! Get him!

796
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,677
Over here to the left!

797
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,773
Kang-bae, get in.

798
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,146
Hey, stop!

799
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:13,816
Hurry up!

800
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:17,902
Stop!

801
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,700
Damn it.

802
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,123
<i>Did you really hire people unfairly?</i>

803
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,829
<i>How many did you hire unfairly?</i>

804
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,329
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>It's all a lie!</i>

805
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,463
<i>It's slander! It's a lie!</i>

806
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,708
SANGIL RAISES SUSPICIONS
OF UNFAIR RECRUITMENT

807
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:43,933
President Choi,
how could you let this go public?

808
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:47,312
I will hold you responsible if I don't
get elected because of this.

809
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,100
This is very upsetting.

810
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:54,395
You talked as if we were a family
when you asked me for favors.

811
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,941
As much as this is
a difficult situation for all of us,

812
00:53:58,026 --> 00:54:00,816
we should team up like a true family.

813
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,116
Don't you agree, sir?

814
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,907
I'll try to do what I can.

815
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,834
My grandson will be working there.

816
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,923
I can't let the company's reputation
go down the drain like this.

817
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,289
Thank you, sir.

818
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,086
Yes, of course.

819
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,423
Hey, it's me.

820
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,797
About the Sangil's
unfair recruitment issue...

821
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,505
Let's just cover it up.

822
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:29,721
Just say some guy who didn't get the job
got angry and made up a lie

823
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,268
to get back at the company.

824
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:34,021
Yes, that ought to do it. Okay.

825
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,070
Loyalty is thicker than blood.

826
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,822
This is what families are all about,
right?

827
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,622
Here you go. Drink up, everyone.

828
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,741
Cheers.

829
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:17,982

INCOMING CALL

860
00:56:58,998 --> 00:56:59,828
Hello?

861
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,086
<i>Hello, this is Sangil Hotel's Audit Team.</i>
<i>Are you Mr. Park Byeong-jae?</i>

862
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:03,999
Yes.

863
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,053
That's me.

864
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,221
<i>First, we'd like to apologize</i>
<i>for the unfair treatment you received</i>

865
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,760
<i>during the recruitment process.</i>

866
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:14,394
<i>We noticed that you didn't get hired</i>
<i>even though you got the highest score.</i>

867
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,684
<i>Therefore, HR has decided</i>

868
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,555
<i>to hire you right away</i>
<i>without any additional requirements.</i>

869
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,700
-Here.
-Okay.

870
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,067
It's delicious.

871
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,786
Do you see that?

872
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,542
I worked so hard to get him a job.

873
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,542
But he's eating at another restaurant.

874
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,544
Humans are unbelievable.

875
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,627
Cut him some slack.
You know why he wanted to eat there.

876
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,671
I have to say, I'm jealous.

877
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,181
They're able to connect with each other

878
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,219
just by holding hands.

879
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:56,103
Why are you jealous?

880
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:59,181
You can get people to open up to you
with even the slightest touch.

881
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,767
That's not what he meant.

882
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,812
He just wants to hold hands with a woman.

883
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,647
Oh, I see.

884
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,072
No, that wasn't my point.

885
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:13,823
I'm jealous that they can connect
without even having to talk.

886
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,367
People I come into contact with
tell me way too much.

887
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,457
But there are only seven more people to go
until I'm cured.

888
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,093
Right, Ms. Weol-ju?

889
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,134
Of course.

890
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,547
Hang in there, Kang-bae.

891
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:39,972
If you want to hold hands,
you can hold mine.

892
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,692
Should we lock fingers?

893
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:46,482
No, it's okay. No.

894
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,572
I'm not that desperate.

895
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,530
Why? You look very desperate.

896
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,070
-Come here. I'll hold your hand.
-No, it's okay.

897
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,374
-Kang-bae.
-Look at Ms. Weol-ju!

898
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,871
Oh, my gosh.

899
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,493
Are you okay?

900
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,946
I'll hold your hand.

901
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,497
<i>When you run a race,</i>

902
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,291
<i>you either come in first, second, or last.</i>

903
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:10,046
<i>But it's important to have a fair start.</i>

904
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,877
<i>But you suffered because of those</i>
<i>who used money and power</i>

905
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,508
<i>to get a head start.</i>

906
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,522
<i>I bet you think it's all over</i>
<i>now that you got a job.</i>

907
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,640
<i>But this is only the beginning.</i>

908
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,190
<i>I hope you survive in this jungle.</i>

909
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:29,569
<i>You and your girlfriend</i>
<i>should support each other...</i>

910
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,779
<i>Or not. Whatever.</i>

911
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,280
Gosh, they need to take it down a notch.

912
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:38,834
They should just get a room.

913
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,828
Whatever. They're on their own now.

914
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,327
Hey! Wait for me!

915
00:59:54,382 --> 01:00:00,262
<i>You were born to peel onions</i>

916
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:05,978
<i>You are always peeling onions</i>
<i>throughout your entire life</i>

917
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,980
Kang-bae, what are you doing?

918
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,273
Get ready for business.
Don't zone out like that.

919
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,529
What's this?

920
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,873
GANG HAN GUARD
KANG YEO-RIN

921
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,618
Oh, right. I need to return this.

922
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,120
What?

923
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:23,995
Oh, the bodyguard?

924
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:26,078
Yes, I never even got to thank her.

925
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,421
It'll be dangerous to go back
to the hotel, right?

926
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,790
If you want to get stabbed, just tell me.

927
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,128
There's no need to go all the way there.

928
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,843
Exactly. I shouldn't go.

929
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,341
By the way,
I had a really weird experience.

930
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,807
I had a lot of physical contact
with that bodyguard, but she was fine.

931
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,809
Nothing happened after she touched you?

932
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,231
Are you sure?

933
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,519
Yes, I'm serious.

934
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,982
She touched here, here, and here...

935
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,647
Anyway, I've never met
someone like her before.

936
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:00,106
Maybe she's just free of worries.
She might not have had anything to say.

937
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,117
Do you think so?

938
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,499
GANG HAN GUARD
KANG YEO-RIN

939
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:09,959
Cheers to Kang Yeo-rin,
the apostle of justice!

940
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,005
Apostle of justice, my ass.

941
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,130
More like the apostle of unemployment.

942
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:22,467
Who knew they would have
the security footage of me letting him go?

943
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,723
I got fired right away.

944
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,101
You're competent enough
to find another job elsewhere.

945
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,063
You don't know what you're talking about.

946
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,862
They say I'm the bodyguard
who sent her client to jail.

947
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:35,649
My name is on the very top
of this industry's blacklist.

948
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,816
I have nowhere to go.

949
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,284
Darn it. I must've been crazy.

950
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,074
If it weren't for that guy...

951
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,834
Was he handsome?

952
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,579
-If he was able to convince you...
-No way.

953
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,422
He looked so common, and he's so clumsy.

954
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,665
He's nowhere near my type. Never.

955
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,837
You've never even dated anyone before.

956
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,803
You might not know your type yet.

957
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,723
Why do you have to hurt me like that?

958
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,892
Weren't you here to console me?

959
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,142
Sorry.

960
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,060
But I'm still very proud of you.

961
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,692
You saved so many people's lives.

962
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:18,066
I saved other people's lives
only to ruin mine.

963
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:21,526
All my life, all I've ever done
was sports and martial arts.

964
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:24,872
How am I going to make a living
now that I can no longer be a bodyguard?

965
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,409
I really have no idea.

966
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,789
KAPEUL MART

967
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,709
Why can't I get a refund?

968
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:40,255
I bought this two days ago!

969
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:44,215
I'm sorry, sir. You lost the receipt,
so we need to check...

970
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,802
Do you think I'm lying?

971
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,598
Do I need to get aggressive with you?

972
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,444
I didn't want to do this,
but you're making me get physical.

973
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,190
You darn little...

974
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,254
<i>Dream World's true or false quiz!</i>

975
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,790
<i>-May the best dead win!</i>
<i>-May the best dead win!</i>

976
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,714
People who won lotteries
after they dreamed of their ancestors

977
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:02,554
are all descendants of the people
who won the Lottery Battle.

978
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,800
My dear, your suffering is over at last.

979
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,472
My goodness gracious.

980
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,851
Choi Jin-dong is going to die?

981
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,848
Weol-ju, you're the only one
who can help...

982
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,350
I'm on a tight schedule myself.

983
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,852
I'm not a philanthropist
with time on my hands.

984
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:17,685
<i>Gosh, this is bad. We don't have time.</i>

985
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,310
<i>I'll stop Death from the outside.</i>

986
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,607
<i>You stay inside</i>
<i>and keep an eye on Choi Jin-dong.</i>

987
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,775
-What's going on?
-<i>One more written apology won't hurt.</i>

988
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:25,741
<i>You asked for it.</i>

989
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,659
<i>No!</i>

990
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,034
<i>Don't go.</i>
