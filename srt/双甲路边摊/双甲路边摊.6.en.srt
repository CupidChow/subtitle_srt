KAPEUL MART COUPLES DANCE COMPETITION

4
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,935
The winning couple
of the Kapeul Mart dance competition is...

5
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:10,651
Congratulations,
Han Kang-bae and Kang Yeo-rin!

6
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,160
-Yeo-rin, we did it.
-I know!

7
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,663
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

8
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,327
Congratulations.

9
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,009
What the hell?

10
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,470
What?

11
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,926
Yeo-rin?

12
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,426
Yeo-rin!

13
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:24,394
-Kiss him!
-Kiss him!

14
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:29,522
-Kiss him!
-Kiss him!

15
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:34,607
-Kiss him!
-Kiss him!

16
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,413
-Kiss him!
-Mr. Ma?

17
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,529
Mr. Ma, no!

18
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,366
-That happened in your dream?
-Yes.

19
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,829
And it was vivid.

20
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,625
The jade ring looked familiar too.

21
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,837
What do you think it means?
You're the expert in dreams.

22
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,800
It's obvious.

23
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,434
Isn't Mr. Ma the one
you find most difficult to deal with?

24
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,814
-Yes.
-Every time you see him,

25
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,730
your heart starts to race and you stutter

26
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,059
because you get anxious.

27
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,654
That's right. How did you know that?

28
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:15,989
Kang-bae,

29
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,742
there's no need to hide it anymore.

30
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,115
Just so you know,
I'm very open-minded when it comes

31
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,084
to one's sexual orientation.

32
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,997
You can relax.

33
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,714
What the hell are you saying?

34
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,918
Miss, is what he's saying true?

35
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,299
-It sounds like a conception dream.
-What? A conception dream?

36
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,802
You said you received a jade ring.

37
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,216
My mom dreamt of a jade ring
before she had me.

38
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:53,979
What?

39
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,777
What do you mean I appeared in your dream?
That hurts my ego.

40
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,742
EPISODE 6

41
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,871
Still, it's a good omen
to have received a jade ring.

42
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,582
Mr. Ma, you should buy
lottery tickets this week.

43
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,002
Don't be ridiculous.
Dreams like that mean nothing.

44
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,963
Right, I guess I was stressed
because of dance practice.

45
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,511
Yes, honey.

46
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,339
What? Really?

47
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,222
Are you kidding me? That's great news!

48
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,603
Okay, I'll be home early today.

49
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,809
My gosh.

50
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,188
-My wife's pregnant.
-No way.

51
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,265
Congratulations.

52
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,567
-Congrats.
-Congrats.

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,610
You'll be a father!

54
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,655
-See? What did I tell you about that ring?
-Was it really a conception dream?

55
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,198
Conception dreams can also be had
by people around you.

56
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,291
Then the jade ring...

57
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,907
Kang-bae,
your dance lessons start today, right?

58
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,618
Let me know if you need a break.

59
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,298
I'll supply you with unlimited snacks,
drinks, and meals.

60
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,973
Wait, you hate physical contact.

61
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,141
Then have a great day today.

62
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,890
I wish you the best.

63
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,310
-You too.
-Have a good day.

64
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:12,234
What conception dream did your mother have
when she conceived you?

65
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,614
My conception dream?

66
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,694
It was quite grand.

67
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,817
There was a vast field...

68
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,664
Move it back a little. Okay, now!

69
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,906
I can't believe you missed that.

70
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,417
Move over. Let me try.

71
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,796
That's odd. I thought I had it.

72
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,966
Hold on. Let me try it once more.

73
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,314
Can't we just go?
We have a lot to buy today.

74
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,773
I won't back down from a challenge.
Give me some cash.

75
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,280
Just a little.

76
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,112
A little to the front.

77
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,860
To the right.

78
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,414
The right!

79
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,043
How on earth can you miss that?

80
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,209
It's all in the flick of the wrist.

81
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,538
Flick. Like this.

82
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,876
Step aside. Now, watch.

83
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,628
Flick.

84
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:24,086
Just like this. There we go.
See how easy that was?

85
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,680
What the hell?

86
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,015
-Move.
-What?

87
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,057
-Come on!
-Okay!

88
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,853
-Come on up.
-Damn it!

89
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,018
I got it!

90
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,896
Excuse me, but I want to play too.

91
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,605
You're still here?

92
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,445
Go home and do your homework!

93
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,911
Yes, this isn't for kids. Go home.

94
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:49,831
Darn!

95
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,247
A bit more. You're almost there.

96
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,254
I got it...

97
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,088
Just a little bit more.

98
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,131
I got it this time.

99
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,474
Let's start with the basic steps.

100
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,687
Again.

101
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,071
-Mr. Han.
-Yes?

102
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,363
Focus.

103
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,074
Right hand and left foot.
Left hand and right foot.

104
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,447
Right hand and left foot.
Left hand and right foot.

105
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,253
Mr. Han!
Straighten your back, lift your chin,

106
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,541
and give me a strong gaze.

107
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,915
-Dancing is all about confidence.
-Okay.

108
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,552
We'll take it from the top.

109
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,044
You need to work out more.

110
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,170
You feel like your heart is bursting
from doing that?

111
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,508
That's right.
It's because I'm physically inept.

112
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,958
There's nothing more to it.

113
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,934
Ms. Kang, that'll be all for today.

114
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,547
-Mr. Han, not you though.
-Sorry?

115
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,927
Stick around for another 30 minutes.

116
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,641
I couldn't be more grateful.

117
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,345
Please teach him well.

118
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,021
I don't think
I need to stay behind though.

119
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,436
Yes, you do.

120
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,275
You can't take the stage in this state.

121
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,906
All you can do is work harder.

122
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,822
At least,
you can get better with practice.

123
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:59,038
That's hardly the case
with many other things in this world.

124
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,462
Sorry?

125
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,086
Sure, I'll stay behind.

126
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,641
Weol-ju, I need more money.

127
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:18,934
Don't you have any?

128
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,192
I spent all the money I had on me.

129
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,980
So what do we buy groceries with now?
I forgot to bring my credit card.

130
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,936
That's right.
We were going grocery shopping.

131
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,445
It's too late to go back now.

132
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,988
Let's borrow some from Kang-bae.

133
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,876
What are you doing? Take my hands.

134
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,296
Well...

135
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,260
Could you teach me the basic steps again?
I forgot them already.

136
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,852
All right.

137
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,757
Gosh.

138
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,228
-Look at him trying to avoid contact.
-Back step, back step, front stepâ€¦

139
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,440
Can we barge in
in the middle of a lesson?

140
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,899
Should we not open the bar then?

141
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,031
Just get in there and borrow the money.

142
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,781
Excuse me.

143
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,377
Are you all right?

144
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,747
I...

145
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,260
No matter how hard I try,
I can't get pregnant.

146
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,633
Sorry?

147
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,759
I've been receiving
infertility treatments for two years now.

148
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,432
Today

149
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,351
is the first day at work

150
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,688
after I gave up trying.

151
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,944
Two years is a long time.

152
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,236
At first,

153
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:01,036
the IVF process didn't even seem
like a hassle.

154
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,577
<i>I had hope that I would be pregnant soon.</i>

155
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,050
<i>I even quit my job</i>

156
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,929
<i>and focused solely on having a baby.</i>

157
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,021
<i>Not long after, a miracle happened.</i>

158
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,140
This is our baby.

159
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,604
Is this really...

160
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,232
<i>I felt like</i>
<i>someone had given me the universe.</i>

161
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,975
-My gosh!
-<i>The old saying was right.</i>

162
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,151
<i>Hard work really did pay off.</i>

163
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,786
<i>It seemed like it was all my fault.</i>

164
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:48,459
<i>Maybe it all went wrong</i>

165
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,504
<i>because I acted too hastily.</i>

166
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,093
Maybe it's because<i> </i>I wasn't strong enough.

167
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,508
Maybe I was never

168
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,560
-meant to be a mother to begin with.
-Don't be ridiculous.

169
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,433
How is that your fault?

170
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,692
The doctor and my husband both said

171
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,357
that it wasn't anyone's fault.

172
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,900
But I didn't see it that way.

173
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,149
I felt defeated.

174
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,202
All I wanted

175
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,488
was to be a mother.

176
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,160
What? This fast?

177
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,503
It hasn't been that long
since the miscarriage.

178
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,792
Your body needs to rest.

179
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,214
I'm as good as new again.

180
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,884
I should get treatment again
so we can have a child.

181
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,433
Hello?

182
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,929
Yes.

183
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,068
I see.

184
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,277
Sure thing.

185
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,192
<i>I'd cry and cry</i>
<i>but the tears wouldn't stop pouring.</i>

186
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,361
<i>Going through that for two years</i>

187
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,283
<i>exhausted both me and my husband.</i>

188
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,264
-Where are you going?
-Where else? I'm off to buy tampons.

189
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,512
Let me come with you.

190
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,508
Why? Should we get a truck-load of tampons
since I can't get pregnant?

191
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,522
I know you're on edge about this,
but we knew it'd be an uphill battle.

192
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,729
You're acting like it's nothing
since you saw this coming?

193
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,361
I'm the only one
who's suffering every month.

194
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,609
Am I right?

195
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,727
Unbelievable.

196
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,850
Why aren't you asleep?

197
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:02,941
Su-gyeong,

198
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:10,076
-do we have to keep doing this?
-What do you mean?

199
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,500
I'm worried that this might destroy you.

200
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,875
-It's all right.
-It's not.

201
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,959
You are exhausted.

202
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,679
Physically and emotionally.

203
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,391
Su-gyeong.

204
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,098
What matters most is us.

205
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,444
We come first and then the baby.

206
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,066
For two years, we tried our best.

207
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,946
When was the last time
we laughed with each other

208
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,319
or had a pleasant conversation?

209
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,487
I don't want a baby anymore

210
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,416
if it means I have to watch you
suffer like this.

211
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,999
I'm exhausted and scared, too.

212
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,468
I feel like a terrible wife.

213
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,933
And I'm terrified
of not being able to live like others.

214
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,267
Don't be silly.

215
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,274
We can build a life that's ours.

216
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,024
I know it will be hard

217
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,660
but let's end it here.

218
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,121
Let's do that.

219
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,747
That's what we promised,

220
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,835
but I don't know
if I made the right choice.

221
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,136
You still want to have a child.

222
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,427
Of course it isn't easy.

223
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,524
It's not something
you can give up on that easy.

224
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,729
How silly of me.

225
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,283
I can't believe I talked
about my personal life on the first day.

226
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:10,895
I'm sorry.

227
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,493
There's no need to be.

228
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,703
You need to talk about it to move on.

229
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:19,794
Here you go.

230
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,464
Don't keep your sorrows bottled up inside

231
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,503
and come by whenever you want to.

232
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,841
We'll be all ears.

233
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,667
Thank you.

234
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,020
What a heartbreaking story.

235
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,847
I didn't expect that
from such a charismatic person.

236
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,305
Tell me about it.

237
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,362
So much for the gods.

238
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,609
I want to give her my conception dream,
but Mr. Ma took it.

239
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,074
The one with the jade ring?

240
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,657
Conception dreams
can't be traded like that.

241
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,121
Samsin just hands them the dream
after she sets everything up.

242
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,120
You two go to the bar without me.
I need to go somewhere.

243
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,003
What? Where are you off to?

244
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,727
Samsin!

245
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,899
Samsin!

246
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,789
Where is she?

247
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,206
CONCEPTION DREAM CHAMBER

248
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,276
-Samsin!
-What the hell?

249
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,002
My gosh, you made me drop it!

250
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,578
I was only greeting you.

251
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,212
I told you not to bother me
when I'm getting conception dream marbles.

252
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,464
This requires delicate handling, you know.
My gosh!

253
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:47,636
Nice!

254
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,729
No way. Like always, you're the best.

255
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,405
This is my pick for today.

256
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:11,876
Samsin.

257
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,881
I have a favor to ask.

258
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,844
Of course.
Why else would you come to see me?

259
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,215
Selfish as always.

260
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,012
I'm busy, so next time.

261
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,894
Come on. Please.

262
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,980
DREAM WORLD

263
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,840
I'm sure she's around here somewhere.

264
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,415
Who?

265
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:00,215
I know almost everyone here,
so let me help.

266
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,970
You've only spent 500 years
going in and out of this place.

267
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,142
I've been delivering conception dreams
for 5,000 years.

268
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,063
-Don't get cheeky with me.
-Right.

269
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,691
I guess you're right.

270
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,271
There she is.

271
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,114
Sweetie.

272
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,277
-Me?
-Yes, you.

273
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,738
Show me your hands.

274
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,661
Why?

275
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,367
Here you go.

276
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,748
Hold on. Are these walnuts?

277
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,171
Yes, they're your future children,

278
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,711
so raise them well.

279
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,168
Just a second.

280
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,086
Thanks for the gift,

281
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,136
but does this mean I'll have a baby boy?

282
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,433
You'll have to give birth to them to know.

283
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:49,434
Can I get a different one?

284
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,726
You want to swap them?

285
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,897
Yes, I want to have daughters, you see.

286
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,073
You can't trade
or return conception dreams.

287
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,027
Kids these days have too many requests.

288
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:03,953
Forget it.

289
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,070
Take what I give you.

290
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,622
You have no idea how exhausting it is
to bless people with offsprings.

291
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,293
-I'd like iced coffee.
-Hot coffee for me.

292
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,835
-I'll get this.
-Now you're scaring me.

293
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,506
I'd rather pay for my own coffee.

294
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,550
Don't be ridiculous.

295
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,433
You're a hero
tackling the issue of low birth rate.

296
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,601
Treating you to coffee
is the least I can do.

297
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:32,934
Is that so? Then can I also take
the coupons for myself?

298
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,228
Yes, of course.

299
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,645
You can also have the ones
I collected so far.

300
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,442
No way. You collected five already?

301
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,697
You must have one hell of a favor.

302
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,485
Tell me. What do you need?

303
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,289
Well, it's nothing big really.

304
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,128
Could you give me a conception dream?

305
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,050
What? You want what?

306
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,799
Since young people these days refuse
to have kids,

307
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,643
I figured you could have a spare marble
for me to give out.

308
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,599
There's a married couple who needs help.

309
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,560
Help?

310
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,811
-What are their names?
-Chae Su-gyeong and Kang In-ho.

311
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,609
All right.

312
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,572
I don't see any babies
for this couple yet.

313
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,034
I wouldn't be asking for a favor
if they had been.

314
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,329
-Can't you just give them...
-Hey!

315
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,000
Blessing people with children
isn't a game, you know.

316
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,543
That's preposterous!

317
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:43,585
All parents are blessed with children
in their own good time.

318
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,589
It's not their turn yet.

319
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,551
When will it be then?
At least tell me that much.

320
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,679
How should I know?
That's up to those above.

321
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,101
Come on.

322
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,564
You're being ridiculous.

323
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,693
Could there be a better moment
than when a couple desires a baby

324
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,311
and is ready to raise one?

325
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,648
Couples who aren't ready
conceive all the time, so cut the crap.

326
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,609
Come by sometime.

327
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,105
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

328
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,616
-Drinks and snacks are on the house.
-Okay.

329
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,126
Please come by sometime.

330
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,683
Stop by sometime.

331
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,564
Where were you? We were busy.

332
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,768
Did you have dinner?

333
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,231
Let's go in.

334
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,898
After hundreds of years,
here we are again.

335
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,576
You're here.

336
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,498
Have you been well?

337
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,712
You seem to have recovered
from your illness. I'm relieved.

338
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,830
Yes, thanks to your concern.

339
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,378
Are you sure?

340
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,474
It's okay. You can relax.

341
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,678
This is an old friend of mine.

342
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,385
My name is Kim Won-hyung.

343
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,227
He is the only person I can open up to,
so I've wanted to introduce you to him.

344
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,030
We studied together as children,

345
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,241
and we're like brothers.
You don't have to worry.

346
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:33,913
I see.

347
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,250
This is Weol-ju,

348
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,615
the lady I told you about before.

349
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,172
What do you think? Isn't she beautiful?

350
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,836
Your Highness.

351
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:52,631
Yes, now I can see
why you fell in love with her.

352
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,678
I knew you'd understand, Won-hyung.

353
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,898
How are you?

354
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,315
Your old friend is finally here,

355
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,196
Your Highness.

356
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,659
You asked her
for a conception dream marble?

357
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,828
You're unbelievable.

358
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,586
Do you expect her to give you that?

359
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,798
What could I do?
I had to ask at the least.

360
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,724
-Maybe I should have just stolen one.
-Forget it.

361
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,718
That counts as a special theft.

362
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,046
Yes, it does sound dangerous.

363
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,434
Didn't you say you'd kill me
if I steal <i>ssanggapju</i> again?

364
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,055
Did I? Shut up.

365
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,392
"Shut up"?

366
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,515
"Kill"?

367
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,645
-Kill who?
-Well, nothing.

368
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,186
There are so many flies these days.

369
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,395
I'll kill them all.

370
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,204
-Hello, Yeombujang.
-Hi.

371
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:02,623
I hope you guys
aren't up to anything stupid.

372
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,668
Gosh, I'm hungry.
Can I get a bowl of udon?

373
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,959
Udon? Sure.

374
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,382
You haven't eaten yet?
Give him some pickled radishes.

375
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,764
Don't get me started.

376
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:16,299
Not a day goes by without trouble
in the Afterlife.

377
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,840
Wait.

378
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,853
Hello. Yes.

379
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,639
What? Someone escaped again?

380
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,314
This is driving me crazy.

381
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,767
Well,

382
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,028
there's no one who can help me
over here either.

383
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,398
All right, I get it.

384
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,025
Just send me some information
on the spirit that got away.

385
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,236
-Okay.
-Is it another evil spirit?

386
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,405
Where is he?

387
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,413
Finish your udon and leave.

388
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,582
We're in a hurry too. Do you understand?

389
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,745
We could settle a grudge
of a wandering ghost,

390
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,003
but for an evil spirit,
you just lock it up.

391
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,919
Still, he'sÂ around here somewhere.

392
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,679
-He's nearby?
-Stop.

393
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,675
Well...

394
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,777
Spin around.

395
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,373
Yeo-rin?

396
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,495
Gosh!

397
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,509
-What were you doing?
-You startled me.

398
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,183
What would Yeo-rin be doing
in the men's room?

399
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,972
It's nothing.
I thought I saw her for a second.

400
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,266
You're already seeing things?

401
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,477
I guess you have to hold hands
and make eye contact

402
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,864
while dancing with her all the time.

403
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,901
No wonder you start having feelings.

404
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,235
But she could even take down a bull
by herself. Will you be okay?

405
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,360
A bull?

406
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,776
What are you talking about?

407
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,495
You have no idea how cute,

408
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,458
<i>feminine,</i>

409
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,876
and lovely

410
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,720
she is.

411
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,223
Feminine and lovely?
Are we talking about the same person?

412
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,096
You must really like her.

413
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:29,847
All right.

414
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,015
Good luck.

415
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,515
I guess a workplace romance
has its charms.

416
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,532
A workplace...

417
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,534
A workplace

418
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:42,911
romance?

419
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,366
A workplace romance?

420
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,173
A workplace romance.

421
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,960
Yeo-rin.

422
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,263
Yeo-rin.

423
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,638
How did the extra lesson go?

424
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,637
I hope you've mastered
the basic steps by now.

425
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:09,887
It went well.

426
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,938
I've been practicing on my own too.
I'm a little better now.

427
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,059
A "little better" won't do.
Do you remember our goal?

428
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,687
-First place.
-Yes, first place.

429
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,067
See you.

430
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,065
Speaking of our goal,

431
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,700
what are you doing tomorrow?
It's our day off.

432
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,949
Why?

433
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,669
To win first place,
in addition to dancing well,

434
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,464
-we should wear the right costumes.
-Costumes?

435
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,335
Here we go.

436
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,716
Ta-da.

437
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,389
Ta-da.

438
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,611
Ta-da.

439
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,666
I don't think these are really my style.

440
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,671
I'll just wear a simple black dress.

441
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,341
No. You look great.
You look absolutely gorgeous.

442
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,429
You look beautiful in this.

443
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:27,928
Sir, would you like
to try something on too?

444
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,140
Ta-da.

445
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,265
This was made to go with that dress.

446
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,704
Oh my. Unbelievable.

447
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,527
It looks great on you.

448
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,949
Try standing next to each other.

449
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,117
I want to see you two together.

450
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,119
Fantastic.

451
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,462
Sir.

452
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,804
Put your hands down.

453
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,594
Perfect. Let me take a picture of you.

454
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,675
Can you try doing a salsa move?

455
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,795
Here we go.

456
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,142
One, two, three.

457
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,858
-Should I carry that for you?
-No, I'm fine.

458
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,239
Where are you going?
I'm taking a bus across the street.

459
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,077
See you.

460
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,633
I almost forgot.

461
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,336
I happen to have some free movie tickets,

462
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,303
and they happen to expire today.

463
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,545
Wait, I happen to have

464
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,060
exactly two of them.

465
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,347
What should I do?

466
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,904
Since I happen to be with you,
should we go together?

467
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,361
Really?

468
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,200
They're out of caramel popcorn.

469
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,066
What movie are we watching?

470
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,906
<i>A Legend in Seclusion,</i> an action film.

471
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,872
I think you'll love it.

472
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,584
I hate that kind of movie.

473
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,504
Sorry?

474
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,329
Then what do you like?

475
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,630
That kind.

476
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,466
WHY DOES LOVE HAVE TO HURT
THE CLOSER WE GET?

477
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,251
-Gosh!
-That hurts!

478
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,052
-I'm sorry. I have gout.
-I'm sorry. I have gout.

479
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,684
You have gout too?

480
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,178
Goodness, you too?

481
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,355
Gosh! It's my gout.

482
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,408
That hurts!

483
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,469
My face!

484
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,718
What should we do?
Even my breath hurts you.

485
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,521
They say even the wind hurts
when you have gout.

486
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:05,732
Can we really

487
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,320
stay together?

488
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,395
We love each other so much.

489
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,611
Why can't we be close to each other?

490
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,561
<i>Let's break up.</i>

491
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,433
<i>I don't want to</i>

492
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,730
<i>hurt you anymore.</i>

493
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:53,359
<i>We can't even hug one last time,</i>
<i>can we?</i>

494
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:02,702
<i>THE GOUT LOVERS</i>

495
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,036
It's supposed to be a romantic comedy,

496
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,131
but I don't know what's funny about it.

497
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,505
It's the saddest movie I've ever seen.

498
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,720
The ending was tragic.

499
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,313
I understand how they would have felt
when they broke up.

500
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,346
When you know how much
the other is suffering

501
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,360
but can't do anything about it,

502
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,518
it's excruciating.

503
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,740
It's difficult

504
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,069
to be in love.

505
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,452
It's the hardest thing in the world.

506
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,982
So? You saw a movie together?

507
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,846
Yes, it would've been a shame
to waste those tickets.

508
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,477
Free tickets, my foot.

509
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,858
I told you he has a crush on you.

510
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,573
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE
FROM HAN KANG-BAE

511
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,333
-Aren't you going to read it?
-I'm too lazy.

512
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,327
Ridiculous. If you're too lazy to do this,
how do you even live?

513
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,915
How do you even eat and breathe?

514
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,591
That's not it.

515
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,011
He said he feels nothing from me.

516
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,681
He wants me as his partner
because he's comfortable.

517
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,550
He feels nothing from you?

518
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:46,968
Unbelievable.

519
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,478
You have to ask him out.

520
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,354
-What?
-Think of all the guys in the past.

521
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,766
Even when things were going well,
as soon as you asked them out,

522
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,146
they all freaked out and ran away.

523
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,705
Thanks.

524
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,711
What was that?

525
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,974
<i>They'd even take a detour</i>
<i>on their way to school just to avoid you.</i>

526
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,846
<i>And Min-su, I think it was,</i>
<i>even transferred to another school.</i>

527
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,435
<i>Because you kept scaring guys</i>
<i>by asking them out,</i>

528
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,848
<i>you even got the nickname "Date Bully."</i>

529
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,704
What was that?

530
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,777
What did you just do to me?

531
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,539
I didn't do anything.

532
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,368
Go away. Right now.

533
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,753
-I don't want to see you again.
<i>-</i>Wait!

534
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,212
At least tell me why.

535
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,757
Why are you leaving me?

536
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,298
It's just that you gave me the creeps.

537
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,180
The moment you touched me,
it creeped me out.

538
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,926
Whatever, I'm scared.

539
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,057
Wait!

540
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,729
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>all the guys I ever liked ran away</i>

541
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,193
the moment I touched them
for the first time.

542
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,605
They looked at me
like some kind of monster.

543
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,361
I've had enough.

544
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,868
I don't want to get hurt anymore.

545
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,331
Exactly.
All the guys have run away so far,

546
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,867
but this guy doesn't feel anything.
Isn't that a big progress?

547
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,709
It's the most romantic thing
that has ever happened in your life.

548
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,589
I'm sure it's destiny.

549
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,007
Whatever.

550
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,091
I'm not interested in romance anymore.

551
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,142
-My only interest is working out.
-Cut it out.

552
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,351
Just read the message.

553
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,851
-Forget it.
-Come on.

554
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,498
Kang-bae, stop staring at your phone.

555
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,415
Are you waiting for a message?

556
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,997
No. My message hasn't even been read yet.

557
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,586
-The one you sent to Yeo-rin earlier?
-Yes.

558
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,756
I thought we had a good time today.

559
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,926
Did I do something wrong?

560
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,850
She probably hasn't checked it yet.

561
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,559
At least she didn't ignore it.

562
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,597
Oh, she read it.

563
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:39,983
She did?

564
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:52,952
She ignored it.

565
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,620
She definitely did.

566
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,757
-Welcome.
-Will they be late?

567
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,586
I think they'll be here soon.

568
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:09,723
In-ho.

569
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,550
It's been a while. How's it going?

570
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,965
Same old, same old.
Su-gyeong, nice to see you.

571
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,514
Nice to see you too.

572
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,971
Hello.

573
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,556
Guys,Â say hello.

574
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,686
-Hello.
-Hello.

575
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,439
Hi, Si-hu and Yu-ra.

576
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,233
Do you remember me?

577
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,396
-You don't?
-No?

578
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,605
-Do you?
-No.

579
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,034
Why not? How could you forget me?

580
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,199
-How old are you, Si-hu?
-I'm six.

581
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,083
You're six? What about you, Yu-ra?

582
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
I'm seven.

583
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,044
You're seven? You're a year older.

584
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,674
Look how chubby your cheeks are.

585
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,750
Who bought you this cute dress?

586
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,434
Hi, Mom.

587
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,063
<i>How come you never call me?</i>

588
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,678
I'm sorry. I've been busy lately.

589
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,886
Is everything okay?

590
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,518
<i>Nothing much is going on here.</i>

591
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,773
<i>How's Su-gyeong?</i>

592
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,108
<i>Why am I even asking?</i>
<i>She must be heartbroken.</i>

593
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:13,355
<i>Your dad found out that you closed</i>
<i>your savings account for IVF</i>

594
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,197
<i>and told me to send you some money.</i>

595
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,162
<i>Buy Su-gyeong some good food</i>
<i>with that money</i>

596
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,334
<i>so you can try again.</i>

597
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,961
-I already told you...
<i>-Try a few more times.</i>

598
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,342
<i>I know there are many couples</i>
<i>without kids these days,</i>

599
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,955
<i>but without kids, married couples...</i>

600
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,216
Mom, I'm driving right now.
I'll call you back.

601
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,476
Do you remember?

602
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,268
When we just got married,

603
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,895
you often came home from work
with swollen legs.

604
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,107
Then I'd give you a leg massage,

605
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,028
and things always heated up in the end.

606
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,536
Your legs still look just as amazing
as they did back then.

607
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,672
This brings back memories.

608
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,170
What are you doing?

609
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:10,844
What?

610
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,844
What's the point?
It's not like I can get pregnant anyway.

611
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,925
Why do you say that?

612
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,890
Earlier,

613
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,982
when I saw you adoring those kids,

614
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,572
I felt bad.

615
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,111
You can't become a dad because of me.

616
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,743
-Without me...
-What is that supposed to mean?

617
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,578
I can't face your parents
because I feel so guilty.

618
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,543
Why would you feel guilty?
Because you can't get pregnant?

619
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,792
Are our lives nothing without kids?

620
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,424
Does it mean anything to you
that I love you?

621
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,165
I just can't give up!

622
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,005
This is too painful.

623
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,097
I'd rather end our marriage.

624
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,435
If I was alone, at least
I wouldn't have suffered because of this.

625
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,464
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

626
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,718
What? Don't you like <i>dakgangjeong?</i>

627
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,348
That's not it.

628
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,599
Both my husband and I love it.

629
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,904
We used to have it all the time.

630
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:56,236
But I stopped eating it
when I started trying to get pregnant.

631
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,364
It's been a long time.

632
00:44:58,987 --> 00:44:59,817
I see.

633
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,738
You're right, what you eat is important.

634
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,663
It must have been hard.

635
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,334
I tried to eat healthy.

636
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:11,916
From shampoo to toothpaste, I swapped out
all the products with harmful ingredients.

637
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,250
You must be a perfectionist.

638
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:18,167
I knew it. You were very meticulous
when you taught me dancing.

639
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:24,934
"Hard work pays off" has been my motto.

640
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,524
But sometimes, hard work doesn't pay off.

641
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,556
I keep being harsh to my husband

642
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,482
because I've been having a hard time.

643
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:41,026
Actually,
I lashed out at him just now too.

644
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,240
Worry about that later
and eat this before it gets cold.

645
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,200
-Thank you.
-Hold on.

646
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,624
Don't you guys know better than that?

647
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:56,748
<i>Dakgangjeong</i> tastes better
when it's cooled down a bit.

648
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,590
-Really?
-That's right.

649
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:03,014
As the syrup cools down,
hardens the coating,

650
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,393
and it becomes crispier and sweeter.

651
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,721
I see.

652
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,426
Life is like that too.

653
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,444
No matter what's making you
suffer right now,

654
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:15,439
things will settle and pass eventually.

655
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,940
Hang in there until then,

656
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,565
and you'll find yourself stronger.

657
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:28,616
How about you let go
until everything cools down?

658
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,249
You're right.

659
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,625
Until everything cools down.

660
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,126
Oh, I didn't tell my husband
where I was going.

661
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,883
I should give him a call.

662
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,891
Why don't you take this home
and share it with him?

663
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,681
It'll cool down once you're home.

664
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,767
Yes. I'll walk you home since it's late.

665
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,021
-Hold on.
-Box this up.

666
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,942
Oh, I almost forgot. Take this too.

667
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,612
It's wine I made with <i>bokbunja.</i>

668
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,573
It's special. Have a glass
and get a good night's sleep.

669
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,613
Don't you worry about anything.

670
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,316
Thank you for the precious gift.

671
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,329
Thank you. I appreciate it.

672
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,036
SSANGGAP WINE

673
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,333
I was worried about you.

674
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,208
You went out to buy these?

675
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,214
Wine and <i>dakgangjeong?</i>

676
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,087
Yes.

677
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:29,299
I felt bad for lashing out at you.
I shouldn't have said those things.

678
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,385
I wanted to apologize too.

679
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,596
I shouldn't have expected you
to give up on it so easily.

680
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:37,154
No, don't apologize.

681
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,312
I realized

682
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,938
I'm happy as long as I can enjoy good food
with you and chat with you.

683
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,815
I had forgotten that for a long time.

684
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:48,986
I'm sorry.

685
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,042
It's okay.

686
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:56,825
Cheers.

687
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,632
Cheers.

688
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,964
So?

689
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,007
You're really going to steal it?

690
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,758
What's with you?

691
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,510
I used to be
the Afterlife detective squad chief.

692
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,018
Do you expect me to participate
in this illegal activity? I can't.

693
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,346
You don't have to. I can do it alone.

694
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,067
Why are you doing this?

695
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,952
Why are you trying so hard
to help this person?

696
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,372
Tell me.

697
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,142
What is it?

698
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,137
I was once in love with a man.

699
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,859
My dream was to marry him,

700
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,114
have his children,

701
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,951
and enjoy ordinary happiness,
but I couldn't.

702
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,116
He wasn't an ordinary person.

703
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:16,833
Neither was I.

704
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,712
In the end,
I died without fulfilling my dream.

705
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,376
I understand how Su-gyeong feels.

706
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,132
How she wants to have a baby
that looks like her husband

707
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,720
and to raise it well.

708
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,427
I know how desperate she is,

709
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,849
and how precious her wish is.

710
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,312
That's why I'm doing this.

711
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,521
I didn't know.

712
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,358
I know

713
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,614
I'm being emotional and irrational.

714
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,697
I won't ask you to understand.

715
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,541
My mom is the only one who understands me

716
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,203
in both realms anyway.

717
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:04,500
Just don't stop me.

718
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,351
Let's go.

719
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,688
Now there are two people

720
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,725
who understand you.

721
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,988
Hi, I'm back.

722
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,284
Let's go!

723
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,079
What? Where to?

724
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,748
A great place.

725
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,578
Let's go.

726
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,523
What?

727
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:58,573
That was as terrible as the weapons
of mass destruction.

728
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,617
What has she been eating?

729
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,874
Are those conception dream marbles?

730
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:06,788
Yes. Let's just get one
and get out of here.

731
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,587
Hey, mute it.

732
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,341
-Hurry up.
-Turn the sound off.

733
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,460
Here.

734
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,849
Kang-bae. Stand guard.
Keep an eye on Samsin.

735
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,180
What? It smells over there.

736
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,476
Just go!

737
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:26,937
Gosh.

738
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,535
Let me try.

739
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,673
We got it.

740
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,021
What?

741
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,771
-You got it.
-Ms. Weol-ju.

742
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,936
Hurry up.
I think she'll wake up soon.

743
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:18,112
Darn it. I should've practiced.

744
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,782
Hey, you try.

745
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,414
I've never done this before.

746
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,490
-Gosh.
-You're driving me nuts.

747
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,333
Why isn't this working?

748
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,629
What?

749
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,178
-It worked.
-We got three.

750
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,011
It worked.

751
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,021
Hey, get the bag ready.

752
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:49,940
Yes, the bag.

753
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,558
Quickly.

754
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:00,949
Let's get out of here.

755
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:04,663
Let's go.

756
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,252
MYSTIC POP-UP BAR

757
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,005
She should be here by now.
Why isn't she here yet?

758
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:24,511
She has to fall asleep,
so she can come to the Dream World.

759
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,143
Was the wine too weak?

760
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,676
Did you add enough <i>ssanggapju?</i>

761
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,386
I think I added too much <i>bokbunja.</i>

762
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,606
No wonder.
You were all over the place today.

763
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,942
Samsin will be at work soon.
Do you think she'll notice?

764
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,701
What's going on?

765
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:47,196
Goodness.

766
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,195
Is it broken?

767
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,379
It needs to be fixed.

768
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,802
What's wrong with this?

769
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,262
What?

770
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,048
What's this?

771
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,812
Mystic Coupon.

772
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,147
Weol-ju. Why you little...

773
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,196
-She must be asleep. There she is.
-She's coming.

774
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,500
She's here.

775
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:36,745
Ms. Weol-ju.

776
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,497
Okay.

777
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:40,674
You throw it.

778
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,418
-Me?
-Yes.

779
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,545
Hurry.

780
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,637
We have to hide.

781
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,097
There. Let's go.

782
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:02,938
What?

783
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,025
It's a lotus flower. It's pretty.

784
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:11,278
Get it.

785
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,169
How can she miss that?

786
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,221
-Ms. Weol-ju.
-Yes?

787
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,509
-We have more.
-Yes. You throw it this time.

788
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,053
Okay. Me?

789
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,846
-Yes. Hurry up.
-Do it.

790
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,476
Here.

791
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,692
Over here!

792
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:44,276
Go ahead and pounce on that woman.

793
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,489
Hey! Come here! Please make just one jump.

794
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,374
It's spacing out.

795
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,869
He doesn't know how lucky he is!

796
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,741
Of course he doesn't.

797
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,616
The zookeeper told me.

798
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,542
I guess
tiger conception dreams are popular.

799
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:05,335
He said Hodori pounced
on a whopping 17 women last night.

800
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,217
He'd be very tired.

801
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,547
So that's why he isn't moving at all.

802
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,061
Gosh, her timing is terrible.

803
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,642
It won't budge.

804
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,983
-Weol-ju!
-There!

805
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,521
-Hey.
-This is bad.

806
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,015
Give me the last one.

807
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,884
Mother. Father. Please take my bow.

808
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,138
Thank you, Su-gyeong. Congratulations.

809
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:59,177
Don't fight with your husband
and live happily.

810
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,097
Yes.

811
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,023
This isn't what I should be doing.

812
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,685
Please hold this.

813
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,739
-Ms. Weol-ju, we don't have time. Hurry.
-Okay.

814
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:13,235
All right.

815
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,489
Don't miss it.

816
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,017
I knew you were up to no good.

817
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,397
This shouldn't be given out carelessly.

818
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,686
You really freaked me out.

819
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,282
Get her!

820
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,242
That was close.

821
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:56,872
What?

822
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,994
-No!
-Catch her!

823
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,038
Get her!

824
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,205
-You!
-Get her!

825
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,344
-Hey!
-Get out of my way when I say it nicely.

826
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:19,677
You're driving me nuts. Samsin, I'm sorry.

827
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,644
What do you mean you're sorry?
Hey!

828
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,305
-Hey!
-Get it!

829
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,728
Goodness.

830
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,782
-Give me that.
-No.

831
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,158
-Wait.
-Here, Guibanjang!

832
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,745
Kang-bae!

833
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:48,882
Goodness.

834
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,166
I'm tired.

835
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,339
-Gosh.
-Give me that!

836
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,888
Where are you going?

837
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,557
Kang-bae!

838
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,653
I got it!

839
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:19,948
She got it!

840
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,367
Yes!

841
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,038
I did it!

842
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,131
Hooray, peach.

843
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,724
Those punks.

844
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,176
GYNECOLOGIST

845
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,308
Here.

846
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,071
Here.

847
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,949
This must be how Samsin feels every day.

848
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,661
She must be happy to work.

849
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,405
You're right. This feels strange.

850
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,077
I hope the baby grows up healthy
in the womb,

851
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,286
and becomes a healthy kid.

852
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,173
It will.
Think of the peach conception dream.

853
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:18,931
It was almost taken away,
but it went to its mom in the end.

854
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,760
It'll be a strong kid.

855
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,182
My last throw did the trick, didn't it?

856
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:27,887
Hey, without my pass,
it wouldn't have been complete.

857
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,475
What are you talking about?

858
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,610
It's all thanks to me
yanking Samsin's hair.

859
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:37,362
-Goodness.
-Come on.

860
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:42,565
Look. The peach was rolled,
and I caught it.

861
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:46,292
And then there was the dance. Look.

862
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:58,298
<i>Everyone has a wound that pains them.</i>

863
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,798
I was once in love with a man.

864
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,586
It's because

865
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:08,024
I killed 100,000 people.

866
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:12,773
<i>The moment you're willing</i>
<i>to reveal that wound you wanted to hide</i>

867
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,978
<i>is when you find someone</i>
<i>with the same wound.</i>

868
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,742
<i>"I know. I'm in as much pain as you are.</i>

869
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,485
<i>So you can cry in front of me."</i>

870
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:30,457
<i>As you show them your true self,</i>

871
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,035
<i>and when they do exactly the same,</i>

872
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,995
<i>you begin to get to know each other</i>
<i>little by little.</i>

873
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,416
-Dance like this.
-Hey.

874
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,382
-You can do it.
-This is it.

875
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,718
-Shall we have a drink as usual?
-Sure.

876
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,387
-Shall we? Wait, what should I make?
-Yes.

877
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,473
What?

878
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,439
Who are they?

879
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:53,845
What?

880
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:56,806
Hey.

881
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,321
Excuse me. Hey!

882
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:03,151
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

883
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:06,027
-No, you really can't take this.
-Give it back.

884
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,525
Why are you tearing it down?

885
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,617
You are suspended.

886
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:14,786
What?

887
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:15,924
Suspended?

888
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:18,634
Says who?

889
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:22,301
Yeombujang, you can't do this.
This is unreasonable.

890
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,131
Please give us a chance.

891
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,587
A chance?
Did you think you could get out of it?

892
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,930
It's Yeomradaewang's order.

893

01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:34,004
<i>Weol-ju and Guibanjang are sentenced</i>

901
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:36,868
<i>to 120 hours of community service</i>
<i>in the Afterlife.</i>

902

905
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:46,424

<i>than just an ordinary guy.</i>

906

<i>When I start to like someone,</i>
<i>he runs away.</i>

912
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,225
What can I do?

913
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,736
<i>Just kiss him.</i>
