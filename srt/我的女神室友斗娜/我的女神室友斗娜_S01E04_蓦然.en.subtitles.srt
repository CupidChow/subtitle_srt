1
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:48,423
DOONA!

2
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,358
Pull away if you don't like it.

3
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,948
EPISODE 4
THE UNEXPECTED

4
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:06,626
WATER FILTRATION PLANT PLANNING
FILTRATION TARGET PARTICULATE MATTER

5
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,647
Sorry, the number you're trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

6
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,440
Please try again later.

7
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,443
When do you have lunch?

8
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,237
Oh, I don't think I'll have time
to have lunch.

9
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,155
Really?

10
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,657
That's a bummer.

11
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,784
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,079
Why are you sorry all the time?

13
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,960
Look, don't worry about me.
I didn't come here to see you.

14
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,005
I'm very capable of having fun by myself.

15
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,270
We're almost all set. All passengers,
please pull the safety bar

16
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,816
all the way down to your waist
until it clicks.

17
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,959
This is no fun, no fun at all.

18
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,379
Are you done?

19
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,354
You're really enjoying that, aren't you?

20
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,107
I haven't been able to eat all day.

21
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,449
When was it?

22
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,412
A show got canceled due to the weather.

23
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:34,375
Getting that free time was
like a gift to me,

24
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,712
so I really wanted to do something.

25
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,131
But I couldn't think of anything,

26
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,843
despite desperately wanting to.

27
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,430
That's when I realized that

28
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,683
apart from singing and dancing,

29
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,436
there's nothing that I know how to do.

30
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,401
I thought, "Later,

31
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,612
much later,

32
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,824
when I lose the ability to sing or dance

33
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,746
and end up with a lot of time on my hands,
what do I do then?"

34
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,248
"I'll be bored

35
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,209
and lonely."

36
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,170
"Life would be no fun at all."

37
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:24,717
But actually,

38
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,720
it's more fun than I thought.

39
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,597
It's become more fun.

40
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,849
That's good.

41
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,397
KOREAN HISTORY, TOEIC MASTERY,
WATER ENGINEERING

42
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,314
How about you?

43
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,817
What do you want to do?

44
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,653
I'm assuming
it wasn't your dream simply to work hard.

45
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,160
Here I am, eating jajangmyeon with you
at 11 p.m. I count that as a win.

46
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:58,668
Just living an ordinary life
like everyone else. That's my dream.

47
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,921
For me, even that's an achievement.

48
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,266
Shall we give these a go?

49
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,815
Let's hope we have luck on our side.

50
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,665
Wait, aren't these supposed to have
only positive things on them?

51
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,917
-Who made these?
-What does it say?

52
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,253
"You will face your enemy
at the worst moment."

53
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,547
"You'll be as helpless as a mouse
before a cat."

54
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:46,841
Are you the mouse?

55
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,638
"Prepare for the unexpected.
Or the consequences could be dire."

56
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:56,601
I was trying to lighten your mood,
but it's been an utter failure.

57
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:01,189
It doesn't bother me
since I'm not the type to make enemies.

58
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:02,899
That's true.

59
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,862
And I'm in a good mood anyway.

60
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,658
This jajangmyeon is so good.

61
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,786
Also true.

62
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,753
-Let's have another date sometime.
-When?

63
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,466
When the weather is so freaking amazing
that we won't be able to stay indoors.

64
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,558
This is so good!

65
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,191
-Won-jun.
-Yeah?

66
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,319
Don't always work so hard.

67
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,033
You're allowed
to take it easy occasionally.

68
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,327
Like me.

69
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,957
Cut corners, slack off…

70
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,459
Who cares?

71
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,798
What?

72
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,217
I do.

73
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,719
I sometimes have really evil thoughts.

74
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,681
When I left home,

75
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,016
I left behind my sick sister

76
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,936
and my mom who works
as the sole breadwinner.

77
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
You'd expect me to leave
with a heavy heart.

78
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,525
But actually,

79
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:32,196
I felt a little happy. Just momentarily.

80
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,408
Is that an evil thought?

81
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,661
Of course it is.

82
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,415
It's so evil
that I've never even talked about it.

83
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,209
This is the first time.

84
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,182
What? Why are you laughing?

85
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,482
-Why are you laughing?
-Seriously.

86
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,818
Why are you laughing?

87
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,114
-I'm not telling you.
-Come on, what is it? Tell me.

88
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,158
Oh, you're so funny!

89
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,213
TIME TO MOVE ON FROM
YOUR PAST RELATIONSHIP AND START ANEW!

90
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,799
SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY
TO CHANGE YOUR FATE

91
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,766
What? Face an enemy?

92
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,935
You don't have any enemies.

93
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,729
Exactly. It's all just superstition.

94
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,398
Do you still have it?

95
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,609
Give it here. I'll throw it out for you.

96
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,862
It should be burned.

97
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,950
What did Doona's say?

98
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,452
-For God's sake!
-What was that?

99
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,872
I spent all that damned money
for you to learn Korean,

100
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,165
and you cheat on me?

101
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,503
That's fucking mine!

102
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,630
I told you to learn how to communicate,

103
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,466
not to communicate with some bitch.

104
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,467
Some bitch?

105
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,430
Why are you angry?
I told you she's just a friend!

106
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,306
A friend? You crazy bastard.

107
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,726
Do you hang out with your friends
in your underwear?

108
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,814
Dos Santos!

109
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,735
Fuck you, you son of a bitch!

110
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,111
Fuck you!

111
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,159
Thank you.

112
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,206
What is it? Do you know her?

113
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,666
No.

114
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,127
I think I mistook her for someone else.

115
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,089
The fortune.

116
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,970
-Let's go.
-Yup.

117
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,854
Jin-ju!

118
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:53,939
Yes.

119
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,536
What is it?

120
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,456
That bitch of a dorm director!

121
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,012
Hey! Open the door!

122
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,351
Our revered comrade Choi I-ra is
on the top of the penalty points league

123
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,727
for 13 consecutive months!

124
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,147
-You have my respect! A round of applause!
-A round of applause!

125
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,154
PENALTY POINTS FOR MAY
WINNER: CHOI I-RA

126
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,697
WARNING! EVICTION UPON 20 POINTS

127
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,872
I'm being discriminated against
for being a foreigner, plain and simple.

128
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,291
Hey, don't you have a conscience?

129
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,587
You either spend the night elsewhere
or crawl in drunk.

130
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,758
You break the hallway windows
carrying around dress forms for projects.

131
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,720
Do you remember the Pig Samba Festival
she hosted last year?

132
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,098
That was so freaking hilarious.

133
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:13,143
The fact that you haven't been kicked out
is a discrimination against us.

134
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,731
I broke up with my boyfriend,
so I won't be spending nights elsewhere

135
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,358
or getting drunk anymore.

136
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,611
There'll be no Pig Samba Festival
this year either.

137
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,571
What?

138
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,783
-Have you broken up with Buenos Aires?
-Yes.

139
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,494
For God's sake.
That's the capital of Argentina.

140
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,371
He's Dos Santos.

141
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,123
How did you get into this school?

142
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,334
You're so ignorant.

143
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,586
Bastard.

144
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,130
Get out of my life.

145
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,633
Go die somewhere.

146
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:50,973
Is it for real?

147
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,687
Well,

148
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,399
you know the group blind date
this weekend? Should we take I-ra too?

149
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,734
Wasn't it 2 boys, 2 girls?

150
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,320
Son of a…

151
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,865
We'll just tell them to bring another guy.

152
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,008
Won-jun, was the goddess
in the lecture hall the real Doona?

153
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,301
Doona from Dream Sweet?

154
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,596
Check out the link Seong-guk posted
on the department group chat.

155
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,684
DREAM SWEET'S EX-LEAD-SINGER DOONA

156
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,106
A female idol eating jajangmyeon
at that time of night. Unbelievable!

157
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,775
What a freaking cushy life she has.

158
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,069
Dream Sweet is falling apart
since Doona's exit.

159
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,529
Is he just a regular guy?
Pay more taxes, you jerk.

160
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,491
-Fuck, I hope this was photoshopped.
-Doona still has fans left?

161
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,575
She's famously rude.

162
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,119
There's only a handful of them left.
The loud minority.

163
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,872
She wants an average life
but not the average bank account.

164
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:01,210
Agree. She rakes in all she can
then runs off when it suits her.

165
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,172
Dream Sweet hasn't been able to release
a single studio album since she left.

166
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,299
-What a dick move.
-Who are the other members?

167
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,134
-Has she retired from showbiz?
-Nope.

168
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,386
For fuck's sake.

169
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,013
I'm sure she'll be back
once the money runs out.

170
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,976
LOOK AT HER LIVING A NORMAL LIFE
UNBELIEVABLE

171
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,825
It's hot.

172
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,291
The photo looks good.

173
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,961
It's like a scene
out of a Hong Kong movie.

174
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,296
Are you all right?

175
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,507
Isn't it fascinating?

176
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,759
We were the only customers.

177
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,303
Did the staff take it?

178
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,643
What's with the sad look?

179
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,231
Did you get doxxed or something?

180
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,234
No, it's not because of me, but…

181
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,487
People are talking about you like…

182
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,741
What?

183
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,118
They're trashing me?

184
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,705
They're so brutal.

185
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,877
You've never looked me up online,
have you?

186
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,380
I'm known for being a dumpster.

187
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,176
I'm someone

188
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,471
whom anyone

189
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,307
can say anything about.

190
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,813
I've been told
half my earnings come from my looks

191
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,690
and the other half for the abuse I get.

192
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,276
Luckily, I'm worth quite a lot.

193
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,780
At least that makes it worthwhile.

194
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,699
Who told you that?

195
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,827
Jesus, there are some assholes
in the world.

196
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,790
Oh, that's right!

197
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,541
You're hot when you swear.

198
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:05,959
What?

199
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:06,919
Try swearing at me.

200
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,213
-Swear at me!
-God, what even…

201
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,299
You never take anything seriously.

202
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,386
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.

203
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,596
I'll see you later.

204
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,070
Hey,

205
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,865
if you have to do
one of those public address speeches

206
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,326
or hold a press conference or something…

207
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,829
Yes?

208
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,040
I'll come with you.

209
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,210
To say what?

210
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,462
That we're just friends.

211
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,765
Can't you tell them
I'm someone you have feelings for?

212
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,814
Can't you do that?

213
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,151
Oh, for God's sake…

214
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,573
Hey, wait for me!

215
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,827
Hey, wait for me! Hey!

216
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,873
-Be honest. Did It make your heart pound?
-No.

217
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,333
-That's not what your pupils said.
-Nope.

218
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,503
What will you wear
to the press conference?

219
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,338
Hanbok.

220
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,675
-Really?
-Yes.

221
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,927
Who wears hanbok to a press conference?

222
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,646
TIME TO MOVE ON FROM
YOUR PAST RELATIONSHIP AND START ANEW!

223
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,981
SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY
TO CHANGE YOUR FATE

224
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,077
Dinner.

225
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,704
Okay, thanks.

226
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,921
Do you girls use social media too?

227
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,924
I have an account,
but I'm not very active on it.

228
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,092
Don't use it. Delete your account.

229
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,012
Yes, sir.

230
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,728
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DEACTIVATE
RATHER THAN DELETE?

231
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,191
RECENT SIGHTING OF LEE DOONA EATING
WITH A MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

232
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,817
IS SHE CRAZY?

233
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,321
The weather

234
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,199
is freaking amazing.

235
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,552
YOU WILL FACE YOUR ENEMY
AT THE WORST MOMENT

236
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,847
What? What is this?

237
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,765
I'm sure I gave this to Jin-ju.

238
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,852
God, this is so creepy.

239
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,194
This is not happening. Knock on wood!

240
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,823
Knock on wood!

241
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,594
What are you up to?

242
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,930
Are you going somewhere?

243
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,515
Me?

244
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,934
Going on a date.

245
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,646
With who?

246
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,440
With you.

247
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,401
What?

248
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,571
Can't you see the weather is nice?
What should we do?

249
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,867
I've got my finals coming up.

250
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,789
Look here. Stop being so annoying
when my makeup looks so good.

251
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:54,915
Look.

252
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,584
Look at that perfect eyeliner.
Do you think this is easy?

253
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,629
It's way harder than this.

254
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,548
What will you wear?

255
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,723
How about this?

256
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,518
Oh, that reminds me. Take some clothes.

257
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,936
After that last incident,

258
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,146
might be good to keep
some men's clothes around.

259
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,235
Something like this? And this.

260
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,822
One second.

261
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,074
Hi, Yun-taek.

262
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,785
Hey, Won-jun, you've got to help me out.

263
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,078
What's going on?

264
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,790
You'll know when you get here.
Can you just come? Please come, okay?

265
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,291
Won-jun, listen to me.

266
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,710
It's a matter of life and death.

267
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,088
I'll send you the address.

268
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,383
What the?

269
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,635
Hello?

270
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,429
What's going on?

271
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,307
I have to go. Yun-taek says it's urgent.

272
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,976
Can't you just ditch him?

273
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,645
You can just close the door
behind you on your way out.

274
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,897
I'll see you later.

275
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,494
-Anyone?
-No.

276
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,291
Won-jun!

277
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,376
Yun-taek!

278
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,173
-Did you see him?
-I saw potential.

279
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,091
-He looks good from behind.
-Let's go.

280
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,178
Are you okay?
I thought something happened to you.

281
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,095
No!

282
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,264
Everything's fine. It's all good now.

283
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,557
Oh! Hey.

284
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,482
Cute.

285
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,776
-Cute.
-Hella cute.

286
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,628
Sorry about the holdup.

287
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,296
Don't worry about it.

288
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:17,641
I'd forgotten for way too long
that I did, in fact, have an enemy.

289
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,280
My belly! I'm dying!

290
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,449
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

291
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,665
That was the beginning of the tragedy.

292
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,833
Shall we?

293
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,546
Let's have them marry each other
so we can be in-laws.

294
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,215
That would be wonderful!

295
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,132
Yeah.

296
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,689
Stop it!

297
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,691
I said stop it!

298
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,317
Call me Noona!

299
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,319
Say it!

300
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,286
Hey, have a bite of this.

301
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,289
I don't want to. Look--

302
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,750
I told you I didn't want any!

303
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,628
How dare you speak to me like that?
Call me Noona.

304
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,463
Whatever.

305
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,798
Here. Try it.

306
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,940
Won-jun, my future husband,
save yourself for me until we meet again.

307
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,652
If you cheat on me, I'll curse you
and your descendants. Got it?

308
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,697
I will return. I will be bag.

309
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,706
Lee Won-jun!

310
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,598
At the age of 12,
Choi I-ra emigrated to Brazil,

311
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:26,227
leaving me with a thousand paper cranes,
a curse, and a resolution to become a bag.

312
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,147
And that is when I finally started
to grow taller.

313
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,565
-More!
-Just a little!

314
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,694
-You really don't know me?
-No, this is the first time we've met.

315
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,989
And Yangjin Birthcare Center
doesn't ring a bell either?

316
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:38,990
No, it doesn't.

317
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,534
How about Dingdongdang Piano Academy?

318
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,452
No.

319
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,080
I see!

320
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,332
I wonder why?

321
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:49,894
-Love shot!
-Come on.

322
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,981
You're very quiet, Mr. First Time!

323
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,484
This will be the first
and last time we see each other.

324
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,027
Right.

325
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:06,786
Everyone take one!

326
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,212
-Number one…
-Who's number one?

327
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,505
Who's number one?

328
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,636
-It's Choi I-ra.
-Number one takes number four's face…

329
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,638
-Number four.
-Who's number four?

330
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:31,227
Takes number four's face
and caresses it while…

331
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,189
-Make it hot!
-Make it hot!

332
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,690
…kissing him!

333
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:41,696
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

334
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,822
All right.

335
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,909
Let's see how much longer
you keep up this pretense.

336
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:50,038
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

337
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:02,467
Kiss!

338
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,135
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

339
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,771
Give it a rest, Choi I-ra.

340
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,150
-This is the penalty drink, right?
-No! Come here!

341
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,736
-Come on.
-Won-jun, reconsider your decision.

342
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,821
You!

343
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,740
You! Don't you dare drink that!

344
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,761
Carrot.

345
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,971
Bunny.

346
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,014
So, you weren't kidnapped, then?

347
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,479
Kidnapped? What do you mean?

348
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,565
I just had a group blind date.

349
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,066
Group blind date?

350
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:09,367
We had this group blind date,
and Won-jun was sensational tonight.

351
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:15,290
The kid was all spruced up
unlike his usual self,

352
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,833
and the girls' eyes were all

353
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,419
twinkle twinkle like little stars!
Twinkle--

354
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,546
Hey.

355
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,924
-Why hasn't Won-jun come back with you?
-Won-jun?

356
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,720
He hit it off with this freaking sexpot

357
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,055
and left with her.

358
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,935
The looks they were giving each other
were so hot.

359
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,481
Hot and also just freaking hot!

360
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,278
From what I can tell,
Won-jun won't be coming home tonight.

361
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,696
Do you know why?

362
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,782
Because tonight,
that girl is going to just…

363
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,785
You know what I mean, right?

364
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,622
There's no way
he's coming home tonight. No way.

365
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,248
Hey, you know what?

366
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,125
I honestly thought

367
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,545
Won-jun was completely hopeless
when it came to girls.

368
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,090
But he grabbed the girl by her face

369
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:12,639
and alternated between passionate
and gentle. Passionate and gentle.

370
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,849
He was good.

371
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,684
Yeah, impressive.

372
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,607
What are you doing out here, by the way?
Go in and go to bed.

373
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm off to bed myself. Good night.

374
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,044
I'm sorry about this.

375
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,547
I'm sorry.

376
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,678
Hey!

377
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,099
Hey, Choi I-ra!

378
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,726
-What?
-Hey, wake up!

379
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:01,938
Drink this.

380
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,112
And have this too.

381
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:24,002
Hey, what the hell were you thinking,
trying to kiss me?

382
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,587
A kiss is hardly a big deal.

383
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,756
In Brazil, it's just a form of greeting.

384
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,091
Well, this is Korea,

385
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,802
a Confucian country
with strict social mores.

386
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,222
That's bullshit!

387
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:39,058
The way your friends were acting,
I thought we were in Ibiza!

388
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,853
Here's what I want to know.

389
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,481
If you recognized me from the start,
why did you blank me?

390
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,067
Let's just say
I'm averse to you by nature.

391
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,322
-Hey!
-What?

392
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,537
Call me Noona, Won-jun.

393
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,290
See? This is why
I pretended not to recognize you.

394
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,209
If you've sobered up, go home.
Where do you live? Do you live alone?

395
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,336
Sorry to disappoint…

396
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,257
but I live in a dorm.

397
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,595
Hey, cut it out.
Look, I'll walk you there, so let's go.

398
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,014
Did you just say you're walking me home?

399
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,852
You mean I have the privilege
of being escorted by my ex-husband?

400
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,937
Oh, for God's sake!

401
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,732
-What? You know you like it!
-I super don't!

402
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,025
Please!

403
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,986
Can't you just give it a rest?

404
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,288
Hey, what's going on?

405
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,500
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

406
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,547
My boyfriend dumped me.

407
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:56,219
Dos Santos, the son of a bitch. I…

408
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:00,014
I was going to get back at him
by meeting someone really hot

409
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,224
at the group blind date.

410
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,894
Why did you have to be there,
of all people?

411
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,654
Why you?

412
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,127
-You're back.
-Yeah.

413
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,763
You're still up.

414
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,473
Yeah.

415
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,435
Why are you out here?

416
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,979
There must be a power outage.

417
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,315
The lights won't turn on.

418
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,484
It was too dark.

419
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,402
Really?

420
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,325
The lights seem to be on upstairs.

421
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,791
What's happened to your hand?

422
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,126
Oh. Yeah.

423
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,796
Burned myself on my cigarette.

424
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,172
Let me have a look.

425
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,345
It must have just happened.

426
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:45,888
Do you have ice?

427
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,017
In the house.

428
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,734
The fridge is still working,
so it's not a full power outage.

429
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,195
I'll take a look
at the breaker panel for you later.

430
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,285
I hear you had a blind date?

431
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,370
Yes.

432
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,125
What do you do on those things?

433
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,461
The usual stuff.

434
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,172
Drink, pair up,

435
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,258
play childish games.

436
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,055
You smell of alcohol.

437
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,849
Yeah.

438
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,268
I had quite a lot.

439
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,236
You also smell quite strongly
of women's perfume.

440
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,823
I guess. Because I was with a girl.

441
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:50,828
Give me your hand.

442
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,596
That's weird.

443
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,682
I was fine before…

444
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,980
but why is it more painful
only after you've noticed it?

445
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,900
That's how it goes.

446
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,445
You don't even know you've been hurt,

447
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,156
but as soon as you become aware of it,

448
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,618
it starts stinging and bothering you.

449
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,291
Is that how it goes?

450
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,794
Yes, it's the same for everyone.

451
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,800
Is that why…

452
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,388
I feel this way?

453
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,532
TIME TO MOVE ON FROM
YOUR PAST RELATIONSHIP AND START ANEW!

454
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,242
SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY
TO CHANGE YOUR FATE
