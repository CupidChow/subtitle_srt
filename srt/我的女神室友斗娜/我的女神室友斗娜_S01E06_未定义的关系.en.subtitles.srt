1
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:48,465
DOONA!

2
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,782
Let's go back in.

3
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,960
EPISODE 6
TWILIGHT ZONE

4
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,291
Thank you!

5
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,335
Thank you so much!

6
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,888
It was so good
to have a decent workout after so long.

7
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,352
-How long have you been doing it?
-Jiu-jitsu?

8
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,229
This was my first time.

9
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,981
You're pretty good.

10
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,526
It's easy to think martial arts is
all about weight class,

11
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,820
but actually, it's a matter of technique.

12
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,322
How do you beat natural talent?

13
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,074
You can't.

14
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,868
So don't be discouraged. Chin up!

15
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:08,039
You're good at yoga.
I've seen how insanely flexible you are.

16
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,210
-Are you going to continue training here?
-Of course!

17
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:17,173
I need to improve my combat power
if I'm going to beat up my asshole ex.

18
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,427
What?

19
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,348
Why bother beating up an asshole
who cheated on you? Just dump him.

20
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,852
You can't fix a person like that.
People who hurt you will keep hurting you.

21
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,568
Well, I'm not exactly thinking
of fixing him or anything,

22
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,697
but point taken.

23
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:43,908
Hey.

24
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,202
Come on.

25
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,123
DREAM SWEET TO RETURN
AS FOUR-PERSON GROUP WITHOUT DOONA

26
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,047
What is it
that's so much more interesting than me?

27
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,048
Your girlfriend?

28
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,552
My Dream Sweet is finally
making a comeback!

29
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,597
These headlines keep popping up,
so I was checking them out. Sorry.

30
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,225
They're making a comeback
without the member named Doona?

31
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,227
I'm not sure. We'll have to wait and see.

32
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,355
Hey. Tell me about school.

33
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,607
Anything going on with Jin-ju?

34
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,986
What is Lee Doona like as a pop idol?

35
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,916

41
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,488
RAISED BY GRANDMA FOLLOWING MOM'S DIVORCE

42
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,320
Hey, it's me.

43
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,739
Where are you?

44
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,200
Outside a paper goods store.

45
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,787
You're drunk.

46
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,872
My dad

47
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,749
ran a paper goods store.

48
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,084
Do you know what that is?

49
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,506
He sold wallpaper and paper flooring.
He repaired lamps.

50
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,675
He basically did everything!

51
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,676
Back then,

52
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,886
there were so many things I wanted to do.

53
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,098
But when Dad passed away,

54
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,560
I suddenly lost interest
in all those things.

55
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,730
Although I knew I'd never be as happy
as when he was around,

56
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,150
I thought I'd try really hard

57
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,278
to at least get as close as possible.

58
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:29,991
And to achieve that goal, it was all right
if I didn't have anything I wanted to do.

59
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,369
I developed a habit
of immediately giving up on anything

60
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,539
that seemed out of reach.

61
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,627
But…

62
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,257
I can't help wanting more.

63
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,221
What I mean is that I like you.

64
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,099
I like you.

65
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,561
I'm jealous of the men
you've liked in the past.

66
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,439
I want to know your story.

67
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,777
That's how I feel right now.

68
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,660
That was too out of line.

69
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,710
I'm sorry!

70
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,587
I'm so sorry.

71
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,805
I want to see you.

72
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:36,807
Now.

73
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,032
You actually came.

74
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,536
I wanted to see you.

75
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,206
I'm here, so go back to sleep.

76
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,151
-Ta-da!
-Oh, sandwiches!

77
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,197
-Why did you make so many?
-The bread was expiring.

78
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,449
We brought them up to share with you guys.

79
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,536
What about Doona?

80
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,664
Oh, it looked like she was still sleeping,

81
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,083
so we thought
we'd just go ahead and bring them up.

82
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,272
What's this?

83
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,275
Did you sleep with--

84
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,361
I mean, are you dating Doona?

85
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,741
I…

86
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,785
like her.

87
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,176
How long has this been going on for?

88
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,304
She's strolling out of his room,
and he didn't let on once until now?

89
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,390
Damn, what a traitor.

90
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,891
I know.

91
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,561
And when I asked him
whether they were dating,

92
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,397
he said, "I like her."
What the hell is that?

93
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,193
They're sleeping together,
but they're not dating.

94
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,029
So actually, that's pretty cool.

95
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,157
Just like people
in those American TV shows.

96
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,909
That's not Won-jun's kind of thing.

97
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,499
What's your opinion?

98
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,461
Do you think it's possible
they're sleeping together but not dating?

99
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,005
My opinion is
that it's a clear violation of the rules.

100
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,798
I should have had a word with them.

101
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,092
You're no fun at all.

102
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,264
-How do live with someone like that?
-Him?

103
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,808
I told you he's a heartless jerk.
I'm so sick of him.

104
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,826
You've put on weight.

105
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,879
Does your stylist live with you?

106
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,383
They're just my friends.

107
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,220
You don't have any friends.

108
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,472
I do now.

109
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,724
Why are you here?

110
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,313
I heard the others are making a comeback.
Are you just going to sit by like this?

111
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,357
Why, you worried?

112
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,069
You need to get the rest of your money.
The outstanding balance.

113
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,196
There isn't anything outstanding.

114
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,740
I got everything,
and I gave you everything.

115
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,910
You should know
since you're the one who blew it all.

116
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,164
So go back.

117
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,249
And grovel.

118
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,630
Do you know why I quit, Mom?

119
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,423
Are you even curious to know?

120
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,467
I'm not curious because I already know.

121
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,514
It's because you have no grit,
and you have a shitty temper.

122
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,432
You only do things that repel others.

123
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,364
-Is Alice sick?
-I'm sorry?

124
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,449
She suddenly said
she couldn't come in today.

125
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,701
Did she not contact you?

126
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,121
No, she didn't.

127
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,541
Did something happen to her?
This isn't like her.

128
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,592
-Welcome.
-Hello.

00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,349
Hey.

132
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,435
Sorry.

133
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,396
It must have been tough today on your own.

134
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,775
No, things were pretty slow today.

135
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,611
I hear there are fireworks today.

136
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,321
Jin-ju.

137
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,615
Want to go watch them with me?

138
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,451
Just come.

139
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,204
I have something to say to you.

140
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,332
Please just come.

141
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,301
Fireworks. Seriously? We're not children.

142
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,720
Could you please shut up?

143
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,349
I'm feeling very blue right now.

144
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,476
Blue? Why?

145
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,105
This guy that I like
seems to have no interest in me.

146
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,941
Really? Who is it?

147
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,863
-Wow, look!
-They're starting! Oh my God!

148
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,240
That's awesome!

149
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,426
About that guy,

150
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,680
not that I know who he is.
I definitely don't know who he is.

151
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,308
But it could be
that he has some kind of trauma

152
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,979
when it comes to love
due to repeated failures.

153
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,443
I don't care.
I like him, so what does it matter?

154
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,237
What?

155
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,829
-That's really nice.
-Right? It's so pretty.

156
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,124
-It sure is.
-Look, it's a love heart.

157
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,714
-Let's go.
-That's so pretty.

158
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,428
That's nice.

159
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,014
I haven't seen fireworks in ages.

160
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,981
-So pretty.
-That's really pretty.

161
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,194
-So pretty!
-They're beautiful!

162
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,118
It's already started.

163
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,246
Isn't this what you invited me to?

164
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:02,956
I know.

165
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,210
Sorry I'm late
when I'm the one who invited you out.

166
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,088
Enjoy it before it ends.

167
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,768
Won-jun,

168
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,188
I'm going to say something important,

169
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:30,025
so keep your eyes on the fireworks,
and don't look at me. Okay?

170
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,950
I like you.

171
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,413
I told you not to look at me.

172
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,457
I'm not done yet.

173
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,754
I've liked you
since the first time I met you.

174
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,758
Because you looked so cool
solving the math problem.

175
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,510
Isn't that funny?

LEE WON-JUN

178
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,603
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

179
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,273
I hear you're good at math.

180
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,984
Could you help me with this?

181
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,913
"In the inscribed quadrilateral ABCD
as shown in the diagram,

182
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,790
find out the length of side BC
when side AB is…"

183
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,044
Here.

184
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,839
Triangle…

185
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,848
Oh, I have to go.

186
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,894
Can I come to you for help
with other problems?

187
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,479
Sure.

188
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,357
OSEONG ACADEMY

189
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,944
At a time when even breathing
seemed too much,

190
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,657
I felt like I could finally breathe
when I was talking with you.

191
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,950
Rock, paper, scissors!

192
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,410
And every day, walking home together,

193
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:50,207
I'd wish I lived further away.

194
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,583
Hey! Lee Won-jun!

195
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,087
I'd think things like that.

196
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:01,301
I'd get butterflies in my stomach,
and my heart would ache and flutter.

197
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,641
Three, two, one.

198
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,774
I felt the same as you.

199
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,069
I like that! Soulmates.

200
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,532
I couldn't tell you how I felt.
I didn't want things to get awkward.

201
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,123
I was scared
we wouldn't even stay friends.

202
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,004
OKAY, TAKE CARE

203
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,633
Because I didn't have the guts
to tell you who I really am.

204
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,062
I know you've already turned me down,

205
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,191
but I'm telling you
in case I regret not saying it.

206
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,737
I like you.

207
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,908
I've liked you
from the moment we first met…

208
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,495
and I still do now.

209
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,065
I can hear the tick-tockl

210
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,942
My look shines through

211
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,612
Look at you now

212
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,031
Who cares?
I'm a star

213
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,574
This here is my ground

214
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,703
I dazzle as I run the show
Whatever others say, I don't care

215
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,583
Follow melodies to wonderland
That you have wished for

216
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,670
La papa loom pow

217
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,466
I'm sassy as I go my way

218
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,804
I'm breaking my cage

219
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,682
Just follow my step

220
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:18,021
Let's dance…

221
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,240
Thank you.

222
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,661
That's something

223
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,081
I've desperately wanted to hear
for a very long time.

224
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,833
And I'm sorry.

225
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,419
I'm sorry I was too young then.

226
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,505
I'm sorry that all I did was hesitate.

227
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,259
And I'm sorry…

228
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,803
that I don't feel
the same way as you anymore.

229
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,936
I hope Doona dumps you.

230
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,149
Even if you end up covered in wounds
and full of regret, I won't take you back.

231
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,318
There are plenty of guys
who like me, you know?

232
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,654
I know.

233
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,075
You're the kind of person
anyone would like. I was one of them.

234
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:18,707
So don't let anyone treat you badly,

235
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,002
not even family.

236
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,254
You don't have to put up with that.

237
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,842
And I wanted to tell you this.

238
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,763
Good for you that you've decided
not to put up with things anymore.

239
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,390
Whatever they happen to be.

240
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,294
It's all over.

241
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,888
You came to the showcase today,
didn't you?

242
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:40,914
The number you're trying to reach
is unavailable. Please try again later.

LEE DOONA

245
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,300
What are you doing
in the middle of the night?

246
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,305
Nothing. Just hanging out.
Why are you out here?

247
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,350
Well, I was just out on a walk
because I couldn't sleep,

248
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,601
and then I saw you.

249
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,563
Go back in and go to bed.

250
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,484
Hey.

251
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,864
Jin-ju's moved out.
She's moving into a mini-studio.

252
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,242
I know.

253
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,077
Because of you?

254
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,295
Why isn't Doona back yet?

255
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,754
How would I know?

256
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,050
She's your girlfriend.
Who else is supposed to know?

257
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,803
Girlfriend…

258
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,182
Isn't she?

259
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,230
Oh, you're such an idiot. Jeez!

260
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,319
Yo!

261
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,283
Come on!

262
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,461
Lee Won-jun.

263
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,297
Do you know why couples do things like

264
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,133
defining Day One of a relationship
and other childish stuff?

265
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,052
Relationships are contracts.

266
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,263
It's only natural
to want to define the terms.

267
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,223
But in my experience,

268
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,517
gut feelings are accurate.

269
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,312
She must have her reasons.

270
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,648
She is a celebrity after all.

271
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,868
Don't give too much of yourself.

272
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:51,878
Want a hug?

273
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,172
No, thanks.

274
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:58,760
Right.

275
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,014
Chin up!

276
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,809
Shall I be off, then?

277
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,310
Get some sleep.

278
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:09,688
All right.

279
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,778
Sure you don't want a hug?

280
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,247
You'll regret it!

281
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,636
LEE DOONA

282
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,304
Where are you?

283
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:21,426
Don't touch that cat. It's filthy.

284
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,603
Are you here? No, I'll be right out.

285
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,647
Yes, I'll be there.
Just give me a sec. Bye.

286
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,823
Doona.

287
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,869
What are you doing here?

288
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,747
Let's go on a trip.

289
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,957
-What?
-Why, don't you want to?

290
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,126
No, it's not that…

291
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,253
Let's go, then.

292
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,465
Hurry up!

293
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,562
Isn't it Won-jun?

294
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,610
Well, statistically,
that is a possibility.

295
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,404
But look.

296
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,490
You know, I'm a Psychology major.

297
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,034
When I analyze

298
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:14,038
the countless non-verbal signs
I-ra is sending me…

299
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,127
I think it's me.

300
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,044
For sure.

301
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,682
This is so uncomfortable,
living under the same roof and all.

302
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:36,978
Choi I-ra.

303
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,541
This is nice.

304
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,549
Hey! Quick!

305
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,302
Oh God!

306
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,138
Just ditch it here!

307
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,977
-It's cold.
-I can't believe this.

308
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,942
Can I have a towel?

309
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,451
Hey, can you help me with this?

310
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,664
This. Come on, hurry up!

311
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,875
Come on!

312
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,417
Jeong-hun!

313
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,591
Where are you going?
We're training. Are you scared of me?

314
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,426
Come at me!

315
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,542
Find another training hall.

316
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,636
Jeong-hun!

317
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,889
Let's go for beef intestines. It's on me.

318
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,600
Come on, Gu Jeong-hun.

319
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,270
Let's go for beef intestines!
I said I'm buying!

320
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,980
-Seriously.
-Look, I'm treating you!

321
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:40,443
-Why is Won-jun friends with her?
-Look, I have something to say to you!

322
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,371
What's she doing?

323
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,265
Let's go.

324
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,310
Come on.
You wanted beef intestines, didn't you?

325
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,277
I don't have any feelings left for him,

326
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:27,073
but actually seeing him with someone else
makes me want to kill him.

327
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,703
We were together for eight years
since we were kids.

328
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,331
What happens to all those years now?

329
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,041
You can't get those years back,

330
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,586
but get your money back.
Didn't you lend him money?

331
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,047
So annoying.

332
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,888
I'm curious
about people like you and Yun-taek.

333
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,517
You get hurt every single time,
but you still chase after love? Why?

334
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,394
Wouldn't it be easier not to?

335
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,396
You don't understand.

336
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:02,525
You don't choose to like someone.
It just happens. Like an accident.

337
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,529
I just don't understand.

338
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,824
Someday, there will come a moment
when you do.

339
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,287
Go for it. It's ready.

340
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,623
I have no appetite.

341
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,376
You still need to eat. Eat up.

342
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,342
This place is great!

343
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,802
This is so good!

344
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,012
Let's toast.

345
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,562
I love this place!

346
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,317
Lettuce! The second bite
will be with lettuce.

347
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,864
-Why aren't you eating?
-Oh, I will.

348
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,743
The second bite is even better.
It's awesome!

349
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,204
-This place is insane!
-What was that?

350
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,540
-I can't understand.
-It's so good.

351
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,292
All right. Slow down.

352
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,752
Do you even know how good this tastes?

353
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,225
When are we heading back?

354
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:19,935
Why?

355
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,770
Do you miss home?

356
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,814
No, I want to stay here longer.

357
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,485
I want to just live here
with you like this.

358
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,741
It's nice to hear you say
you want to do something.

359
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:41,749
Should we start dating for real?
Like, let the whole world know and all?

360
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,547
What? You don't have the nerve?

361
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,632
On the contrary.

362
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,009
I'm elated.

363
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,140
What shall we make for dinner?

364
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:20,598
MSA HEAD OF TALENT RECRUITMENT
PARK IN-WOOK

365
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,271
I'll go to Seoul.

366
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:54,752
