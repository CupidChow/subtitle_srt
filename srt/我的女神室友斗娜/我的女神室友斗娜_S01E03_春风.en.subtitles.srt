1
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,465
DOONA!

2
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,968
"I'm glad."

3
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,721
"I'm glad."

4
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,600
"I'm glad."

5
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,726
EPISODE 3
SPRING BREEZE

6
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,229
What do you think that means?
From a girl's point of view.

7
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,400
It could mean two things.

8
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,653
Number one!

9
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,948
"I'm glad that you, whom I like,

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,368
have nothing going on with her."

11
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,164
Number two! "Doona?"

12
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,417
"I'm not keen on her."

13
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,045
"Well, I'm glad you're not with her."

14
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,672
I don't think it's either.

15
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,717
God, are you stupid?

16
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,052
It's obviously number one.

17
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,596
Why would Jin-ju like me?

18
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,391
Why not?

19
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,769
I like you.

20
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,981
You're smiling.

21
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,444
I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with me.

22
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:52,904
It's just…

23
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,240
It's difficult with Jin-ju.

24
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,536
You think too much.

25
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,288
Just live a bit in the present.

26
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,668
True feelings that can be felt
without words? They don't exist.

27
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,172
Well, if you get hurt,
I can at least be a shoulder to cry on.

28
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,466
Isn't that what friends are for?

29
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,580
FOR SOPHOMORES
THE ART OF MATHEMATICS

30
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,433
Won-jun, come quick.

31
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,351
-Close that.
-Okay.

32
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,646
Five, four, three,

33
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,440
two, one.

34
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,322
Five, four, three,

35
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,449
two, one.

36
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,496
Five, four, three,

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,999
two, one.

38
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,044
Seriously?

39
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,171
If you're going to do it, do it right.

40
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,465
-Here, like this.
-Five.

41
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,719
Four, three, two, one.

42
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:57,862
There's a rumor going around
that we're together.

43
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,156
-I know.
-But it's not true.

44
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,408
We're just close, right?

45
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,078
What do you say

46
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,122
when people ask you
what the deal is between us?

47
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,874
What about you?

48
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,043
What do you say?

49
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,629
Well,

50
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,215
just that we're close.

51
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,301
That we get on well.

52
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,931
That we're like soulmates.

53
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,604
That's so true.

54
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,482
I like that! Soulmates.

55
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,622
This one looks good.

56
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,708
Only you do.

57
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,003
You look good in it too!

58
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,491
Happy birthday. I'll be in touch.

59
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,041
I'm sorry for the delay.

60
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,085
We're really backed up with orders.

61
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,295
Please enjoy.

62
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,071
I'm so sorry.
I spilled some coffee over there.

63
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,491
I'll get it.

64
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,701
-Okay. Thank you.
-No problem.

65
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,923
Jin-ju.

66
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,175
Yeah?

67
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,719
What are you doing tomorrow?

68
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,138
Tomorrow…

69
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,266
Want to go see the cherry blossoms?
If you're busy--

70
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,226
No! I…

71
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,772
Sure!

72
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
Okay.

73
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,584
Doona, where are you?

74
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,213
Are you sleeping?

75
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,468
Doona!

76
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,057
Doona!

77
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,521
Doona, are you in there?

78
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,148
I'm trapped.

79
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,320
-Can you open it for me?
-Hang in there for just a sec!

80
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,016
A penny for your thoughts.

81
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,104
So hot.

82
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,316
A man who fixes bathroom doors is so hot.

83
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,194
My god. You're unbelievable.

84
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,322
I'm serious.

85
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,867
Maybe it's because I don't have a dad,

86
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,578
but it's kind of like a fantasy of mine.

87
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,331
Your father isn't around?

88
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,833
No.

89
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,751
My father died when I was young too.

90
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,465
I never had one to start with.

91
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,177
Life must have been hard for you too.

92
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,262
Not really.

93
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,515
It's actually convenient

94
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,561
since I can imagine my father
to be whatever I want.

95
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,189
Do you know what's really hard?

96
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,151
It's not someone who was never there.

97
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,529
It's people who disappear on you
when they were there before.

98
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,823
That's what drives you insane.

99
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,954
That's right.

100
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,789
These had disappeared on me too.

101
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,671
Oh, I think I saw a pack in the cabinet
while I was looking for the toolbox.

102
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,507
That one?

103
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,938
These aren't mine.

104
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,359
Why would I smoke something like that?

105
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,195
Hey…

106
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,281
shall we go out?

107
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,870
There seem to be a lot of people's heads
you want to smash. So let's do it.

108
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,831
Give it a go.

109
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,625
Here.

110
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,344
Faster!

111
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,929
Whack them hard to score points.

112
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,722
Think of all the people you hate.

113
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,640
Faster!

114
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,309
Neener, neener! Getting angry?

115
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,648
There's a pattern to this.

116
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,275
That hurts!

117
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,069
Don't hit me!

118
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,153
You're good.

119
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,322
That hurts!

120
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,991
It's fun, right? Oh, there's one.

121
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,952
Here. There.

122
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,370
That hurts!

123
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,080
Great job!

124
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,083
-Nice.
-I want to go again.

125
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,752
Go for it.

126
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,088
That hurts!

127
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,049
That's it.

128
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,050
Don't hit me!

129
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,511
That hurts!

130
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,179
YOUR SCORE

131
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,980
That hurts!

132
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,573
How did that not go in?

133
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,169
Come on, go in!

134
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,676
Give me the ball!

135
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,785
-Nice.
-I'm beat!

136
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,375
Hey!

137
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,670
You should lie down too.

138
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:24,965
It's really pretty.

139
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,522
Why are you laughing?

140
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,735
What are you calling pretty?
I can't see a single star.

141
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,321
It's really overcast at the moment.

142
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,700
-It looks like it will rain tomorrow.
-Do you think?

143
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,455
It looked pretty

144
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,832
regardless.

145
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,007
Thanks for today.

146
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,052
For everything.

147
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,595
You too.

148
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,849
I can't remember the last time
I let go like this and had fun.

149
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,483
I asked Jin-ju to go see
the cherry blossoms with me.

150
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,778
Really?

151
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:28,821
Did she say yes?

152
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,494
I thought she'd say no, but yeah.
I'm not sure why.

153
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,372
Don't run away.

154
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,124
It can become a habit.

155
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,128
I won't.

156
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,630
The weather…

157
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,466
"Clear and sunny."

158
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,448
Won-jun!

159
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,705
They're so pretty!

160
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,333
They are, aren't they?
Wow, there are so many of them.

161
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,250
Yeah.

162
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,588
Oh, right. Kook Su-jin's apartment complex
has really pretty cherry blossoms.

163
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,340
Do you remember?

164
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,342
Yes. That's right.

165
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,762
Didn't we skip a day of academy classes
to hang out in that playground?

166
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,265
Skip a day? Are you kidding me?

167
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,893
You were determined
not to miss the revision class,

168
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,812
so we run back after just 20 minutes.

169
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:31,985
Lee Won-jun was never even late for class,
let alone skipping one.

170
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,862
You're really something.

171
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,083
-Oh, the other day--
-The other--

172
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,795
-You go first.
-No, you go first.

173
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,423
I came across a whack-a-mole
in my neighborhood.

174
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,843
The one you were obsessed with
outside the academy?

175
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,885
Really?

176
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,931
I've been really missing it.
I haven't been able to play it in Seoul.

177
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,307
Have you?

178
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,685
No, not me. Only Doona has.

179
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,062
It was her first time.

180
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,189
Everything she does seems to be her first.

181
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,612
What were you going to say?

182
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,697
I don't know.

183
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,283
I can't remember.

184
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:28,750
It's raining.

185
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,072
Jin-ju.

186
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,879
-Here.
-Thank you.

187
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,298
-Get under this. It's cold.
-Oh, thank you.

188
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,725
YUN-TAEK

189
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,519
-May I take this call?
-Of course, please go ahead.

190
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,564
Yes, Yun-taek?

191
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,858
Won-jun, when are you back?
We ordered pizza.

192
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,693
It was two-for-one, so we got four.

193
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,280
Is that Seo Yun-taek
you're talking to on the phone?

194
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,992
Yes. Do you know him?

195
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,162
Wow! What a small world.

196
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,790
Won-jun's friend from back home

197
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,251
and my best friend are connected like…

198
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,044
Like this. Right?

199
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,798
Jin-ju, what can I say about Se-hun?

200
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,760
Call me biased,
but he really is an impressive bastard.

201
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,721
First of all, he's tall.
He's good-looking.

202
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,723
He's also rich.

203
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,601
Oh, and he's freaking amazing at sports.

204
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,478
So his body's ripped!

205
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,398
His legs are like,
you know what I mean, right?

206
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,358
-You've lucked out.
-Cut it out, man.

207
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,610
He's like that when he's drunk.
Just ignore him.

208
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,903
It's okay.

209
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,824
So?

210
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,867
Are you two an item, then?

211
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,120
No, it's nothing like that--

212
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,538
We're like soulmates.

213
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,873
Because we get on so well.

214
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,167
Yeah.

215
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,631
You should date!

216
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,174
-Kiss!
-Yun-taek.

217
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,261
You should have some food.

218
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,513
You must be hungry from talking so much.

219
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,682
Ms. Lee,

220
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:54,062
did you just call me by my name?
Have I finally become visible to you?

221
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,940
Where's the tranquilizer gun?
Why are you so chatty today?

222
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,734
Am I talking too much?

223
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,610
You can talk too, you know?

224
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,321
I've become visible to her.

225
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,697
I've finally become visible…

226
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,490
I'll go buy some ice cream for us.

227
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,034
All right.

228
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,537
Cheers!

229
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:14,166
You know,
when we were doing national service…

230
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,945
You came.

231
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,989
My soulmate.

232
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,957
It looks like
I'm going to have to resit my exams.

233
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,879
I wanted to go to the same college as you,
but it's not going to happen.

234
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,967
It's cold.

235
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,831
Is that better?

236
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,922
No.

237
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,842
I'm still cold.

238
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,499
You have surprisingly old-fashioned taste.

239
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,376
You like toe socks too.

240
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,753
Aren't you cold?

241
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,964
Not at all! I'm immune to the cold.

242
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,222
These are different.

243
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,767
-What are?
-The cherry blossoms.

244
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,896
Yangjin and Seoul have different ones,
and these are different too.

245
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,067
Should I tell you why?

246
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,569
Do you know why?

247
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,200
Those are apricot blossoms,
not cherry blossoms, you dummy.

248
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,286
Oh, really?
How do you know something like that?

249
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,705
I'm more knowledgeable than you.

250
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,124
So you should treat me as your teacher.

251
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,626
Yes, Ms. Lee.

252
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,669
You go ahead and go in.

253
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,589
-What about you?
-I'm going to have a smoke.

254
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:13,220
-Do you want me to keep you company?
-No, the ice cream will melt.

255
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,972
-Can you throw this away for me?
-Sure.

256
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,350
All right, then.

257
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,786
-Here we are. Ice cream.
-Ice cream!

258
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:39,996
Thank you.

259
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,456
Here you go.

260
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,418
-Here's your favorite.
-Oh! Thank you.

261
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,004
Hey, Doona. Hurry over
and have your ice cream.

262
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,968
-What were you talking about?
-Oh, yes.

263
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,344
Right, so,

264
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,639
the wild boar is charging toward me.

265
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,558
Wild boars are really fast, you know?

266
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,477
I obviously couldn't outrun it.

267
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,437
So I thought, "Let's jump on its back!"

268
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,858
I took a jump and landed on its back,
except I was facing backward.

269
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,404
So I'm riding it backward like clip, clop,
and all hell is breaking loose.

270
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,864
People are shouting,
"Yun-taek, where are you going?"

271
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,409
"I'll return on boar-back, sir!"

272
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,495
-And I grabbed its tail to steer it.
-Stop lying, man.

273
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,541
Of course it's a lie, jackass.
How could this possibly be true? God…

274
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,793
You're really drunk.

275
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,046
-So, what? Just flirting?
-So far, yes.

276
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,009
-Jin-ju's cute, isn't she?
-What?

277
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,430
Jeez!

278
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,433
Anyhow, congratulations, man.

279
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,900
Doona, can I come hang out again?

280
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,195
You can come every day.

281
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,662
-Come on, let's go, everyone!
-Mark him!

282
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,543
Come on, let's go, Korean Lit!

283
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,004
-Okay, let's go!
-Mark him!

284
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,547
-It's open!
-Over here!

285
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,674
-It's open!
-Won-jun, it's open!

286
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,097
-They're going to end up fighting.
-No way.

287
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,558
Won-jun would never.
He'd rather give up the ball.

288
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,817
Nice!

289
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,404
Don't worry about it! It's all right!

290
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,864
-Good job!
-Yay!

291
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,158
-Let's go, Korean Lit!
-Time out.

292
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,409
KOR LIT
CIV ENG

293
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,413
-What's going on?
-Hold onto this for me.

294
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,831
Sure.

295
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:48,958
Let's go!

296
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,462
-Come on, Se-hun!
-Jeong!

297
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,548
Korean Lit!

298
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,300
-Finish it off!
-Block it!

299
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,302
-Nice!
-Okay!

300
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,014
Nice!

301
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,600
Come on, guys! Let's go!

302
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,601
We've got this!

303
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,020
Come on, Korean Lit!

304
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,272
Come on! Let's go!

305
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,357
Good job!

306
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,025
-Well played.
-Good job.

307
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,151
Hey, good job.

308
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,240
-Good job.
-Thanks.

309
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,036
Jin-ju, you're coming for lunch, right?

310
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,082
There's a new pasta place
just across the street.

311
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,291
Let's all go together.

312
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,461
I have a class now.

313
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,631
Just us, then?

314
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,300
Okay!

315
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,011
-Let's do this again sometime.
-Sure.

316
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,015
I'll see you later.

317
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,475
Let's go.

318
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,457
Did you miss class because of me?

319
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,500
I didn't want to go anyway.

320
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,381
You'll lose her if you keep on like that.
Are you okay with that?

321
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,675
How can I lose her, Ms. Lee?

322
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,968
She's not mine to lose.

323
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,636
That's not true.

324
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,098
From where I'm standing, you and Jin-ju
feel the same way about each other

325
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,600
but are just being stupid.

326
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,352
At least make a go of it before giving up.

327
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,146
I'm frustrated just looking at you.

328
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,899
I have.

329
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,110
I told her I had feelings for her.

330
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,236
I did.

331
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,114
You did?

332
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,449
Yes.

333
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,910
I thought she felt the same way.

334
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,296
I like you.

335
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,485
The number you're trying to reach
is currently…

336
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,028
Is everything okay?

337
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:29,118
Sorry, I've been busy.
I'll contact you later.

338
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,791
MAYBE

339
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,921
COULD WE

340
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,223
COULD YOU COME OUT FOR

341
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,602
This could feed two dozen people.

342
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,229
We can easily finish this.

343
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,064
Of course we can eat it all!

344
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:10,785
Okay.

345
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,331
Take care.

346
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:29,095
We lost touch after that and didn't see
each other for more than a year.

347
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,309
It was my fault.

348
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,186
What was your fault?

349
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,189
Making assumptions
about someone's feelings.

350
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,319
Overstepping the mark
without having the conviction to do so.

351
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,531
And losing a friend in the process.

352
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,704
But it's water under the bridge now.

353
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,999
I'm happy to just be friends
with her again.

354
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,252
Genuinely.

355
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:08,176
So, Ms. Lee, you can stop
with your coaching now.

356
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,764
Does that mean I'm fired?

357
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,975
That's a bummer.
I never even got paid for it.

358
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,859
SE-HUN

359
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,865
I'll go take a call.

360
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,141
Who's there?

361
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,422
Doona must be super bored these days.
She wants to hang out almost every day.

362
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,300
It's her first time having friends.
I kind of feel bad for her.

363
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,887
She seems to rely on you a lot.

364
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,267
No, she just likes to tease me.
I'm not much of a person to rely on.

365
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,270
-Should we get these chips?
-Okay.

366
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,487
You underestimate yourself sometimes.

367
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,949
You're quite reliable, you know?

368
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,495
Sorry for the wait. I'll ring you up now.

369
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,041
That's right. It's April Fools' Day.

370
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,669
Has everyone told a lot of lies today?

371
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,297
If not, now's the time.
Lie to me all you want.

372
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,299
Yun-taek.

373
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,051
I love you.

374
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,386
Oh, I love you too.

375
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,306
You jerk, I'm going to kick you
in the face for that!

376
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,059
Someone told me he likes me today.

377
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,149
But I haven't responded yet.

378
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,609
Why not?

379
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,030
Because I'm not sure of my own feelings.

380
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,327
It's weird.

381
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,580
I'll start having feelings for someone,

382
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,542
but as soon as they approach me,
I lose my nerve.

383
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,630
I get afraid that they'll be disappointed…

384
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,383
once they get to know the real me.

385
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,231
What's up with you guys?
I thought we were telling lies.

386
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,274
What's going on?

387
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,735
Why the long face, you guys?

388
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,154
Your acting is out of this world.

389
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,906
Is that what method acting is?

390
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:18,950
I was totally absorbed just now.

391
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,910
Don't hang out with Doona.
She's rubbing off on you.

392
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,371
That was awesome, Pearl Kim. I like it.

393
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,875
It's Doona's turn next!

394
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,463
What's your lie, Doona?
It's going to be hard to top Jin-ju's.

395
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,423
I think I'm being stalked.

396
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,969
That's an unusual theme for a lie.

397
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,846
I wish it were a lie.

398
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,309
YOU'RE PRETTY

399
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,270
But it's real.

400
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,354
What's this?

401
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,775
You're pretty.

402
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,444
He's here, even now.

403
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,077
Hey, what the hell?

404
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,163
What? What the hell is that?

405
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,207
You creep!

406
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,174
You! Stop right there!

407
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,675
-Hey!
-Won-jun!

408
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,260
Hey!

409
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,970
Get that creep! Get that bastard!

410
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,347
That bastard! That…

411
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,891
Oh, he's turned off.

412
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,145
I've got it!

413
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,398
-All right?
-I've got it! Yes, I'm fine.

414
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,609
-Are you okay?
-It's fine. Thank God.

415
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,610
Get used to it.

416
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,986
He's a heartless jerk.

417
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,368
Hey, let go of me!

418
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,872
I'm not letting you go, you bastard!

419
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:48,956
Let go!

420
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,044
Hey! You bastard!

421
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,088
-You son of a…
-You son of a bitch!

422
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,423
Are you all right?

423
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,217
You son of a bitch!

424
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,801
Hey, hold him!

425
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,720
You creep. Hold him.

426
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,971
How dare you.

427
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,700
Goddamn it.

428
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,911
-What?
-What?

429
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,414
What a son of a bitch.

430
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,877
I did it out of pure curiosity.
That's all.

431
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,213
I saw her from the store and got excited.

432
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,173
I've been a fan of hers forever, you see.

433
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,305
Let's deal with him ourselves.

434
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,890
What do you have in mind?

435
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,892
He deserves to be beaten
to a goddamn pulp.

436
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,937
I'll just beat him here

437
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,691
until he's at death's door.

438
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,735
A blow to the head?

439
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,405
That might feel satisfying.

440
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,163
-I've always wanted to try it.
-Wait…

441
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,313
Thank God she has common sense, at least.

442
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,277
You. Say one more word, and I'll kill you.

443
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,820
I'm sorry.

444
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,295
Do you really think
it's all right not to call the police?

445
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,798
Doona is dead set against it.

446
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,508
She must have her reasons.

447
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,305
Are you all right?
You look like you're hurt pretty bad--

448
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,431
I'm fine.

449
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,607
I'm going to leave home soon, Won-jun.

450
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,567
That's why I've been working.

451
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,196
Because my dad's against it.

452
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,531
I did wonder what was going on.

453
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,450
Really?

454
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:58,979
DAD

455
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,898
WHY AREN'T YOU BACK HOME YET, YOU BITCH?

456
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,859
YOU THINK I SENT YOU TO COLLEGE
SO YOU CAN FOOL AROUND WITH MEN?

457
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:04,944
TEXT ME BACK RIGHT NOW

458
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:05,861
I'M ON MY WAY

459
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,235
P
YOU'VE GOTTEN BETTER AT LYING

460
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,821
P
STOP CONTACTING ME AND WAIT QUIETLY

461
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,521
You're back.

462
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,399
-Yes.
-You should have woken me up.

463
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,610
I couldn't sleep.

464
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,196
Let me have some beer too.

465
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,874
Why don't you take a seat?

466
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:47,189
We got his ID, the memory card,
a letter of apology,

467
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,316
and a statement
that he'll never do it again.

468
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,193
We got everything we thought necessary.

469
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:55,155
We went to his place
and did a factory reset of his computers.

470
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,449
We've made him quit
his convenience store job,

471
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,494
and told his parents and the manager
about what happened.

472
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,958
I'll pass everything on to you,

473
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,504
so you can go to the police
when you feel ready.

474
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,630
Whenever that may be.

475
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,257
I will.

476
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,219
Thank you.

477
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,602
Weren't you scared
dealing with that alone?

478
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,563
Not really.

479
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,528
Doona.

480
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:40,784
It's okay to be scared.
It's better than getting hurt, you know?

481
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,374
Don't get hurt. Not by anyone.

482
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,252
It was once your job
to be loved by people.

483
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,145
I think I still feel sleepy.

484
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,272
I want to sleep.

485
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,848
I'll hold it for a bit.

486
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,269
Pull away if you don't like it.

487
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:55,122
