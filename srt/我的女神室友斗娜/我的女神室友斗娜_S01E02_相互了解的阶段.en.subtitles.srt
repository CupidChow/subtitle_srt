1
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:48,298
DOONA!

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,218
You can't see anything now

3
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,095
Both your eyes are blinded

4
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,306
And you got a no choices

5
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,058
I hypnotize you

6
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,228
Screaming out so loud

7
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,231
Screaming in my heart is the spell, love

8
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,903
I got this fire, fire…

9
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,771
Doona.

10
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,356
Lee Doona.

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,191
Wake up.

12
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,235
Lee Doona!

13
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:23,726
EPISODE 2
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER

14
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,736
Jeong-hun consumes
150 grams of protein a day.

15
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,117
His sole concern is
the peace and comfort of his own being.

16
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,704
Straighten your elbows out tautly.
That's it. Breathe in.

17
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,205
He has firm views on dating.

18
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,207
The population is exploding
out of control.

19
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,084
Propagation isn't needed right now.

20
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,588
Human reproductive function
and libido should be curbed.

21
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,132
In some ways, that could be
our evolutionary path, right?

22
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,597
Just ignore him, baby. He's a nutcase.

23
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,223
-Yeah?
-Baby, say "Ah."

24
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,350
Yun-taek's nickname is
the Hundred-Day Prince.

25
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,685
-Right?
-Have some more.

26
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,687
He dreams of a fated love

27
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,565
but can't last more than 100 days
without getting dumped.

28
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,695
Of course, it's not possible to know
what everyone's stories are.

29
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,213
Because we all have
a true version of ourselves

30
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,007
that we wish to hide from the world.

31
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,876
I sent you a screenshot of the message
the boss sent me yesterday.

32
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,504
That's the one, right? Yeah, okay.

33
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,763
Hey!

34
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,489
EDWARD

35
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,242
Thank God I was able
to hire you so quickly.

36
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,911
Last week,
Alice and I thought we were going to die.

37
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,122
Oh, here she comes.

38
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,708
No way!

39
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,793
You're Edward?

40
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,878
Do you two know each other?

41
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,214
Yes!

42
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,634
What a coincidence.

43
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,636
Welcome on board.

44
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,143
-Hi.
-Hello, welcome.

45
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,520
-Can I have an iced Americano, please?
-Sure thing.

46
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,772
Your iced hazelnut is ready.

47
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,024
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

48
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,942
Enjoy your coffee.

49
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,777
Thank you.

50
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,058
LEE DOONA
MISSED CALL

51
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,477
Ah, so cold!

52
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,897
-Here you go.
-Oh, thanks.

53
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,571
This is nice.

54
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,704
You make good coffee.

55
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,831
-It's good, isn't it?
-Yes.

56
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,253
MARCH 2021 MOCK EXAM SCHOLARSHIP
1ST PLACE YANGJIN HIGH SCHOOL LEE WON-JUN

57
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,422
2ND PLACE
YANGJIN GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL KIM JIN-JU

58
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,471
KIM JIN-JU
YANGJIN GIRLS' HIGH

59
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,355
There's Kim Jin-ju.

60
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,689
You know her?

61
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,277
Her family owns our restaurant's building.
They're super-duper rich.

62
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,572
Yu-i is there too.

63
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,699
Hey, I'll be right back.

64
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,094
Excuse me.

65
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,639
I hear you're good at math.

66
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,392
Could you help me with this?

67
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,820
-Here.
-Thank you.

68
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,198
Triangle…

69
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,454
Cosine…

70
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,749
Are you headed home?

71
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,335
No, I have a tutoring job to go to.

72
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,631
I work a lot, don't I?

73
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,342
Is there something going on?

74
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,803
Are you worried my family went bankrupt?

75
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,638
No. That's not what I meant.

76
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,682
I'm glad everything's fine.

77
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,330
ALICE

78
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,711
Whenever I have tuna,

79
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,881
I always kind of feel like
I've made it in life, you know?

80
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,550
I'm going to lay down a bed of rice

81
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,179
then this tuna viscera chopsticks…

82
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,639
Tuna viscera chopsticks?

83
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,850
I have to warn you,
this is incredibly salty.

84
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,602
It's so salty that…

85
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,729
MOM

86
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,814
Next, you wrap it like this.

87
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,986
It's like assembling sushi.
You know what I mean, right?

88
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,614
You need some sesame oil and salt mixture.

89
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,868
I wanted to have this
with warm cooked rice like this today.

90
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,484
DOONA

91
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,613
The number you're trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

92
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,575
Please leave a message after the tone.

93
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,713
Didn't we agree
you wouldn't keep a personal cell phone?

94
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,758
There are times
when I want to hear your voice, you know?

95
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,347
Don't cause any trouble.

96
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,734
You're so cute.

97
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,653
You like me, don't you?

98
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,533
But don't like people too much.
It's better to keep out of their way.

99
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,368
There are lots of bad people out there.

100
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,543
Wow, you're a genius cat.
You understood me right away.

101
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,546
I'm sorry.

102
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,674
Are you hurt?

103
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,310
-You're bleeding.
-It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

104
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,564
Where were you?

105
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,524
I called you.

106
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,525
I was working.

107
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,443
Tutoring?

108
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,571
No, at a café. I haven't been able
to get a tutoring job yet.

109
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,662
Do you know what I hate the most?

110
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,748
-Bad singing?
-Nope.

111
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,293
Not picking up my calls.

112
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,839
How should I put it?

113
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,926
It makes me feel abandoned.

114
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,264
-It fucking sucks.
-Oh, I was working.

115
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,521
It wasn't aimed at you.

116
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,273
You should get some rest.

117
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,905
Why did you call? Did something happen?

118
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,701
I wanted to hear your voice.

119
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,954
So pick up next time.

120
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,711
Hello, this is Companion,

121
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,005
the 44th Civil Engineering
Student Association.

122
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,340
To kick off the new semester…

123
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,634
Due to a study group meeting,
I will not be…

124
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,763
It's 20,000 won to attend,
50,000 won to decline.

125
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,642
I will attend.

126
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,068
START OF TERM PARTY!

127
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,863
-Patriotic!
-Minsong!

128
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,448
-Flourishing!
-Engineering!

129
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,574
-Brilliant!
-CED!

130
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,620
-We are Civil!
-Engineering!

131
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,829
Cheers!

132
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:11,290
Let's make some noise!

133
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,307
This quarter's overseas business results

134
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,852
depend entirely
on the KCON 2022 JAPAN performance.

135
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,147
The single showcase after KCON 2022 JAPAN
will be our largest ever.

136
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,609
We plan to expand the media showcase
to the scale of a full concert.

137
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,153
-For KCON…
-Doona. Lee Doona.

138
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,474
Hey, you left some at the bottom, asshole!

139
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:14,103
-What's that face for? Hey!
-Hey, pour a round. Quickly.

140
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,604
LEE DOONA

141
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,107
-Why are you giving me that face?
-Fucking stop that!

142
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,651
-I'm sorry.
-That's not good enough. Let go of me.

143
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,319
-I'm sorry.
-Drink this, then.

144
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,154
-If you're sorry, drink.
-I'm sorry.

145
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,031
-All right. Sit down.
-Hey.

146
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,783
Hello?

147
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,660
Hel-low or hel-high?

148
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,121
That's such a bad dad joke.

149
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,458
Where are you? I'm…

150
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,586
Hello, how are you?

151
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,840
You're the pretty lady I saw at school
the other day, aren't you?

152
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,133
Come on, give it back.

153
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,220
Come on, stop ignoring me and answer me.

154
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,264
-Give it back.
-Hello? Anybody there?

155
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,892
-Cut it out and give me back my phone!
-What the…

156
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,063
-What the hell are you looking at?
-Hey, you!

157
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,783
Did he hit you?

158
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,201
Not yet.

159
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,915
How dare you hit my Won-jun?

160
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,333
What year are you?

161
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,336
Take your filthy hands off me.

162
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,757
You think you can act all entitled now?
You're starting to piss me off.

163
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,718
And what are you going to
fucking do about it, fuckface?

164
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,054
Watch yourself.
I have a weapon in my hand.

165
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,680
-Hey, look…
-Go for it.

166
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,891
Do it, then.

167
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,479
Hey, go on. Go right ahead.

168
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,440
Don't cause any trouble.

169
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,402
You pissed? Hit me, then.

170
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,947
Stop waving it around if you can't do it.

171
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,740
-You think I can't?
-Do it, then!

172
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,597
PHARMACY

173
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,543
I'm absolutely fine.

174
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,878
It's for me. I'm the one who needs it.

175
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,679
That's bitter.

176
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,433
If you hit people over the head
with wine bottles,

177
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,852
you'll get arrested on the spot.
You know that?

178
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,395
He was asking for it.

179
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,951
I don't know what you've been through,

180
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,079
but if you're having problems
with anger management,

181
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,458
you can get therapy for that.

182
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,005
Why? Do I look like
I've been through something?

183
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,133
Well, it's not entirely normal
to walk around

184
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,219
with a wine bottle
to smash someone's head in with.

185
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,972
I bought it because I happened to see it,

186
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,225
and I wanted to drink it with you.

187
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:46,690
Then let's drink.

188
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,525
What's stopping us?

189
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,494
Are you treating us?

190
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,872
Yes! Let's choose what to have. Come on.

191
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,373
How about fried chicken?

192
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,542
-I love it!
-Fried chicken and beer, then?

193
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,794
We need whelks too.

194
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,466
-I'm hungry all of a sudden.
-How many?

195
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,009
This is so awesome!

196
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,805
-Let me go say hi.
-Sure.

197
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,889
Won-jun!

198
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,560
-Are you here for the party?
-Yes. You too?

199
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,812
Yes!

200
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,396
You're with someone.

201
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,026
Oh, we live in the same house. She…

202
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,237
Aren't you Lee Doona?

203
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,782
Kook Su-jin was a huge fan, right?

204
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,617
I'm a fan of yours.

205
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,663
I'm off. I'm tired.

206
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,584
Oh, excuse me, but do you drink?

207
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,753
Would it be okay
if we had a drink together?

208
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,923
Why would I drink with someone
I don't even know?

209
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,217
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

210
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,014
I'm…

211
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,308
I…

212
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,561
I'm…

213
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,313
a shy person.

214
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,732
-A really shy person, actually.
-Right.

215
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,363
But you're lucky.

216
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,490
I'm telling you, you're lucky.

217
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,826
I know!

218
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,078
But I'm…

219
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,874
I'm the kind of person everyone likes!

220
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,296
I bet he likes me too.

221
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,381
Hey, Won-jun.

222
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,967
Do you not like me anymore?

223
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,139
Who cares if he likes you or not?
He's not important.

224
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,016
Hey, Jin-ju!

225
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,476
Marry me.

226
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,729
I want to marry you too.

227
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,148
-Let's get married!
-Let's get married!

228
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,904
Jin-ju, don't you need to get going?
You might have missed the last bus.

229
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,238
We have to get married.

230
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,741
Be quiet. We're going to get married.

231
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,412
You missed the last bus though.

232
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,167
-Jin-ju.
-Yeah.

233
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,836
Crash at my place tonight.

234
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,297
Actually, just live here.

235
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,425
You can have all of this.

236
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,970
-I'll give you everything.
-I've been needing a place to stay.

237
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,764
Thank you!

238
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,766
You're crazy!

239
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,142
Hey,

240
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,229
are you crazy?

241
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,732
You must be crazy.

242
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,526
Hey, wake up.

243
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,904
Hey, you sleeping?

244
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,990
Come on, why are you sleeping?

245
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,825
You're crazy.

246
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,702
Jin-ju, wake up.

247
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,746
Your dad's calling. Jin-ju!

248
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,705
What's wrong?

249
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,707
What should I do?
We should probably answer.

250
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,917
Answer it, then.

251
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,543
How can I answer it? I'm a man.

252
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,881
You're a man?

253
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,802
-He says he's a man.
-Oh, what do I do?

254
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,763
Oh, no, you shouldn't.

255
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:05,681
Hello?

256
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,729
Oh, hello, Mr. Kim.

257
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,274
I'm Jin-ju's friend
from the Korean Lit department.

258
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,567
I'm Lee Se-na.

259
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,404
The Start of Term party finished
a bit late tonight,

260
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,489
so Jin-ju's decided
to stay over at my place.

261
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,574
Oh, where's Jin-ju?

262
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,370
She just went to take a shower.
Should I tell her to call you?

263
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,623
Yes, of course. Everything is fine.

264
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,919
Oh, of course!
Yes, my parents are here with us.

265
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,131
I will. Bye, Mr. Kim.

266
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,596
Wow, you're a pro. That was phenomenal.

267
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,514
Boom!

268
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,726
You should have gone into acting
instead of becoming an idol.

269
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm going for a smoke.

270
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,947
You should go home.

271
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,383
I told you to go home.

272
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,553
Oh, Yun-taek told me
not to come home before 2 a.m.

273
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,430
I'll go in a bit.

274
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,499
Why are your hands so rough?

275
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,292
Excuse me?

276
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,588
Weirdly, I seem to injure myself
every time I see you.

277
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,424
Maybe we're not meant to hang out.

278
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,470
She's pretty.

279
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,430
Jin-ju.

280
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,934
I guess.

281
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,232
I'm jealous.

282
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,904
You're jealous of her
because she's pretty?

283
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,741
I meant you.

284
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:37,707
You have a good relationship
with someone you've known for a long time.

285
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,127
I'm jealous of that.

286
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,717
So freaking jealous.

287
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,181
I can't seem to manage that, myself.

288
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,770
Hey, be careful.
You've been drinking and… God.

289
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,357
How did I end up like this?

290
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,863
You're adorable.

291
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,199
I almost did it.

292
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,160
-Did what?
-Turn away next time.

293
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,037
If you can.

294
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,108
Hey, be careful. You've been drinking and…

295
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,289
I did wash it properly.

296
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,041
Interesting, it still smells of you.

297
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,918
I guess it's the fabric softener.

298
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,548
Did you get home all right yesterday?

299
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,092
Doona told me she didn't see you leave.

300
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,093
When did you leave?

301
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,803
I just remembered!

302
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,514
I haven't had a chance to thank her yet.

303
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,143
I was so shocked,
thanks to a certain someone.

304
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,060
Who?

305
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,480
You don't have to hide it from me,
come on.

306
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,107
I saw it.

307
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,860
You and Doona kissing.

308
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,238
Kiss? Me?

309
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,156
Yes.

310
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,325
Oh, it's Se-hun.

311
00:26:58,408 --> 00:26:59,576
Se-hun!

312
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,621
I'd better go.
I'll see you at the café, Won-jun.

313
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,331
Oh, but…

314
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,803
That's not true.

315
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,906
This is a milk container.

316
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,910
Cosmetics. So this is general waste.

317
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,622
I bet your manager did this
for you in the past.

318
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,749
It's obvious
you've never done this before.

319
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,294
Why are you so irritable?

320
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,545
Are you hangry?

321
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,382
Did Jin-ju reject you?

322
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,386
What's Jin-ju got to do
with anything? Jeez.

323
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,097
Oh, this is a plastic bag.

324
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,265
I guess I was right on target.

325
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:07,519
Gotta ask someone out to get rejected.

326
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,605
Jin-ju thinks you and I are dating.

327
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,523
What?

328
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,858
Really? Why?

329
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,903
She says she saw us that day
on the rooftop.

330
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,446
When we…

331
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,240
we…

332
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,955
You should have set her straight.

333
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,876
Well, it's not like
Jin-ju and I are an item.

334
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,837
It would be weirder trying to explain it.

335
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,839
Then what should we do?

336
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,091
Do we need to date for real?

337
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,470
Why doesn't it surprise me
that you have no friends?

338
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,939
And why don't I?

339
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,818
You spit out whatever is on your mind,
whatever you want to say.

340
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,487
There aren't many people like that.

341
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,824
You don't care
if people get the wrong idea about you.

342
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,200
You don't need to hold back.

343
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,745
In some ways, I envy you.

344
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,124
What the heck? This is also general waste.

345
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:15,962
Yes.

346
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,589
You're right.

347
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,342
I do whatever the fuck I want
regardless of what others say.

348
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,762
So? Is that a bad thing?

349
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,391
Oh, so I ended up like this
because of the way I behave?

350
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,726
It's all my fault.

351
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,312
There's no way
I'm going to restart my career now,

352
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,606
so I should just sell weight loss pills
on Insta.

353
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,024
Is that what you're saying?

354
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,400
I never said that.

355
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,570
I'm going to sort the recyclables
however the fuck I want to as well.

356
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,239
Don't you fucking tell me
where to put what, goddamn it!

357
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,432
You should've kept it together.

358
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,407
Don't you think
you brought it on yourself?

359
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,110
Hey, Kooksu.

360
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,697
You know Doona from Dream Sweet
or whatever that you were crazy about?

361
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,949
Yes! The Goddess Doona!

362
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,909
-What about her?
-Is she sick by any chance?

363
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,037
I hear it's common among celebrities.
Like mental health issues.

364
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,831
Maybe she suffered from cyberbullying?

365
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,292
Of course not!

366
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,003
Doona is the type to do
whatever the hell she wants.

367
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,131
She's only left the band to focus
on her studies for the time being.

368
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,216
Only trust the facts, my friend.

369
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,719
-Is that a fact?
-Trust me!

370
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,388
But why are you asking about my Doona?

371
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,517
-Are you also a fan now?
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.

372
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,352
She just popped into my head.

373
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,770
Yeah.

374
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,566
I've been thinking
about her a lot today too.

375
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,734
How much is that?

376
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,651
Why?

377
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,590
What? Do you have something to say?

378
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,013
Have you eaten yet?

379
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,770
I made too much food for dinner.

380
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,731
If you haven't, could you wait?

381
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,317
-I'll go and bring some for you.
-No need.

382
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,217
Listen, here.

383
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,762
It's the rule to give prior notice
before bringing someone.

384
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,473
Well, I didn't exactly bring her, as such.

385
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,144
-She does live in this house too.
-Exactly!

386
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,397
You should be the one
to notify how antisocial you are

387
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,274
so she can avoid you.

388
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:52,613
Just ignore this heartless jerk.

389
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:57,118
Come and visit us any time you want. Okay?

390
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,719
Can I ask you something?

391
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,139
You really don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

392
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,600
Okay. Go ahead.

393
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:22,852
Why did you quit?

394
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,151
Maybe it's because
I've never achieved anything in my life,

395
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:33,613
but I can't imagine someone like you

396
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,698
throwing the towel in.

397
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,578
I'm sorry.
You must be sick of questions like this.

398
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,540
No. You're the first.

399
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,584
Really?

400
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,921
People prefer to believe
what they want to believe.

401
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,465
The real reason isn't important to them.

402
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,013
Cutting to the chase,

403
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,225
nothing happened.

404
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,562
It's just that all of a sudden,

405
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,942
I couldn't sing anymore.

406
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,653
That's all.

407
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,173
Do you have any coins?

408
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,136
Good luck!

409
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,389
Here I go.

410
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:58,990
Seriously?

411
00:35:59,073 --> 00:35:59,907
No!

412
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,499
-What? All of this?
-Yep.

413
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,880
Come on, hurry!

414
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,506
Here.

415
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,609
You should've kept it together.

416
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,237
I told you today's an important day.
Let's talk after this.

417
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,535
Dream Sweet, you're on in three minutes!

418
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,786
We're starting now!

419
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,288
I can't sing.

420
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,373
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,417
I can't do it.

422
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,463
You will do it. No matter what.

423
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,090
I don't have time
for your childish antics.

424
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,098
Ten seconds!

425
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,354
Five seconds!

426
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,147
Four. Three.

427
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,440
Two.

428
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,356
Stop this game

429
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,108
Waited for it

430
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:01,570
I now appear before your eyes

431
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,155
Whisper spell

432
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,782
You can't escape

433
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:07,201
I got you

434
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,536
Come to me

435
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,414
You can't see anything now

436
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,999
Both your eyes are blinded

437
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,584
And you got a no choices

438
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,961
I hypnotize you

439
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,257
Screaming out so loud…

440
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,385
Hey, Lee Doona!
You've really let yourself go!

441
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:29,098
Could you hold this in your mouth for me?

442
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,936
You make it burning, burning, burning

443
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,860
-Do you really have to make it so obvious?
-Is she for real?

444
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,239
If you want attention,
save it for your solo career.

445
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,624
This is plagiarism!

446
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,835
They're identical
even down to the composition!

447
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:58,794
You!

448
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,546
You'll lose everything

449
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:03,215
and end up
selling weight loss pills on Insta.

450
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,266
-Isn't that Lee Doona?
-What's wrong?

451
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,267
What's going on?

452
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,069
Doona.

453
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,153
Lee Doona.

454
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,364
Wake up.

455
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,407
Lee Doona!

456
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,626
I've done it!

457
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,886
-Let's go.
-Okay.

458
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,109
-It was my birthday today, you know.
-Oh, really?

459
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,487
And I just happened to make
birthday seaweed soup today? Wow.

460
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,283
You should try to eat better.
It feels sad when you don't eat properly.

461
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,244
It helps to plate things up nicely too.

462
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,665
I've realized that eating well is
the only thing I can do for myself.

463
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,546
How about you?

464
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,090
Why didn't it work out with Jin-ju?

465
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:32,430
Well, isn't that just how crushes go?

466
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,183
You foolishly read way too much
into every little detail,

467
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,770
plunging into the depths of despair
and floating among the clouds.

468
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,647
Then you go overboard

469
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,775
and drift apart.

470
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:51,073
-Are you sure she doesn't like you too?
-Absolutely sure.

471
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,324
You may be wrong.

472
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,409
How do you know?

473
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,785
You can make it wrong.

474
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,078
Right. So, how?

475
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,539
You've got to make her heart pound.

476
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,876
Girls like Jin-ju tend to like
that kind of stuff.

477
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,210
You know, right?

478
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,920
Bam, against the wall like this.

479
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,383
Try it. Push her against any wall.

480
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,553
Then look at her without saying a word.

481
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,721
For ten seconds.

482
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,640
No, ten is too long.
Five seconds is enough.

483
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,767
And then…

484
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,480
And then what?

485
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,736
You have to come up with the next part.

486
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,030
I can't do everything for you.

487
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,407
You're too demanding.

488
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:38,996
Want to practice with me?

489
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,998
I'll tell you

490
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,459
if my heart starts pounding or not.

491
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,979
Happy birthday.

492
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,028
See? It doesn't work.

493
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,283
Your birthday is over now.
Let's go in. It's really late.

494
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,258
Were you sleeping?

495
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:16,885
No.

496
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,181
Why? Do you have something to tell me?

497
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,353
There's nothing going on
between Doona and me.

498
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,314
It seemed like you got the wrong idea.

499
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,483
I just wanted to set the record straight.

500
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:35,029
Yeah?

501
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,906
Okay.

502
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,287
I'm glad.

503
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,713
Happy birthday. I'll be in touch.

504
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:34,017
