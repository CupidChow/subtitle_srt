1
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,634
DOONA!

2
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,605
Who is that?

3
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,035
Don't go.

4
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,663
Hop in.

5
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,126
EPISODE 7
CLEAR THE AIR

6
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,557
Why are you here?

7
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,603
Got a cold?

8
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,781
You have a fever. Have you seen a doctor?

9
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,329
What is it you want to say?

10
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,749
Aren't you the one
who has something to say to me?

11
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,086
Let's talk in Seoul.

12
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,760
It's time to make a comeback.

13
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,428
Any longer and you'll be forgotten.

14
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,972
What if I want to be forgotten?

15
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,478
Whether by you or by the public.

16
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,481
What will you do
if I just want to be forgotten?

17
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,694
But you don't want to.

18
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,489
Isn't that what you fear the most?

19
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,283
Being discarded, ending up all alone.

20
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,871
So that's why you did it.

21
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:12,252
You dumped me in that house by myself
and didn't once show your face…

22
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,215
so I could feel how it is to be abandoned.

23
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,177
It was your way of punishing me.

24
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,400
Stop the car.

25
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,486
I'm getting out.

26
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,950
Stop the car!

27
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,081
Don't.

28
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,168
-Stop it!
-Stop it, Lee Doona!

29
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,672
Stop it!

30
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,774
-What do you think you're doing?
-Let go of me!

31
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,402
Let go!

32
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,655
Let go!

33
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,035
Stop this.

34
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,370
Calm down.

35
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,667
That's enough!

36
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,594
I bet it was fun for you.

37
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:50,475
Thanks to you, I felt like I was sinking
into the ground every single day.

38
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,644
Don't be dramatic.

39
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,064
You're no better than my mom, you bastard!

40
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,025
You knew I had feelings for you.

41
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,779
You knew how desperately
I was waiting for you.

42
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,908
So you even took advantage
of my feelings to suck me dry.

43
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,911
You fucking disgust me!

44
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,044
You waited for me
because you liked me? Really?

45
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,339
That's not true.

46
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,591
You made a mess you couldn't clean up.

47
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,927
You needed a ticket
to return to the industry,

48
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,554
and I happened to be that ticket.
You never…

49
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,435
Do you even know
what it means to actually love someone?

50
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,773
If you'd really had any thought for me,

51
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,858
you wouldn't have behaved
that way on a stage

52
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,694
that your, my, and your team members'
lives depended on.

53
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,324
Don't act like
you're the only one who got hurt.

54
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,494
I didn't use you.
You were the one who used me.

55
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,206
The person that neglected you wasn't me

56
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,625
but you yourself.

57
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,966
Look at what you just did.

58
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,263
You have no qualms about ruining yourself.

LEE DOONA

61
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,792
Yes.

62
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,337
You're right. It is today.

63
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,632
There's been an incident.

64
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,176
Ms. Lee Doona's guardian?

65
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,594
Yeah.

66
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,597
No, I'm going to make it today
no matter what.

67
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,641
Yes, but

68
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,477
does that really need to be decided now?

69
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,688
Yes. I'll be there soon.

70
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,109
Yes, and look into that hospital
I mentioned earlier.

71
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,487
Okay.

72
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,539
LEE WON-JUN

73
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,962
You have a good relationship
with someone you've known for a long time.

74
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,506
I'm jealous of that.

75
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,758
These aren't mine.

76
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,267
You've gotten better at lying.
Stop contacting me and wait quietly.

77
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,189
RECEIVED TWO TICKETS
FOR TODAY'S LAST BUS TO SEOUL

78
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,499
MOM

79
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,856
Get in the car
unless you plan on never seeing me again.

80
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,485
Those words always scared me.

81
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,489
But somehow,
they’re not at all scary to me now.

82
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,535
Do what you want.

83
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,162
You won’t be seeing me again.

84
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,963
Then why did you come
to the showcase event?

85
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,528
KOOK'S SEAFOOD HOUSE

86
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,243
Jesus, man. Slow down.

87
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,329
What's up with you?

88
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,292
Why is everything so difficult?

89
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,507
Math is the easiest thing
in the world, isn't it?

90
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,301
Maybe for you, asshole.

91
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,270
Who do those kinds of people date?

92
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,272
Who?

93
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,445
I guess they date people like themselves.

94
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,906
Those at the top of their game.

95
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,827
If I were Doona,

96
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,830
I would date Son Heung-min.

97
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,582
Did you see his free kick yesterday?

98
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,918
That kind of trajectory is
impossible to achieve.

99
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,254
That is not the foot of a mere mortal.

100
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,800
I used to be a fan of Messi's.
But now, I'm for Son Heung-min.

104
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,519

LEE DOONA

106
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,652
Eighth grade?

107
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,740
All you have to do is to do as I say.

108
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,369
As long as you do that,
you have nothing to worry about.

109
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,248
Once you sign with us,
I'll take care of everything for you,

110
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,959
where you stay,
what you eat, what you wear.

111
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,088
But in return,
you must never hide anything from me.

112
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,506
If you do, we're done.

113
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,342
Why should I do that?

114
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,513
Are we going to be like a family?

115
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,181
Something like that.

116
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,393
Is that easier for you to understand?

117
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,219
Is it here?

118
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,724
Here?

119
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:52,946
That's enough for today.

120
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,596
This is so good! Wow!

121
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,730
This place is insane!

122
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,946
God, the house feels so empty. Right?

123
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,912
-Yun-taek.
-Yeah?

124
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,124
Well, this person--

125
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,542
Who? A girl?

126
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,256
No, a person was eating beef intestines

127
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,591
and went like this.

128
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,719
Why do you think I keep thinking about it?

129
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,596
What are you saying?

130
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,520
CHOI I-RA

131
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,751
Oh, Jeong-hun!

132
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,754
-Hi.
-That was quick.

133
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,922
You look busy.

134
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,843
-Yeah.
-How did you know I was thirsty?

135
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,136
-Thank you!
-Sure.

136
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,807
That is so refreshing!

137
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,812
What is it you need help with?

138
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,317
It's our department fashion show.

139
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,570
No need to get on stage,
but could you help me with the fitting?

140
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,156
I'll treat you to an amazing meal. Please?

141
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,160
First,

142
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,413
could you try this on for me?

143
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,331
This.

144
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,500
You can get changed over there.
If you can't manage, just holler.

145
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,212
Okay.

146
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,112
Let me ask you this! How could you do
something like that so easily?

147
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,616
That is definitely not true, I-ra.
I've never once given up on you.

148
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,284
My heart has always been yours.

149
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,661
Fuck. What are you on about?

150
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,121
I've finally realized

151
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,832
that you're the only woman in my life.

152
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,750
God.

153
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,128
Have you run out of money?

154
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,466
I'm into someone else now,
you crazy bastard!

155
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,593
Hey, baby.

156
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:28,036
Can you take a look at this for me?
Is this how it's supposed to be?

157
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,957
-Right.
-I-ra.

158
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,088
Don't do this, I-ra. Let's start over.

159
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,382
What are you doing? You're hurting me!

160
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,550
Please.

161
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,223
Just pay my wife back, asshole.

162
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,684
And hands off
if you know what's good for you.

163
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,898
The sweet smell of money!

164
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,901
Smell it.

165
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,741
Hey! Here!

166
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:09,494
You've got to do this.
One more time. Oh yeah.

167
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,956
One more time. Oh yeah!

168
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,705
Hi.

169
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,506
Are you back from visiting home?

170
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,258
Yes.

171
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,510
That's good.

172
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,348
When does break start?
You can take about a week off, right?

173
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,600
Shall we go abroad nearby?

174
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,312
Japan? Or Guam?

175
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,735
When did you get back?

176
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,861
This morning.

177
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,657
-And how's your cold?
-I'm okay.

178
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,536
That's good.

179
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,914
I'm going up. I'm tired.

180
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,834
Look, say what you want to say…

181
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,422
and stop being so frustrating.

182
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,386
If I say what I want to right now,
I'll regret it.

183
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,720
So say it.

184
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,014
I can take whatever you say.

185
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:00,397
Ask me what I did with him.
That's what you want to know, isn't it?

186
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,898
-What?
-Why? Isn't it?

187
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,359
In your head,
you're imagining all sorts of things,

188
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,320
but you don't have the guts
to get mad at me.

189
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,699
Is this your way of saying sorry?

190
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,994
Or are you not even sorry?

191
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,539
What right do I have to get mad at you?

192
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,417
I don't want to know
what you did with that guy.

193
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,128
What I want to know is
what you are doing with me.

194
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,630
I thought it didn't matter to me

195
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,091
whether you're leaning on me
because you're lonely

196
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,342
or just playing around.

197
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,597
Since I liked you and I was okay with it,
I thought it didn't matter.

198
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,020
But I guess I'm not that tolerant.

199
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,607
You don't have to have feelings for me.

200
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,525
Why would someone like you want to have…

201
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,700
But this is going too far.

202
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,785
Even for you.

203
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,059
Hey, Won-jun,

204
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,854
you're staying here over winter break,
right? The landlady was asking.

205
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,191
I'll be moving out. I'll let her know.

206
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,027
What?

207
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,530
Really? Why?

208
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,960
Yes, I'm doing my best to sort things out.

209
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,380
I'll update you as soon as I have news.
I'm sorry.

210
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,146
Why did you do it?

211
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,608
Lee Doona.

212
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,743
I already told you.

213
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,497
I just can't sing.

214
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,628
Fine.

215
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,088
Then take a break.

216
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,075
Yes, Ms. Ma.

217
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,827
It's not going to work.

218
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,664
We'll have to take Doona out
and continue with four.

219
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,040
I'm sorry.

220
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,366
Welcome.

221
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:56,526
A milkshake?

222
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,780
-You really have given up on everything.
-I have.

223
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,952
I sleep all day,
eat whatever, and do nothing.

224
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,246
So, do you feel smug?

225
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,665
Watching us crash and burn?

226
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,461
I thought I would, but not really.

227
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,755
You should've done a better job.

228
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,466
Tell me about it.

229
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,094
I wish we could have shown you.

230
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,730
About what you said, that you can't sing,

231
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,232
I believe you.

232
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,820
I believed you back then too.

233
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:47,702
We may not have been friends,

234
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,122
but we were at least comrades in arms.

235
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,334
So I could tell.

236
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,296
I thought you'd be resentful of me.

237
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,257
If you hadn't jumped off then,

238
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,843
I probably would've myself.

239
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,436
I don't hate you. You know that, right?

240
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,566
I wanted to be like you, but I couldn't,

241
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,403
and I didn't want to hate myself for it,

242
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,740
so I think I hated you instead.

243
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,921
10 YEARS LATER GROUND

244
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,144
I'm sorry, we're closed.

245
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,444
I left some of my stuff here.

246
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,739
Come in.

247
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,051
-Sorry, excuse me.
-Oh, sure.

248
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,618
Are you still in your mini-studio?

249
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,954
I found a studio apartment
within only a few days.

250
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,166
It's a bit far from campus,
but it's not too bad.

251
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,419
I feel much better
than when I was commuting from Yangjin.

252
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,671
I'm glad to hear that.

253
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,591
How does it feel to be dating?

254
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,134
Are you happy?

255
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,601
I kept my distance from you for a bit.

256
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:22,231
You felt like a different person
when you were with her.

257
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,443
Like someone I'd never met before.

258
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,241
I'm saying you've changed in a good way.

259
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,495
I really mean it.

260
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,375
Lee Won-jun who's head over heels.
That's a rare thing!

261
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,970
You are invited to a Churrasco Night
of Unity and Forgiveness!

262
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,472
Place, the house. Time, right now.

263
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,599
-Hostess, I-ra Choi.
-I-ra is so funny.

264
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,064
Do you want to go there?
Everyone will want to see you.

265
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,610
No.

266
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,115
You told me

267
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,034
not to let anyone treat me badly.

268
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,370
But when I thought about it,

269
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,873
I realized I was the one
who mistreated myself most.

270
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,629
I'm treating myself better
by not being friends with you.

271
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,174
It still hurts, you see.

272
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,221
Who knows?

273
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:39,559
With time, when there comes a point
when all I feel is joy when I see you,

274
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,603
maybe we can be friends then.

275
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,357
Please understand that,
even if you feel disappointed.

276
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,334
In your head,
you're imagining all sorts of things,

277
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,420
but you don't have the guts
to get mad at me.

278
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,340
Is this your way of saying sorry?

279
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,802
Or are you not even sorry?

280
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,472
I thought it didn't matter to me

281
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,891
whether you're leaning on me
because you're lonely

282
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,350
or just playing around.

283
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,521
Since I liked you and I was okay with it,
I thought it didn't matter.

284
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,401
But I guess I'm not that tolerant.

285
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,630
Are you moving out?

286
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,048
Yes.

287
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,634
-Where to?
-I don't know.

288
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,261
What if I told you not to?

289
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,017
-Do I have to answer that?
-Yes, you do.

290
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,525
Could you leave my room?

291
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,962
Stop this. You smell of cigarette smoke.

292
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,380
But I quit.

293
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,091
Maybe it's his smell, then.

294
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,096
You're a real jealous type.

295
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,100
What? Does he not want you?

296
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,519
Is that why you need me again?

297
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,813
I'd stop there,
while I still find it cute.

298
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,194
I'm staying here.

299
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,030
Drag me out if you can.

300
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,491
I'm telling you
I want you out of my sight!

301
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,326
Why are you insisting on being here?

302
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,995
Because I want company.

303
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,788
Which doesn't have to be me!

304
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:06,706
It does.

305
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,458
It does have to be you.

306
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,758
Then why did you do that to me?

307
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,636
Because I didn't know

308
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,015
that the person I didn't want to lose…

309
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,226
was you.

310
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,647
I don't know a lot,

311
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,276
and I'm always slow
at realizing my own feelings.

312
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:39,071
I only find out
after I've lost everything.

313
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,948
And then I regret it.

314
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,826
It drives me crazy too.

315
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,289
So, can't you go easy on me, please?

316
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,252
You're a real mess. You know that?

317
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,963
You're selfish and unstable,

318
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,299
and you hurt me without a second thought.

319
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,636
That's why it feels so unfair.

320
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,722
You're the one that came
and shook me up out of nowhere,

321
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,849
but now, I'm the one

322
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,229
who wants you to be mine so much
it's driving me crazy.

323
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,444
So tell me you're sorry.

324
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,368
-I'm sorry.
-Tell me that you like me.

325
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,872
Tell me that you like me and not him.

326
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,751
Please.

327
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,547
I love you.

328
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:09,745
Won-jun.

329
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:11,831
Yeah?

330
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,625
Don't hate me.

331
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,961
I don't hate you.

332
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,966
I tried, but I couldn't.

333
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,094
I don't mean now.

334
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,972
I mean going forward.

335
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,142
I promise I won't.

336
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,397
Does this mean we've made up?

337
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,566
Yes.

338
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,485
So easily?

339
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,532
I've always been easy.
I was just pretending to be difficult.

340
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,170
It has to be you for me too.

341
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:21,275
Do you remember the song
I gave up writing halfway through?

342
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,153
During our second album, I think.

343
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,491
I'd forgotten the melody,

344
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,452
but it's come back to me.

345
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,916
-That's good.
-It is.

346
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,213
To the point where I actually wonder
if it's okay to feel so good.

347
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,095
You should drink that. You ordered it.

348
