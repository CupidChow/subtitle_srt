1
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:48,506
DOONA!

00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,170
EPISODE 5
MEANINGLESS KISS

3
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,537
What was our assignment again?

4
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,165
-Oh, hey.
-Hey, you're here.

5
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,419
-I'll be off, then.
-Bye.

6
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,148
Hi.

7
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,114
Could I talk to you for a second?

8
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,117
Sure.

9
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,494
Go ahead.

10
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,710
About what?

11
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,011
Was it touching you? Sorry.

12
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,723
Why did you do that yesterday?

13
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,766
Yesterday?

14
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,231
We kissed yesterday.

15
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,944
I just did it.

16
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,863
What other reason is there
to kiss someone?

17
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,783
Why? Was it not very good?

18
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,497
Do you like me?

19
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,125
Do you?

20
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,631
See? You don't.

21
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,592
I don't kiss my friends.

22
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:07,890
So let's not do anything
other than what we can do as friends.

23
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,104
Wanting comfort from someone
because you're lonely

24
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,106
and going through a rough time,
I get that.

25
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,359
But that feeling can fool you.

26
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,486
You'll get hurt that way.

27
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,114
Hey,

28
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,825
you're such a bore.

29
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,538
You're all of 21 years old.
Why do you take everything so seriously?

30
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,959
It's not like I asked you to be lovers.

31
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,919
It gave me butterflies.

32
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,801
And I don't want to feel that way
over something meaningless.

33
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,305
It's okay to get butterflies from me.

34
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:52,018
Everyone does and then gets over it.
You think you're any different?

35
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,425
SEEKING FEMALE ROOMMATE
FOR FIRST FLOOR OF SHARED HOUSE

36
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,067
Excuse me! Could you hold
the elevator for me? Wait!

37
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,277
Wait!

38
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,572
Oh, thank you!

39
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,282
So sorry!

40
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,743
-Thank you.
-Jeez, you could have taken the next one.

41
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,541
-The kissing king!
-The samba girl?

42
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,418
Yes, it's me, the samba girl!

43
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,003
Yes, it's me! This is crazy!

44
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,549
-Where are you going? To a lecture?
-No, I'm…

45
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,844
Oh, I'll contact you
to give you the details.

46
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,846
-I'll contact you in a bit!
-Yeah, sure.

47
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:10,888
Thank you.

48
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,813
-Let me crash in your room for a bit.
-I'm off.

49
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,107
Honey!

50
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,485
You piece of trash! Get out of my sight!

51
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,241
-What do I do?
-Hey.

52
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,912
I've been kicked out of my dorm.

53
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,622
Can't you help me out?

54
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,550
About what you said to me last time.

55
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,261
You mean when I told you
about my feelings for you?

56
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:52,638
Yes.

57
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,224
I want to give you my answer.

58
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,726
You can take your time.

59
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,520
I feel like I know what's coming.

60
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,690
I have feelings for someone else.

61
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,862
-If I gave you mixed signals--
-You mean Won-jun?

62
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:16,496
You never gave me mixed signals.
I knew. I just chose to ignore it.

63
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,583
I'm sorry.

64
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,129
LITERARY SOCIETY
SPARK

65
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,320
MOVING OUT? YOU'RE PENNILESS. COME HOME,
OR I WON'T SUPPORT YOU EVER AGAIN

66
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,535
I'M AT THE PARKING LOT
GET OVER HERE AS SOON AS YOU'RE DONE

67
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,079
HAVE YOU FINALLY LOST IT?
HOW DARE YOU IGNORE MY CALLS?

68
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,207
MOM SAYS YOU WORK PART-TIME. STUDY MORE,
DON'T HANG OUT LIKE A SLUT. REPLY!

69
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,846
GOODBYE

70
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,519
DAD
BLOCK CONTACT

71
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,614
Won-jun.

72
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,924
What is this place? It's pretty.

73
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:52,842
Hey.

74
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,177
Come over here.

75
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,764
You can see your place from here too.

76
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,892
I didn't know
there was an open rooftop here.

77
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,894
There's a lot you don't know.

78
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,779
What are you thinking about?

79
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,740
Just that

80
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,535
there are so many buildings out there,
but not one belongs to me.

81
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,997
-I guess we're all the same.
-No, not you.

82
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,376
Why not me?

83
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,712
I didn't mean anything by it.

84
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,466
I just didn't think
that's something you'd worry about.

85
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,011
Jin-ju.

86
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,350
Stop acting like you know me.

87
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,778
What's wrong?

88
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,073
Is there something I'm missing about you?

89
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,797
I'm sorry.

90
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,344
This wasn't what I wanted to talk about.

91
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,305
I'm being such a nuisance.

92
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,061
Don't drift too far away.

93
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,191
That's all I wanted to say.

94
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,903
Please don't let anything else happen.

95
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,239
I can't take anymore.

96
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:37,047
Hey, everyone! I, Choi I-ra, am moving!

97
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,312
Yay! Forward, backward!

98
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,522
To the left, to the right!

99
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,775
-Isn't that Cute Guy?
-Where?

100
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,067
Hey, Cute Guy!

101
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,153
-Hello!
-Cute Guy!

102
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,113
-Oh, you're right!
-It is Cute Guy!

103
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,241
-Hello!
-Hi! How have you been?

104
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,202
How have you been?

105
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,413
What's going on?

106
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,917
She got kicked out, so I told her
about the room. Good work, right?

107
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,086
-Hey!
-Hey, Cute Guy!

108
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,925
-I-ra, coming here was a great choice!
-Hey, Cute Guy!

109
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,598
Hey, it's Lee Doona from Dream Sweet.

110
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,809
-Hello.
-Hey, it's Lee Doona.

111
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,727
-Hello.
-Hello.

112
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,063
She's pretty.

113
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,649
-She's so pretty.
-She's really pretty.

114
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:37,775
-So pretty!
-It's Doona.

115
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,692
Won-jun.

116
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,821
Look at her.

117
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,660
She got here fast.

118
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,585
Thank you.

119
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,593
She left home, so I told her to come.
Good work, right?

120
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,845
-Hello.
-Hello.

121
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,436
-Hey, Yun-taek!
-Could you take this?

122
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,313
-Put it there.
-No!

123
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,107
Yun-taek, put it here!

124
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,192
-Hey!
-Don't put it there!

125
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,527
It looks better here.

126
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,153
-No!
-Just leave it here for now.

127
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,197
-No, let go!
-This is better.

128
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,574
Let's leave it here for now.

129
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,784
Won-jun! Wait for me!

130
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,787
What on earth are you wearing?
Aren't those pajamas?

131
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,746
Aren't they cute?

132
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,458
I treated my roomies to the same ones
as a housewarming gift.

133
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,379
-Do you want a pair too?
-I'll pass, thanks.

134
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,006
I know you want them.

135
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,844
-Hey.
-What?

136
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,096
What's she like? Doona, I mean.

137
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,348
Shouldn't you call her Unni?

138
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,184
Why would I?
We're the same age.

139
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,313
Give me some intel!
I have to live with her now.

140
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,773
What kind of person is Doona?

141
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,276
I have no idea myself

142
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,570
what goes on in her head.

143
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,787
I'm back! Come here.

144
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,541
Oh, you bought beer.

145
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,752
Let's drink ourselves stupid!

146
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,128
-Give me one.
-Sure.

147
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,380
This is heavy.
How did you carry this here alone?

148
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,715
I found a servant upstairs.

149
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,009
Why? You want to come in too?

150
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,762
-No.
-I wasn't going to let you in anyway.

151
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,805
You're an outcast now! Good night!

152
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,351
-So, then you must know Kooksu too?
-Of course!

153
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,268
Really?

154
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,604
He's inherited the business,
and he's now the CEO!

155
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,106
No way! That lucky so-and-so!

156
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,275
-You're annoyed!
-I'm really annoyed!

157
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,861
-His name is Kooksu?
-His name is Su-jin!

158
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,446
Jinx!

159
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,658
Kook Su-jin, right?

160
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,661
-Yup. Kooksu is really funny.
-Yeah, he really is.

161
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,455
Then you must also know Happy Pharmacy?

162
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,957
Of course! It's still there!

163
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,625
-It's still there?
-Yes!

164
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,169
-Oh, that place!
-What about it?

165
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,880
Kook Su-jin used to have a crush
on the owner's daughter,

166
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,216
so he'd always go there
to get an energy drink

167
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,009
and ended up getting addicted to it.

168
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,138
And since Won-jun was always with him,
he got addicted too!

169
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,642
The two idiots walked around
like this all the time.

170
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,450
Why are you coming outside?

171
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,202
I-ra's on the phone with her mom.

172
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,840
It must be hard
to suddenly live with others.

173
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,138
I've lived in dorms for a long time.
It must be more uncomfortable for you.

174
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,100
It feels like a school trip. It's fun.

175
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,477
School trip?

176
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,939
I've never been on one of those.

177
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,527
Let's go on one sometime, the three of us.

178
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,778
In school uniform.

179
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,406
Sounds good.

180
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,461
Why did you

181
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,839
suddenly decide to get roommates?

182
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,883
What about you?

183
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,303
Why did you suddenly leave home?

184
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,513
The timing was right.

185
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,142
All those things that had gone wrong

186
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,979
and all those things
that had piled up over time

187
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:49,860
exploding due to something utterly trivial
in one crucial moment.

188
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,445
I think that's what happened.

189
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,157
In more ways than one.

190
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,539
It's also why I told Won-jun
how I felt about him.

191
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,919
-Did you?
-Yes.

192
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,963
Not in so many words,

193
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,549
but he probably understood.

194
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,974
I've come here to hear his response.

195
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,479
-I don't want to lose him this time.
-That's unfortunate.

196
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,943
I can offer you a room,

197
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,655
but I can't root for you in that regard.

198
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,033
Because I've gotten myself involved too.

199
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,004
Doona…

200
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,426
I know Won-jun well.

201
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,429
He always overthinks things,

202
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,518
and he's cautious about everything,
almost to the point of excess.

203
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,437
He doesn't get involved in anything

204
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,983
unstable and precarious,
things that are certain to burn him.

205
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,112
He and I have known each other
for a long time. We were very close.

206
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,948
And had feelings for each other.

207
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,703
That's very special too.

208
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,211
We're late! Let's make a run for it!
I have a lecture in first period!

209
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,423
-No!
-We're going to be late anyway.

210
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:35,507
Your girlfriend.

211
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,051
-Let's take a taxi. My bag's so heavy.
-It's hot!

212
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,429
-We'll be late even by taxi.
-What's with all this?

213
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,515
Get lost unless you're going to
carry it for me. Here! Let's go.

214
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,392
What's your problem?

215
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,146
-You jerk! What's wrong with you?
-Let's get something to eat first.

216
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,772
That's very special too.

217
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,233
Being familiar,

218
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,612
having shared memories,

219
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,489
living in the same world.

220
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,284
That's powerful too.

221
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,164
That's what I'm putting my faith in.

222
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,667
-Hey!
-We should eat first.

223
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,086
-That hurts!
-What's wrong? Are you all right?

224
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,881
Hold on! Sorry!

225
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,090
Seriously!

226
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,634
-Come on!
-Get a move on!

227
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,720
-Hey!
-Come on, let's eat first!

228
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,598
Hey! Won-jun!

229
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,690
How's it going with the celebrity?
Are you friends yet? What's she like?

230
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,108
How should I put it?

231
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,860
She's got a reputation.

232
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,279
I'm not sure.
She's just like everyone else.

233
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,740
Then how about the guys?

234
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,665
What's that face for?

235
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,001
What's going on with your nostrils?
What is it? You're scaring me.

236
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,718
Actually,

237
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,263
this morning…

238
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,514
-Yeah?
-Yeah?

239
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,816
MEN
CLOSE THE CURTAIN BEFORE SHOWERING

240
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,468
I-ra Choi!

241
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,640
-Marry him!
-Marry him!

242
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,225
-Marry him!
-Marry him!

243
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,318
It gave me butterflies.

244
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,324
And I don't want to feel that way
over something meaningless.

245
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,271
Be careful around people.
Because it shows.

246
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,651
What shows?

247
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,779
Your loneliness.

248
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,034
Your desperation for love
to compensate for the lack of it.

249
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,954
Your anxiousness
over losing people's interest.

250
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:47,092
-The samba girl, I-ra Choi!
-The kissing king, Yun-taek!

251
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,931
Why are you so hyped?

252
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,769
-Thanks for cooking.
-Sure.

253
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,231
-Would you like any help?
-No need. I'm all done.

254
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,777
Do you have a blanket I could use?

255
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,613
Oh, there's one in my bedroom,
on the chair.

256
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,533
Okay. Thank you.

257
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,302
THE ART OF MATHEMATICS

258
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,822
Have you found it?

259
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,282
Yes!

260
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,412
-Then come out for some beer.
-Sure.

261
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,059
Wasn't that a celebrity?
Did I just gasp too loudly?

262
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,564
She's from Dream Sweet!

263
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,873
-You know me, right?
-Huh?

264
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,334
Lee Doona!

265
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,388
What an honor.

266
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,474
A celebrity recognizing someone
who's just an old idol trainee.

267
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,312
I don't know.
It's good to see a familiar face.

268
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,897
A bit like meeting a fellow Korean
in a foreign country.

269
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,693
You're even prettier than before.
What are you up to now?

270
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,153
Nothing.

271
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:58,158
It's a shame. What were you thinking?
You were doing well.

272
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:02,370
-Well, I screwed it all up.
-Yeah.

273
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,625
I feel like I could put up
with any shit thrown my way once I debut,

274
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,003
but then I'm told
there's always new shit that comes up.

275
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,213
It must have been tough.

276
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,137
-Do you want to go somewhere else?
-Why not?

277
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,473
People are, you know,

278
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:27,687
designed to instinctively recognize others
that are similar to themselves.

279
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,273
-Take I-ra Choi here, for example.
-Yes!

280
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,776
The moment I saw her, I knew right away

281
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,154
that she was totally my kind of person.

282
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,365
-That's so nice!
-Totally my kind of person.

283
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,535
Jin-ju and Won-jun, it's exactly the same
for you guys, isn't it?

284
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,497
Birds of a feather. Right?

285
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,590
-Yay!
-Yay! Here.

286
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,801
-The kissing king!
-The kissing king!

287
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,053
-Seriously!
-Stop complaining.

288
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,097
-I'm sorry.
-Do you want me to carry her?

289
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,224
I'll carry her. You can…

290
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,477
-Just open the door, will you?
-Okay.

291
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,147
-Jeez, this girl is so weird.
-Hey, be quiet!

292
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,148
Stop it!

293
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,067
Do you want to go for a walk?

294
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,570
Let's go.

295
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,221
I want to do that.

296
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,123
Leave it.

297
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,544
It's broken.

298
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,927
OUT OF ORDER!

299
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,515
I thought I'd sooner die
than tell you about my family.

300
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,561
I was really happy

301
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,814
that day.

302
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,361
The person I liked had told me
that he liked me.

303
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,792
I like you.

304
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,129
My heart felt like it was about to burst.

305
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,632
I felt like I got everything
I ever wanted.

306
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,134
I wanted to scream and shout,
I was so happy.

307
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:16,314
There were so many things
I wanted to do with you.

308
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,902
And it felt like all of it was possible.

309
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,488
You!

310
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:27,367
Write down on here
everything you got up to with the guy.

311
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,830
I said, do it now! You bitch!

312
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,666
Please, honey! Just stop!

313
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:46,386
It was like falling out of a dream
and back to reality with a thud.

314
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,975
The Kim Jin-ju that Won-jun liked,

315
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,937
the one that was always cheerful,
smiling, and self-confident, was fake.

316
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,524
The real me was the miserable person

317
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,819
who lived with this mess of a family.

318
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,742
I suddenly lost all courage.

319
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,711
Don't you have anything
you want to tell me?

320
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,680
I…

321
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,559
really liked you a lot.

322
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,293
I really liked you a lot.

323
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,089
So much so
that I didn't want to see you again

324
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,383
in case I fell for you like that again

325
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,261
and ended up getting hurt.

326
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,223
So much so that when we met again,

327
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:19,896
I couldn't even tell whether I still had
those feelings for you or not.

328
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,150
I wish I could have comforted you

329
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,903
when you were going through a rough time.

330
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,197
But now…

331
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,159
too much time has passed.

332
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,204
You could comfort me now.

333
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,540
Comfort me. Please?

334
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,419
Comfort me, support me,

335
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,382
and like me, just like you did before.

336
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,890
It's you and me we're talking about.

337
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:02,855
I'm sorry.

338
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:09,570
I asked you out on a walk
because I felt I needed to say sorry.

339
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,111
Bye.

340
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,328
What the fuck?
What do you think you're doing?

341
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,708
Right.

342
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,127
So this is how you mess with people.

343
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,546
I've come across a lot of people
who can't stand you.

344
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,507
Now I know why.

345
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,259
Then get lost.

346
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,346
Are you trying to get his attention?

347
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,269
Park In-wook.

348
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,943
Must suck for you though. It seems like
the man's cut you off for good.

349
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,447
What's going on?

350
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,118
Who the hell are you?

351
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,665
Is this the kid
you've been hanging out with?

352
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,375
You…

353
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,337
-How old are you?
-Why? How old are you?

354
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,839
What was that, you little shit?

355
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,051
Hey! Let's go.
I left my phone in your car.

356
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,263
I'll get it for you.

357
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,182
Let's go.

358
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,395
Unbelievable.

359
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,038
-What are you doing?
-Are you a friend?

360
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:06,998
What?

361
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,500
I'm asking if you're a friend of Doona's.

362
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,047
She doesn't have any friends.

363
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,386
I'm in the same position as you. She…

364
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,223
Why am I laughing about this?

365
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,350
She's just throwing herself at anyone

366
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,020
to grab the attention
of that asshole, Park In-wook.

367
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,980
I know it's her habit to do that,

368
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,482
but if I get picked, why not?
It's a free lunch, right?

369
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,905
What? Are you going to punch me?

370
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,742
Just get the hell out of here.

371
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,996
Why? Do you think you're different?

372
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,249
What, are you fucking in love with her?

373
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,380
Fuck!

374
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,091
Fuck!

375
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,552
You son of a…

376
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,507
What goes on in that mind of yours?

377
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,888
I'm dying to know.

378
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,583
It's okay to get butterflies from me.
Everyone does and then gets over it.

379
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,543
You think you're any different?

380
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,476
What are you doing here?

381
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,330
Have you been exercising?
You're covered in sweat.

382
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:44,090
What? Is this off-limits too?

383
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,719
Butterflies again?

384
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,811
This is hard.

385
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,669
Hey!

386
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,070
Can I ask you something?

387
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,159
You said I'm no different. To who?

388
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,911
The guy from tonight? No? Then who?

389
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,124
Perhaps you've forgotten?

390
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,043
You said it was meaningless.

391
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,921
Although I didn't deny it

392
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,257
because you could be right.

393
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,388
That's why I decided
to hang out with other people.

394
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,348
I was curious, too…

395
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,727
whether my feelings for you

396
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,938
mean that I like you…

397
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,109
or that I'm tired of being alone?

398
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,531
But what will you do
if that's not the case?

399
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,785
What if I'm surrounded by other people,

400
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,623
but I still like you and still miss you?

401
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,128
If it actually turns out
that I've fallen for you,

402
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,465
what will you do then?

403
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,475
See?

404
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,520
You can't answer either, can you?

405
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,889
You said you don't kiss your friends.

406
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:41,517
I don't.

407
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:39,737
