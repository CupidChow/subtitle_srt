1
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:49,716
DOONA!

2
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,777
You're so heavy!

3
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,975
-Hello.
-Hi.

4
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,062
-These are all so pretty.
-Feel free to take a look.

5
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,110
This one is pretty.

6
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,027
-Is it?
-Yes.

7
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,113
-We have a matching one for men.
-Do you?

8
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:55,824
Try it on.

9
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,368
Hurry and try it on.

10
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,328
What do you think?

11
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,872
-It's nice!
-It really is nice.

12
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,499
EPISODE 8
TYPICAL AND ORDINARY

13
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,251
-Shall we get them?
-Sounds good to me.

14
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:10,380
You say

15
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:17,303
That I'm always a genuine soul

16
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:26,062
You also say

17
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,983
That at least for today

18
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,777
I am everyone's lover

19
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:39,742
Tonight the clowns' farce wins applause

20
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:47,500
As once again the fake masquerades as art

21
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,089
Wear your leather…

22
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,133
MOM

23
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:03,141
Like a Hollywood movie star

24
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,733
MOM

25
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:25,997
I sometimes

26
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:34,839
See myself in you

27
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,180
One day

28
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,681
My ugly…

29
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,599
Right.

30
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,812
If that's what the doctor said,
that's what we should do.

31
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:54,609
If you've decided, don't put it off.
Ask them to schedule the surgery ASAP.

32
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,361
Okay, bye.

33
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,452
MINSONG NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENT OF CLOTHING

34
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,539
COME PICK ME UP
I'M TOO DRUNK TO WALK

35
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,124
-Here's more.
-Put it over there.

36
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,918
Well, I've sent it.

37
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,382
It's going to be so embarrassing
if no one comes.

38
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,176
Then that's just her fate.

39
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,723
-To fate!
-To fate!

40
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,724
Cheers!

41
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,199
The fortune teller told me

42
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,535
that I'm going to be
very lucky in love today.

43
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,452
-Really?
-Yes.

44
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,746
-I'm counting on you today.
-You can count on me.

45
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:53,126
Come pick me up right now.

46
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,336
I'm too drunk to walk.

47
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,217
-Hey, I've got to go.
-What?

48
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,678
-I have to go.
-Where are you going?

49
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,679
What? Oh, I--

50
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,180
-Wait.
-Let go! I have to go.

51
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,891
-Where are you going?
-Look, I'll be back.

52
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,268
-Yun-taek!
-Bye!

53
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,353
Useless jerks, all of them.

54
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,820
Someone's here.

55
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,657
Hey, someone's here.

56
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,037
Oh, fudge. It’s true.

57
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,292
Hey, wake up.

58
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,752
Wake up.

59
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,816
We're home!

60
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,278
We're home!

61
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,572
Christ, I'm exhausted.

62
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,617
No!

63
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,341
What are you looking at?

64
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,926
It’s making me want to kiss you.

65
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,691
Damn it!

66
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,404
Why did you dodge me?
Don't you know how to kiss?

67
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,446
You're drunk.

68
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,949
I'm stone sober now, thanks to you!

69
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,284
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure!

70
00:06:58,793 --> 00:06:59,794
I like you too.

71
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,713
I'm not the only one who's clueless.

72
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,636
Wow.

73
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,556
Shit.

74
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,100
He's so damn hot.

75
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,887
-You're so cute.
-You're so cute!

76
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,473
Won-taek is kind of cute, like tofu.
Don't you think?

77
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,975
Tofu! Won-taek, like tofu!

78
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,521
-Stinky tofu! It's stinky tofu.
-Right? It's the color of stinky tofu!

79
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,815
-So cute!
-It's Yun-taek, okay?

80
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,358
-Won-taek!
-Won-taek!

81
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,194
-Let's have a toast!
-Toast!

82
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,237
Where's I-ra?

83
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,115
Come on. Drink.

84
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,867
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

85
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,079
You drink so well!

86
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,957
-That is good.
-But what's this? Isn't this a dimple?

87
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,918
He even has dimples!

88
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,420
-So cute!
-Your dimples are so cute!

89
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,172
-Oh my!
-He's dressed so well too.

90
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,715
Let's do this properly, then.

91
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,761
-The stinky tofu is stripping.
-I'll pour you a drink!

92
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,096
Love it!

93
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,556
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

94
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:04,043
You say

95
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:10,716
That I'm always a genuine soul

96
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:19,016
You also say

97
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,396
That at least for today

98
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,274
I am everyone's lover

99
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,822
Tonight the clowns' farce wins applause

100
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,118
As once again…

101
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,012
Step, step, step, step, step

102
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,849
Step, step, step, step, step…

103
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,870
I just realized…

104
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,588
Yay! It's the sea!

105
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,341
It's right before us!

106
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,093
So amazing.

107
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,512
Be careful! You'll fall over at that rate.

108
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,693
This is so nice.

109
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,572
Honestly, your tastes are so predictable.

110
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,867
I've always been that way.

111
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,537
I like the most typical

112
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,415
and ordinary things.

113
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,750
It doesn't suit you.

114
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,394
Don't you want to go back?

115
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,189
-What?
-To what you were doing before.

116
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,193
There must have been
some things you liked about it.

117
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,404
You just lost sight of them.

118
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,452
Would you let me go?

119
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,582
What kind of question is that?
You should go if you want to.

120
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,544
But I think it would be nice.

121
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,506
I want to see you sing.

122
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,438
I like that you're a fool.

123
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,279
What if they tell me to break up with you?

124
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,281
Should I still go back?

125
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,335
Hello?

126
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,253
Your voice is a bit hoarse.

127
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,049
-Are you having a rough time?
-Yes.

128
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,388
I only got here a few days ago,
and I miss you already.

129
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,016
Me too.

130
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,314
Is it raining there too?

131
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,028
No. It's overcast,
but it's not raining yet.

132
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,082
Apparently,
it's going to rain a lot this year.

133
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,763
I SAW MY LOVE DOONA
AT THE NERD CONNECTION'S CONCERT

134
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,223
DOONA THE GODDESS! BEAUTIFUL!

135
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,518
Lee Doona!

136
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,645
LEE DOONA MADE A SURPRISE APPEARANCE

137
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,273
Lee Doona!

138
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,350
CERTIFIED MAIL

139
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,770
LAWSUIT NOTICE FOR DAMAGES CLAIM
RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT

140
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,440
Hello. I am Jung Ji-guk,the legal
representative of MSA Entertainment.

141
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,569
My client has started proceedings
against you for financial damages.

142
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,698
I believe you’ve received
the certified mail.

143
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,036
From this point on, I would prefer
to speak with your legal representative.

144
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,750
LAWSUIT NOTICE FOR DAMAGES CLAIM
RELATED TO BREACH OF CONTRACT

145
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,212
YOU HAVE INCURRED A PENALTY
DUE TO YOUR UNILATERAL BREACH OF CONTRACT

146
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,226
Don't smoke in here.

147
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,611
Did you really have to go this far?

148
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,450
You think it was me?

149
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,666
I wouldn't have stopped at this.

150
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,169
We agreed to terminate the contract
on the condition

151
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,296
that I did not sign with another agency.

152
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,386
Did you think that would be possible?

153
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,638
I may have washed my hands of you,

154
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,600
but I can't stop Ms. Ma's actions.

155
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:46,482
You've set a bad example in the industry.
No company would let you off the hook.

156
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,320
And if they don't?

157
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,322
Irrespective of the compensation,

158
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,325
they'll drag the trial out
for as long as possible to torment you

159
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:59,787
and destroy your public image
with an endless smear campaign

160
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,371
with no regard for the truth.

161
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,332
A comeback after that?

162
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,543
You couldn't even if you wanted to.

163
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,225
Just tell me what I need to do.

164
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,395
Don't you already know
that this is your chance?

165
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,649
I've taken care of the videos
that were posted online.

166
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,151
For your part, get rid of that boy first.

167
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,155
If you do make a comeback,
they'll rip you to shreds because of him.

168
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,163
-Have you got everything?
-Of course! I have everything.

169
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,081
Me too.

170
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,208
-We have enough, right?
-Of course!

171
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,752
-Yes, definitely!
-Here, left pocket.

172
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,296
Got it.

173
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,594
Stop right there. What's that ring?

174
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,179
Do you have a girlfriend?

175
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,933
-Took you long enough to notice!
-I know! Is she pretty?

176
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,144
-Yes.
-Asshole! What about me, man?

177
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,187
-I want to meet her.
-All right, soon.

178
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,982
Tell me how I can meet a pretty girl.

179
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,114
Won-yeong is being discharged on Sunday.

180
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,867
I'll come up straight after,
even if it ends up being late.

181
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,202
Oh, I have to go.

182
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,581
-Okay, then.
-I'll call you.

183
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,557
I'm off to Na-yeong's.

184
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,893
Okay. Oh! Take this.

185
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,103
It's from Doona.

186
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,480
Thank you.

187
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,358
-See you later.
-Bye.

188
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,616
You really didn't have to bring anything.

189
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,785
-So you're taking time off school.
-Yes.

190
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,164
I've cut ties with my dad,
so I can't afford the fees.

191
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,875
And you and Won-jun are
such eyesores to me.

192
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,251
There are multiple reasons.

193
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,879
You don't have to be quite so honest.

194
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,758
I got a job at a cram school.
I'll treat you sometime.

195
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,721
I guess you don't hate me that much, then?

196
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,602
My dad has run
in three National Assembly elections

197
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,687
and failed to get elected all three times.

198
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,650
And every time it happens,
he loves to bad-mouth the winner.

199
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,903
I mean, how is that the winner’s fault?

200
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,031
Tripping yourself up

201
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,409
and then blaming someone else
makes you look so pathetic.

202
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,124
I have to say,
your dad really is obnoxious.

203
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:58,090
On the night of the Start of Term Party,
I answered his call.

204
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,385
-Hello?
-You crazy bitch.

205
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,222
What kind of scum
are you out with at this time of night?

206
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,600
No way!

207
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,103
I had no idea!

208
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,985
I started to warm up to you
from that point on.

209
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,447
And I felt for you that you were trying
so hard to appear perfect.

210
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,702
That's so embarrassing.

211
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,288
There's nothing
to be embarrassed about between friends.

212
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,081
I've been living life all wrong.

213
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,875
It's not like pretending changes anything.

214
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,798
There are people
who live their lives wrong, but not you.

215
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,640
Why did you come over, by the way?

216
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,311
I missed you.

217
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,856
I told you I liked you.

218
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:34,598
NOWDROWZ
INSOMNIA, NON-HABIT-FORMING, SLEEP AID

219
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,726
You're up.

220
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,144
Want some coffee?

221
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,522
Sure.

222
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,440
I'll make toast.

223
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,424
Talk. You're here
because you have something to say.

224
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,302
Do you still have
business left with Doona?

225
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,932
Because I'd like you to stop visiting her
in a personal capacity and harassing her.

226
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,769
Why are you so angry?

227
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,608
How old are you? 21? 22?
Have you completed military service?

228
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,694
By the time you've done that,
graduated, got a job,

229
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,946
and whatever else,
it'll be five years from now.

230
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,450
Will you date her until then?

231
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,661
-Realistically--
-I don't see why not.

232
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,457
Sure.

233
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,419
There are also people in this world
who believe in things

234
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,631
like fairies, ghosts,
and past life connections.

235
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,091
A kid like you could think that.

236
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,552
Then why don't you
leave us kids alone to play?

237
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,555
Because there is too much at stake
to let you do that.

238
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,223
Don't exaggerate.

239
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,187
Is that what you think?

240
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,690
In an industry
where public image is everything,

241
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,943
bringing her back after she messed up
and cut out is a huge risk.

242
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,864
Public opinion is at rock bottom,
and no one can predict what will happen.

243
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,533
If the profit expected
from Doona is ten billion,

244
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,994
the potential loss
we have to take on is even higher.

245
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:47,165
Given all this, neither the company
nor Doona is stupid enough

246
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,501
to take on the risk of a relationship.

247
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,632
So, who should be
the one to let her go? Me?

248
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:22,886
I think Doona's had a lot to think about,
and what she wanted from the company was

249
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:28,433
to give her a bit more say
in her work going forward.

250
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,809
Oh, of course!

251
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,771
She should have a say
and create the kind of music she wants.

252
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,981
From now on,
the company will reduce involvement

253
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,692
and let Doona dictate the direction
she wants to take.

254
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,069
Why would we interfere?

255
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,780
Of course we mustn't.

256
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:45,283
Our job is to allow the artist
to do what they want.

257
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,453
Doona, please feel free to do
what you want. We won't interfere.

258
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,371
Make the kind of music you want.

259
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,583
How many tracks
did you say are in the works?

260
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:58,338
We have about five or six
from artists that Doona selected.

261
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,385
If there's anything you need right away,
just ask Mr. Ko.

262
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,806
I'll take care of the move,
so don't worry about it.

263
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,683
Just tell me anything specific
that you need.

264
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:17,190
Isn't it amazing that I've suddenly
regained my ability to sing?

265
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,609
I find it amazing.

266
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,072
How can I let go?

267
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:29,452
You're good at discarding people,
so you tell me

268
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,663
what it is I need to do…

269
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,917
to let go of him.

270
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,045
Because I don't think I can do it.

271
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,758
I'll do a good job.

272
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,513
I'll succeed enough to justify the time
and money that's been invested in me.

273
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,267
Enough for them to forget
about the company's losses.

274
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,311
I'm not doing this because of the lawsuit.

275
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,855
And it's nothing to do with you.

276
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,398
I know.

277
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,568
I realized I wanted to be happy.

278
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,152
So…

279
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,915
I met him.

280
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,419
He came to see me. Didn't he tell you?

281
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,715
For now, cut contact with everyone.
This is not a request.

282
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,093
Rest up. Things are going to
get busy from tomorrow.

283
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:29,387
What did you say to him?

284
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,644
There wasn't much to say.

285
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,188
What could I say to a kid?

286
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:53,202
Like a Hollywood movie star

287
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,007
Thank you, everybody.

288
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,385
Today's performance has been
particularly nerve-racking for me,

289
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,889
and the reason is
that I spotted a familiar face

290
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,725
in the audience earlier this evening.

291
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:18,311
I'm a huge fan of hers.

292
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:21,689
Dream Sweet's Ms. Lee Doona.

293
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,566
What? Dream Sweet's Lee Doona?

294
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,902
I'm right, aren't I?

295
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:32,492
Would it be okay
if I invited you to join me on stage?

296
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,959
Lee Doona!

297
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:45,463
Lee Doona!

298
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:49,717
Lee Doona!

299
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,611
You're so cool!

300
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:17,203
If you don't mind,
may I ask you to sing something for us?

301
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,490
I just realized

302
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,912
The endless winter

303
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,587
And the maze that is my heart

304
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,836
I just realized

305
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,839
The endless winter

306
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,010
And the maze that is my heart

307
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,221
All that time I spent suffering

308
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,224
Pierced by the thorns…

309
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,038
I just realized

310
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,250
The endless winter

311
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,587
And the maze that is my heart

312
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,173
All that time I spent suffering

313
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:44,804
Pierced by the thorns

314
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,098
With love

315
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:52,728
Every day felt as heavy as lead

316
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,981
Days passed by

317
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,858
Where I didn't expect
Anything good to happen

318
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:04,699
And you, a total stranger, came to me

319
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,786
You were a whole other universe

320
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:15,167
I was a fool back then

321
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,003
Trapped in fear

322
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:20,214
I didn't understand anything about myself

323
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:25,303
I now realize that my dream is

324
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,849
To spend an ordinary day
Walking by your side

325
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:35,354
I still remember the day

326
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,149
How you embraced my heart

327
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,901
And how my heart fluttered

328
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:45,031
I still remember the day

329
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:50,244
I want to tell you these words now

330
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,955
Stay with me

331
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,668
I just realized

332
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,546
Taking my shaky first steps

333
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,633
I took another step

334
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,470
Held your hand

335
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:12,683
And smiled so wide

336
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,186
With love

337
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:20,232
I dug up my feelings for you
And my confusing thoughts

338
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,486
That had been buried deep within

339
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,031
And entrusted them to you

340
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:33,496
I was a fool back then

341
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,331
Trapped in fear

342
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,501
I didn't understand anything about myself

343
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:43,589
I now realize that my dream is

344
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:48,219
To spend an ordinary day
Walking by your side

345
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,599
I still remember the day

346
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,310
How you embraced my heart

347
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,063
And how my heart fluttered

348
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:03,734
I still remember the day

349
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:08,572
I want to tell you these words now

350
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,533
Stay with me

351
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,410
