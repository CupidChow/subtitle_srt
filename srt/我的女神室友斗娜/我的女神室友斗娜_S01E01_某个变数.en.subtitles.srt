EPISODE 1
AN UNEXPECTED TWIST

3
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,639
KOOK'S SEAFOOD HOUSE

4
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,901
KOOK'S SEAFOOD HOUSE
CEO KOOK SU-JIN

5
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,446
I've had business cards made.

6
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,535
I'm jealous. You're already a CEO at 21.

7
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,037
Now that you're the boss,
get to work earlier.

8
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,415
The grocery boxes are too heavy
for my mom to carry.

9
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,459
You're that worried about your mom,
but you're running off to Seoul?

10
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,629
The commute has always been a problem.

11
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,631
And with Won-yeong now
out of the hospital,

12
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,343
I figured it'd be better
to use the commute time productively.

13
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,513
Hey, Kooksu.

14
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,765
Thank you.

15
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,767
Take care of my mom for me.

16
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,895
Don't even worry about it, doofus.

17
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,194
If, by any chance,
you happen to see Doona in Seoul,

18
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,820
you have got to call me, okay?

19
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,072
Yeah, right. As if.

20
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,950
WHEN THE ANSWERS INCLUDE
VERBS AND NON-VERBS

21
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm sorry.

LOVE AND DO WHAT YOU WILL

23
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,346
Hello.

24
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:07,724
It's open.

25
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,780
Excuse me.

26
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,575
Have we met before?

27
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,913
Maybe not.

28
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,959
I must have mistaken you for someone else.
You looked familiar.

29
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,754
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,341
Oh! I'm just moving in
on the second floor.

31
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,093
I hope we can get along.
It's my first time living on my own.

I recommend that you use the rooftop
for your laundry.

38
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,599
I mean, yes.

39
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,446
-Newbie?
-Hello, I'm--

40
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,989
Senior year, Psychology.

00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,624
Right, I'm Lee Won-jun.
Sophomore, Civil Engineering.

44
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,377
There is absolutely nothing
to be worried about.

Live free.

47
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,257
Okay?

48
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,174
Yes.

49
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,227
No!

50
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,270
Oh no!

51
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,279
What the heck?!

52
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,758
There.

53
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,265
Perfect.

00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,981

Oh, thank God.

60
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,420
-Here.
-Thanks.

61
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,715
Hey, did you see his hoodie?

62
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,508
He must be a total fanboy.

63
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
Why would he wear that in public?

64
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,262
-That's actually kinda adorable.
-Agreed.

00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,556
Hey, CEO Kook.

68
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,600
Hey, bro.

69
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,894
Get ready to kiss
your big bro's feet, bro.

70
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,104
Kiss your feet?

71
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,816
Someone's paying 800,000 won a month?

72
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,317
Sick, isn't it?

73
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,194
And that's just for math.

74
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,404
Freaking sweet!

75
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,155
Wow, that's insane!

76
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,075
That will cover my rent
and living expenses.

77
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,244
CEO Kook, I don't know how to thank you.

78
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,579
Please pass my thanks on to your mom too.

79
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,665
How's the house? Is it okay?

80
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,711
Screaming out so loud…

81
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,045
What?

82
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,131
I can't hear you.
Turn the music down a bit.

83
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,007
Dream Sweet Lee Doona!

84
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,551
I love you forever!

85
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,512
This is how much I love Doona!

86
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,639
Jeez, what the hell?

87
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,100
Didn't you throw out their albums
and quit being a fan?

88
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,354
It's not that easy to give up
something you love so much.

89
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,523
Oh, hey, speaking of which,

90
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,276
give me back the hoodie
I gave you last time.

91
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,196
It's limited edition merch.
There won't be any new Doona merch.

92
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,698
Merch?

93
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:23,117
I thought it was my birthday present.

94
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,078
Oh no!

95
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,247
I was wearing it all day yesterday!

96
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,583
What? Who wears merch!

00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,483
I want…

103
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,782
Are you messing with me?

104
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,453
I remember now.

105
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,917
You're Lee Doona, right? Dream Sweet.

106
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,627
It's finally come to me.

107
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,213
It's finally come to you. Really?

108
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,882
I'm sorry? I didn't quite catch that.
What did you…

109
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,679
Give the crappy acting a rest.

110
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,352
Are you insane? I could have gotten hurt!

111
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,395
But you didn't.

112
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,356
What?

113
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,982
How did you know I live here?

114
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,150
I didn't.

115
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,861
Did you put up a spycam or something?

116
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,656
What is it you want to see so much

117
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,909
that you'd even move here to stalk me?

118
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,620
I'm really not a stalker.

119
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,665
My friend is a fan of yours
so you looked familiar. That's why--

120
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,669
I'm sorry. I won't look at you again.

121
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,801
But you know what?

122
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,178

In terms of math, I can confidently say
that you won't find a better tutor.

126
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,329
I have expertise
due to extensive tutoring experience.

127
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,248
I can say that for certain.

128
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,627
You're earnest and polite. I like that.

129
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,090
Does that mean I can start next week?

130
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,925
Yes.

131
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,263
-Mr. Lee!
-Yes?

132
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,517
Well, you forgot this.

133
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,352
Oh. Thank you.

Won-jun!

137
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,969
It's been a while, Jin-ju.

138
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,106
I didn't recognize you
because of the short hair.

139
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,026
Really? I've had this
for more than a year now.

140
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,613
Exactly.

141
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,659
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

142
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,706
That hairstyle suits you too.

143
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,126
Where do you live?
Are you still commuting?

144
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,213
Just until last semester.
I'm in a nearby house share now.

145
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,510
That's a shame.
I thought we could commute together.

146
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,931
Five hours on the road
is going to be so tedious.

147
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,349
What do you mean?

148
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,601
I'm at Minsong now too.

149
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,440
Come on, I got in on my second attempt.
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

150
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,526
Oh. Here.

151
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,443
Cheers!

152
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,616
Wow.

153
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,792
It's so cold.

154
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,841
-Here.
-Oh, you don't have to.

155
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,135
Take it. It's cold. And it's snowing.

156
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,138
All right, then. Thank you.

157
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,685
You're still so sweet.

158
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,775
This is me.

159
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,905
And this is me.

160
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,575
So that's who my competitor was.

161
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,410
We've always been competitors.

162
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,162
Only I've never beaten you.

163
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,549
Anyhow, let's hang out often
now that we're in the same school.

164
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:31,925
Sure.

165
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,597
My bus is here.

166
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:38,974
See you later.

-You!
-Yes?

170
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,009
Don't sing.

171
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,845
You really suck at it.

172
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,975
If you sing that song around me
one more time,

173
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,603
I'll smash your head in.

174
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,979
Smash what?

175
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,698
Hey.

176
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,366
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

177
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,294
Oh, hi. I'm at 21 Minsongdae-gil.

178
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,087
Someone's collapsed and is unconscious.

179
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,590
I think you should get here quickly.

180
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,717
Could you please hurry?

181
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,510
Yes.

00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,665
JOB HUNTING STUDY GROUP

183
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,501
Is this only applicable to seniors?

184
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,045
Hey.

185
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,714
You're awake.

186
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,216
You're in the hospital.

187
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,804
Oh, the nurse was asking
about your guardian.

188
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,182
I don't have one.

189
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,398
You should call your family…

190
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,650
I said I don't have one.

191
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,695
Then how about your manager--

192
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,780
I said I don't fucking have one.

193
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,948
What's going on?

194
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,538
Why are you swearing?
There are people around.

195
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,249
So what if there are? Don't you swear?

196
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,583
No, I don't.

197
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,545
And I'm not a celebrity, unlike you.

198
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,755
I'm not either. Not anymore.

199
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,016
Ms. Lee Doona, is your guardian here?

200
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,060
Ms. Lee Doona.

201
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,022
I'm her guardian.

202
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,857
You can talk to me.

203
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,525
Could you please follow me?

204
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:08,201
Thanks to your quick actions,
there are no particular complications,

205
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,412
but her body temperature is
on the low side,

206
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,624
so please make sure her head,
hands, and feet are always kept warm.

207
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,419
A dry blanket will be useful here,

208
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,796
and most importantly,
make sure she wears socks.

209
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,175
Give her warm drinks
to help the recovery process.

210
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,301
I see.

211
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,929
Oh, and would there be
any other internal issues?

212
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,599
Does she need any other tests?

213
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,685
No, no further tests are needed.

214
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,356
Oh, I'm sorry, but would you happen to
have a phone charger I could borrow?

215
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,858
-I'll be one moment.
-Sure.

216
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,120
They said to put socks on you.

217
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,209
-So do it, then.
-Me?

218
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,503
Aren't you my guardian?

219
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,265
Excuse me.

220
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,158
You'll have to excuse me.

221
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,294
Weren't there any bed socks?

222
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,254
I'm sorry?

223
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,965
I mean, weren't there any ordinary ones?

224
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,092
I like ordinary stuff.

225
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,554
Are you laughing?

226
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,681
No.

227
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:58,061
It's just that you like ordinary stuff
when there's nothing ordinary about you.

228
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,775
Bed socks can make your feet sweat
and end up making them colder.

229
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,777
I got these on purpose.

230
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,446
And at least they're pink.

231
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,949
All the others looked like dad socks.
I chose these carefully.

232
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,962
What's your name, Mr. Guardian?

233
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,046
Me?

234
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,095
That's personal information.

235
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,616
KOOK SU-JIN

236
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,869
Hey, Kooksu.

237
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,205
Hey, do you smoke?

238
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,124
Oh, smoke.

239
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,667
What, me?

240
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:06,379
My mom's friend says to tell you
not to come for the tutoring job.

241
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:08,882
What?

242
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,300
You jackass.

243
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:13,845
She asked me three times to confirm
that you're a non-smoker, and I said yes.

244
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,516
But then she found that your scarf
absolutely reeked of cigarette smoke!

245
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,155
My 800,000 won.

246
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,157
I can't believe this.

247
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,753
YOUR ITEM HAS BEEN DELIVERED

248
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,474
Won-jun.

249
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,896
Have you had breakfast?

250
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,524
If not, let's eat together.

251
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,319
Is that my package by any chance?

252
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:20,954
What is it?

253
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,372
It's really cushy.

254
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,542
Why would you sit
on someone else's package?

255
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,002
I'm so hungry.

256
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,545
What shall we eat?

257
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,005
Have a nice day.

258
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,269
That was the day
she started waiting for me.

259
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,153
Won-jun, have you eaten?

260
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,238
Shall we go for tteokbokki?

261
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,824
Won-jun!

262
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,704
Jokbal and bossam combo?

263
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,999
Won-jun, let's go eat!

264
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,765
This is seriously driving me nuts.

265
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,356
Hello.

266
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,234
Hello.

267
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,613
If you're here to hang up your laundry,
do it. Don't mind me.

268
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,153
My friend gave it to me
as a birthday present.

269
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,322
But he wants it back,
so I'm gonna return it.

270
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:21,783
I only wore it the other day
'cause it's fleece-lined.

271
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,368
It was cold that day, right?

272
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,369
Did I say anything?

273
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,746
-No, but in case you got the wrong idea.
-I didn't.

274
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,914
You said you're not a fan.

275
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,999
So that means you're not.

276
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,553
You dress well for an engineering major.

277
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,055
Does your girlfriend choose your clothes?

278
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,307
I don't have a girlfriend.

279
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,645
I'm hungry.

280
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,896
Shall we get something to eat?

281
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,527
Actually, can I ask you something?

282
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,864
Did you maybe…

283
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,826
fall for me?

284
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,330
Please don't do this.

285
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,833
It's making me uncomfortable.

286
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,637
Why are you laughing?

287
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,183
You're so funny.

288
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,897
I haven't laughed like this
in a long time.

289
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,276
-Look.
-Yes?

290
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,611
I won't fall for you.

291
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,362
I'll never fall for you.

292
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,407
"Never" is a bit unnecessary.

293
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,202
Let's be friends.

294
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,537
I want to be friends with you.

295
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,540
With me? Why?

296
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,125
Because I don't have any friends.

297
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,591
The first floor is for girls.
Maybe you should make friends with them?

298
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,344
First floor?
I have the whole floor to myself.

299
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,888
Wow, you're rich.

300
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,973
I suddenly want to be
best friends with you.

301
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,809
Really? Does that mean I can call you?

302
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,018
No.

303
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,520
You're a tough nut to crack.

304
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,729
Of course I am.

305
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,525
It can't be helped, then.

306
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:22,153
If I get attacked by a stalker and die,
it'll be your fault.

307
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,614
Why would it be my fault?

308
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,617
The sun's coming up. I have to make
a wish, so stop bothering me.

309
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,369
When did I bother you?

310
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,557
-Hey.
-Huh?

311
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,851
You forgot your underpants.

312
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,866
I wish I could move.

313
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,140
Kim Jin-ju!

314
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,099
Jju!

315
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,435
Sorry we're late.

316
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,394
Let's eat.

317
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,312
Is it good?

318
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,612
Lee Won-jun.

319
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,240
Hey.

320
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,996
Didn't you hear me calling you?
You can have this back.

321
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,498
You can keep it on if you want.

322
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,916
No. It smells of cigarette smoke.

323
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,464
Let me.

324
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,602
It's done.

325
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,648
See you later.

326
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,108
Yeah.

327
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,236
-Who was that?
-What do you mean?

328
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,863
-Who is he? Tell us.
-It's just someone I know.

329
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,198
He's good-looking.

330
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,617
What's with the vibe between you two?

331
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,994
"Just someone I know."

332
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,333
Can't you tell her I don't smoke?

333
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,170
A friend, no, what am I saying?
I mean, some weirdo…

334
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,548
Anyhow, it's not me.

335
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,509
She's found someone?

336
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,428
Already?

337
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,888
That's ten in total. 70,000 won, please.

338
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,558
Yes, thank you.

339
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,336
PART-TIMERS WANTED
RECRUITING STAFF MEMBERS FOR CAFÉ 1890

340
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,048
Hello.

341
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,386
-Take it down.
-I'm sorry?

342
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,221
I said take it down.

343
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,432
Oh, aren't we allowed
to put things up here?

344
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:22,894
You need to pay
to get this little stamp here.

345
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,104
You think it's okay
to post things willy-nilly?

346
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,422
Tutoring? That's a piece of cake!

347
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,007
Ladies and gentlemen!

348
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,467
The Brains of Yangjin!

349
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,052
Yangjin born and bred!

350
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,805
Lee Won-jun!

351
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,267
-I'll visit often.
-What for?

352
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,311
Don't forget to take the pumpkin juice.

353
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,522
It's in the crisper drawer of the fridge.

354
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,149
Won-jun!

355
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,569
If you get a girlfriend, send photos!

356
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,446
Go inside! It's cold!

357
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,615
Make sure you take
your medication on time!

358
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,353
Hello?

359
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,730
Hello?

360
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,860
I got your number from your flier.

361
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,028
Yes, how can I help you?

362
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,323
I was wondering if you would

363
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,036
go out for a meal with me sometime.

364
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:22,805
Are you angry?

365
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,724
No.

366
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,017
You are. I can tell.

367
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,021
Hey, why don't you get mad at me?
I want to see you get mad.

368
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,023
Why are you angry though?

369
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,650
Didn't you stick them everywhere
so people would call?

370
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,986
Look here.

371
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,906
Are you that bored?

372
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,949
Is this your idea of fun?

373
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,494
You can do whatever you want
because you're a bum

374
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,580
who's rolling in time and money.

375
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,749
You don't care how you live your life.

376
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,167
Well, congratulations.

377
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,837
But you know what?
Not everyone can live like that.

378
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,798
I desperately need a job.
I also need to study.

379
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:00,968
I have a lot on my plate at the moment.

380
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,221
So please, for the love of God,

381
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,806
stop following me
and playing pranks on me.

382
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,436
I don't find them amusing
in the slightest.

383
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,318
Well, now that I've seen it,
I'm really disappointed.

384
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,153
I see you have no talent

385
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,197
for getting mad.

386
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,950
I understand what you're saying.

387
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,411
Hello?

388
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,377
Ms. Lee?

389
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,882
Let's go out for a meal sometime.

390
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,301
Whenever you want.

391
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,011
It'll be my treat.

392
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,556
As soon as I find a tutoring job.

393
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,021
Oh my god!

394
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,540
The presumed value of Vb
is pointing downward,

395
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,834
so we calculate it as a negative value.

396
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:42,004
Under the condition
that the aggregate force equals zero,

397
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,549
Vb comes out to 75 newtons.

398
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,968
Now, we'll move on to the bending moment.

399
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,596
We need to calculate
the aggregate bending moment

400
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,806
that applies to point B.

401
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,974
Under the condition
of the equilibrium equation,

402
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,310
the aggregate bending moment
at point B is zero.

403
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,938
Positive direction means
a clockwise direction.

404
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:02,566
Let's look at all the bending moments
that are being applied to point B.

405
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,444
The reaction force of 120 newtons
applying to point A

406
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,823
is rotating in a clockwise direction
in relation to point B.

407
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,164
Let's go eat.

408
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,207
Now?

409
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,500
You said whenever I want.

410
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,919
I want to now.

411
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,721
For now,

412
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,225
I think we need to wait
until class is over.

413
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,274
What should we eat?

414
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,798
Don't you mind being recognized?

415
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,757
No.

416
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,595
When I'm dressed like this,
not many people recognize me anyway.

417
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,389
You didn't either.

418
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,226
Actually, that was because
it felt so divorced from reality.

419
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:27,776
I'll call you.

420
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,404
You don't mind, do you?

421
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,114
Well,

422
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,033
if it's urgent.

423
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,135
I'm telling you this just in case,

424
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,846
but don't fall for me either.

425
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,181
Me?

426
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,809
I don't think there's any danger of that.

427
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,980
You never know.

428
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:15,074
Every life has its unexpected twists.

429
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,626
You once said to me

430
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,838
that you and I are
from different universes.

431
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,644
That though we had been living
in completely different universes…

432
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:18,012
we found ourselves sitting side by side
at the same station purely by chance.

433
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,609
RECENT CALLS

434
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,071
LEE

435
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,698
DOONA

436
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,995
Even though you may be right…

437
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,551
I was happy…

438
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,598
that it was you.
