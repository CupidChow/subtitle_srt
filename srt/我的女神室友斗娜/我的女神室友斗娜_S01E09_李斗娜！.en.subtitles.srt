1
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,552
DOONA!

2
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,580
Would you let me go?

3
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,087
What kind of question is that?
You should go if you want to.

4
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,798
But I think it would be nice.

5
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,635
I want to see you sing.

6
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,930
I like that you're a fool.

7
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,729
What if they tell me to break up with you?

8
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,773
Should I still go back?

9
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,819
Given all this, neither the company

10
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,862
nor Doona is stupid enough

11
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,198
to take on the risk of a relationship.

12
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,079
So, who should be the one
to let her go? Me?

13
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,353
EPISODE 9
DOONA!

14
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,563
LEE DOONA SOLO ALBUM

15
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,856
Congratulations!

16
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,694
CONGRATS ON THE COMEBACK!

17
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,989
ALL OF MSA WISHES YOU SUCCESS
IN YOUR SOLO CAREER, DOONA!

18
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,792
FROZEN WATER PIPE PREVENTION TIPS

19
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,802
I've moved. I'll leave you my new address.

20
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,224
It's getting colder now. Are you well?

21
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,226
RECRUITMENT
GENERAL CIVIL ENGINEERING

22
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,772
We don't have any photos together.

23
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,483
Let's take some when we have time.

24
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,693
EXAM SCHEDULE

25
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,453
You're pretty!

26
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,579
You're so pretty!

27
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,788
I love you!

28
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,290
Doona!

29
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,750
Look over here, please!

30
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,878
-You're so pretty!
-You're so pretty!

31
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,962
-Hello.
-Hello.

32
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,672
Here. I brought you a gift.

33
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,217
-Thank you.
-You're so pretty!

34
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,178
I like your glasses.

35
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,055
Would you mind if I tried them on?

36
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,016
Where do they sell these things?

37
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,979
Could you find out
where you can get these?

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,607
And escort this gentleman out, please.

39
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,318
Security, please.

40
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,115
So disappointed.

41
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,996
IT'S SMOOTH ENOUGH
TO DOWN IN ONE GO!

42
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,004
You must be very shy.

43
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,382
Hello, Doona.

44
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,143
Wait, is this…

45
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,442
No, it can't be.

46
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,864
TO SU-JIN FROM DOONA
GO, KOOK'S SEAFOOD HOUSE!

47
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,003
MINSONG TOGETHER FESTIVAL
OUTDOOR CONCERT, LEE DOONA

48
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,338
I'm so busy preparing
for the end of the semester.

49
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,142
I miss you.

50
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,996
It feels like
we are in different universes.

51
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,672
The others are over there
drinking more. Let's go too.

52
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,591
-Sure, let's go.
-They should be…

53
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,967
-My God.
-She's so pretty.

54
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,886
How can her face be so tiny?

55
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,395
And we're sitting

56
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,899
side by side at the same station
purely by chance.

57
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,195
Yes. We've just finished up
and headed out.

58
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,113
About an hour?

59
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,158
The article is in two days.

60
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,285
It's all been confirmed
with the Japan team,

61
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,703
so keep it confidential till then.

62
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,604
I feel angry today somehow.

63
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,534
CRAM SCHOOL

64
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,912
It's snowing.

65
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,873
It's the end of the semester
in a few days.

66
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,670
My part-time job
at the cram school is ending too.

67
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,787
It's cold out, but I haven't seen
the stray cat Nana around.

68
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,582
I'd better look for her tonight.

69
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,668
Are you done?

70
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,005
Let's go get something to eat.

71
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,519
Cheers.

72
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,278
You called me a lot, right?

73
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:50,863
No.

74
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,116
Really?

75
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,580
I thought you'd have been worried
about me. I'm glad you weren't.

76
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,509
I couldn't use my phone.

77
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,470
I barely managed to get out now as it is.

78
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,227
I understand.
You don't have to explain anything.

79
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,356
You were made for the stage.

80
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,319
I'll be rooting for you.

81
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,245
Everything's…

82
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,748
okay between us, right?

83
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,004
I'm off to the military.

84
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,969
Yeah?

85
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,809
That's good.

86
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,145
At least the time will pass quickly.

87
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,783
The agency treats me like a crazy woman.

88
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,620
They won't let me use a phone,

89
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,872
and someone even follows me
to the bathroom.

90
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,999
They must be scared I'll run away again.

91
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,293
They really don't have to.

92
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,506
This is what prior convictions
get you, right?

93
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,533
Given the situation,
I have to be careful for the time being,

94
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,994
but it will be two years max.

95
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,374
Once I'm established, my private life
won't be much of an issue anymore.

96
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,584
And then--

97
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,919
You don't…

98
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,261
You don't have to worry about me.

99
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,280
You want to end things here?
Is that what you're saying?

100
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,700
Were you saying something else?

101
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,911
I was saying something else.

102
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,043
That's what I was saying.

103
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,215
I want to stop here.

104
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,500
When I was a washed-up has-been
with nothing going on in my life,

105
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,961
you thought you had a shot
at playing around with me,

106
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,297
but now that I've gone back,
you can't handle it?

107
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,760
Do you know what I did when I met him?

108
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,637
I told him I was going to date you!

109
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,724
I told him
I was going to keep dating you, so…

110
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,190
It's true. I want it all.

111
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,818
That's why
it really hasn't been easy for me.

112
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,032
So, why is it so easy for you?

113
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,494
What is it
that I've been trying to endure for us?

114
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,789
What are you enduring for us?

115
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,166
Tell me.

116
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,127
You said I should go if I wanted to.

117
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,631
You said you wanted to see me sing!

118
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,771
And you're the one who let go.

119
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,525
You're the one
who's breaking your promise.

120
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,778
You're the one running away
because you don't have the guts.

121
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,531
And you're the one who's discarding me.

122
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,868
Just like all the others.

123
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,581
Is that it?

124
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,461
Is that it?

125
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,177
Yes.

126
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,274
That's good.

127
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,738
Action!

128
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,842
I'VE MOVED

129
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,760
I MISS YOU

130
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,762
IT FEELS LIKE
WE ARE IN DIFFERENT UNIVERSES

131
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,807
AND WE'RE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE
AT THE SAME STATION PURELY BY CHANCE

132
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,108
What is dating?

133
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,735
Dating is a muscle.

134
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,538
What do you think, everyone?

135
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,749
We've all been broken
at some point in our lives, right?

136
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,294
Being broken and feeling pain is necessary

137
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,213
for building muscle.

138
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,506
"IS IT OKAY TO LOVE AGAIN?"

139
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,591
That's how we get stronger.

140
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,844
DATING = MUSCLE

141
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,846
Bulking up your heart!

142
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,057
Bulking up…

143
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,060
Bulking up your heart.

144
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,771
Tell me, everyone. What is dating again?

145
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,189
It's a muscle.

146
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,441
Not loud enough. What is dating?

147
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,526
It's a muscle!

148
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,944
What is dating?

149
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,987
It's a muscle!

150
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,530
One last time. What is dating?

151
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,699
-It's a muscle!
-It's a muscle!

152
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,827
You can do it!
We can all have a love life!

153
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,662
All we have to do is bulk up!

154
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,539
Like this.

155
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,959
Let's bulk up for love!

156
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,294
Seo Yun-taek!

157
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,442
-Hey!
-Yeah.

158
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:54,818
Hey!

159
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,619
Get up and have breakfast.
I have to go to work.

160
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,253
-Come on.
-Okay.

161
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,029
I'm off to work.

162
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,450
You're up early,
given how much you had last night.

163
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,953
Yeah, I was planning to go home
and sleep, but…

164
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:49,039
I'll do that. You should at least
have a protein bar or something.

165
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,504
Here you go. And you.

166
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,840
-Don't forget to take this.
-Thanks.

167
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,761
-I'm off.
-See you later.

168
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,806
Bye.

169
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,686
The job seems to be going
all right for her.

170
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,231
Such a surprise. I never thought
I-ra would have a desk job.

171
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,024
It's weirder I'm living with a woman.

172
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,734
That's true.

173
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,487
I still can't get used to it.

174
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,991
I gotta get to work. Take your time.

175
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,075
-Thanks.
-Sure.

176
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,883
-Won-jun.
-Won-jun.

177
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:42,801
Hey.

178
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,762
-Hello.
-Hello.

179
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,857
HANG IN THERE!
MAYBE DREAM SWEET WILL VISIT?

180
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,067
TO SU-JIN FROM DOONA
GO, KOOK'S SEAFOOD HOUSE!

181
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,163
The Oseong Apartment people are saying
they asked for pickled ginger.

182
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,498
-They want it delivered now.
-What?

183
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,419
What are they talking about?
It's not there.

184
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:27,512
Hello. I'm calling
from Su-jin's Seafood House.

185
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,724
The pickled ginger has to be ordered
as a menu item.

186
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,980
Yes, thank you.

187
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,900
-I'll go drop it off.
-Won-jun.

188
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,402
I think they're doing this
because you look easy.

189
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,737
I'll go myself.

190
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,988
No, I'll do it.

191
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,200
I'm going.
You just hang out with Jin-ju here.

192
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,077
With who?

193
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,536
With me.

194
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,836
I was glaring at you,
wondering when you would notice me.

195
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,463
You couldn't feel it?

196
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,799
When did you come back to Korea?

197
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,886
Have a seat first.

198
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,891
This is the desert in Las Vegas.
Look at this.

199
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,226
What are they? Rocks?

200
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,103
Yes. Aren't they pretty?

201
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,689
-Wow, that's amazing.
-This is Times Square in the States.

202
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,818
I recognize it.
It's that famous New Year's spot, right?

203
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,695
-Yes, that's exactly it.
-I wish I could go.

204
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,739
These are my Brazilian friends.

205
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,534
Look. This guy is a photographer.

206
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,202
He takes amazing photos.

207
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,538
He's a good-looking dude.

208
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,290
This was taken on my way to school.

209
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,626
This restaurant is
right across from where I live.

210
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,920
I literally go there every day.
The food is great.

211
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,380
-It's called Habibi?
-Yes.

212
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:48,260
-Isn't the weather in Brazil amazing?
-It looks awesome.

213
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,305
-Look at this.
-Wow. That looks amazing.

214
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,974
God, I so want to go.

215
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,144
-I'm going to go clean up. Keep talking.
-Okay.

216
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,604
This is I-ra's parents' place.

217
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:03,608
It's impossible to find a place to live
in Brazil, so I'm doing a homestay here.

218
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,653
I went to visit in the summer
and then just ended up staying on.

219
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,906
Oh no.

220
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,624
Doona also happened to be
in Brazil for a concert.

221
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,255
Where are you going now?

222
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:29,134
Oh, to my sister's.
She's coming to pick me up after work.

223
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,218
Right.

224
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:48,945
SU-JIN'S SEAFOOD HOUSE (DELIVERY-ONLY)

225
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,158
CONGRATS ON 4-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
OF YOUR DEBUT AS A SOLO ARTIST!

226
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,619
AEIHERUMUH
LOVE AND DO WHAT YOU WILL

227
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,510
So, is this house going to be demolished?

228
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,220
The house?

229
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,516
It'll still be around.
The landlady's son is getting married,

230
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,561
so she's renovating it
and gifting it as their marital home.

231
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,439
Whoever the guy is, I'm so jealous of him.

232
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,568
Does that mean this is the last time
we're getting together here like this?

233
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,278
That's a bit sad!

234
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,696
Yeah, it is.

235
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:57,449
Hey, it's been ages
since we all got together, so…

236
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,368
Oh! We're missing Doona.

237
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,455
Doona has to be here for our family

238
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,583
to be reunited in its entirety. Doona--

239
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,586
Eat your veggies
if you want to be healthy!

240
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,671
Let's toast to health!

241
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,131
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

242
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,049
Cheers!

243
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,265
Why aren't you drinking?

244
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,559
-I have an interview tomorrow.
-What interview?

245
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,938
I passed the second stage.

246
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,191
No way!

247
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,278
-Dude! Lee Won-jun!
-Won-jun!

248
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,157
Congratulations! That's my boy!

249
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,619
Seriously, it's such a waste
to leave you single!

250
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,496
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

251
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,834
Really, you never change, do you?

252
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,338
Always keeping things to yourself.
I'd like to see what's inside you.

253
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:56,716
-I'll tell you when I get the job.
-That will be too late.

254
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,928
I'll tell you even if I fail.

255
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,181
-Knock on wood! Don't jinx it!
-Knock on wood.

256
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,767
-Knock on wood!
-Good luck, Won-jun! And congrats!

257
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,894
-Congratulations!
-Cheers!

258
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,063
It's been ages
since we've had Jin-ju with us.

259
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,023
-Let's continue at our place!
-I-ra.

260
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,150
-You're a traitor if you bail.
-Get in.

261
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,860
-My interview.
-Just one more drink.

262
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,946
Jin-ju, in front.
Won-jun, you're not coming?

263
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,531
-He has an interview.
-That sucks.

264
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,199
-Get in.
-Call us when you get it.

265
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,535
-Okay. Take care.
-Won-jun, get that job!

266
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,662
-Take care.
-Won-jun!

267
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,038
-You're a traitor!
-Bye!

268
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,456
Quiet!

269
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,933
Hello.

270
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,439
I thought you had left.

271
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,234
I left my jacket here.

272
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,821
Then go and get it.

273
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,754
-How's everyone? Are they well?
-Yeah.

274
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,595
They're well.

275
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,767
Have you listened to my music?

276
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,299
Lee Won-jun!

277
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,052
Won-jun!

278
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,769
"Take care"?

279
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,314
-Is that all you have to say to me?
-Yes, it is.

280
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,360
Let's talk inside.

281
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:10,298
-How can you be so calm?
-Is that how it looks to you?

282
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:14,927
Do you know what you were to me back then?

283
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,057
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't be alive now.

284
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,767
Because at the time,

285
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:26,147
I despised myself so much,
I didn't want to wake up each day.

286
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,401
I didn't care about what tomorrow held.
It was only because of you--

287
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,278
Things are different now.

288
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:37,158
You're right. They are different.
Because I really like myself now.

289
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,494
I'm better than I've ever been.

290
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,623
I'm not lonely, I'm not hurting,
I sleep well, my work is going well,

291
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,626
and I have many people
by my side even without you.

292
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,837
So now,

293
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,006
I no longer need you.

294
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,134
I know.

295
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,352
So this time, it's your turn to beg.

296
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,730
Tell me you're sorry.

297
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,192
Tell me you did me wrong.

298
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,031
I'm sorry.

299
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,159
I did you wrong.

300
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,870
Tell me you regret it.

301
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,832
Tell me you regretted it!

302
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,630
I regret it.

303
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,093
I regret it every single day.

304
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,972
So please leave me in peace now!

305
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,475
Please.

306
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,772
I've missed you.

307
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,826
I've missed you too.

308
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,433
2027 NATIONAL CIVIL SERVANT LEVEL 5

310
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,723
LEE DOONA

311
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,765
YOU'RE AWESOME, DOONA

312
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,143
Doona!

313
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,356
I love you, Doona!

314
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,984
Here's your card, sir.

315
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,111
Here you go.

316
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,447
Thank you.

317
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:28,783
Let's go.

318
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,534
Yes, sir.

319
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,209
It's Doona. Did you see her?

320
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,752
So pretty!

321
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,382
Sir, it's this way.

322
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,675
Allow me, please.
