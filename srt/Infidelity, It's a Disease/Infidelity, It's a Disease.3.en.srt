1
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,125
Who's there?

2
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:16,041
The school's under renovation.

3
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,750
It's too noisy, so I'm crashing here for a couple of days.

4
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,000
What, is it inconvenient?

5
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,125
No, it's fine, totally fine.

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:28,291
Come on in, it's super convenient.

7
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,083
Really convenient.

8
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:32,541
So, where do I sleep?

9
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,000
You're obviously sleeping with me.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,750
No way, I want the bottom bunk.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,666
No can do.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,958
You take the bottom.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,666
I can't handle that.

14
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:44,541
What are you up to?

15
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,250
What could I be up to?

16
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,500
It's not like it's our first time.

17
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,500
Don't act so distant.

18
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:56,791
It's inconvenient.

19
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:58,791
Inconvenient?

20
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,541
Are you on your period or something?

21
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:04,250
No way, that's impossible.

22
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,416
You jerk!

23
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,625
Wow, he actually named himself "Perpetual Motion Machine"?

24
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,791
How narcissistic can you get?

25
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,083
So,

26
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:30,333
you like working out, huh?

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,125
Yeah.

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,083
How about

29
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:43,208
I teach you?

30
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,125
I'm a pro, you know.

31
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:49,041
Sure.

32
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,708
Check out my muscles.

33
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,083
Pretty big, right?

34
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,625
Wow, they're huge!

35
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,333
Wanna

36
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,791
come to my place

37
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,666
and feel them?

38
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,708
Sure, wait for me!

39
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,708
Oh.

40
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,083
Oh.

41
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,208
Deng deng deng deng deng deng.

42
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,916
Come on, come on!

43
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,083
Deng deng deng deng deng.

44
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:51,500
Wow!

45
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:55,291
APT APT APT APT

46
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:59,500
APT APT APT uh-huh, uh-huh

47
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,083
APT APT APT APT

48
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:03,541
APT APT

49
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,875
Yo-hoo! Come on, baby!

50
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:44,083
Yo, you're up pretty early, huh?

51
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,083
I didn’t sleep all night.

52
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,291
What’s with you this early morning?

53
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,333
Taking some performance enhancers?

54
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:56,916
What for?

55
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,291
Why are you observing so closely?

56
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,416
Are you full or what?

57
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:15,583
Are you full?

58
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,291
Are you full?

59
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:21,833
Why’s your body so hot?

60
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,166
I need you.

61
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:27,875
Baby.

62
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,166
Show some respect.

63
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:37,333
I said, show some respect!

64
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:37,875
Hey.

65
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:40,000
I poured you a glass of milk.

66
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,625
Thanks.

67
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:53,375
Hey.

68
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,208
Why’d you become a fitness coach?

69
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,041
Well,

70
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:03,833
when I was a kid,

71
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,333
I was really, really skinny.

72
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,458
Always got bullied.

73
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,666
So I thought,

74
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,958
how can I get stronger?

75
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,416
And later,

76
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:16,375
I just fell in love with fitness.

77
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,750
Hmm.

78
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,750
Sounds like a sob story.

79
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,625
Are you making this up?

80
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,291
What,

81
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,458
don’t believe me?

82
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,041
Hold on.

83
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:45,708
What’re you thinking?

84
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:47,625
I’m thinking,

85
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,875
you looked pretty innocent back then.

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
What made you

87
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,333
turn into a beast who only thinks with his lower half?

88
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,416
Boring.

89
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,666
You killed the vibe.

90
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:03,666
I’m going to bed.

91
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,875
Honey, please open the door quick!

92
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,166
I’m begging you, open the door!

93
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:30,875
What’s up?

94
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,458
I’m trying to sleep.

95
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:33,708
Honey,

96
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:37,250
I really need you right now, open the door quick!

97
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,750
I’m putting in earplugs, go to sleep.

98
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,666
Listen to me,

99
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:45,708
listen, just open the door!

100
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,375
Ah!

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ah!

102
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,208
I told you, I’ve cut off everyone I was involved with.

103
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,208
I’ve cleaned it all up.

104
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,541
But why do I still not believe you?

105
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,000
Why don’t I believe you?

106
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,208
Why don’t I believe you?

107
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,208
So how can I make you believe me, huh?

108
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,833
Use them all up.

109
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,958
I bet you won’t have the energy to mess around then.

110
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,125
Well,

111
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,375
bring it on!

112
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,125
Well,

113
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,916
bring it on!

114
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:02,916
Let’s give it a try.

115
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,208
Santa Claus, Santa Claus!

116
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,416
Let me fix it again, over here.

117
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,250
It’ll be flat in no time.

118
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,166
Hey, hey!

119
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,958
You’re being naughty!

120
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,458
Hey, hehe!

121
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,083
You’re doing it again!

122
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,166
You’re doing it again!

123
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,625
Watch out…

124
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,333
Hey!

125
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,541
You’re doing it again!

126
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,791
Careful, I’ll use this!

127
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,041
You dare?

128
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,833
You think I don’t dare?

129
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,708
I dare!

130
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:42,791
Come on!

131
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,208
I’m coming!

132
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,500
I’m really coming!

133
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Come on!

134
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:54,375
Hahaha, it’s pretty cool!

135
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,791
Really pretty cool!
