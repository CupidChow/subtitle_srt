1
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,250
You have a new order. Please process it promptly.

2
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,083
What the hell do you want?

3
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:43,250
Nothing much, just supporting your business.

4
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,666
What’s your real motive?

5
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,625
Motive?

6
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,625
To promote Chinese medicine, of course.

7
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,833
Be honest with yourself.

8
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,291
Is your motive really that innocent?

9
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:56,958
Absolutely.

10
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:00,708
Super innocent. Just purely innocent.

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,583
I want to sleep with you.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,875
Then I’m definitely not coming.

13
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:10,375
If you don’t want a bad review...

14
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,291
You’ll definitely show up.

15
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,416
See you later, babe.

16
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,791
Door’s open. Come in.

17
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,708
Hey, what’s going on? Where are you?

18
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,416
Come out already!

19
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,333
Please name your favorite song.

20
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,250
What? I said, turn on the light.

21
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:24,750
Please turn on the light.

22
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,500
Please hum your favorite song.

23
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,000
Then I’ll turn on the light.

24
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,125
Stop messing around.

25
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,375
Turn on the light and come out!

26
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,375
Please hum your favorite song.

27
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,083
How would I know what song you like?

28
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,208
No, your favorite song.

29
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,666
Just for you.

30
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,250
(Singing) Oh my love

31
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,833
(Singing) My darling

32
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,416
(Singing) I've hungered for...

33
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:07,125
(Singing) Oh my love

34
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,958
(Singing) My darling

35
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:14,875
(Singing) I've ...

36
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,666
Can I invite you...

37
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,291
To have dinner with me?

38
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,041
Try this steak. How is it?

39
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

40
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,791
Medium rare.

41
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,041
Of course, steak’s gotta be medium rare.

42
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:50,958
How do you remember that so well?

43
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,500
It’s clearly written on the app.

44
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,041
Steak, medium rare.

45
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,458
Loves *Ghost* and sky blue.

46
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,416
I thought you put in real effort.

47
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,666
Turns out it’s just stuff from the app.

48
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:08,458
You can see it all there.

49
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,958
Does effort mean checking an app?

50
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,791
Don’t ruin the vibe, okay?

51
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:15,375
Come on.

52
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,583
Cheers.

53
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,833
Alright, almost done. One strawberry left.

54
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,000
You eat it.

55
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,083
Here, I’ll feed you.

56
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,125
Getting naughty, huh?

57
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:19,708
Hey!

58
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,333
Hehe.

59
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,791
You’re doing it again?

60
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,750
You believe me?

61
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,666
Don’t you dare!

62
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,500
I wouldn’t dare.

63
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,666
Come on!

64
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,208
Looks good.

65
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,666
Really good.

66
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:31,750
Oh no.

67
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,583
I’m gonna be late.

68
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,125
Where are you going?

69
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,583
I’ve got a super important report due this week.

70
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,875
Gotta go. Don’t miss me too much!

71
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,625
Hey!

72
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,958
You’re cheating?

73
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,500
Might as well call you “Seven Times a Night.”

74
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,791
Don’t tell me these are all for solo sessions.

75
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,833
Drank too much last night.

76
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,500
I don’t remember a thing.

77
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,416
Goodbye.

78
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,416
Whoa, wait, wait!

79
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:40,916
In love,

80
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,916
The worst thing is falling for a player.

81
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:49,291
The best thing is turning that player into my pet.

82
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:51,750
Alright, player.

83
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,750
You just wait.
