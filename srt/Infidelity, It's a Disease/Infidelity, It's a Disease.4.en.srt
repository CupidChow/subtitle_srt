1
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,833
Oh, sorry about that!

2
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:54,916
It’s fine.

3
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,250
Take a look around.

4
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,416
Is that your mom in the photo?

5
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

6
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,958
My parents got divorced when I was six.

7
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:09,166
And then…

8
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,750
When I was eight,

9
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,041
my mom remarried.

10
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,500
So, who did you live with?

11
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,125
On my own, obviously.

12
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:23,041
I’ve been in boarding school ever since.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,916
So, you got into fitness…

14
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,750
Was it really because you were scared of being bullied?

15
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:36,958
Hey,

16
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,166
why do you look so out of it?

17
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:45,041
Aren’t you supposed to be Mr. Seven-Times-a-Night?

18
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:53,375
Can you just step out for a bit?

19
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,583
I really need a break.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,833
This…

21
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,125
Is it for me?

22
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,708
Hehe.

23
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,291
Nah, that’s for me.

24
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,125
Sorry, bro.

25
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,083
Some friends dropped by yesterday.

26
00:02:44,208 --> 00:02:46,583
I’ll definitely show up today, promise!

27
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,958
Stop messing around.

28
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:54,916
You’re not gonna show up.

29
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,250
Out in the wild?

30
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,041
You’re going all out, huh?

31
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:25,083
Of course! You scared?

32
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,500
I’m worried *you* can’t handle it.

33
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,541
Let’s find out.

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,916
Wait for me, babe.

35
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,958
Here I come!

36
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:26,333
You’re late, babe.

37
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,750
I’ve been here for ages!

38
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,791
How did I miss you?

39
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:49,333
Let me ask you something.

40
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,250
Do you really like me?

41
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,583
Of course I do.

42
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:59,375
Prove it.

43
00:05:02,583 --> 00:05:06,583
Alright, how do I prove it?

44
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:12,583
Take off your shirt.

45
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,541
It’s practically freezing out here!

46
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,333
It’s basically subzero!

47
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,083
Can’t even handle a little thing like that?

48
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,583
And you call that love?

49
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,333
I’m outta here.

50
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,208
Fine, I’ll do it!

51
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,750
See that?

52
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,000
Nice, nice.

53
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,791
Now sing…

54
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:06,833
The theme song from *Ghost*.

55
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,125
(Singing) Oh!

56
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,500
(Singing) My love…

57
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:26,750
(Singing) I’ve hungered for your touch…

58
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:33,875
(Singing) I’ve hungered for your touch…

59
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:42,916
(Singing) Time goes by so slowly…

60
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,333
Hey!

61
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,375
Are you nuts or what?

62
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,500
You’re totally crazy!

63
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,458
Sorry, I took it a bit too far.

64
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:24,416
What can I do to make it up to you?

65
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,208
Tell me.

66
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,416
What can I do to get you to forgive me?

67
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,500
I’m sorry.

68
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,833
How about…

69
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,666
You make me a bowl of hot noodle soup?

70
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,875
Why noodle soup?

71
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,625
Because when I was a kid,

72
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,250
whenever I got sick,

73
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:52,333
my mom would make me a bowl of hot noodle soup.

74
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,708
Why did you mess with me?

75
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,625
Because I realized…

76
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:56,958
I kinda like you.

77
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,041
I’ve gotta go.

78
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,666
Can you not leave just yet?

79
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,083
I want to apologize.

80
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,708
Apologize for what?

81
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,416
Actually…

82
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,583
I should be the one apologizing.

83
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,291
I’ve seen a therapist before.

84
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,041
They told me…

85
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,166
I struggle to maintain…

86
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,208
a stable, close relationship.

87
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:02,875
Got it.

88
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,208
I understand what you mean.

89
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:09,916
Actually…

90
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,208
We’ve been through similar stuff.

91
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,750
But what I want to say is…

92
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,791
Even if you’re on your own,

93
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,708
you should still find ways to be happy.

94
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:24,875
Bye.

95
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,291
Hey, wait!

96
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,625
I…

97
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,125
Can I…

98
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,125
eat your hot noodle soup every day?

99
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,708
(Laughter)

100
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,458
Here we go again.

101
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,500
Checking again?

102
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,916
I told you,

103
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,250
I’ve deleted everyone I was involved with.

104
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,083
But why do I still not trust you?

105
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:16,208
So, what do I have to do for you to believe me?

106
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,833
Use them all up.

107
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:27,708
I bet you won’t have the energy to mess around then.

108
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,208
Well…

109
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,708
Let’s give it a try!
