1
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,708
Not bad.

2
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:32,458
Can you provide special services?

3
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,250
No.

4
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,333
We offer legitimate services.

5
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,083
You're from my homeland!

6
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,750
I'm studying nursing at Jingnan University.

7
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,416
Skilled in professional massage and acupuncture.

8
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,541
So, I sell my skills, not my body.

9
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,958
I just couldn't help myself—you're too gorgeous.

10
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,125
Easy fix. Lie down.

11
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:05,041
I'll cool off your wild thoughts.

12
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,375
Hey, what's your name?

13
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,458
Zirui.

14
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,416
Zirui.

15
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:43,875
Yeah.

16
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,125
Why did you come to Japan to do this?

17
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,583
Oh, I get it.

18
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,833
A gambling dad.

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,291
A sick mom.

20
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,791
A sister in school.

21
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,125
And a broken her.

22
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,916
Easy, easy! That hurts!

23
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,625
No pressure, no results.

24
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,958
Seriously, why did you come to Japan?

25
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,708
To promote Chinese medicine, obviously.

26
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,125
What’s with your imagination?

27
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,791
Hey, doc.

28
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,625
Can I ask a professional question?

29
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,458
Sure.

30
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,291
I feel off all over.

31
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:47,458
What’s wrong with me?

32
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,416
Overindulgence.

33
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,791
What’s that mean?

34
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:04,541
Kidney deficiency.

35
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,375
Can I...

36
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,791
make a small request?

37
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,291
What’s a small request?

38
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,541
Just...

39
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,416
a tiny, tiny request.

40
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:25,958
Fine.

41
00:04:30,458 --> 00:04:32,333
Can you wear this for the massage?

42
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,708
Goodbye.

43
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,916
You’re mad?

44
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,625
Pervert!

45
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,500
Really mad?

46
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,708
What if I wear it?

47
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:57,708
Turn around.

48
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,041
Let me look a bit longer.

49
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,541
Looking costs extra.

50
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,666
Charge me.

51
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,458
Are you getting the massage or not?

52
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,750
There’s still time.

53
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,583
No rush.

54
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,291
If you’re not in a hurry, I’ll head back.

55
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,375
Hey!

56
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,583
Wait, wait!

57
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,500
Turn around.

58
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:25,875
Hey!

59
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,791
Be gentle this time, okay?

60
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,208
Okay.

61
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,000
Ah, that’s nice.

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,583
Keep it up, keep it up.

63
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:46,916
Feels good.

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,458
Keep going, keep going!

65
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:53,833
Too hard?

66
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,875
No, no, no!

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,041
It’s too good!

68
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:56,958
Keep going!

69
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,708
Why yell if it feels good?

70
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,666
You’re so weird.

71
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,166
Can’t I yell if it feels good?

72
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,666
So fierce yet cute.

73
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,083
Hey!

74
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,250
Yes, yes, harder, harder!

75
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,583
Yes, yes!

76
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:14,291
Don’t stop!

77
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:18,416
Don’t stop, keep going!

78
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,916
Harder, don’t stop!

79
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:24,083
Yes!

80
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,458
Harder!

81
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,416
I have to go. Something came up.

82
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,916
You’re not done yet!

83
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,333
Where are you going?

84
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,416
What are you doing?

85
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,166
You’re too good-looking.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,458
Let me kiss you.

87
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,625
You’re really too gorgeous.

88
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,791
Can I check my phone first?

89
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,458
Sure.

90
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:55,791
Thank you for your patronage.

91
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,458
This session is complete.

92
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,625
We hope to serve you again.

93
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:01,750
Huh?

94
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,833
I can extend the session!
