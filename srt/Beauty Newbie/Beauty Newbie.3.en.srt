1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,520
Thank you everyone for joining the petition.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,456
Thank you, Faye.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,600
Unlike someone who never gave any cooperation in anything.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,336
Liu.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
Can I talk to you?

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
What do you want from me?

7
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:13,680
Why can’t you let me have a good life?

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,696
Mac.

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,360
I’m ready to give you my answer.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,039
I want to go out with you. I think I also like…

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,856
Liu!

12
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,279
Liu, what are you talking about?

13
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,120
You must have misheard me.

14
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,640
You shouldn’t be so easy to men.

15
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,880
Mac, how can you say that to her?

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Faye.

17
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,536
Faye.

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,376
Faye.

19
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Faye.

20
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,200
Sorry.

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
My foot slipped.

22
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,600
“Slipped,” my ass.

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,600
That was clearly intentional.

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,320
Jerk!

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,320
You!

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,080
I apologized, didn’t I?

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,960
Why don’t we just forget it?

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,160
Think of it as a part of your “theatrical.”

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
You, jerk!

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Mac.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,320
You alright?

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
You!

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Mac.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,079
Mac, stop it.

35
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,976
You ass!

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let go of me!

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,280
If I do, you’re getting beat, dude.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,800
Enough!

39
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:02,960
Come on. Let’s just go.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,360
I’ll let this go, Mac.

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
But you…

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,040
I’ll deal with you later.

43
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Hey.

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,600
Be careful of her.

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,960
[BASED ON LINE WEBTOON “MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY” BY KI MAENGGI]

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,119
And here I thought

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,760
that when you said you would “stay out of it,”

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,120
you really would stay out of it.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
Turned out you were just waiting to make a grand entrance.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,920
Had me thinking you’re The Flash back there just now, you know. You were moving left and right like anything!

51
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,240
What do you want?

52
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,600
You’re asking me?

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,080
I think you should ask yourself what you want, you dumbass.

54
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
“Dumbass”?

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Yeah, you, dumbass. Honestly, what do you want?

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,559
I just couldn’t stand it.

57
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,880
What else was I supposed to do?

58
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Couldn’t stand what?

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,320
What happened to Liu? Or you couldn’t stand Faye?

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,840
Eah, those are one thing to worry about.

61
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,240
But there’s someone else I’m more concerned with.

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,040
Do you know a guy named Saint?

63
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Saint?

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,040
I heard of him. Why?

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you quiet because you’re wary of me now?

66
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,480
I’m quiet

67
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,080
because I’m mad at Guy.

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Who does he think he is to point at you

69
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,960
and say things like that?

70
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,120
He’s so infuriating.

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Yeah…

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,480
I don’t get it, either.

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Mimi, you never get anything.

74
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
Maybe this is a good thing.

75
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,880
Now that you’re angry with Guy,

76
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,800
you won’t think about Mac too much.

77
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,480
Oh, just forget about Mac.

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
I’m more worried about you, Liu.

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,479
How are you feeling?

80
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
Are you alright?

81
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
It’s okay.

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Thank you.

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
It’s alright.

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Professor.

85
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,560
I’d like to report being assaulted at the cafeteria.

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,560
I rushed here before anyone could twist the story into their favor.

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,760
Can you see my face, Prof?

88
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Look.

89
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,640
What happened?

90
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
That freshman Guy started it.

91
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,160
I was just walking by when he stuck his foot out and tripped me.

92
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
He attacked me.

93
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,000
I’m bruised all over.

94
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,080
He needs to be punished for this.

95
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,680
We need to teach him that our faculty doesn’t tolerate this kind of behavior.

96
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
How could he attack me?

97
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,600
Calm down, Mac.

98
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,440
I need to hear his side of the story first.

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,720
Do you have any evidence, like a video clip, or a witness?

100
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,400
I do have one witness.

101
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,320
I’m not the first person Guy picked a fight with.

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,800
I’ll ask him to come by.

103
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Call him.

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,720
Thank you.

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Hello?

106
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,200
You got into a fight with Guy because you were trying to help Liu?

107
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Fine.

108
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,000
I’m in the area.

109
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,440
I’ll drop by.

110
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,480
He said you punched him.

111
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Is it true?

112
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
Did he tell you why I did that?

113
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
Doesn't matter ’cause you threw the first punch.

114
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
And it wasn’t the first time you picked fights.

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,600
I have a witness who can vouch for me that you’re a freaking thug.

116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,000
We’ll see.

117
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,760
Saint?

118
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
So you do know.

119
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Scared now?

120
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
No.

121
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,640
I’ve been wanting to see him, is all.

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,559
He said you can testify

123
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,280
that Guy has been acting inappropriately many times before.

124
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
Is that right?

125
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Yes.

126
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,080
This guy’s bad news, Prof.

127
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,199
I got into a beef with him last time

128
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,880
because he was bothering a girl.

129
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,560
Think about it, Prof. He’ll even pick fights with women.

130
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,720
See?

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,160
I told you.

132
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,280
He isn’t as trustworthy as he looks.

133
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,000
He’s bad news.

134
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,200
Oh, I heard that it was about the same girl this time around, too.

135
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,560
Guy, why are you like this?

136
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,600
Did Mac stop you this time?

137
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,800
Why don’t you see for yourself?

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,720
Someone got it on camera.

139
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Here.

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,480
See, Prof?

141
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,080
Guy tripped Mac over,

142
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,480
and then taunted him for it.

143
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,560
Oh, it’s so clear here.

144
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,480
It’s evident that you started it.

145
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,359
But after that he threw a chair at...

146
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,520
Ah…

147
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,120
Too bad they didn’t get that part on camera.

148
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,480
But they’ve got something from before that.

149
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
You wanna see?

150
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,600
They got the whole thing recorded.

151
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Liu.

152
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,280
Are you crying? Your acting is pretty good.

153
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,480
I think you will pass the audition.

154
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
Oh, Mac.

155
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,440
You’re such a jerk for this.

156
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Sorry.

157
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
I’m a professor.

158
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
I must remain impartial.

159
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,720
Saint, why are you doing this?

160
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,640
You lied to me.

161
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,880
You said you’d take care of her.

162
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,480
How could you do this?

163
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Now you asked me to blame all this on Guy?

164
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,080
Someone like you…

165
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,760
Should I let the faculty deal with you,

166
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,320
or should I take the matter into my own hands?

167
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
I...

168
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Listen…

169
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,960
That’s the story, Professor.

170
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,760
I… started it.

171
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,200
It’s not the end of the world…

172
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,440
to say “thank you,” you know?

173
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,320
You want me to thank you for calling me “bad news”?

174
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,520
That’s your takeaway from this whole thing?

175
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,960
I would have been able to defend myself just fine without you there.

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh, wow.

177
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,440
Would you listen to this spunky guy?

178
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,000
I’ll at least thank you for telling the truth.

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,080
Didn’t know it took that much out of you to say a simple thank you.

180
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Whatever.

181
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
Thank you for saving Liu.

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
I don’t need your gratitude.

183
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,680
Whatever concerns Liu concerns me.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You have nothing to do with it.

185
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, you little...

186
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,159
Oh, this place is adorbs.

187
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Totally.

188
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,880
How did you know I’ve always wanted to come here?

189
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,680
I saw it on this blog called Liu’s Scent.

190
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,200
They said a good scent helps the mind relax.

191
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,400
Especially this one.

192
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,280
Lavender.

193
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,080
I just don’t want you to be sad.

194
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,160
Thank you, Faye.

195
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,920
Seeing how amazing you are only makes me so mad at Guy.

196
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,200
How dare he say all that about you?

197
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,520
Guy can’t seem to leave you alone.

198
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,080
Was there some history between you two?

199
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
It’s nothing.

200
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,400
We just went to the same school once.

201
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,240
I see. Same school.

202
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,680
I think Guy said that

203
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,480
because he misunderstood me.

204
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,240
Before this…

205
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,560
I told Mac I liked him.

206
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,400
Please don’t get this the wrong way, Liu.

207
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,480
I just thought Mac was too quick to fall for you,

208
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,280
that I wanted to make sure that he really liked you.

209
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,880
So I put him to a test.

210
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,240
I think Guy heard that,

211
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,600
and thought I was trying to steal Mac from you.

212
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,400
Maybe that’s why he told you to be careful of me.

213
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,880
But maybe it was really all my fault.

214
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
No, Faye.

215
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Not at all.

216
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
It wasn’t your fault at all.

217
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,880
If it wasn’t for you,

218
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,640
I would have dated Mac without knowing that he didn’t really like me.

219
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,560
Don’t blame yourself.

220
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
I’m sorry, Liu.

221
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,520
Thank you, Faye.

222
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,136
Paula.

223
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
Hmm?

224
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,840
You get this, don’t you?

225
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,000
I’m afraid I don’t this time around.

226
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,840
Come on now.

227
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,480
Don’t cry.

228
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,160
Let’s focus on the good things.

229
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
It would be even better

230
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
if you forgive Guy for this, too.

231
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,480
But that jerk...

232
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,280
I mean… but he did you wrong.

233
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,680
Why are you defending him?

234
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,560
I don’t want to be on bad terms with him.

235
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Please.

236
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Hang on.

237
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Did someone say she doesn’t want to be on bad terms with Guy?

238
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Did you, Faye?

239
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,080
Are you only pretending to argue with him because you’re a tsundere?

240
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Stop it, Paula.

241
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,400
You watched too much TV.

242
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,280
I didn’t know you’re a tsundere, Faye.

243
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,200
Oh, Mimi!

244
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,440
You got my joke, didn’t you, Liu?

245
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,240
Really?

246
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,560
[Mac] Really?

247
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,800
[Mac]

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hmm…

249
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,120
Let me see.

250
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,880
Whoa, that’s quite a wound.

251
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,200
And you insisted it was nothing.

252
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,320
Apply this.

253
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,599
I already did.

254
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,920
How much more do you need me to?

255
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
Just put it on before Dad sees it.

256
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,199
But seeing how big it is,

257
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,640
I think you’ll have to avoid him altogether.

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,920
I don’t think Dad will get mad anyway.

259
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,360
He’d understand.

260
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,400
Would he understand the video on social media?

261
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,600
Hey, aren’t you really good with computers?

262
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,400
Can you wipe it off the internet for me?

263
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,760
What, you afraid Dad might reduce your allowance?

264
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,360
If Dad reduced my allowance,

265
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,040
I wouldn’t have the money to buy new T-shirts for you to steal, you know?

266
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,919
Steal? I’m just borrowing!

267
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,319
That’s an accusation.

268
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,640
“Borrow,” huh?

269
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,599
Even if you didn’t ask, I’d have done it for you anyway

270
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,200
because I’m the best sister ever.

271
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,800
Don’t worry. You’ll still get your full allowance in that bank account.

272
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,040
Just check it.

273
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,240
I didn’t get anything.

274
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,120
[Dad: Did you get into a fight at school?]

275
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,176
Gale.

276
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,920
I swear I wiped the internet clean!

277
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,880
[Dad: Did you try to help your brother get away with this?]

278
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
- Crap. - Crap.

279
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,240
What do we do now, Guy?

280
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
I have an idea.

281
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,480
Hi, Dad.

282
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,920
The thing is Guy…

283
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,559
Guy made me do it!

284
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,840
This had nothing to do with me!

285
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Gale!

286
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,120
Why…

287
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,200
Why didn’t you reply to any of my texts?

288
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,240
Is something wrong?

289
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,800
Are you… mad at me about Mac?

290
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,319
Since you’re done putting all your dirty laundry in the machine,

291
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,360
I don’t think you have anything else to do here.

292
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Who says I’m done?

293
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,920
Well, now you are...

294
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Yeah?

295
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,720
You wanna talk?

296
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,440
I think you are done.

297
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Hold on!

298
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Are you insane?

299
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,360
What do you think you’re doing?

300
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,760
Well, I didn’t know what else I needed to do for you to talk to me.

301
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,400
But there’s nothing to talk about.

302
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,720
You said you’d take care of me and then send Mac.

303
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,600
Do you have any idea what he did to me?

304
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,000
I’m sorry.

305
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,800
This is my fault.

306
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,320
I really didn’t know Mac would do that to you.

307
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,720
You know him better than I do.

308
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,520
How could you say that?

309
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,880
You’re absolutely right.

310
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,640
But I really didn’t expect any of this to happen.

311
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,199
The Mac I know is a harmless dude who never bags any woman.

312
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,919
He even got the nickname Body-count Mac

313
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,320
because he misses his chances every time, you know?

314
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,800
Is… Is that so?

315
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Yeah.

316
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,840
I really don’t know what got into him to make him do that.

317
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,720
But don’t worry, Liu.

318
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,840
I dealt with him

319
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,520
and ordered him not to get anywhere near you again.

320
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:26,280
I swear I’ll try my best to keep that promise I gave to your parents.

321
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,560
So…

322
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,960
Will you let me make up for it?

323
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,920
I won’t ask anyone else to take care of you.

324
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,840
I’ll do it myself.

325
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
It’s alright.

326
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,880
I can take care of myself just fine.

327
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
I got it.

328
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,920
I swear I got it.

329
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Let me.

330
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,120
But it doesn’t hurt to let someone help you, does it?

331
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
You know what?

332
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,480
I’ll let you handle your own things

333
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,800
when your mother says you’ve talked to her.

334
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Like your father said,

335
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,240
nobody wants you to carry the whole world on your own little shoulders.

336
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,320
How can I trust you?

337
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,120
You asked me for my contact so quickly, you know?

338
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,360
Ah, about that…

339
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,240
That’s not exactly accurate.

340
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,800
And I was just asking for your sake, by the way.

341
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,560
Your mother actually gave me your contact since day one.

342
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,040
I just couldn’t bring myself to text you out of the blue and startle you.

343
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,480
So I had to pull a little stunt for that.

344
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,160
Well…

345
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,720
I’m always here if you need to talk.

346
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,360
Just make sure to keep your shirt on next time.

347
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,960
If you don’t like it, I won’t do it again.

348
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,360
I’m glad we finally got to talk, Faye.

349
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,520
Guy totally messed up everything.

350
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,640
But we’re in the clear now.

351
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,600
Well… Let’s go out.

352
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,240
Faye, is everything alright?

353
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,800
I’m sorry.

354
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,280
But I don’t think we can go out together.

355
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,800
Yesterday, I talked to Liu.

356
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,560
Liu really likes you, Mac.

357
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,960
But I don’t like her!

358
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
I like you!

359
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,120
I always have.

360
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,480
What do you want me to do?

361
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,920
Betray Liu?

362
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,600
She’s my friend.

363
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,720
Is there no way we can go out together?

364
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
I can’t betray Liu.

365
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,200
I feel really sorry for her, Mac.

366
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,880
She was so ugly in school

367
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,960
that she didn't want anyone to see her.

368
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,680
That’s why we petitioned to stop all that Hot Guy-Hot Girl stuff.

369
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
We don’t want anyone to unearth her old photos to make fun of her.

370
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,840
I think, if that happened, it would be really bad for her…

371
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,760
so bad that she might even quit school.

372
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,880
But you...

373
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:01,440
Do you see what a poor thing she is?

374
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,200
This is the first time she has friends,

375
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,920
the first time she experiences love.

376
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Imagine if her friend and the man she loves betray her…

377
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,120
I can’t do that.

378
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,080
But Faye, we love each other.

379
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,480
There’s gotta be a way to make this work.

380
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,640
As long as Liu is here,

381
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,240
there is no way, Mac.

382
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,000
Does that mean if Liu isn’t here,

383
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,400
we can work out somehow?

384
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,240
What are you going to do?

385
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,920
Chase her away?

386
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,080
You can’t do that.

387
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
Faye…

388
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,320
(I feel really sorry for her, Mac.)

389
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,720
(She was so ugly in school)

390
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,640
(that she didn't want anyone to see her.)

391
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,840
(If that happened, it would be really bad for her…)

392
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,240
(so bad that she might even quit school.)

393
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,920
One hot coffee, please.

394
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,360
Oh, sorry.

395
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,840
It’s all shattered.

396
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
What do you want?

397
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,080
What are you saying?

398
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,000
You’re the one who knocked my compact powder over and shattered it.

399
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,400
How can you ask me such a thing?

400
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,160
I should be asking you what you’re doing.

401
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,120
It’s all ruined. This is expensive, you know…

402
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,320
Give it to me and I’ll buy you a new one.

403
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,879
Don’t wanna buy the wrong brand and have to talk to you more than this.

404
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,000
That would be annoying.

405
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,520
Oh, I love that kind of responsibility.

406
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,520
Where’d you learn that?

407
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,800
What school taught you that?

408
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,720
I’ll say in my videos that this school produces gentlemen.

409
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,280
What are you talking about?

410
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,520
It’s nothing.

411
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,560
I just want to get to know you better.

412
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,520
Liu isn’t happy to see us fight, you know?

413
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,640
You know what you need to do to get to know me better?

414
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,040
Stop doing what you’re doing.

415
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,920
Well…

416
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
I wouldn’t mind a little disciplining from you.

417
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,520
Save that trick for someone else.

418
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,400
Give me that.

419
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,880
Please. Just tell me.

420
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Is it ready?

421
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,560
Hey, won’t you take responsibility anymore?

422
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,720
You happy now?

423
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,320
Guy, you haven’t answered me.

424
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,520
Tell me, please, please, please.

425
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,679
I’ll leave you alone after that.

426
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,160
Please.

427
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,600
Can I have my coffee now, please?

428
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,680
There’s this fly bugging me.

429
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,360
If I’m a fly, then you’re a roach, or a… a flea!

430
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
You two are cute together.

431
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:06,480
- We’re not together! - We’re not together!

432
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,320
Guy.

433
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,360
I really do want to get to know you better.

434
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,160
I don’t share the sentiment.

435
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,520
Stop following me.

436
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,040
Fine by me.

437
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,720
[They went to Arunlert School. I have a photo. I went to that school, too.]

438
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,160
Arunlert…

439
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,040
Where would I find a photo of Liu?

440
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,679
[Does anyone have a photo of Liu from Chemistry from when she was in school?]

441
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,000
[Have a good day, Liu.]

442
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,120
[Saint: Have a good day, Liu.]

443
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,920
[Mac: First years have a meeting at our major’s meeting room at 10.]

444
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,480
[Mac: Come meet me before that. I need to talk to you.]

445
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,680
[Mac: I saw you’ve read my texts.]

446
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,520
[Mac: Not afraid that your old photo might get out anymore?]

447
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,400
What do you want, Mac?

448
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,519
If you don’t want me to show your photo at the meeting,

449
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,680
come talk to me.

450
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,080
(Or do you want it all over the internet instead?)

451
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,279
(People are still talking about the petition.)

452
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,120
They’re wondering why our major withdrew from the competition.

453
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,000
They all want to see what you looked like before.

454
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
Why are you doing this?

455
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,600
(Come talk to me and you’ll find out.)

456
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,720
If this goes well,

457
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,120
nobody has to get hurt.

458
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,040
Oh, hey, Liu.

459
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,759
Is something wrong?

460
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
You don’t look so well.

461
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,760
It’s nothing.

462
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,560
I’ll head there first.

463
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:37,919
What? Why?

464
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
The meeting doesn’t start until much later.

465
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
Liu?

466
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,360
What’s with her?

467
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,680
[Mac wants to talk to me in the meeting room.]

468
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,200
[Can you come here, Faye? I’m scared.]

469
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,120
He didn’t take long showers.

470
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,559
He ghosted me and had a new girlfriend!

471
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,520
Oh, you finally know.

472
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
How’d you know that before I do?

473
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,279
Did he tell you?

474
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,040
Oh, that…

475
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,999
How could he tell you before he told me?

476
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,200
Faye.

477
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,760
Faye, help me out.

478
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,840
[Mac wants to talk to me in the meeting room.] [Can you come here, Faye? I’m scared.]

479
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Faye.

480
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Faye.

481
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,440
Faye, what’s wrong?

482
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,640
It’s nothing.

483
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,800
What happened, Mimi?

484
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,120
Faye…

485
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,680
Oh, dear Mimi.

486
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,720
Just have a bite of this and you’ll feel better.

487
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,696
Don’t cry.

488
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,880
Say “ah.”

489
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,040
What else do you want from me, Mac?

490
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,920
Was what you did to me not enough?

491
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,040
I’m sorry for everything that happened.

492
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,080
If you knew it wasn’t a good thing, why did you do it?

493
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,000
I had to do it for myself.

494
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,640
You know why they called me “Body-count Mac”?

495
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,240
You should get it.

496
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,880
You were bullied into getting that surgery, weren’t you?

497
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,360
I’m like that, too.

498
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,240
I’m running from something, too.

499
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,640
We’re the same, Liu.

500
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,520
You got away from it.

501
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,440
You can help me get away, too.

502
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,080
What do you want me to do?

503
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,240
Stop liking me.

504
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,120
Tell Faye you’re okay if she wants to date me.

505
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,600
Let me have a girlfriend so I can stop being Body-count Mac.

506
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,656
But...

507
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,960
If you won’t do it,

508
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,360
I’m going to leak this.

509
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,520
I need you to get out of my and Faye’s lives.

510
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
Hey.

511
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,080
What are you doing on campus today?

512
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,480
Almost makes me think you want to be in that meeting.

513
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,720
Well, do you?

514
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,639
I have some classes to attend at another faculty.

515
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,960
Oh, sorry I forgot you’re our star athlete.

516
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,320
Do you know what the meeting is all about, though?

517
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,240
If you’re so curious, why not just attend it?

518
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,000
I’m not curious.

519
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,280
I’m just wondering why Liu had to get there so early.

520
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,440
Saw her rush to the meeting room so fast.

521
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,760
Oh, this is even weirder.

522
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,120
What are fourth-years still doing here?

523
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Excuse me.

524
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,600
What time is the meeting for freshmen again?

525
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,320
Hmm? What meeting?

526
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,519
We’re here for class.

527
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,600
There’s no meeting.

528
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,960
But… you guys told us in the freshman group chat?

529
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,880
Oh, it’s nothing.

530
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,320
We got it wrong.

531
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,080
Isn’t this weird?

532
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,920
They told us to come…

533
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,360
Why are they acting like they don’t know anything?

534
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
[First years have a meeting at our major’s meeting room at 10.]

535
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,576
Hey!

536
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Where are you going?

537
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Wait up!

538
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,240
Hey, is everyone here?

539
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,200
Hurry up.

540
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,360
I have something important to tell you all.

541
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,200
You guys must be wondering what this meeting’s all about.

542
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,600
We already wrapped up the orientation, after all.

543
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,720
But I feel like you guys don’t know each other well enough.

544
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,080
I’m talking about another campus event.

545
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,200
Our campus is holding a fair soon.

546
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,040
The event will be held on…

547
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,280
What is it, Liu?

548
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,600
I’m not sure what’s going on, Faye.

549
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,120
But Mac wants me to tell you that

550
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,960
I’m okay if you and Mac want to go out together.

551
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,040
If you date him, he won’t leak my old photo.

552
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,680
But I don’t like him.

553
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,800
I was just testing him.

554
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
I know.

555
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,960
You really don’t want anyone to see that photo, do you?

556
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,280
I just don’t want anyone to see it.

557
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,640
But I know you don’t like Mac.

558
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,000
I don’t know what to do.

559
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
I may not understand you

560
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,640
because I don’t share the same past.

561
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,520
But if it matters to you,

562
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,200
I’ll go out with Mac.

563
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
For you.

564
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,520
No, Faye.

565
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
It’s okay.

566
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,120
I’ll be okay

567
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,440
if I know I get to protect my friend.

568
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,600
I’ll talk to him.

569
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,840
And this is a tradition that happens every year…

570
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,880
Mac?

571
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,200
I have something to tell you.

572
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Yes?

573
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,760
What I want to say is…

574
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Faye, please stop.

575
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,560
Don’t do this.

576
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Don’t do what, Liu?

577
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,800
Don’t go out with Mac, Faye.

578
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Liu!

579
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,120
You sure you know what you’re doing?

580
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,360
What’s going on?

581
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
I don’t know.

582
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,880
It looks like Mac and Liu really are arguing about something.

583
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Guy!

584
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,480
Liu.

585
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,160
You really won’t get out of our way, huh?

586
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,520
It’s not me standing in your way.

587
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,960
Faye never likes you.

588
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Liar!

589
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,200
She told me herself that she likes me.

590
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,080
You’re the one making this complicated.

591
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,560
Am I right, Faye?

592
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,800
Tell her you like me.

593
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Tell her, Faye!

594
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,120
I’m sorry. I don’t like you.

595
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,600
You can’t use me to make Faye like you.

596
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
I get it.

597
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,560
Please stop this, Mac.

598
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I get it now.

599
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,320
You’re still trying to sabotage Faye and me.

600
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,800
Isn’t fooling people your area of expertise?

601
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,600
You fool people into thinking that you’re beautiful

602
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,840
when your actual face looks like…

603
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
Scared?

604
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,800
If you’re scared then why are you doing this to me?

605
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,200
Do the right thing, Liu.

606
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,560
If you won’t,

607
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,880
I’ll show everyone what your real face looks like.

608
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,680
Mac has her old photo?

609
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,920
I don’t know, dude.

610
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,720
Hey, Mac really does have Liu’s old photo!

611
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,400
Mac, please, don’t do this.

612
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,480
Liu doesn’t…

613
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Doesn’t what?

614
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
Hmm?

615
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,480
You guys also want to see her old face, right?

616
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
Right?

617
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,560
Oh, I do.

618
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,080
Do what’s right, Liu.

619
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,480
I am doing exactly that.

620
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,039
The truth is Faye doesn’t like you.

621
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,040
Liu!

622
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,960
I’m trying to do you a favor here, you bitch.

623
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,160
Guess you don’t want that.

624
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Guy, grab the remote!

625
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
You again, jerk?

626
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
You!

627
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,400
Crap, I should have grabbed his wooden sword.

628
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
You!

629
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,320
I’m warning you.

630
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,720
Stay out of this.

631
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Jerk!

632
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,200
You thought that was all I got?

633
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
Are you okay now?

634
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,199
Hey, what’s this?

635
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:19,720
Oh, crap. [This is Liu before plastics. From Mac.]

636
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,560
[That’s her actual face. Awful!]

637
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,520
[Let’s make it viral.] [Save it before it’s gone.]

638
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,240
[Let’s make it viral.] [Save it before it’s gone.]

639
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:23,640
Is this even the same person? [Dude, look at her face.] [Look at her old face.]

640
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,240
She looks like a ghost.

641
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:26,559
She does have a ghost face.

642
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,200
Damn, her surgeon must be really good.

643
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,439
No wonder she doesn’t want anyone to see this.

644
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:31,976
Is this for real?

645
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,560
There’s no way this is the same person.

646
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,800
She looks like a corpse.

647
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,760
Ghost-face.

648
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,800
Guys, don’t share it.

649
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,719
People are looking for this.

650
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Shut up!

651
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,200
Liu. Liu!

652
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,160
Hey, go after her.

653
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
I’ll deal with this.

654
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,880
Hey, delete it.

655
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,960
- I think it’s too late. - Now!

656
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:02,760
It’s all over campus now.

657
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Ann.

658
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,680
Do you know where Liu lives?

659
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,079
(How would I know that?)

660
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,559
(I’ll ask Mimi or Paula.)

661
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,560
(Take a breath, dude.)

662
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,680
How the hell can I do that when she’s crying?

663
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,120
(Fine. I’ll call you back.)

664
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
[Aren’t you way too worried about her?]

665
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,400
(I don’t want her to think she’s alone anymore.)

666
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,720
(Even if she doesn’t want to see me, )

667
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,360
(I just want her to know that)

668
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,280
(I’ve always been here by her side.)

669
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,520
Saint. This is like a paradise to me.

670
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,280
I’m glad to see you smile.

671
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,720
I can only do that here.

672
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,160
You have someone looking out for you at school, too, you know?

673
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,960
I’m trying to prove that Faye is behind all this.

674
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,560
Every time Fairyfaye replies,

675
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,319
if we see her on the phone,

676
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,800
then that will prove that it’s really her.

677
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
What?

678
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:18,920
What are you doing?

679
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:20,160
You’re Fairyfaye, aren’t you?
