1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,760
I’ll be very happy for you

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,400
if it’s him you’re in love with.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,480
I shouldn’t have made use of your confusion and turned it into my advantage.

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,880
Why are you so nice to me?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Even that doesn’t make you love me.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,400
Just go. Go to Guy.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,160
I don’t want to be your friend anymore.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,399
Don’t be so mean to me

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,959
I don’t want to be your friend…

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,200
because I want to be your girlfriend.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,680
(Evermore)

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,360
Are you that proud of your first perfume?

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,400
I’m not proud of the perfume.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,960
I’m proud that I am your first boyfriend.

15
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,840
Silly.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,320
Sorry.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,840
I’m going to ask you if you want to buy water.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,760
There’s a convenience store right there.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,280
But it’s almost our dorm.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,960
Oh, right.

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,560
I…

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,120
Can I…?

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,120
This?

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,520
I’ll carry it for you.

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,920
Thanks.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,240
You’re welcome.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,160
What are you doing?

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,159
I’ve been watching you acting awkwardly for a while.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,240
Saint.

30
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,960
Why are you still out?

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
I came to dry my laundry.

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,200
I saw you two. So I wanted to say hi.

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,040
We are now dating.

34
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,760
Oh.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Why did you tell me that?

36
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,640
In case you didn’t know.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,640
When did you know that you are her boyfriend?

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,640
Around an hour ago.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,040
But…

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
I knew before that.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,680
I knew around three hours before you knew.

42
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,400
Huh?

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
You are always one step behind.

44
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,280
Liu.

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,080
How did he know before me?

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,600
Um.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,320
Baifern Pimchanok

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,000
Win Metawin

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,560
Great Sapol

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,080
Jane Ramida

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
(BASED ON LINE WEBTOON “MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY” BY KI MAENGGI)

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,080
Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,528
This episode contains a scene depicting an eating disorder that some viewers may find disturbing.

54
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:58,120
Viewer discretion is advised.

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Hey, congratulations!

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,679
Lower your voice.

57
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,320
Why are you that excited?

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,879
Of course, I’m excited.

59
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,280
My friend finally has a girlfriend.

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,640
I thought you were rooting for Saint.

61
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,479
I’m an honest and loyal friend.

62
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,680
You got a girlfriend right before Chem-Re Party.

63
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,960
Chem-Re Party?

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,599
You’ve never heard of it?

65
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you know any activities on the campus?

66
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,720
Is all you know Liu?

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,320
That’s all I need to know.

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,040
You make me envious.

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,279
I think you should take Liu to the party.

70
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,800
The party is perfect for new couples to go public with their relationships.

71
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,399
It’s a music event held to celebrate the end of the midterm exam.

72
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,639
At the event, light-up rings are available for sale.

73
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,600
This is the highlight of the event.

74
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,759
Couples usually buy their rings in the same color.

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,200
When the MC asks the lights to be turned off,

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
the visitors will turn on their light-up rings.

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,640
You can tell who is dating by the color of their rings.

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,960
I think you should go public with your relationship with Liu at this event.

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,560
Nonsense.

80
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:21,200
Why would I go to that kind of event?

81
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,200
What’s up, Guy?

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
The Chem-Re party is held next week.

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,680
Yes.

84
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,760
Do you want to wear couple rings with me?

85
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,520
Ann told me that you weren’t interested in the party.

86
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,960
I just didn’t want to admit it.

87
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,240
They are available in many colors.

88
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,640
Why don’t you pick a color?

89
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,920
I can’t promise you that I will go.

90
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,520
I have a concern.

91
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,160
I think I should tell Faye about us first.

92
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,920
Do you really believe that she has feelings for me?

93
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,800
I don’t care what you think of Faye.

94
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
I want to talk to her first.

95
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,120
I don’t want her to find out later and feel mad at me.

96
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,600
If that’s going to make you feel better, I get it.

97
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,360
Is there anything I can help?

98
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,720
It’s okay.

99
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,640
I’ll take care of it.

100
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,160
Alright, see you.

101
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,600
Blue.

102
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,160
Blue.

103
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,160
I want blue ones.

104
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,520
I’ll talk to Faye before the party.

105
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,760
Yes.

106
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,159
Mimi, you did it wrong.

107
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
This is the right one.

108
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,880
Oh, I see.

109
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,520
Thank you, Faye.

110
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,760
I should have listened to you in the last quiz.

111
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,760
Everything you said was in the quiz.

112
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,160
I was studying the old quizzes until late last night.

113
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,880
You slept late but your skin still looks great.

114
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,840
I envy you.

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,600
What’s up, the girl in a relationship?

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,320
How did you know?

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
Everyone knew.

118
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,199
We all saw Saint came to pick you up yesterday.

119
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,600
Right?

120
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,480
Can I talk to you?

121
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,800
Can I listen to it too?

122
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,720
It’s about Guy.

123
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,720
Liu is setting me up with Guy.

124
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,520
Sure. Take your time.

125
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,280
Let’s go somewhere quiet to talk.

126
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,160
It’s great that we are alone.

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,359
I have something to ask you.

128
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,839
I want to make desserts for Guy.

129
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,800
I bought an imported recipe book for it.

130
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,160
I tried to make several desserts but I don’t know what he likes.

131
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,519
Can you tell me the desserts that can help me win over his heart?

132
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
Faye.

133
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,920
I’m sorry but I can’t help you.

134
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
You don’t know what he likes, do you?

135
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,000
Let’s go talk somewhere else.

136
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,879
Is there something wrong?

137
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,920
You’re acting strange.

138
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,440
I…

139
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,320
I want to talk to you about Guy.

140
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Wait.

141
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
Don’t tell me yet.

142
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,960
Please let it be good news. Amen.

143
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,400
Okay.

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,680
What did Guy say?

145
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,840
Guy can’t return your feelings.

146
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Guy still hates me, doesn’t he?

147
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,479
Then I shouldn’t be making desserts for him.

148
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,080
I should find a way to make him drop his prejudice against me first.

149
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,600
It’s not that, Faye.

150
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,160
Guy has a girlfriend.

151
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,560
Who is she?

152
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Me.

153
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,720
Is this a joke?

154
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,240
How is that possible?

155
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,240
You went out on a date with Saint yesterday.

156
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,160
Are you making a joke because you have a surprise for me?

157
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,840
Is Guy hiding around here?

158
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,479
Where is he?

159
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,880
No, Faye.

160
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,640
What I said is not a joke.

161
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,440
Guy and I are dating.

162
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,480
I know how much you trust me.

163
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,760
I was the first one you told about your feelings for him.

164
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,520
You asked me to help you.

165
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
I shouldn’t have done this to you.

166
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,880
How did it happen?

167
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,120
You were dating Saint.

168
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,520
I wasn’t dating him.

169
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,800
I never thought of him that way.

170
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,560
Are you saying you have had feelings for Guy all this time?

171
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,880
Before I told you how I feel?

172
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Then why did you agree to help me?

173
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,080
Why did you tell me not to give up?

174
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,440
At first, I thought it would be better

175
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,240
if you two were together.

176
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,120
But I was wrong.

177
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,240
I made things complicated.

178
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
I’m telling you this.

179
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,240
Because I want to apologize to you.

180
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,160
I’m sorry.

181
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,400
Do you know why I asked for your help?

182
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,440
Because I trusted you.

183
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,960
I thought you were my best friend.

184
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,360
I’m sorry.

185
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,920
Now my best friend,

186
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,200
she said that she is in love with the man I love.

187
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,879
I’m speechless.

188
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,360
How could you do this?

189
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
My head is full of questions.

190
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
I get it.

191
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,639
You can be mad at me.

192
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,760
You can punish me any way you want. I’ll accept it.

193
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,640
If that’s what you want.

194
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
Can I ask you one thing?

195
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,400
Is he happy when he’s with you?

196
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,320
Dating you, does it make him happy?

197
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,080
How about you?

198
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,880
Are you happy?

199
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
If yes,

200
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,520
I am happy for you.

201
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,720
Though I love him so much,

202
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,080
I love him so much that I want him to be happy.

203
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,320
I also love you so much.

204
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,160
I want you to be happy.

205
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,560
That’s enough for me.

206
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,360
If you two are happy,

207
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,560
I am happy too.

208
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,160
It’s good that you told me.

209
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,320
Come to think about it.

210
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,760
All this time, you must have a hard time because of me.

211
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,360
Not at all.

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,080
I’m sorry.

213
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,160
I should be the one who apologizes.

214
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,000
I’m sorry, Liu.

215
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,000
Alright, class.

216
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,919
Today, we are going to learn about phase diagrams.

217
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,720
A phase diagram is a chart showing the physical states of a substance

218
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,360
such as solid, liquid, and gas.

219
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,640
The states are correlated to the conditions of temperature and pressure.

220
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,440
Alright.

221
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,400
This is the phase diagram of water.

222
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
How did it go?

223
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,040
Why don’t you ask her?

224
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,680
I got it. I’m about to do so.

225
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,040
(How did it go?)
[Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support us]

226
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,640
(Faye was mad. But in the end, if we are happy, she is happy for us.)

227
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:19,660
(I know what you are thinking. Faye is having a hard time enough.)

228
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:22,833
(You shouldn’t find fault with her.)

229
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,720
(Fine. Are you going to Chem-Re Party with me?)

230
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,520
(Yes, I’ll go.)

231
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,360
Mork.

232
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,560
Guy is staring at Faye again.

233
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,799
I think it’s a bit strange.

234
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,800
The hashtag #GuyFaye is not trending anymore.

235
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,720
There’s no other reason.

236
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,480
It’s because now everyone knows that the only man in Faye’s heart is me.

237
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,040
You’re delusional.

238
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,520
The hashtag has drastically decreased.

239
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,680
Is she really backing down?

240
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,400
Do you really think that?

241
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,160
Please make some noise for Mork.

242
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,079
If your heart is available

243
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,800
Please let me enter

244
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,360
So I can take a look inside

245
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,040
If there is a room for me to find?

246
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,240
If you dare to take a leap, come on in

247
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,920
Liu, what are you doing?

248
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,160
Faye.

249
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,319
I made cookies for you.

250
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,800
Thank you.

251
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,959
They are cute.

252
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,640
Let me take a photo of them.

253
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,680
(Faye made the cookies for us.)

254
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,640
Isn’t Faye acting too normal?

255
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,280
Yes, she is acting way too normal.

256
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,440
I have unpacked almost all the gifts.

257
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,800
This is the last one.

258
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,600
Let’s see what it is.

259
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,080
Oh!

260
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,239
Everyone, my friend secretly sent this to surprise me.

261
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,400
Look at it.

262
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,200
Are you my fan too?

263
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Let’s try it.

264
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,440
It’s very delicious.

265
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:56,448
(Faye, how can you eat a cake and not gain weight?)

266
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:57,479
(Do you have any workout tips?)

267
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,160
I want to remind you that nutrition balance is very important.

268
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,519
You need to take care of your health and keep the balance in food reward.

269
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,080
I finish unpacking all the gifts.

270
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,680
I got to go now.

271
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,080
Come here.

272
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,520
Bye.

273
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,320
Go.

274
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,880
Don’t worry about me.

275
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,520
I’m fine.

276
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,320
Good.

277
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,599
If you eat it, you need to get it out.

278
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,440
How would you be pretty If you don’t do this?

279
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,440
Mom.

280
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,640
Do you know why you don’t have any friends?

281
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,280
It’s because you are not pretty.

282
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,040
Get it out. Get it all out.

283
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,160
Do it.

284
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,000
Get it out.

285
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,720
Get it out.

286
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,600
Get it out.

287
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,400
40.

288
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,720
41.

289
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,960
42.

290
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,400
43.

291
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,520
44.

292
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,880
45.

293
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,480
You have 45 pimples on your face.

294
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,640
Wash it again.

295
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,240
Wash until the pimples are gone.

296
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,559
Women’s values depend on their beauty.

297
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,920
It will make your life easier.

298
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
That’s not enough. Wash it again.

299
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,320
Women’s values depend on their beauty.

300
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,320
Wake up.

301
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
The more you sleep, the more stupid you become.

302
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,400
Your face looks much better now.

303
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,400
But that’s not good enough.

304
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,320
There are plenty of beautiful girls.

305
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,040
But it’s hard to find women who are both beautiful and intelligent.

306
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,040
You need to become that woman.

307
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,199
When will you stop torturing her and let her live a normal life?

308
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,160
Why would I do that?

309
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,640
I had friends.

310
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,920
I enjoyed going out, shopping, and eating with them until I got fat.

311
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,800
See how it ended?

312
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
My husband left me.

313
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:12,560
If I let her live like that, she will fail in life.

314
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,800
I don’t want her to end up like me.

315
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,400
Isn’t my job to make sure that she has a better life than me?

316
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,240
If you want to live this crazy life, you should do it alone.

317
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,799
Don’t drag Faye into it.

318
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,199
You call me crazy because I teach her the reality that our values are judged

319
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,400
based on these shallow things.

320
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,120
We need to learn to live in this crazy world.

321
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,400
My job is to make sure that she will survive in this world.

322
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,880
Like I told you,

323
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,279
if you don’t work hard to become pretty,

324
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,560
you will never be able to have the world in your hands.

325
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,200
If you are the prettiest,

326
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,520
everything will go your way.

327
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,840
How should we handle body shaming?

328
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,360
Don’t become a victim.

329
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
I need to be pretty.

330
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,240
Don’t show them who you are.

331
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,239
Don’t say what you think.

332
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,159
Say only the things that people want to hear.

333
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Otherwise, you can’t make them love you.

334
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,960
In this world,

335
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
we should not allow body shaming to exist.

336
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:45,400
I believe despite our different appearances, we all are pretty in our own way.

337
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,760
This year, you need to be selected as your school’s picket girl.

338
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,240
If you can get the spotlight on you,

339
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,480
People will follow you on social media.

340
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,600
I can do it, Mom.

341
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,440
I’m the prettiest girl in my class.

342
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,440
Like this?

343
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,600
What are you doing?

344
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,440
Praew, what did you do?

345
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,120
You look much prettier.

346
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,800
I got a nose job.

347
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,520
A nose job?

348
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,080
Since you are much prettier, we should nominate you to be the picket girl.

349
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,440
That’s a good idea.

350
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,120
I want to try it too.

351
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,480
I have never done it before.

352
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,240
Everyone, let’s vote.

353
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,120
Is this good?

354
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,480
Should I hold it like this?

355
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
Thank you so much.

356
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,240
Should I go all the way?

357
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,960
Thank you.

358
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
(You are a loser.)

359
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,920
(You lost to a girl who went under the knife.)

360
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,960
You are the only one who loves me.

361
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,199
(How are you doing?)

362
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,080
(You are quiet lately?)

363
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,480
(I have something to think about.)

364
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,200
(Thank you for worrying about me.)

365
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,599
(Let me know if there’s anything I can help. I’m always by your side.)

366
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,760
(You are the only one who always stays by my side.)

367
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,320
(If you have no one, you always have me.)

368
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:30,148
(That’s heartwarming.)

369
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,188
(Thank you. I feel much better after talking to you.)

370
00:26:31,212 --> 00:26:34,985
(Now I know what I need to do next.)

371
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,880
(I’m excited about Chem-Re Party.)

372
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,400
Is this okay?

373
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,040
Yes.

374
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,960
We should move it a little.

375
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,639
Faye, I bought this snack for you.

376
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,560
Thank you.

377
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,479
It’s okay, Faye.

378
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,880
Enjoy your snack. I’ll clean it up.

379
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,640
I’ll help you carry it.

380
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,880
Since I’m going to perform on stage tonight,

381
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,840
I need to boost my skin.

382
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,760
I should drink it too.

383
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,720
She wants one too?

384
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,440
What’s wrong?

385
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,520
Mimi, that drink doesn’t help boost your skin.

386
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,200
It’s…

387
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,280
It’s good for the excretory system.

388
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,160
Eh?

389
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,880
This is Chem-Re Party.

390
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,520
Let’s have fun.

391
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,840
Where is Mimi?

392
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,840
She said she was going to perform on stage, didn’t she?

393
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,560
That’s right.

394
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
But I’m more worried about Guy.

395
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,119
Where is he?

396
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,080
Why isn’t he taking care of his girlfriend?

397
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
I’m here.

398
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,240
Do you have the sixth sense?

399
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,800
Where were you?

400
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,200
Did you buy the rings?

401
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,320
Of course.

402
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,439
Sorry, I forgot that you are in a honeymoon phase.

403
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
Are you the first one who bought the rings?

404
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,120
How did you know that?

405
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,320
Did you tell someone about us?

406
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,040
What?

407
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Someone teased me about us.

408
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Stop being so lovey-dovey.

409
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,840
Let’s drink.

410
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,120
Cheers.

411
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,360
You’re what I ask for

412
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,999
It might be you

413
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,880
Know this, it’s true

414
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,080
You’re the one I’ve been dreaming of

415
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,800
Someone I want to hold and love

416
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,040
Now and forever

417
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,879
It might be you

418
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,919
Something so true

419
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,719
It’s you that I surrender

420
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,080
Who makes my heart tender

421
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,760
Might be you

422
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,480
Next is a short break before going back to the performance.

423
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,480
It is a result of the relationships in the chemistry department.

424
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,400
Wow, let’s see if there are any sparks among our friends.

425
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:40,280
For those who wear rings in the same color, maybe they have a special relationship.

426
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,840
How many people will get their heart broken because of it?

427
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,840
No matter what will happen,

428
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,760
We have prepared a last song for you.

429
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,360
Are you ready?

430
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,960
Yes.

431
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,040
Ten.

432
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,159
Nine.

433
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,319
Eight.

434
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,280
Seven.

435
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,280
Six.

436
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:04,319
Five.

437
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,280
Four.

438
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,240
Three.

439
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,120
Two.

440
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,360
One.

441
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Turn on your rings.

442
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,080
It’s not working.

443
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,079
Is your ring working?

444
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,880
No. What about yours?

445
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
No.

446
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,480
I have to apologize to everyone for pulling off a stunt like this.

447
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,080
If Guy comes to buy rings, give this box to him.

448
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,360
Are you two dating?

449
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,560
Please don’t tell anyone about it.

450
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,760
Not many people know it.

451
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,960
Mimi also doesn’t know.

452
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,080
I want two blue rings.

453
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,600
I put them in a special box for you.

454
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,320
This one is for a girl and this one is for a guy.

455
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,719
Why didn’t you tell me that you two are dating?

456
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,880
How did you know?

457
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,320
Girls always share this kind of thing.

458
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,000
It’s okay, Faye.

459
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,080
Enjoy your snack.

460
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,640
Did you purposely make other rings broken?

461
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,359
I’m sorry that I surprised you like this.

462
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,360
You wouldn’t tell people about us.

463
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,040
I’m too madly in love with you to wait any longer.

464
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,880
Besides the rings, don’t you think that I have other plans?

465
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,640
If you don’t play along with me,

466
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,640
Liu may get into trouble.

467
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,000
What the hell are you planning to do?

468
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,080
I won’t tell you.

469
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
When did you two start dating?

470
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,720
When did you ask her out?

471
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,360
Did Guy ask you out first?

472
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,360
We were studying together.

473
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,360
After that, we went to a market.

474
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,479
We went to an outdoor movie theatre.

475
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,920
That was when he asked me out.

476
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,680
This is the keyring that he gave me when he asked me out.

477
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,800
He played Tin Can Alley.

478
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,520
He wasn’t good at it but he tried really hard.

479
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,400
He played several times before he got it.

480
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,320
He looked so cute when he gave it to me.

481
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,800
Anyway,

482
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,880
I want to announce to everyone that your shipped couple has become a real couple.

483
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,240
Yuck!

484
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,120
Faye.

485
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,560
I…

486
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,960
I’m sorry.

487
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,080
You did that because you are mad at me about Guy, right?

488
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,240
You must feel really hurt because you love him very much.

489
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,440
No, it’s not about him.

490
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,840
To be honest, I have no feelings for him.

491
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,240
I wanted to throw up when I kissed him on the cheek.

492
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,960
I want to wipe my lips until they disappear.

493
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,120
Are you saying you have never had feelings for him?

494
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,360
Then why…

495
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,640
You still don’t get it, do you?

496
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,720
Everything that happened is not about stupid love.

497
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
It’s not even about Guy.

498
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,320
Then why did you do it?

499
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
This is between you and me, Liu.

500
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,960
Do you really not know…

501
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,880
all this time

502
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
how much I hate you?

503
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,840
But you are my friend.

504
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,440
You’ve been protecting me.

505
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:18,520
You said whether it was natural or man-made, beauty was the same.

506
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,680
I didn’t say that because it was what I think.

507
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,480
I said it because it made me look good.

508
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,520
Do you think I voted for you to be our department’s hot girl

509
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,600
because I wanted to support you?

510
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,640
No, Liu.

511
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
I wanted you to be in the spotlight.

512
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,799
So people would dig into your past and expose your old photos.

513
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,440
You would be humiliated.

514
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,000
Though you didn’t play along with my scheme,

515
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,520
Mac fell for my plan.

516
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,519
He dug in and found your photo.

517
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,960
I have to reveal your photo.

518
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,720
I smiled every time you were in trouble.

519
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,440
I will humiliate you every time you are in the spotlight.

520
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,480
For Guy,

521
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,440
I just can’t let you have him.

522
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,120
Because you don’t deserve to have him.

523
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,000
What the hell are you talking about, Faye?

524
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,720
You’ve never seen me as your friend?

525
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,080
Why do I want to befriend you who makes all my effort become meaningless?

526
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,039
I’ve worked so hard to become this pretty.

527
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,280
But you used plastic surgery as a shortcut.

528
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
You try to be in the same league as me.

529
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,640
How is that fair?

530
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
All you did was lie still when you underwent the surgery.

531
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,400
You had to endure pain for a short while during your recovery.

532
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,599
But I…

533
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,840
I always have to be on a diet.

534
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,160
I’ve worked so hard in school.

535
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,600
I did everything.

536
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,360
How dare you steal the spotlight from me?

537
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,240
I’ve never thought of getting ahead of you.

538
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,240
Then why did you get plastic surgery?

539
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,400
Everyone who goes under the knife wants to be in the spotlight.

540
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,240
I just want to be your friend.

541
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,360
I just want to have friends.

542
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,640
In the past, I was so ugly that no one wanted to be my friend.

543
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,400
You are the first friend in my life, Faye.

544
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,320
I’m begging you.

545
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,200
Can we not be like this?

546
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,080
What else can we be?

547
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,400
Every time I see you, it reminds me

548
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,640
if you have money, you can have everything.

549
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,959
But for me who have nothing,

550
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,480
No matter how hard I try, I will still lose to people like you.

551
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,920
If there are more people like you,

552
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Those who were born with natural beauty will become meaningless.

553
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,440
If this is between you and me,

554
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,360
can you not drag Guy into this?

555
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,559
It’s no longer between us.

556
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,000
Because I am popular while Guy stands out.

557
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,040
This is something that people need to take sides

558
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,400
based on the little information that they have.

559
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,680
Unfortunately, this is the information that they have.

560
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,480
Faye supported Liu to be the department’s hot girl

561
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,000
though she went under the knife.

562
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,360
Faye told everyone to delete Liu’s old photo.

563
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,760
Faye fell victim when Liu tried to rebel during the campus fair.

564
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,280
I’m sorry that people are quick to judge.

565
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,920
This world is on my side, not yours.

566
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,775
(Over my dead body if you want to hurt Faye.)

567
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,520
(I love you, Faye. You’re my idol. )

568
00:41:25,545 --> 00:41:26,089
(Faye is pretty and smart. My grades have improved because she helped me with my studies.)

569
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:27,041
(I love you, Faye. I’ll protect you.)

570
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:28,280
(Faye is sweet and nice. Liu is a troublemaker.)

571
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,640
Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

572
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Is this the effort you mentioned?

573
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,599
Faye’s really smart, you know?

574
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,800
She hardly has any weaknesses.

575
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,040
We have to take her down in real life first before we take her down online.

576
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,920
Will you guys let me do this by myself?

577
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,160
I want this to be between just me and her.

578
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,320
Shut up!

579
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Liu, you bitch.

580
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,160
And you said you cared about me.
