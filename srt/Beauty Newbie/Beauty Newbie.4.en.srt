1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720
You!

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,320
Thank you for saving Liu.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,240
I don't need your gratitude.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,320
Whatever concerns Liu concerns me.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,520
You have nothing to do with it.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,240
I'll show everyone what your real face looks like.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,040
Oh, crap. Is this even the same person?

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,480
Hey, go after her. I'll deal with this.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,360
Liu.

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,760
Thank you for always being there for me

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
whenever I have a hard time.

12
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,440
Without you,

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
I would have no one to lean on.

(BASED ON LINE WEBTOON "MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY" BY KI MAENGGI)

15
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,680
(Chemistry Department Alumni Group Chat) (Did you see this video?)

16
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,280
You were quite cool.

17
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,920
Kendo?

18
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Why did you come all the way here to shop?

19
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
I just passed by.

20
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,400
I thought...

21
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,760
you came here to comfort someone but you were too late.

22
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,040
What about you?

23
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

24
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,240
Why can't I be here?

25
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm living with Liu.

26
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,120
What do you mean?

27
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,360
Are you upset?

28
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,160
When I said I'm living with Liu,

29
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,200
I meant we're living in the same building.

30
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,440
I live next door to her.

31
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,600
It means...

32
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,080
I'm always by her side.

33
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,520
Oh.

34
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,920
You are just a next-door neighbor

35
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,080
who have no clue what Liu likes to eat.

36
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,720
You are talking as if you know.

37
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
Of course.

38
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,480
Because I've known her since we were in junior high.

39
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,640
Then...

40
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,640
Thanks for letting me know.

41
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,520
Yes.

42
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,400
Here it is.

43
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,520
Don't worry.

44
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,560
This next-door neighbor will take good care of Liu.

45
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,520
Unlike her friend who knows everything

46
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,120
but...

47
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,120
But what?

48
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
- But what? - Excuse me.

49
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,640
You haven't paid for it.

50
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,040
I think what happened to Liu is a bit strange.

51
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,000
Strange? How?

52
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,920
It's good to see you.

53
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,480
I have something to ask you.

54
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
I know Mac well.

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,360
I just practiced my lines for the university's theatre.

56
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,520
He never did anything like this.

57
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,360
I was surprised to see him change his mind during the cafeteria incident.

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,040
I think I also like...

59
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,800
Liu!

60
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,080
Liu, what are you talking about?

61
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,160
You must have misheard me.

62
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,960
Another thing is...

63
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,720
Mac is not that smart to find Liu's old photo.

64
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,696
(Faye's Instagram: a group photo of Liu, Faye, Mimi, and Paula)

65
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:07,995
(with a capture asking about Liu's old school.)

66
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,870
What school taught you that?

67
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,935
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,160
I like you, Mac.

69
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,920
Thank you for telling me about Mac.

70
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,680
You leave it to me. I'll take care of it.

71
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,960
(Comment 1: She is all plastic. How could you compare her to Faye?)

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,040
(Comment 2: She doesn't deserve to be in the same photo with Faye.)

73
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,320
(Comment 3: I thought she was reborn.)

74
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,000
(Comment 4: She was nominated for the hot girl of the chem dept?)

75
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
(Comment 5: She is a masked girl. Nothing on her face is real.)

76
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,600
(Faye is way prettier, Natural beauty vs. man-made beauty)

77
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,164
(Faye deserves to be the department's hot girl.)

78
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,256
(She got a new face but Faye still looks prettier than her.)

79
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:04,864
(She is no match for Faye.)

80
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,515
(Faye: Please stop it.)

81
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,437
(This is not funny.)

82
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:14,186
(I don't want to see Liu feel hurt more than she already did.)

83
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,893
(Cyberbullying is considered a defamation offense.)

84
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,008
(If you don't want to be in trouble, please delete it.)

85
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,760
(FairyFaye: Thank you for saying that. It's so true.)

86
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,600
(Comment 2: You're pretty both inside and out.)

87
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,880
(Comment 3: You are my no.1.)

88
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,440
(Stock footage: University campus at daytime)

89
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,320
Mac, you did wrong this time.

90
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,960
You forced her to do what you wanted

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,040
by threatening to release her photo.

92
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,480
Listen to me.

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,040
You have no right to violate her even if you have your reasons.

94
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,520
Professor, I didn't mean to release it at first.

95
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,520
I...

96
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,480
But you did it.

97
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,880
Guy.

98
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,800
I know that you wanted to help your friend.

99
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,000
But you used violence to solve the problem.

100
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,480
So you both will earn demerits by 20 points.

101
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,520
Yes.

102
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,440
Guy, this is your first infraction.

103
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,960
Mac, you have a record of previous infractions.

104
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,880
Lighting firecrackers to impress a girl.

105
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,280
Violating the dress rules for examination.

106
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Professor.

107
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
In all your demerits, 50 points have been deducted.

108
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,040
So...

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,800
you will be suspended from school for one semester.

110
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,760
Professor!

111
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,760
I'm a senior.

112
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,680
If you knew that, you shouldn't have done it.

113
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,080
There's nothing I can do to help you.

114
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,200
He said that he didn't mean it.

115
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,160
Maybe this was not his fault.

116
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,200
Guy, don't pretend as if you are helping me.

117
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,040
I'll take my suspension. Damned it!

118
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,160
Goodbye.

119
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,560
Mac.

120
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,560
What the hell do you want from me?

121
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,240
Who sent you the photo and told you to dig into Liu's past?

122
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,360
Why do you want to know that?

123
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:26,189
If we capture that person

124
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:28,664
and they admit that they told you to threaten Liu,

125
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,400
you may ask the professor to reconsider your school suspension.

126
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,200
If that person is who I think they are.

127
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,240
Who do you think they are?

128
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,360
Tell me where you got the photo.

129
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,280
I got it from a social media user.

130
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,320
It is sent to me by one of Faye's fans.

131
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,040
The person is in a Discord community.

132
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,560
(The username is "FairyFaye".)

133
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,123
(Natural beauty. No need for surgeon's help.)

134
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:12,068
(Fairyfaye: She is gorgeous.)

135
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:14,088
(Fairyfaye: I thought you were an angel.)

Mooping?

148
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
That's not the point.

149
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm trying to prove that Faye was behind everything that happened.

150
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,360
How are you going to do that?

151
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,680
I am going to be an active user in the same community as FairyFaye.

152
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,800
Every time FairyFaye replies in the community.

153
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
If Faye also types on her phone,

154
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,480
it means that Faye is FairyFaye.

155
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,640
If I catch her,

156
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll take her to the professor

157
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,400
and talk about reducing Mac's punishment.

158
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
Guy.

159
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,560
Thank you for helping Liu yesterday.

160
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,560
Everyone.

161
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's give a round of applause to Guy.

162
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,840
You need to thank me for taking the video, Guy.

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,240
Otherwise, no one would know how cool you were.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,240
Mork, I think you should not post the video.

165
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,320
People will talk negatively about Liu again.

166
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,040
That's right.

167
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,120
Faye, you are so thoughtful.

168
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,080
Liu is not in the class yet?

169
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Right.

170
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,200
Saint.

171
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,560
Get your notebook, tablet, laptop, or whatever you use when studying.

172
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,240
Then follow me.

173
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,080
What?

174
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,880
Come on.

175
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,160
Go get it.

176
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,440
When you're done, follow me.

177
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Okay?

178
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,880
Oh.

179
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,760
I didn't know that there was a garden here.

180
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,640
Is this place yours?

181
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,920
No, it's Nam's.

182
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,800
Lately, he's barely come up here.

183
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,680
So I took over it.

184
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,240
I'll help you with your study today

185
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
if you still don't want to go to school.

186
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
You don't need to worry about falling behind in your class.

187
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,960
Is that why you asked me to come here?

188
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,120
Yes.

189
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,360
There is one more thing.

190
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,720
I want you to try this tea.

191
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,680
I think its scent can help relieve your stress.

192
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Did my mom tell you that I am interested in scents?

193
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,760
You are interested in scents?

194
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,320
You didn't know about that?

195
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,040
No but...

196
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,120
Don't tell me that you choose to study chemistry

197
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,080
because you want to be a perfumer.

198
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,400
How did you know the profession?

199
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,000
I think you should go in there to see how well I know it.

200
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,400
Oh.

201
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,560
Saint.

202
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,960
This is like a paradise to me.

203
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,960
If you feel bored,

204
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,960
you can come here.

205
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,160
I'm enfleuraging these petals.

206
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,440
But I'm not sure if it's working.

207
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,320
No one uses this old method anymore.

208
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,080
Can I try it?

209
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Sure.

210
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
But after you finish your study.

211
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,960
Saint.

212
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,920
Liu.

213
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,680
You are skipping your class.

214
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,160
As a perfumer, you not only need to know how to extract fragrance.

215
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,840
but also need to know how to create new fragrances.

216
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,440
I know that.

217
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,960
Can't we do it while studying?

218
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,920
Liu.

219
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,280
You said you want me to relieve my stress.

220
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,360
Fine.

221
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,960
But you need to focus on your study.

222
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,240
Yes.

223
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,840
Shall we begin?

224
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,800
Sure.

225
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,920
Let's start with roses.

226
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,680
Yes.

227
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,760
I'll help you tie it.

228
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
Let me know if it's too tight.

229
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,320
Done.

230
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,120
Thank you.

231
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,920
It's good to see you become lively again.

232
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,040
I only feel this way here.

233
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,520
I think your friends at the university are also helping you.

234
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,040
Let's start our study.

235
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,480
Do you know what moles are?

236
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,040
They are subatomic particles.

237
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,600
It's a unit of measurement for substances.

238
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Atom is...

239
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,443
the average of all isotopes in a substance.

240
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:15,661
(Check Girls Out chatroom)

241
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:22,695
Carbon occurs in three isotopes: carbon 12, 13 and 14.

242
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,280
Each isotope has different atomic masses.

243
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,560
Look at Guy.

244
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,640
He keeps staring at Faye.

245
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,440
That's right.

246
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,160
I think he's acting strange.

247
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,320
Jerry, zip up and listen to the professor.

248
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,720
We need your lecture notes to study for the exam.

249
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,560
What?

250
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,120
Focus.

251
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,360
What did you say?

252
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
Look at him staring at her.

253
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,280
What are you doing?

254
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
Will you send a message today?

255
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,160

Do what?

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,000
How did you send the photo when your phone is with me?

330
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,600
Doesn't it mean that I am not that person?

331
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,920
Students, what is going on?

332
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm sorry, Professor.

333
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,880
My friend misunderstands me.

334
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,720
Guy, I know you hate me.

335
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,080
But you are crossing the line by wrongly accusing me.

336
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm Liu's friend.

337
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,320
Why were you typing on your phone earlier?

338
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,000
I asked Faye to come up with a caption for my Instagram post.

339
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,280
Do you have a problem with that?

340
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,440
Give me my phone back.

341
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm sorry.

342

I'm not accusing you.

346
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm just not able to expose you yet.

347
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,480
Aren't you too straightforward?

348
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,320
But now you know that I didn't do it.

349
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,680
Um.

350

351
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,320
Are you going to walk away like this?

352
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,920
Aren't you going to apologize for misunderstanding me?

353
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,760
It will be nice if you buy me a drink.

354
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,560
Something sour, refreshing, low sugar, and good for health.

355
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,760
Do you like this kind of romantic scene?

356
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,000

357
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
You are the one who is doing this.

358
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,280
You were staring at me all the time when we were in the class.

359
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,120
Do you know what other people think we are?

360
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,040

361
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,240
Buy whatever you want.

362
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,120
Calm down.

363
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,360
Faye, why did Guy hold your hand?

364
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,000
He didn't hold my hand.

365
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,920
He just handed me money to buy the yogurt drink.

366
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,000
Why did he need to give you money?

367
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,200
Are you broke?

368
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,120
No, he wanted to buy me a drink.

369
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,680
He wanted to apologize to me for accusing me in front of the class.

370
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,200
This is odd.

371
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,160
Stop it.

372
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,480
Don't imagine things.

373
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,240
He just wrongly accused me and apologized for it.

374
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,680
Wrongly accused you.

375
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,120
Held your hand.

376
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,200
Gave you money to buy a drink.

377
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,400
Is Guy hitting on you?

378
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,920
Mimi, you are three minutes delayed.

379
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,000
Guy is hitting on Faye.

380
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,840
Really?

381
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,480
He is hitting on Faye?

382
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,800
Mork, Mork, Mork.

383
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,560
Calm down.

384
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,840
Look there.

385
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,000
Where?

386
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
Are you free this evening?

387
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,720
This evening?

388
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,560
Do you have other plans?

389
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
I saw you like perfumes.

390
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,240
I want you to go to a party launching the first perfume of La Dixieme.

391
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,440
I got an invitation.

392
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,880
I'm going to give it to you.

393
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,320
It's okay.

394
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,240
It's okay.

395
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,200
Take it.

396
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,600
I don't take it because...

397
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,200
I was also invited because of my Facebook Page about perfumes.

398
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,640
This means...

399
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,520
I'll see you at the party.

400
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,520
No.

401
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,520
We are going to the party together.

402
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,120
What is the world's first modern perfume?

403
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,000
Houbigant's Fougère Royale, right?

404
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,800
Yes.

405
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,200
Why was it considered the world's first modern perfume?

406
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,652
It was the first time that the synthetic component,

407
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:33,480
Coumarin, was used in perfume.

408
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,360
It was used to create an imaginary scent of ferns.

409
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,400
Am I right?

410
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,280
Yes.

411
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,600
So I have...

412
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,520
ten points.

413
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,600
Liu, you have only eight points.

414
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,200
Saint, you cheated.

415
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Your family business is about chemical products.

416
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,920
You also had an internship with Ms. Linda.

417
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,440
No.

418
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,320
I got the internship because of my talents.

419
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,520
Saint.

420
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,120
Do you think I will meet Ms. Linda today?

421
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,240
Probably.

422
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,400
Why?

423
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,600
I'm nervous.

424
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,320
I'm already excited.

425
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,600
Should I tell you about my internship with her?

426
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,680
Ms. Linda told me to make a perfume under this theme.

427
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,600
The theme was 'Tomorrow'.

428
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,520
I...

429
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,440
I totally blew it.

430
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,880
Why?

431
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,720
Liu, I have no sense of creativity.

432
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,800
Tomorrow is not here yet.

433
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,440
How could I come up with a scent for it?

434
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
I just mixed this and that.

435
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,440
In the end,

436
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,400
it was a mess.

437
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,160
You are exaggerating.

438
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,560
How bad could it be?

439
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,800
I'm not exaggerating.

440
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,520
Ms. Linda told me to change my field of study.

441
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,120
She said if I wanted to launch my own perfume brand,

442
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,560
I should study business instead.

443
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,880
Anything about perfume making and creating,

444
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
I should go find a partner to supervise it.

445
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,680
That's why you are studying for a master's degree.

446
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,720
Right now, I'm looking for a talented perfumer to work with.

447
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,360
I think I have some knowledge about fragrances.

448
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,720
I think that is not enough.

449
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,640
I need someone talented.

450
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
If I don't see their potential...

451
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Wait and see.

452
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,880
One day, I'll stand out in your eyes.

453
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,400
Hello, Saint.

454
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,600
Hello.

455
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,280
Who are you?

456
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,720
I'm from Liu's Scent Facebook Page.

457
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,920
Please register your name.

458
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,760
The souvenir will be given at the end of the party.

459
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,680
Sure.

460
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,320
Let's go.

461
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:45,960
Saint.

462
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,480
How are you?

463
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,200
I'm good.

464
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,880
I'll talk to you later.

465
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,800
Sure.

466
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,000
Liu.

467
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,000
Let's take a photo together.

468
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,600
Alright.

469
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,000
Saint.

470
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,520
Hello.

471
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,360
Hello.

472
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,680
I heard that your latest perfume won an award again.

473
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,440
The news travelled fast.

474
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,160
Congratulations.

475
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,800
Thank you.

476
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,440
Saint, can you talk to your father for me?

477
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,000
He refused to order the alcohol that I wanted.

478
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,160
I can't get the scent that I want.

479
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,200
You know what I mean, right?

480
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,920
I get it.

481
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,160
Aunt Pen and Uncle Eak, this is Liu.

482
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,720
- Hello. - Hello.

483
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,600
Why don't you go try the new perfume of La Dixieme?

484
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,520
I'll follow you.

485
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,400
Yes.

486
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,400
(Hello, ladies and gentlemen.)

487
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,600
(Welcome to the party launching a new perfume collection.)

488
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,840
You must be busy lately.

489
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,040
Not really.

490
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,200
(Thank you for attending our party.)

491
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,120
Hello.

492
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,440
Can I try the perfume?

493
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,720
Sure.

494
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,040
This is a new perfume from La Dixieme called "Reunion".

495
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,960
Please feel free to comment whether you like it or not.

496
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,640
That's a surprise.

497
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,208
At first, I thought it would have a sweet scent of plumeria

498
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,424
blossoming in a garden.

499
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,120
But the perfume has a scent of plumeria fallen on the ground.

500
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,960
It has scents of rain and wood.

501
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,360
It reflects strength.

502
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,640
I can feel a sense of awesomeness and courage.

503
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,400
You sound like an expert.

504
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,320
I guess you must be very interested in perfumes.

505
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,840
Yes.

506
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,160
The person who inspired me to like perfumes was Ms. Linda.

507
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,800
I read her interview when I was young.

508
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,800
She said scents were invisible beauty.

509
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,920
She said scents could give us a sense of beauty

510
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
that did not based on our appearance.

511
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,120
It could not be judged from its looks.

512
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,040
It was not a type of beauty that everyone could sense.

513
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,920
They could only sense it when they opened their heart to us.

514
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,000
Those words touched me.

515
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,520
I'm glad that someone remembers it.

516
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,520
Can you tell me your name?

517
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,160
I'm Liu.

518
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,880
Nice to meet you.

519
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,080
I'm...

520
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,120
Ms. Linda.

521
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,600
(Next, please invite Ms. Linda to the stage to say something)

522
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,160
(about launching a new perfume today.)

523
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,560
(Please give her a round of applause.)

524
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,200
Excuse me.

525
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,840
Didn't you say you were nervous?

526
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,080
You were talking well.

527
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,080
I didn't know that Ms. Linda was around.

528
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,080
Right.

529
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,080
How long had she been listening to you?

530
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,480
You knew that she was around

531
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,520
and told me to walk here, didn't you?

532
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,240
Do you think I would leave you alone in the party?

533
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,160
Scents.

534
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,920
They are invisible beauty.

535
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,040
That was what I said when I started to be a perfumer.

536
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,960
I almost forgot it.

537
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,560
I have to thank someone

538
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,720
who reminds me of those words.

539
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,080
I've been away from home for many years.

540
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,240
All this time,

541
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,600
I went through many hardships.

542
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,960
There were two things

543
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,160
that helped me get through it.

544
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,560
The first thing was

545
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,640
my love for perfumes.

546
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,920
The other thing was my strong determination

547
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,800
to successfully create this perfume

548
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,960
and come back to Thailand to launch it.

549
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
When I created this perfume,

550
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,840
I hoped that everyone who smelled this perfume

551
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,480
would think about places from their memories

552
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,520
and their loved ones.

553
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,320
In this perfume,

554
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,960
I encrypted many things.

555
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,760
This perfume is a fougère perfume.

556
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,680
It's a perfume for men.

557
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,680
But I made it suitable for women as well

558
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,560
by adding fragrances of oakmoss,

559
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,480
tonka bean,

560
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,840
and tropical rainforest.

561
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,160
But the main fragrance of this perfume is plumeria.

562
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,520
The flower that is commonly grown in houses.

563
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,880
I hope that this perfume

564
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,160
will take you to the place where you are longing for.

565
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,000
This is "Reunion".

566
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,400
How do you feel?

567
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,480
Are you still nervous?

568
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,160
Yes.

569
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,000
There you are.

570
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
Before I went to the stage,

571
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,720
my mind was still blank and I didn't know what to say.

572
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,880
Thank you, Liu, for reminding me of those words.

573
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
It's not a big deal.

574
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,200
You don't need to thank me.

575
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,440
No, it's a big deal.

576
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,680
Do you know what?

577
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,680
When my words touch someone's heart,

578
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,880
it makes me realize that

579
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,440
the hard work and effort I put into my work means something.

580
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,160
Thank you, Liu.

581
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,640
When I see a fan get to meet her favorite artist,

582
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,000
I am also happy.

583
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,120
Wait and see, Saint.

584
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,360
One day, I will become an artist.

585
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,480
Aren't you interested in raising an artist?

586
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,960
Is this how younger generations are flirting?

587
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,760
It's not like that.

588
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,560
I just want him to hire me.

589
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,080
Liu, you may only have your eye on the job.

590
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,280
But he may have his eye on something else.

591
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,680
Am I right?

592
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,680
I'll tell you something, Liu.

593
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
When he was in France,

594
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,960
he was flirting with many models.

595
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,640
That was not true.

596
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,040
Don't accuse me of such a thing.

597
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,680
I am an honest man.

598
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,360
I only date one girl at a time.

599
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,080
Saint is not flirting with me.

600
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,160
He doesn't even want to give me the job.

601
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,080
Liu, you are only a freshman.

602
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,200
She is a junior at our faculty.

603
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
Liu, do you have any plans after the party?

604
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,920
Do you want to go have a drink with me?

605
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,600
I want to know about things that university students like nowadays.

606
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,680
I want to do some research for my future perfumes.

607
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,840
Of course. That's my honor.

608
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,600
Can I go with you?

609
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,520
What?

610
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,040
It's a girl time.

611
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,880
You don't need to come.

612
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,160
Okay.

613
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Liu, I'm warning you.

614
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
She is a heavyweight.

615
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,200
If you can't handle it, text me right away.

616
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,000
What?

617
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,480
What heavyweight?

618
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,120
I just drink like normal people do.

619
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,440
Cheers.

620
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,480
It's refreshing to have a drink after a long day at work.

621
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,240
How are things at the faculty?

622
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,480
Has the construction been completed?

623
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,560
When I was there, it was so noisy.

624
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,320
It has been completed.

625
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,160
But I think it's probably time for another round of renovation.

626
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Again?

627
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,080
They are good at spending money.

628
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,960
Do you know anyone else in the faculty who wants to be a perfumer?

629
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,760
As far as I know, I don't think there is.

630
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,280
I didn't attend the orientation ceremony.

631
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,800
So I don't know much about other classmates.

632
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,160
Why?

633
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,920
You don't like this kind of activity?

634
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,520
At the time, I was still recovering from my surgery.

635
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,760
I underwent major plastic surgery.

636
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,560
I'm sorry for bringing this up.

637
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,760
I just want you to know that

638
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,800
I was not born pretty.

639
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,520
Your words "invisible beauty" really touched me.

640
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,760
You don't mind that I...

641
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,800
Not at all.

642
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,080
I want to tell you this.

643
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,120
Every woman has a right to choose

644
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,440
and do things that they like.

645
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,800
You know when I started the brand La Dixieme,

646
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,960
there were many obstacles.

647
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,880
I had a hard time physically and emotionally.

648
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,440
I was not the only one who was having a hard time,

649
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,760
but people around me also had a hard time

650
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,400
especially someone who I love dearly.

651
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,960
I'm not sure if he is still mad and hates me.

652
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,160
Why are you this upset?

653
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,960
I get it that you are mad that you failed to expose her.

654
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,600
But this was your mistake.

655
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,480
Do you think it's that easy to expose someone like Faye?

656
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,400
Why are you reminding me of it?

657
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,160
I want you to be more thorough next time.

658
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,240
Look.

659
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,640
Look.

660
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,760
People are now saying that you did that to get her attention.

661
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,880
They suspect that...

662
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,200
you are the type that likes to tease the girl that you like.

663
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
I will never have feelings for a girl like her.

664
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,360
I really hate this kind of girl.

665
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,920
But I like it.

666
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,320
It would be fun to see you spending time with Faye every day.

667
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,720
But I don't like it.

668
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,600
If I could choose,

669
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,480
I would never associate myself with a girl like her.

670
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,960
What kind of girl you are talking about?

671
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,840
A two-faced girl or a pretty one?

672
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,040
Those who only care about appearances and are narcissistic.

673
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,320
"Reunion" is a perfume that I made to send a message that

674
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,080
I want to see him again.

675
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,480
How about this bar?

676
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,600
Are you talking about your boyfriend?

677
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,520
No.

678
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,840
I'm talking about my son.

679
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,280
I think you may know him.

680
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,160
His name is...

681
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,160
Guy.

682
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,200
Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

683
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,280
She's my mother.

684
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,840
I never wanted to leave you.

685
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,960
But you did.

686
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,080
You never care about me or Gale.

687
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,720
But if it's not too much for you,

688
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
could you please tell me about this?

689
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:52,160
This woman looks beautiful but she's ugly inside. Don't call her mom.
