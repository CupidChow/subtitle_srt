1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,866
But will you please at least talk to Mimi and Paula?

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,160
Those idiots aren’t friends.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,080
They’re just my followers.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,160
I posted that voice clip.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,680
But the photos, the posts, or the acid,

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,080
none of that is my doing.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,800
They always say they’re “by her side.”

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
(From someone by your side)

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,360
Faye’s cat…

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,560
What does her cat look like?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,960
The cat’s gray.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,720
Mork.

Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

19
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:35,315
This episode contains a scene depicting an eating disorder that some viewers may find disturbing.

20
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:37,873
Viewer discretion is advised.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,400
I don’t think we shouldn’t jump to the conclusion yet.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Paula, can you find the name of Faye’s cat for me?

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,680
Okay, sure.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,400
Let’s go to this place.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,440
Many photos of Faye posted by FairyFaye were taken here.

26
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,160
(Hello, Beautiful.)

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
(Faye and her favorite café.)

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,763
(Cute. I met this famous girl at her favorite café again.)

29
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:52,360
We should go and ask them.

30
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,560
You should come with me.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,960
There’s a customer who likes to sit there.

32
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,200
The customer often came at the same time as Faye.

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,360
But they seemed to know each other because I saw them greeting.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,000
One time, the customer’s shirt had a light smell of vinegar.

35
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,080
Right?

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,560
Yes.

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,160
When was that?

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,920
I remember it because it was my birthday.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,920
Why does he smell like vinegar?

40
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,560
This was that date.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,960
(Show a calendar on the phone.)

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,160
(CGI turning back time to 17 September 2024)

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,680
(17 September 2024)

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,320
Faye.

45
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,040
Are you okay?

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
Faye, are you okay?

47
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,600
Faye, let me take a look.

48
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,280
Go wash it off.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Liu, what the hell did you do?

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,960
Mork?

51
00:03:03,926 --> 00:03:04,603
(Are you with Mork?)

52
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:05,477
(Yes. Why?)

53
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,543
(Mork is the harasser.)

54
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:07,406
(Check his bag and see if there’s acid.)

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,640
What the hell are you doing?

56
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
I should be the one who asks you that.

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,800
Why are you planning to attack Faye with acid?

58
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,040
Just because Faye doesn’t return your love and chose another guy.

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,760
Do you really have to go this far, Mork?

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,640
What?

61
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
What the hell are you talking about?

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,840
Did you post Faye’s photos?

63
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,160
You’ve always taken photos of Faye.

64
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,320
When those photos were taken, you were also present at those places.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,360
You always took her photos any time you got the chance.

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,360
Maybe…

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,320
her upskirting photos were also taken by you?

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,040
You are solving this?

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,040
Why don’t you put this here?

70
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,320
What?

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,360
Just because I like taking photos,

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,360
it doesn’t mean I am a pervert.

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,400
How will you explain your lab coat with a vinegar smell?

74
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
A vinegar smell?

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,160
The staff told Guy that the man who secretly took photos of Faye that day was

76
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,920
carrying a lab coat with a vinegar smell.

77
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,880
See you.

78
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,200
Thank you.

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,400
You were the only one whose lab coat was spilled with vinegar that day.

80
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,200
Hey.

81
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,000
The lab coat wasn’t mine.

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,000
After I used it, I returned it to the owner.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,560
I’m sorry.

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,560
I accidentally spilled vinegar on it.

85
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,160
One more thing,

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,160
I’m not carrying any acid with me.

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,160
Whose coat was it?

88
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,720
Paula, did you find her cat’s name?

89
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,160
Yes.

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,840
Hello, hello.

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,040
Isn’t he cute?

92
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,400
Excuse me.

93
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,160
Yes.

94
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,280
Is there any bread store around here?

95
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,920
Yes, there’s a store at the corner of the road.

96
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,760
The pumpkin bread is really good.

97
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,920
Do you see my cat?

98
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
It was here earlier.

99
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,520
I’ll check the CCTV camera.

100
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,520
Kitty.

101
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,600
Kitty.

102
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,920
Kitty.

103
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,280
Kitty.

104
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,440
Kitty.

105
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,200
Kitty.

106
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,200
Kitty.

107
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,640
Come to me.

108
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,000
Kitty, where are you? Come here.

109
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,000
He gained a bit of weight.

110
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,760
Kitty.

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,720
Look at the camera and say hi to everyone.

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Kitty.

113
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Kitty.

114
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,120
Kitty.

115
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,480
Kitty.

116
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,840
Kitty.

117
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,600
Kitty.

118
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,160
Look at the camera and say hi to everyone, Jerry.

119
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,160
Jerry.

120
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,960
Hello.

121
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,040
Hello, Ann.

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,840
Liu said you are with Jerry.

123
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,280
He is not with me.

124
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,760
He told me that Faye might be in this room.

125
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,040
When I walked into the room,

126
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,960
he locked me in.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,080
Why did he do this?

128
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
Send me your location.

129
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,640
I’ll go help you.

130
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,400
Aren’t you going to tell me what is going on?

131
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,800
The person who posted the tweet threatening Faye is Jerry.

132
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,800
Huh?

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,160
Jerry.

134
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
What are you doing here?

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,360
We are looking everywhere for you.

136
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,520
Everyone is very worried about you.

137
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,560
Really?

138
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,360
How are you feeling?

139
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,760
Are you okay?

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,800
I’m okay.

141
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,080
I’m a bit stressed.

142
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,760
You are stressed?

143
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,640
It serves you right.

144
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,040
What do you mean?

145
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
I should have known it sooner

146
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
that you would go to a place

147
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,800
where you can keep your cat with you.

148
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,760
Then I wouldn’t have met with those guys.

149
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,760
I would have come straight here to see you.

150
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,360
It’s hurtful.

151
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,800
I’ve always been by your side.

152
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,560
Can I take this seat, Jerry?

153
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,960
Thank you.

154
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,840
I’m the person who knows everything about you.

155
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,560
The one who’s always been there for you.

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,320
(I’ll always be by your side.)

157
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,600
It’s so cute.

158
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,960
The red boxes.

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,720
You must be confused about how we reach this point.

160
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,120
I don’t get it either.

161
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,040
I’ve always helped you.

162
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,640
You wanted to know Liu’s old school. I found it for you.

163
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,560
When you were almost busted by Guy, I helped you get off the hook.

164
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,120
How do you send the photo when your phone is with me?

165
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,080
Whatever you wanted to know, I found the info and told you.

166
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,160
(How are you doing?)

167
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,880
(You are quiet lately?)

168
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,880
(I have something to think about.)

169
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,920
(Thank you for worrying about me.)

170
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
(Let me know if there’s anything I can help. I’m always by your side.)

171
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,920
(You are the only one who always stays by my side.)

172
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,920
(If you have no one, you always have me.)

173
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,141
(That’s heartwarming. Thank you.)

174
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,440
(I feel much better after talking to you.)

175
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,280
(Now I know what I need to do next.)

176
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,480
(I’m excited about Chem-Re Party.)

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,400
Everything you did at Chem-Re Party,

178
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,560
It’s okay, Faye.

179
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,720
I’ll clean it up.

180
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,640
I thought you did it for me.

181
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,440
But…

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Three.

183
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Two.

184
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,000
One.

185
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
Turn on your rings.

186
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,360
I have to apologize to everyone for pulling off a stunt like this.

187
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,320
You betrayed me.

188
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,040
Why, Faye?

189
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
Why?

190
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,280
You have never been grateful for the love and bond we shared?

191
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,200
Look.

192
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,240
We are raising this baby together.

193
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,640
It’s so cute.

194
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,480
I thought I was the only one who’d been feeding it.

195
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,080
Have you been feeding it too?

196
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,840
Yes.

197
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,120
You are the other person who helps me take care of it.

198
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
Did you name it?

199
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,960
No. I just call it kitty.

200
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,840
What about you? Did you name it?

201
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
You call it kitty.

202
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,120
Why don’t we name it “Jerry”?

203
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,560
Huh?

204
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,320
Jerry.

205
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,920
You named it after its dad.

206
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,720
You are taking care of it as if you are its mom.

207
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,640
You care for it while I care for you.

208
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,280
We are family, aren’t we?

209
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,520
But you betrayed me.

210
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,440
So I can’t help to…

211
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,640
People are being too mean to Faye right now.

212
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,120
I think I should cheer her up.

213
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,120
I’ve been reporting the unusually mean comments.

214
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Don’t blame it on me.

215
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,000
Everything that is happening,

216
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,400
it’s your fault.

217
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,440
How dare you use your pretty face to seduce other men?

218
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,800
Our relationship crumbled down because of you.

219
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,960
You are the one who destroys our relationship.

220
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,720
So…

221
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,840
our baby…

222
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,720
it should no longer live.

223
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,320
Jerry, don’t!

224
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Now, you want to negotiate with me?

225
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
I’m sorry, Jerry.

226
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,080
I didn’t know

227
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,160
that you have been helping me all this time.

228
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,520
We are family.

229
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,520
You, I, and the baby.

230
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
Actually,

231
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
I should have dated you.

232
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,560
It was my fault.

233
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,560
I should have realized it sooner.

234
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,720
You need to calm down.

235
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,680
Did you order me to calm down?

236
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
No.

237
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,880
You know that I have no feelings for Guy.

238
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,080
You are the one whom I have feelings for.

239
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,680
Do you mean it, Faye?

240
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
I like you.

241
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,120
I really like you.

242
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,920
Because you’ve always stayed by my side.

243
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,280
So let’s have a fresh start.

244
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,600
Let’s take care of this baby together.

245
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,720
Will you forgive me, Jerry?

246
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,560
Psychopath!

247
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,360
That’s what I thought.

248
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
I knew you would never repent your wrongdoings.

249
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,800
Then…

250
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,640
this is the perfect punishment

251
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,840
for a girl like you.

252
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,840
I’ll go help Ann.

253
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,080
You wait here for Guy and go help Faye together.

254
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,800
Guy, where are you?

255
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
I just parked my car.

256
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,160
Where are you?

257
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,160
I’m in the alley where the hostel’s owner told me about.

258
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Tell her that we called the police.

259
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,280
Why do you think I let you walk away easily, Faye?

260
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,480
Because I know

261
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,360
there is no place for you to hide.

262
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,360
You are a threat to the society.

263
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,920
I…

264
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,760
I will punish you.

265
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,640
Come out and receive the punishment you deserve.

266
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,800
You exploit your beauty.

267
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,040
You don’t deserve to live.

268
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,160
Where are you?

269
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,360
Are you at the sign that says “Ugly”?

270
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,640
Come on, Faye.

271
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
Let’s end this.

272
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
Mork, where is Film?

273
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,480
He went separate ways to look for Faye.

274
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,000
Any updates from Liu and Mimi?

275
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,760
Liu, do you see any signs of Faye?

276
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
No, not at all.

277
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
I got to go.

278
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,560
Wait.

279
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,720
What should we do?

280
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,160
Let’s go to the hostel first.

281
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,520
Mork, do you know where it is?

282
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,960
Yes. Follow me.

283
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,400
Damn it, Jerry.

284
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,400
Crap.

285
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,760
Wait.

286
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,080
This way.

287
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,720
Jerry, stop.

288
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,360
Catch me if you can.

289
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,520
Damn it.

290
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,920
I’ve been hanging out with this lunatic all this time.

291
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,960
What did you do to Faye?

292
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,880
I punished her.

293
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,120
I punished her for all of you.

294
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,000
It’s over.

295
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,520
It’s over.

296
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,840
Guy, call an ambulance.

297
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,480
You must be ecstatic to see me end up like this.

298
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,320
You must be happy that your plastic face is prettier than me now.

299
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,000
Now I am the ghost face instead of you.

300
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,240
If I have to live with this face,

301
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,680
I’d rather die.

302
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,640
Faye, stop!

303
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,640
Your face is fine.

304
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,600
Look. Look at this.

305
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,640
You are fine.

306
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,360
The acid that he used is very diluted.

307
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,640
You should go to see a doctor anyway.

308
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,960
Come with me.

309
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,200
Stop pretending to be nice to me.

310
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,000
You came here to see how ugly I would become.

311
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,080
Do you think I will fall for your pretense?

312
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,880
You were born with no beauty and dared to break the laws of nature.

313
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
What the hell is wrong with you?

314
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,720
Why do you keep talking about it?

315
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,040
Can I ask you one thing?

316
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,280
Why do we have to fight and hate each other because of this stupid thing?

317
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,680
Do we really have to compete on this?

318
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,160
You might be mad at me for saying this.

319
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
But where is the difference between us?

320
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,800
We both have been tormented by the world that defines our values based on our

321
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,920
beauty.

322
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,320
You are killing yourself to be pretty.

323
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,440
I was shattered to be called ugly.

324
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,720
Because this is how this world works,

325
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,760
you assumed that we have to kill each other over it.

326
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,360
Do we really have to do it?

327
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,920
We should be the ones who understand each other the most.

328
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,160
I want to hate you, Faye.

329
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,360
But since I know how this world works,

330
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,360
I can’t bring myself to hate you.

331
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,920
This world is ugly

332
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,360
for labeling us based on our appearances.

333
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,120
But we…

334
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,360
We should not be ugly like it.

335
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,520
You are up.

336
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,720
Do you want to drink soy milk?

337
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,720
The doctor said your skin is fine.

338
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,200
The acid he used is very diluted.

339
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,360
Jerry brought the bottle that Mork put the wrong label on when he was preparing

340
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,800
substances.

341
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,400
Faye.

342
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,640
I don’t have a solvent.

343
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,040
But when I am close to you,

344
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,680
I am melting.

345
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,080
Mork, you are funny.

346
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,120
How can you come up with the joke?

347
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,640
Hey!

348
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,640
Damn it.

349
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,120
I was so worried about Faye that I forgot which bottles were which.

350
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,600
Can you come here to help me?

351
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,640
What?

352
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,120
What is in these bottles?

353
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,360
How would I know what is in the bottles?

354
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,640
Okay.

355
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,360
Can you put them back for me?

356
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,560
Where are you going?

357
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,800
I have to go see Faye.

358
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,760
The beaker was broken but her heart was not.

359
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,680
Fine.

360
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,640
Thank you.

361
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,680
See you.

362
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,120
That’s why you were not injured.

363
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,960
I think you should go talk to the doctor

364
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,960
about your eating.

365
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
About Jerry,

366
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,680
we are trying to help him.

367
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,360
He was sent to the police.

368
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,920
You don’t need to be so nice to me.

369
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,480
That’s true.

370
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
But I want to.

371
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,520
I don’t want anyone to feel…

372
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
that they are alone in this world

373
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,480
like I did.

374
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,600
I always believe

375
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,720
that we can be friends.

376
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,400
What about you?

377
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,480
Do you want to be my friend?

378
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,480
You booked this page a long time ago.

379
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,200
Can you write a message for me?

380
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,600
(This page is Faye’s.)

381
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,760
(In the place where perfume is created, appearance doesn’t matter.)

382
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,480
(This place became a playground for us)

383
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,960
(including Faye.)

384
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,160
What are you doing?

385
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
Faye, smell it.

386
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,508
(We all have been hurt by the beauty standard.)

387
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,040
(This world tries to define our values based on our appearances.)

388
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,960
(Beauty should only be one of many happiness in women’s lives.)

389
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,880
(Our values should be defined by who we are.)

390
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,160
I’m sorry.

391
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,640
I did wrong to you.

392
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,640
I’m very sorry, Mac.

393
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,920
(There’s no way that everyone will love us for who we are.)

394
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,880
Faye.

395
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,000
If Mac doesn’t forgive you, don’t be overstressed about it.

396
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,480
I deserve it.

397
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,720
(If we stay true to who we are, it will bring people who truly accept us into our lives.)

398
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,160
(This kind of life is what I call a life of freedom.)

399
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,200
(I’m not only talking about freedom from prejudice based on our appearance)

400
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,240
(but also from the roles other people expect us to play.)

401
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
(even though can be more than that.)

402
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,280
Have a seat.

403
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,920
I thought you would refuse to meet me.

404
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,320
I have no reason to avoid you.

405
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,240
That’s true.

406
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,840
I was the one who had avoided you.

407
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,520
I have many things I want to talk to you.

408
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,360
But first of all,

409
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,760
I want to apologize for everything in the past.

410
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,240
It was my fault.

411
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,080
I’m very sorry.

412
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
Yes.

413
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,440
I came here because I want to talk about business with you.

414
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,000
You said you want to create a signature air perfume for your hotel.

415
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,280
Yes.

416
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,000
Did you talk to Guy about it?

417
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,840
Yes.

418
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,560
He’s now more mature.

419
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Based on the ingredients,

420
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,280
this is a modern chypre perfume, right?

421
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,720
You told me to create a prototype product for your brand launching.

422
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,280
It has to be a modern chypre perfume to create a buzz.

423
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,000
I’ll send two bottles of it to you.

424
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,320
One bottle is for you to try it.

425
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,640
Or you can give it to your special someone.

426
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,520
How did you know it?

427
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,560
I don’t think you can be single for long.

428
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,400
I’ll give the other one to Nam.

429
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,160
(When you have no strings attached.)

430
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,160
(When you are free.)

431
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,360
(We can do what we love.)

432
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,480
(We can love who we want to love.)

433
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,960
I’m leaving. Bye.

434
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,080
Bye.

435
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,600
Hello, Note.

436
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,600
She has a boyfriend to pick her up.

437
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,880
What about shabu?

438
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,960
She has a boyfriend.

439
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,600
They are walking hand in hand.

440
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,600
Whose car is that?

441
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,560
Whose ride is it?

442
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,680
Yours?

443
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,400
No.

444
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,280
Isn’t that Nene?

445
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,120
Huh?

446
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,600
That’s my ride.

447
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,080
See you.

448
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,640
Huh?

449
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,080
Film.

450
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,320
Is it real?

451
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,240
Bye.

452
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,960
Nene, you look so cute in person.

453
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,600
See you.

454
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,560
See you.

455
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,720
Bye.

456
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,920
Bye.

457
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,160
Since everyone seems to have their partners,

458
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,640
Faye…

459
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,680
I’ll give you a ride home.

460
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,560
Let’s go.

461
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,080
Bye, Liu. See you.

462
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,200
See you.

463
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,160
Bye.

464
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,600
You need to come with me.

465
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,280
Because she has this guy come to pick her up.

466
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,080
Let’s go.

467
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,320
Don’t be sad.

468
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,640
Hey.

469
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,040
Do you need to be so dressed up?

470
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,680
You said you would take me out on a date.

471
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,320
I didn’t think that you would take me here.

472
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,120
To recreate it.

473
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,040
We didn’t have a proper date last time.

474
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,880
(Thank you for always being by my side.)

475
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,640
(I should be the one who thank you for helping me grow up.)

476
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,560
(Many things you did, I don’t think I could do it if I were you.)

477
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,960
(Like what?)

478
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,000
(Forgiving Faye.)

479
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,160
(You can bicker with her like before.)

480
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,920
(But now I think I will feel a bit jealous.)

481
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,280
(Why would you be jealous of her?)

482
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,280
(I know who is the perfect person for me.)

483
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,880
(Is it me?)

484
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,960
(Who else would it be if it’s not you, Silly?)

485
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,880
(Hey.)

486
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,920
(Because of you)

487
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,200
(I realize that this may be the most beautiful thing.)

488
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,760
(What are you talking about?)

489
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,280
(Forgiveness.)

490
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:11,440
(You give her a chance to live, to learn, and to grow up.)

491
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,480
(I just don’t want to be a heartless person.)

492
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,880
(I’m proud to have you as my girlfriend.)

493
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,040
(I’m proud to have you as my boyfriend.)

494
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,240
(You also help me grow up.)

495
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,680
(You make me feel that as long as I have you, I don’t need to feel afraid.)

496
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,040
(Let’s keep growing up together, shall we?)

497
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,840
(Of course.)

498
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,520
(Will you ever leave me?)

499
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,280
(Why will I do that?)

500
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,880
(Because I’m quite boring.)

501
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,880
(I’m more boring than you.)

502
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,840
(Does it mean we will be together for a long time?)

503
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,160
(Because we both are boring.)

504
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,160
(I hope so too.)

505
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,160
We finally get to watch a movie together.

506
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,160
I think…

507
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,920
you should keep the ticket.

508
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,920
Why?

509
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,520
Don’t you want to keep it?

510
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,840
You should keep it.

511
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,240
Dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin.

512
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,280
Why didn’t you say it?

513
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,160
I already wrote it down. Why do I need to say it?

514
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,280
I want to hear it.

515
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,280
Can you say it for me?

516
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,240
Dopamine.

517
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,880
Serotonin.

518
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,400
Oxytocin.

519
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,440
Love hormones.

520
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,160
You should tell me you love me.

521
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,880
Dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin.

522
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
Then I…

523
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,680
Dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin.

524
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,240
 Anyone out there who understands and sees me? 

525
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,240
 Caring and ready to take care as if I’m VIP? 

526
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,360
 Someone who loves me for me 

527
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,880
 In ways nobody has ever seen 

528
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,960
 Making tomorrow different from what has been 

529
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,160
 You’re the only one in my line of sight 

530
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,800
 Wanna see you clearly in the best light 

531
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,080
 You make my whole world shine so bright 

532
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,240
 No longer alone like before 

533
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,560
 I fix my gaze on you forevermore

534
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,880
 On my focus
