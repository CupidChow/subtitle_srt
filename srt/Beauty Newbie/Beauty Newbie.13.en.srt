1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,679
Turn on your rings.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,240
It’s not working.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,920
I have to apologize to everyone for pulling off a stunt like this.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,439
What the hell are you planning to do?

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,680
Your ship has sailed, guys!

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,159
You did that because you are mad at me about Guy, right?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,679
You still don’t get it, do you?

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,559
This is between you and me, Liu.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,239
You’ve never seen me as your friend?

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,079
Why do I want to befriend you who makes all my effort become meaningless?

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
This world is on my side, not yours.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,600
I should have believed you

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,560
when you told me who Faye was.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,280
But even after what she said to you,

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,080
you still don’t want to believe it, do you?

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,600
I just can’t believe that

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,120
everything up until now between Faye and I has been…

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
a complete lie.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,520
I want to study chemistry so I can become a researcher.

20
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,520
Please help me out.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
I’ll go out with Mac.

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,000
For you.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,200
I’ll make you a hero.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,280
Thank you, Faye.

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,280
It’s good.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,320
Try it.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,320
Do you want to try it?

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,920
I can help you with it.

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,520
Liu, let’s go have lunch.

30
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,320
It smells great.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,200
Liu, try it.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,040
It smells great, right?

33
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,160
Faye is…

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,640
my first friend.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,080
(Thank you for being my first friend.)

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,240
She’s the first friend in my entire life.

37
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,360
Can you not think of her as your first friend?

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,400
How can I not think that when she—

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,200
Can’t I be your first friend?

40
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,240
I never told you this, but in junior high, when you were being bullied…

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
I was there for you.

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,600
So… if you think of me as your first friend,

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,320
will it make you less sad about this?

44
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,720
I never knew you did that.

45
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,680
You don’t know about a lot of things.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,720
I’ve been a long-time follower of your perfume blog, you know?

47
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,160
I see.

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,840
Am I qualified to be your first friend now?

49
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,200
Alright.

50
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,240
But I’m not just your first friend, though.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,840
I’ve been upgraded to your first boyfriend.

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Don’t cry.

53
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,800
Please, you guys.

54
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,560
We are in public.

55
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,600
What’s so bad about it?

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,080
We’re dating, you know?

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,199
And you’re doing such a good job at it

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
that people believe you’re dating someone else.

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,880
And instead of fixing that, you guys are out here being lovey-dovey.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,360
If it were me, I’d be trying to take that Faye girl down right now.

61
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,280
You have to at least let the world know she’s the fake one,

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,680
not you.

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,720
You have some ideas about how to deal with her, then?

64
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,400
Oh, you kid.

65
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,120
Who do you take me for?

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,120
Of course I’ve got some ideas.

67
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,080
Well, then, will you help us out?

68
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,200
I happen to be a moron, you see…

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
I have no idea what to do.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,799
But if you have something in mind about this,

71
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
will you help us out?

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
For Liu.

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,200
You moron.

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,160
(BASED ON LINE WEBTOON “MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY” BY KI MAENGGI)

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,528
(THIS PROGRAM CONTAINS A DEPICTION OF EATING DISORDER WHICH MIGHT TRIGGER SOME PEOPLE.)

76
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:04,480
(PLEASE BE ADVISED.)

77
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,360
Good thing you have something in mind, Saint.

78
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,280
Guy and I were up racking our brains all night.

79
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
But no matter how much we tried to put dirt on her…

80
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,599
(Faye pretended to pass out at the fair.)

81
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,440
(Are you jealous of her?)

82
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,120
(Who would joke about that kind of thing?)

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,560
(Nonsense.)

84
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,160
(Don’t be delusional,babe.) 
(Jerk.)

85
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,239
Look.

86
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Her fans defend her like some groupies.

87
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,639
You guys are dealing with someone with a good image.

88
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,480
I’m not one bit surprised you got some backlash for that.

89
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,800
She’s a professional at this.

90
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,240
You only met her a few times and you can tell that much?

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,560
Well, it was confirmed at the fair, really.

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,720
I think there’s no point fighting her on the internet.

93
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,360
The online world feels like it’s so big and vast,

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
(Faye is so pretty and kind. She steps down so Liu can be their rep.)

95
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,679
(Liu should be ashamed for making Faye pass out at the fair.)

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,719
(I love Faye. She’s my idol.)

97
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,440
(Faye is too nice. She helps report that photo of her friend.)

98
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,080
(Faye is the epitome of beauty.)

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,528
(Faye’s pretty inside and out.)

100
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:53,920
When in fact,

101
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,800
the reality we live in is much bigger.

102
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,240
Are you suggesting…

103
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,800
Yes.

104
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,879
We have to take her down in real life first before we take her down online.

105
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
There’s more weight to it that way.

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,439
Faye’s really smart, you know?

107
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,480
She hardly has any weaknesses.

108
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,280
I walked into her in a run-down neighborhood once…

109
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,120
I really was there to tutor someone.

110
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,640
They’re blue-collar workers who never got to finish school.

111
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,360
She turned the table on me so easily.

112
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
There’s actually this one thing…

113
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,280
I don't know if I should tell you guys, though.

114
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
It seems like a private matter.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,160
What is it?

116
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,160
Well…

117
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I’m not sure if she’s going through something,

118
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,480
but maybe we can talk to her about it.

119
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Will you guys let me do this by myself?

120
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,120
I want this to be between just me and her.

121
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,520
But I do need your help.

122
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,240
Is it true you went home with Guy yesterday, Faye?

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,400
He just walked me home.

124
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,640
Oh, that was why you weren’t doing your usual live streaming.

125
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,240
Mimi, are you quiet because you don’t follow again?

126
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,680
Oh… well, yeah.

127
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,640
Hey, Liu.

128
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,040
Have you guys had anything to eat?

129
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,440
Can I get you something, Faye?

130
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,959
That’s awfully nice of you, Liu.

131
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,160
But I’m not really hungry.

132
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,319
Guy.

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,800
Come sit here.

134
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,400
Mimi, I think you should move.

135
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,440
Oh, sure.

136
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,440
I have to go see our professor anyway.

137
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,280
Please.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
You’re here at the cafeteria, but you’re not eating?

139
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
I’m only keeping Paula and Mimi company.

140
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,840
I’m craving something, though.

141
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,640
Will you share it with me?

142
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,520
Oh, dear.

143
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
What are you craving?

144
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,000
Cake.

145
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,120
A cake for a couple.

146
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,000
I love you so much so share this with me.

147
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,879
It’s alright, Guy.

148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,680
I’m really full.

149
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,319
Thank you, though.

150
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,399
I’ll feed you.

151
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,679
No.

152
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,160
It’s embarrassing.

153
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,240
If Guy keeps doing this, I guess the Guy-Faye hashtag is trending again.

154
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,360
Take a bite…

155
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,480
Babe.

156
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,480
He said “babe”!

157
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,360
Hey, your girlfriend’s mouth is a mess.

158
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,280
Let me clean up.

159
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,719
Oh, your first day together.

160
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,040
What an adorable couple.

161
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,240
Enough already.

162
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,840
You made even more of a mess, you know that?

163
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,680
I’m going to clean up in the restroom.

164
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
You dummy, what’d you do that for?

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,520
Oh, I am the lucky witness to such a beautiful love.

166
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,440
Guy said he saw you do that before.

167
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,120
Is this the effort you mentioned?

168
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,480
So what if it is?

169
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,240
Are you going to tell people about this?

170
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,120
I told you it’s useless.

171
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,840
You know how I’d explain this?

172
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,959
I’m allergic to strawberries, but Guy doesn’t know that.

173
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,040
I ate it because I didn’t want to disappoint him, so I had to throw up.

174
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,120
Why would you go that far?

175
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,240
This is hardly normal.

176
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,000
You and your fake face have no right to tell people what is or isn’t normal.

177
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,280
I’m just worried about you.

178
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,040
Worried?

179
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,440
Don’t be absurd.

180
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,080
I think you’re just oh-so-giddy you found some dirt on me.

181
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,440
What’re you gonna do with it?

182
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,359
Give it a try, by all means.

183
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,320
I’ll just make something up and win in the end.

184
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Aren’t you exhausted?

185
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,760
Doing all this just to win?

186
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,319
Not at all, Liu.

187
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,479
I’m actually having the time of my life.

188
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,680
Especially getting to date Guy when we hate each other’s guts.

189
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,040
It’s so damn fun.

190
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,799
Aren’t you afraid that

191
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,600
if one day the truth comes out,

192
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,600
you’ll have no one left?

193
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,759
You don’t have to be my friend.

194
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
You don’t have to listen to me.

195
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,760
But will you please at least talk to Mimi and Paula?

196
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,760
Those idiots aren’t friends.

197
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,400
Do you honestly think people are friends because they like each other?

198
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,320
Paula and Mimi only stick to me because I’m pretty and popular.

199
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,800
If I wasn’t, they wouldn’t even stick around.

200
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,760
Those two aren’t friends.

201
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,920
They’re just my followers.

202
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,520
Honestly, Liu,

203
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,440
everyone around me, whether Paula, Mimi, Mork, Film, or Jerry,

204
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,440
they’re all just my fans.

205
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,200
I’m only nice to them so they can be my voice and defend me.

206
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,760
I told you I’ve got this world in the palm of my hand.

207
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,720
Even if you know my secret now,

208
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,880
it won’t mean a single thing.

209
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,880
Paula and Mimi only stick to me because I’m pretty and popular.

210
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,880
If I wasn’t, they wouldn’t even stick around.

211
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,680
Those two aren’t friends.

212
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,000
They’re just my followers.

213
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,400
You were right.

214
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,919
Nobody would believe me if I came out with this.

215
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,280
The world really is in the palm of your hand.

216
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,680
But if it comes from your own lips,

217
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,280
that’s another story, isn’t it?

218
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,560
Liu.

219
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,360
- Faye. - Give it to me.

220
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,000
Faye.

221
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,280
Faye.

222
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,440
I don’t want to hurt you, Faye.

223
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,040
But talking doesn’t seem to do much good right now.

224
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,400
I only want to ask a few things of you,

225
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
and I’ll delete this voice clip immediately.

226
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,240
Will you please hear me out and do it?

227
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,360
I’ll leave you alone after that.

228
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
And you do the same to me.

229
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,960
Guy will wait for you at the cafe after class.

230
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,240
You just have to walk up to him,

231
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,080
and break up with him in front of everyone.

232
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,400
And see a doctor.

233
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,960
Please.

234
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,760
Let’s just end this on a good note.

235
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,760
Liu cares about you.

236
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
Do you realize that?

237
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,960
Does she?

238
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,880
Do you want to say this or do you want me to?

239
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,440
Go ahead.

240
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,440
Fine.

241
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,440
Faye.

242
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,960
If you understand, then this is it.

243
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,160
I can’t go out with you anymore.

244
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,520
What? What happened? Why?

245
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,200
Yeah, why?

246
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,240
It’s my fault.

247
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,520
I don’t deserve you.

248
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,920
It just won’t work between us.

249
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,400
I’m sorry.

250
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,240
If you understand, then this is it.

251
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
Wait.

252
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
I have something to say to you.

253
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,200
What now?

254
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,119
Of all the people to lose to,

255
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,720
you lost to a plastic face?

256
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,160
- If you have money, you can have everything. - Throw up. Throw it all up!

257
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,160
But for someone who has nothing like me,

258
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,680
no matter how hard I try, I will always lose to someone like you.

259
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,799
Aren’t you afraid if one day the truth comes out?

260
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
Let’s end this on a good note, Faye.

261
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,039
No.

262
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,600
I’m not breaking up with you.

263
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,160
Please, Guy.

264
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,600
You said she still cares about me, right?

265
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,600
I know I won’t lose this time around.

266
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,280
I bet she doesn’t even have that clip anymore.

267
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,760
(I’m sure Faye will keep her word.)

268
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,480
(I’m deleting that clip.)

269
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,040
(I’m not very comfortable keeping it.)

270
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,280
Am I right?

271
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,920
You…

272
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,400
Please give me another chance, Guy.

273
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,120
Don’t break up with me.

274
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,240
I’m sorry.

275
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,880
Please.

276
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,880
I’m so sorry.

277
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,360
Don’t leave me.

278
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,639
Please, Guy. Give me another chance.

279
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,360
I’m sorry.

280
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,320
Crap, Guy.

281
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,680
Can you stop being a jerk for a minute?

282
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,160
You told her you loved her yesterday and now you changed your mind?

283
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,760
Mork, don’t.

284
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,400
It was my fault.

285
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,879
I must have done something to upset him if he wants to break things off.

286
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,200
But I’m okay.

287
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,640
What the hell is wrong with you?

288
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,040
Don’t you care about her feelings?

289
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,960
Hey, this is—

290
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,239
Hey, what is this?

291
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,120
What happened?

292
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,120
I don’t know.

293
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,040
Especially getting to date Guy when we hate each other’s guts.

294
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,360
You don’t have to be my friend.

295
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,960
But will you please at least talk to Mimi and Paula?

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,960
Those idiots aren’t friends.

297
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
They’re just my followers.

298
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,320
Faye, this isn’t true, is it?

299
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,400
Paula, Mimi, Mork, Film, or Jerry,

300
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,199
they’re all just my fans.

301
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,160
I’m only nice to them so they can be my voice and defend me.

302
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,040
Someone must have faked my voice with an AI tool.

303
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,160
It’s Liu.

304
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,640
Liu is in love with Guy so she wants to get back at me.

305
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,640
She’s lied to you all before, hasn’t she?

306
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,520
She lied about Mac, even to me.

307
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,800
Why are you doing this to me, Liu?

308
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,520
How could you?

309
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,760
Mac?

310
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,640
Who exactly was lying about Mac?

311
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,320
Wasn’t it you who went to Mac and told him you liked him?

312
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,320
I like you.

313
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,480
What did you say to Mac?

314
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,599
I wished them a long-lasting relationship.

315
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,800
You told everyone you were just wishing him good luck with Liu.

316
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,080
You also said you went on a date with me,

317
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,920
when I actually went with Liu.

318
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,720
You stole that keyring from her, didn’t you?

319
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,800
This is the keyring that he gave me when he asked me out.

320
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,600
What is going on?

321
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,119
I really don’t follow this time.

322
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
You too, right, Mimi?

323
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,120
No.

324
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
I follow perfectly fine this time.

325
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,320
But Guy isn’t lying.

326
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,920
Because we actually ran into Guy and Liu that day,

327
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,760
not Guy and Faye.

328
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,320
I only saw Guy that day.

329
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,480
But I do remember him with that keyring.

330
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,480
Faye…

331
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,560
Did you really steal Liu’s life?

332
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,760
What are you saying?

333
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,599
You know I wouldn’t do something like that.

334
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,999
This is me, Faye.

335
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,079
The same Faye everyone loves.

336
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,400
I wouldn’t do something like this.

337
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,080
I didn’t do any of this.

338
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,960
	I wouldn’t!

339
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:41,560
Is this the same Faye who thinks of her friends as followers?

340
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,080
Mimi, I told you that is what Liu made with my voice.

341
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,639
Are you trying to blame this on Liu,

342
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,040
just like at the fair?

343
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,360
Oh, right.

344
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,880
Before you passed out…

345
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Here, Faye.

346
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Drink something.

347
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,400
Mork offered you water,

348
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,680
but you didn’t drink anything.

349
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,960
It was like you wanted a reason to pass out.

350
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,319
Come to think of it,

351
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,239
that day in the lab when you guys broke that beaker,

352
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,960
I saw Liu hand you the beaker quite properly.

353
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,320
But you dropped it on pur—

354
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,120
Shut up!

355
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,800
Shut up, all of you!

356
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,559
What the hell are you recording that for?

357
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,800
Stop it!

358
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,200
I said stop! Put your phones down!

359
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,879
Liu, you bitch.

360
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
And you said you cared about me.

361
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,920
I didn’t post it.

362
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,280
If it wasn’t you, then who the hell would do this!

363
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,480
Who else could do this!

364
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,440
Enough, Faye.

365
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,440
You’ve made yourself look bad enough.

366
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,935
(#FakeAngel)

367
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,317
(We’ve all been scammed.)

368
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:12,868
(She’s not who she says she is. I heard even her house is just a set.)

369
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:15,635
(Thanks to whoever posted that or else we’d all be fools.)

370
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:20,519
(It hasn’t been confirmed yet, right? I bet it’s just a mean prank.)

371
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:23,880
(Mean prank, you said? There’s more coming if you guys don’t believe it.)

372
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,760
(That bitch told me to send this to Mac.)

373
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:30,815
(Faye’s a freaking mastermind. What an idol.)

374
00:23:30,955 --> 00:23:32,880
(Real bad bitch. Put TV villains to shame.)

375
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,763
(She really refused to drink anything.)

376
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:36,920
(I’ve got proof.)

377
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,120
Fake drinking now too? Damn.

378
00:23:42,526 --> 00:23:43,208
(It wasn’t Faye there. It was Liu.)

379
00:23:43,268 --> 00:23:44,202
(How’d Faye know all this, though?)

380
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,520
(Duh, I kept her updated, how else?)

381
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,279
Hey, aren’t they friends with Faye?

382
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,080
Go ask them what’s exactly going on.

383
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,840
I’m curious.

384
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,120
Why me?

385
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,120
You go.

386
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,000
You go.

387
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,880
No, you!

388
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,720
Aren’t they too loud?

389
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,440
People are being too mean to Faye right now.

390
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,360
I think I should cheer her up.

391
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,400
I’ve been reporting the unusually mean comments.

392
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,440
Oh, Faye, how could you have done this to us?

393
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,828
(So what exactly happened, Liu?)

394
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:45,742
(Liu, spill.)

395
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:46,766
(You posted that clip, didn’t you?)

396
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:01,588
(What happened,Guy?)

397
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:02,323
(Dude, tell us.)

398
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:03,319
(Do you know anything about Liu and Faye?)

399
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:04,637
(What happened?)

400
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:05,664
(You weren’t dating Faye?)

401
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,039
(I went to the same school with Faye and she’s been like this since way back.)

402
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,442
(When she started out, I pointed out her content wasn’t original and got myself blocked.)

403
00:25:32,488 --> 00:25:35,726
(Serves her right. I’ve been waiting for her downfall.)

404
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,436
(Been thinking it was weird when she passed out.)

405
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:41,720
(Looks so obvious she wanted to show some skin.)

406
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,688
(Fairyfaye: I’ve got even better ones. Stay tuned.)

407
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,960
You’ve got a package!

408
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,480
(From someone by your side)

409
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
(I hope you keep all the gifts I gave you.)

410
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,280
(I am by your side. Everywhere. At all times.)

411
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,440
(Love you.)

412
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,960
(I know everything about you.)

413
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,040
(Every nook and cranny.)

414
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,520
(A bitch like you deserves to be punished!)

415
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,022
(Go to hell.)

416
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,848
(So what’s happened?)

417
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,390
(Are you and Faye falling out?)

418
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:52,159
(Liu, what’s going on?)

419
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,550
(You jealous of Faye or something?)

420
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,000
(Tell me what happened, Liu.)

421
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,640
Is something the matter, Saint?

422
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,920
Why don’t you sit down?

423
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,160
You haven’t seen it, have you?

424
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,240
Seen what?

425
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Scroll through those hashtags from last night.

426
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,080
I’ve been reporting those photos,

427
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,600
but someone keeps posting new ones.

428
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
This…

429
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,000
It’s all Faye.

430
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,480
What’s more concerning is…

431
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,120
There are some shots of her from under her skirt.

432
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,400
What…

433
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,120
Do you have any idea who could have posted that voice clip and these photos?

434
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,160
I don’t.

435
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,399
But Saint, I think this is getting out of hand.

436
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,570
(This slut must be punished.)

437
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:02,640
(I’m washing her face in acid.)

438
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,079
I wasn’t going to get involved.

439
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,640
But I don’t think Faye deserves this, either.

440
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,040
Guy.

441
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,240
Guys.

442
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,400
How is it?

443
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,120
Film and I are trying to find out who posted these photos.

444
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,839
Besides finding out who posted them,

445
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,480
I think we should also find out where Faye is.

446
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,160
It looks like whoever is doing this wants to hurt her.

447
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,000
I’ve been calling her, but she doesn’t pick up.

448
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,160
Ann went to check up on her where she lives.

449
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,160
She said she met Faye in the neighborhood once.

450
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
I didn’t see her.

451
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,800
I asked around.

452
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,360
But when I got to her house…

453
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,960
Faye.

454
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,720
Faye?

455
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,360
Faye.

456
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,640
It looks like she ran away.

457
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,400
So we need to find out who keeps posting these photos and where Faye is.

458
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,120
Aren’t you mad at her, Liu?

459
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,960
Why are you helping her?

460
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,280
Of course I am.

461
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,480
But that doesn’t mean I want to ruin her life.

462
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,520
You guys feel the same, too.

463
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
I don’t want her to get hurt.

464
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,560
Neither do I.

465
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,839
Only I get to beat some sense into her. And I’ll beat her hard.

466
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,439
Friends talk to each other.

467
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,040
And I’m her friend, not her follower.

468
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,480
That’s very touching.

469
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,640
I’m only here because Mork asked me to, though.

470
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,240
I kind of agree.

471
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,120
No matter what Faye thinks of us, she doesn’t deserve to be punished.

472
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,320
Well said, dude.

473
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,120
It’s like you’re reading those words from my mind.

474
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,400
Should we split into two groups?

475
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,760
One looks for Faye so they can protect her.

476
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,280
The other looks for the one who posted those photos and calls the police.

477
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,240
Saint and I will be looking for the bad guy.

478
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,600
I’ll help you and Saint.

479
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,399
The rest of you should come with me, then.

480
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,040
Okay.

481
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,720
Well, where should we start?

482
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,520
First of all, let’s look for the accounts that posted everything.

483
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,400
Alright.

484
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,920
The voice clip, too?

485
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:52,028
(I really didn’t think Faye would say this.)

486
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:53,400
Talk to Mimi.

487
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,640
Those idiots aren’t friends.

488
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,479
I don’t think she’s gone far.

489
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,920
I just can’t think where she could run to.

490
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,920
Yeah, where could she go?

491
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,920
Yeah…

492
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,760
Hey, doesn’t she have a cat she really loves?

493
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,320
Did you see her cat when you went to her place?

494
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,280
No.

495
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,880
I think we’re looking for a hotel or hostel that allows cats.

496
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,600
I think it’s possible Faye took her cat with her.

497
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,717
(Find her! #FakeAngel)

498
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:29,422
(Wash her face with acid.)

499
00:32:29,462 --> 00:32:30,682
(Where the hell is Faye?)

500
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:31,608
(Saw her. She’s wearing blue.)

501
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,920
Hang on.

502
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,320
I think I found something.

503
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,920
Look at these accounts.

504
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,320
It looks like different people.

505
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
But no matter what platform they’re on,

506
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,960
the handles all have something in common.

507
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,800
(I love Faye.)

508
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,200
And it’s Fairyfaye.

509
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,920
(I’m the only one by her side, but she never cares.)

510
00:32:49,921 --> 00:32:50,842
(I’ve got loads of her photos.)

511
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:51,936
(Do you like my gifts?)

512
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,760
(Faye is fake.)

513
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,560
You’re right.

514
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,720
Most of the screenshots from Faye’s chat comes from this Fairyfaye.

515
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,200
The Fairyfaye I suspected of also uses this handle.

516
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,840
I thought it was Faye’s account at first,

517
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,360
but it’s actually someone who’s been helping her.

518
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,319
How did you send the photo when your phone is with me?

519
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,879
Doesn’t that mean I am not that person?

520
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,200
Look here.

521
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,639
They always say they’re “by her side.”

522
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,440
(I’m by your side.)

523
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,800
But if they’ve been helping her, why did they—

524
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,280
The first change comes after the Chem-Re Party.

525
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,320
I must make it clear here that your ship has sailed, guys!

526
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
After she said she had a boyfriend?

527
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,800
From what I looked up, there are three possible accommodations.

528
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,520
Let’s split into three teams.

529
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
I’ll go with you, Liu.

530
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,199
Film, you come with me.

531
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,600
Okay.

532
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,759
You’re with me, Jerry.

533
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,120
Yeah.

534
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,200
Let’s go.

535
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,560
Guy.

536
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,560
This sound…

537
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,560
Those idiots aren’t friends.

538
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Mimi?

539
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Come to think of it, Mimi has been acting weird lately.

540
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,799
All I know is that she’s been secretly dating Note,

541
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,439
whom Faye has opposed before.

542
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,400
If he’s someone like Note, don’t you even think about it.

543
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,040
Mimi did seem irritated about it, but…

544
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:42,680
She’s here to help Faye, isn’t she?

545
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,480
What if she’s not here to help?

546
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,640
What if she went to Faye’s house and didn’t find anyone,

547
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,480
so she’s using all of us to get to Faye?

548
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,480
Hello, Liu?

549
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,680
Hurry up, Liu.

550
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,920
We need to get to Faye.

551
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,160
Mimi might be our guy.

552
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,840
Check her bag to see if she’s got some acid with her.

553
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,160
Mimi.

554
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,320
What’s wrong?

555
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,280
Did you post that voice clip?

556
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,320
Guy said he heard the sound of your keychain in the clip.

557
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,360
Were you there in that restroom?

558
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
You don’t have to listen to me.

559
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,720
But will you please at least talk to Mimi and Paula?

560
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,720
Those idiots aren’t friends.

561
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,320
Do you honestly think people are friends because they like each other?

562
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Mimi, are you so mad at Faye about Note

563
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
that you want to hurt her?

564
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,840
Yes.

565
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,240
I am mad at her.

566
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,360
And I knew she made herself throw up even before this.

567
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,080
Where is Mimi?

568
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,959
She said she was going to perform on stage, didn’t she?

569
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,040
That’s right.

570
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,560
But I’m more worried about Guy.

571
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,760
Where is he?

572
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,720
So when I realized she was going to make herself throw up again…

573
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,680
What are you craving?

574
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,080
Cake.

575
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,920
A cake for a couple.

576
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,520
I was going to confront her and make her stop.

577
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:43,080
But I didn’t expect to hear her say she never thinks of me, you, or Paula as her friends.

578
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,080
I’m not mad at her about what she said about Note.

579
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,360
But even then, she still thinks so little of me.

580
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,840
Liu…

581
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,440
You already told her you wanted to end this on a good note.

582
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,839
Give me another chance, Guy.

583
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,560
Don’t leave me.

584
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,520
I’m sorry.

585
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,880
But since she didn’t play by the rules,

586
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,840
I took the matter in my own hand.

587
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,560
Yes.

588
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,120
I posted that voice clip.

589
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,200
But the photos—

590
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,880
That wasn’t me, Liu.

591
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,480
I only posted the voice clip to expose her for who she really is.

592
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,920
But the photos, the posts, or the acid,

593
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,000
none of that is my doing.

594
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,040
That’s why I’m here, Liu.

595
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,520
I want to help Faye.

596
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,560
I know I was wrong for posting that voice clip.

597
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,440
I didn’t think it would come to this.

598
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,840
What?

599
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:01,760
The person who posted the voice clip and the one who wants to hurt her are two different people?

600
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,239
(Almost got her. Wait and see.)

601
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,200
(Get her ass.)

602
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:14,440
(Go for it!)

603
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
(Let me know. I want to get her, too.)

604
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,520
Hold on.

605
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:24,433
(I’m Faye’s real boyfriend. She named her cat after me.)

606
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Now who’d fit the description…

607
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,120
What does her cat look like?

608
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,080
The cat’s gray.

609
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,920
Mork.

610
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,039
You will know why Guy will never develop any feelings for Faye.

611
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,560
It’s because Faye likes me. Your ship has sailed, guys!

612
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,600
Your ship has sailed, guys!

613
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,800
Mork.

614
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,600
Mork!

615
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,840
Mork, wait for me!

616
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,160
I can’t wait.

617
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,879
I have to find Faye before anyone.

618
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,200
I know that.

619
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,639
Let’s go to this place.

620
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,040
This looks like his favoritespot to take her photos.

621
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,679
You did it, didn’t you?

622
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,560
You posted those photos of Faye.

623
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,959
Excuse me, where is my cat?

624
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,520
Kitty.

625
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,440
Kitty!
