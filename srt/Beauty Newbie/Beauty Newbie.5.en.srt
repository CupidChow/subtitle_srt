Wait.

2
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:03,287
Aren’t you going to apologize for misunderstanding me?

3
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:07,766
Liu, do you have any plans after the party?

4
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:09,607
Do you want to go have a drink with me?

5
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:10,823
Of course.

6
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:15,207
“Reunion” is a perfume that I made to send a message that I want to see him again.

7
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:16,806
Are you talking about your boyfriend?

8
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,166
I’m talking about my son.

9
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:19,567
His name is…

10
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:22,767
Guy.

11
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:34,447
It’s really you, Guy.

12
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:40,447
Liu.

13
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,687
Come with me.

14
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:43,286
But I’m not here with you.

15
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:44,927
I’m here with her.

16
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,926
That’s why I’m telling you to come with me.

17
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:49,927
This woman is using you.

18
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:53,047
I’m not.

19
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,687
Really?

20
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:58,127
I think you are.

21
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:02,486
I guess you haven’t quite kick that old selfish habit of yours

22
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:04,567
where all you care about is your own gain and never other people’s feelings.

23
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,207
You’re overstepping.

24
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,687
You can’t just say that to her.

25
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:14,727
I’m sorry on his behalf for being so rude.

26
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:17,327
So you won’t come with me?

27
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:20,887
You have no right to tell me what to do or what not to do.

28
00:01:26,327 --> 00:01:27,263
Ann.

29
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,527

30
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:33,127
S–Sorry about this.

31
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:39,847
Hey, Guy.

32
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:43,607
I know you’re in a bad mood but you can’t say things like that to her, dude.

33
00:01:45,927 --> 00:01:48,567
You asked me why I don’t like someone like Faye.

34
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:56,367
It’s because of her.

35
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:01,687
I’m really sorry.

36
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:04,046
My friend was such a mannerless oaf,

37
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:06,087
and on your first meet, too.

38
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,247
It wasn’t our first meeting.

39
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,687
That was him.

40
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:17,847
That was the man I was telling you about.

41
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,127
That means…

42
00:02:21,847 --> 00:02:22,967
You’re his…

43
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:27,447

00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,247
I’ve been waiting for you.

51
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:44,727
Actually… I know Ms. Linda has a son.

52
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:48,127
But I really didn’t expect it to be Guy.

53
00:04:49,327 --> 00:04:51,327
What should I do, Saint?

54
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:55,327
It looks like Ms. Linda really wants to talk to him.

55
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:00,887
I guess she really does.

56
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:05,087
She isn’t usually the type to ask for help.

57
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,327
Whatever it is,

58
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:10,447
she’s someone who always tries her best to do it all on her own.

59
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:14,527
She probably really did everything she could this time.

60
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:19,327
Well… yes.

I’m sorry I have to do this to you.

63
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,367
But I really don’t know what else to do to get in touch with Guy.

64
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,407
I’ve been calling him but he never picks up.

65
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:37,407
I sent birthday and Christmas presents and never got anything back.

66
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:40,127
He never lets me in.

67
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:44,647
Sometimes I fool myself that

68
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,327
it isn’t him who blocks me out,

69
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,087

Gale just won’t throw this away when it’s all torn up.

73
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:28,807

I don’t.

173
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:56,567
I never wanted to leave you.

174
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:57,967
But you did.

175
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,447
You left us for your new man.

176
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,407
All you think about is yourself.

177
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:08,127
You never care about me or Gale.

178
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:12,447
The only thing that matters to you is your perfumes.

179
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,046
Is that what your father told you about me?

180
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:17,807
It doesn’t matter what Dad says.

181
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:20,367
You know what does matter?

182
00:12:21,527 --> 00:12:24,207
The fact that Dad stays by our side all these years,

183
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:26,407
and the fact that you never did.

184
00:12:29,487 --> 00:12:31,247
Don’t try to see me again.

185
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,647
I don’t want to hate you any more than this.

186
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,727
Let’s go, Liu.

187
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:48,423
What’s wrong with you?

188
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:49,927
Why do you keep letting her use you like that?

189
00:12:57,087 --> 00:12:58,087
Sorry.

190
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:02,167
I forgot she might be important to what you love.

191
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,887
I won’t get in your way when it comes to her from now on.

192
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:13,487
Guy.

193
00:13:17,727 --> 00:13:19,167
Thank you for worrying about me.

194
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,447
But if it’s not too much for you,

195
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:28,167
could you please tell me about this?

196
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,927
Do you remember that day when we went to the perfume store together?

197
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,447
The perfume you helped me find…

198
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,287
It belonged to her.

199
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,326
I should be happy, shouldn’t I?

200
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:19,207
I’m the happiest person.

201
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,527
I’m the happiest girl.

202
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:28,207
- Linda, what are you doing? - Let me go!

203
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,303
Guy

204
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,887
Guy, get out of here.

205
00:14:30,927 --> 00:14:32,086
Get out.

206
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,287
- Stop it. - Let go!

207
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:34,327
Stop!

208
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,527
Are you looking at the frangipani blooming?

209
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,407
No.

210
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,487
I’m looking at them getting trapped.

211
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:11,607
If all this drives you so insane,

212
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:14,687
I’ll sign that divorce paper.

213
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,767
Now that I think about it,

214
00:15:46,007 --> 00:15:49,487
the story you told me was a bit… weird.

215
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:53,607
How so?

216
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,927
Guy said Ms. Linda left them for another man, right?

217
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:01,287
But from what I heard, after her divorce,

218
00:16:01,767 --> 00:16:03,407
Ms. Linda never dated anyone again.

219
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,367
She didn’t?

220
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:08,847
After the divorce,

221
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:11,846
the only person who stays close to Linda is Wut.

222
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,687
He’s been Linda’s assistant for years.

223
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:17,047
More importantly, he likes men.

224
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:20,167
He’s married to some French guy.

225
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:30,487
All Ms. Linda does all these years is build her perfume brand and fight for custody.

226
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:36,287
She’s never even looked twice at anyone who tries to take her out.

227
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:43,487
I always hear her say she will do her best to take her children away no matter what.

228
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,287
Take her children away”?

229
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:49,847
That’s her exact words.

230
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:54,247
I don’t really know what that actually means.

231
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:15,727
[Child Custody]

232
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:20,647
[Merry Christmas, Guy and Gale.]

233
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:40,367
Hello.

234
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,246
I’m here to see Ms. Linda.

235
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:43,766
Oh, I see.

236
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,287
This way, please.

237
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:51,567
These aroma materials all smell different.

238
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:56,367
Some of them smell amazing the moment it touches our skin,

239
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:58,367
but fades quickly as time goes by.

240
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,247
Some might not catch your attention at first,

241
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:06,047
but matures into your favorite scent as it fades.

242
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:07,327
Let’s try it.

243
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:11,167
Oh, Liu?

244
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,207
Excuse me.

245
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:17,887
Hello.

246
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:20,606
I’m in the middle of class.

247
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:24,407
Do you want to try making a bottle of perfume while you’re here?

248
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,407
Come on in.

249
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:34,846
We’re making the perfume of our imagination today.

250
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,246
Try making something that you like,

251
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:41,567
or something that you’d like to give to someone.

252
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:47,047
Just go with your wildest imagination.

253
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:48,447
Let’s begin.

254
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:51,007
Start with smelling each bottle,

255
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,527
and then see how you can mix things up.

256
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,327
Let me know if you need any help.

257
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,406
What would you like, ma’am?

258
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:07,487
One matcha, please.

259
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:11,206
Can I have matcha with watermelon juice, please?

260
00:19:11,688 --> 00:19:13,607
Watermelon juice? Interesting.

261
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:15,207
You have to try it.

262
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:16,647
It smells divine.

263
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,447
Of course.

264
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:21,807
Oh, you have something to talk to me about, right?

265
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,887
I…

266
00:19:25,407 --> 00:19:27,407
I want to talk about Guy.

267
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:35,047
Did Guy send you here?

268
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,407
What did he say?

269
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:39,167
Actually...

270
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:40,767
Here’s your order.

271
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:42,007
Thank you.

272
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,247
No problem.

273
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:49,367
Thank you

274
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:00,727
Excuse me.

275
00:20:00,887 --> 00:20:02,006
I think you got my order wrong.

276
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:04,447
This one doesn’t have watermelon juice in it.

277
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,846
I’m sure the order was right.

278
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:09,287
I think you picked up the wrong cup.

279
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:12,567
They look the same, but smell quite distinctly different.

280
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,046
If the order wasn’t wrong,

281
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,447
she would have been able to tell the difference and said so.

282
00:20:34,927 --> 00:20:39,366
I think I really did pick up your cup.

283
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:40,687
Let’s order another.

284
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:42,327
Can we have another of the same order please?

285
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,367
Of course.

286
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:54,007
You must be wondering

287
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:58,207
why I didn’t say anything about the scent

288
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:02,527
when I should be the one who knows best about it.

289
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:06,687
I wouldn’t…

290
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:11,007
I…

291
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,687
I’ve lost my sense of smell.

292
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:32,687
That’s the main reason I left Guy and Gale.

293
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,447
What happened?

294
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,727
Where do I even begin?

295
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:51,167
Should I start with the part where I married someone everyone thought was

296
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:53,167
the perfect man?

297
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:54,767
Will you marry me?

298
00:21:57,527 --> 00:22:00,047
I’ll make you the luckiest girl.

299
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,287
Yes.

300
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:09,247
But as it turned out,

301
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:13,967
we valued our happiness very differently.

302
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:19,606
Thank you for the ride.

303
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:20,726
I told you I could have called a cab myself, though.

304
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:21,847
Just get inside, sis.

305
00:22:29,127 --> 00:22:30,807
I thought you quit your job.

306
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:35,847
I thought we agreed I could keep working.

307
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:37,647
You’re a mother now.

308
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:39,647
You should be staying with your babies.

309
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:41,887
I’m already working.

310
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,607
Why would you also be out there just so people can call me a bad husband?

311
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:46,447
So are you worried about me,

312
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,086
about our babies,

313
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:50,006
or about losing face?

314
00:22:50,007 --> 00:22:51,007
Watch it, Linda.

315
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:55,687
It’s both parents’ job to take care of their children.

316
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,687
I can’t just quit my job and abandon my perfumes.

317
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,287
Perfumes are my life.

318
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:06,127
If you insist on going out and about,

319
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,247
don’t be surprised when people start thinking you’re having an affair.

320
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:11,687
What?

321
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:15,526
Don’t you know how lucky you are to have someone willing to support you?

322
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,887
All you need to do is be a mother, take care of your children,

323
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:19,887
and look pretty at functions.

324
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:23,847
Isn’t that supposed to be every girl’s dream?

325
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:31,887
Honestly, aren’t you exhausted?

326
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:35,247
You take care of your babies during the day and go to the lab at night?

327
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:37,007
Of course I am.

328
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:38,007
But it’s okay.

329
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:41,247
I’ll do my best despite it all.

330
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:47,687
I want to show my children that they shouldn’t just give up on their dreams.

331
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:53,727
Hey.

332
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:55,847
What are you doing with my phone?

333
00:23:57,127 --> 00:23:58,767
Are you seeing him?

334
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:00,767
Is that why you keep deleting your chats?

335
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:02,767
I deleted those chats because...

336
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,206
Give it to me.

337
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:05,943
Hey.

338
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:06,487
Stop.

339
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,966
Leave my phone alone.

340
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:08,607
Why should I?

341
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:10,126
Because I really have nothing to hide!

342
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:11,127
Stop!

343
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:14,367
Hey?

344
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:18,327
Honey?

345
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:30,007
Honey?

346
00:24:44,767 --> 00:24:48,967
You’ve lost your sense of smell because of the concussion.

347
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,447
If this condition doesn’t let up within six months,

348
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:56,527
there’s a possibility that you might lose it for good.

349
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:15,567
I’m sorry.

350
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:19,847
I’m really sorry.

351
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:32,647
But all this wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t because of you.

352
00:25:35,887 --> 00:25:37,367
If you’d only stayed home,

353
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,047
it wouldn’t have come to this.

354
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:48,807
This might be for the best.

355
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:55,687
We won’t have to fight anymore.

356
00:25:56,527 --> 00:25:58,367
Now that you can’t make perfumes,

357
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:02,687
our marriage will be perfect.

358
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:20,767
“Perfect”?

359
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:22,847
“Perfect”?

360
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,207
I have a great husband.

361
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:27,206
I am lucky.

362
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:30,247
I am lucky! I am lucky!

363
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,607
If all this drives you so insane,

364
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:39,767
I’ll sign that divorce paper.

365
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:45,247
But our children stay with me.

366
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:50,007
Because if you want to leave for your job,

367
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:52,487
it means you can’t be a good mother.

368
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:54,887
You’re not qualified to raise our children.

369
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:57,007
Isn’t that right?

370
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:06,086
Why are women who can’t be with their children 24/7 called “bad mothers”?

371
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:07,127
I got it, sis.

372
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:16,766
I’m sorry for leaving.

373
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,087
But I promise…

374
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:23,687
One day, I’ll come back and take you away from someone like him.

375
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:27,247
When I left Guy and Gale,

376
00:27:28,207 --> 00:27:32,327
I tried many times to get custody of my children.

377
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:35,167
But it always fell through

378
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,127
because Guy didn’t want me to win.

379
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:40,567
I didn’t understand why at first,

380
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:43,166
not until I saw Guy again.

381
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,687
But you did.

382
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,087
You left us for your new man.

383
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:50,967
Guy must have thought I left him for someone else.

384
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:56,447
It’s always hurt and pained me to my very core

385
00:27:59,007 --> 00:28:01,407
to have to choose between my children and myself.

386
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:09,087
I don’t understand why we must only choose one thing.

387
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:16,567
Why can’t we follow our dreams while keeping our family together?

388
00:28:19,607 --> 00:28:20,927
I made a mistake.

389
00:28:22,007 --> 00:28:26,567
If only I could put up with it and stayed,

390
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:31,647
my relationship with Guy would have been better.

391
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:35,406
I lost.

392
00:28:35,407 --> 00:28:37,167
It was my defeat.

393
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:44,847
You haven’t lost.

394
00:28:46,447 --> 00:28:48,327
I don’t want you to.

395
00:28:54,327 --> 00:28:57,967
It wasn't your fault for wanting to take control of your own life,

396
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:02,007
and it shouldn’t reflect on you as a mother.

397
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:07,527
Hey.

398
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:11,287
You won’t lose.

399
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:13,287
You won’t lose everything

400
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,887
just because you want to remain who you truly are.

401
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:24,607
I have something to tell you.

402
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:41,767
I think we should change the font right here.

403
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:44,647
Yes, ma’am.

404
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,606
Excuse me for a minute.

405
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:52,647
Why don’t you all go take a short break?

406
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,167
Thank you.

407
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:10,287
Liu told you to come here, didn’t she?

408
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:16,846
You don’t look like you believe my story.

409
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:18,327
What does it take for you to stop?

410
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:29,647
I’m really happy to see you grow into such a great man all on your own.

411
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:36,167
You want me to stop?

412
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:42,087
I’ll ask you to promise me one thing in return.

413
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:50,927
Promise me you’ll take care of yourself.

414
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:57,207
Just grow strong, like you’ve been doing.

415
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,047
Please take care of Gale for me.

416
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,247
Let her have her freedom.

417
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:08,567
Make sure she gets to do whatever she wants.

418
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:14,087
Is that all?

419
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:17,727
It is.

420
00:31:21,927 --> 00:31:24,447
I have one last thing for you, too.

421
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,167
What does it smell like?

422
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:37,287
I don’t know.

423
00:31:37,407 --> 00:31:38,727
How could you not know?

424
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,167
You’re a perfumer.

425
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,326
It’s a scentless preserved flower.

426
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:48,327
No.

427
00:31:48,847 --> 00:31:49,927
Tell me what this smells like.

428
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:53,487
I told you I don’t know.

429
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:54,967
You have to know!

430
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:58,327
You don’t want to believe

431
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,927
that what I said is true, do you?

432
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:07,967
You just don’t want to believe

433
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:14,966
that the man who raised you did that to me.

434
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,327
Goal

435
00:32:21,727 --> 00:32:23,287
Fight me all you want.

436
00:32:24,207 --> 00:32:29,887
I have to at least admit that your father really did a good job with you.

437
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:35,007
Happy Birthday to you.

438
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:38,887
Happy Birthday to you.

439
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:41,047
Happy Birthday to you.

440
00:32:41,087 --> 00:32:47,047
But you can’t deny that he really did me wrong.

441
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:53,527
He trapped me and refused to let me be who I am.

442
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:57,127
All that for what he called a family.

443
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:00,407
But honestly, Guy,

444
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:07,127
is it fair for me to take all the blame?

445
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:13,167
Is it fair for all the time I lost,

446
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:16,847
for all the years I lost with you and Gale?

447
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:20,487
What I do,

448
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:23,567
who I am,

449
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:28,247
don’t I deserve any of that?

450
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,647
I just want us to talk.

451
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:36,807
I just want to spend some quality time with you.

452
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:42,406
I just want to have dinners with my children and meet up sometimes.

453
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:44,247
That’s all I want.

454
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:56,247
I understand if you don’t want to forgive me.

455
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,567
But won’t you give me a chance

456
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:05,567
to spend some time with Gale?

457
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:34,727
Oh?

458
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:38,127
Table for one?

459
00:34:38,647 --> 00:34:40,207
Where are Guy and Gale?

460
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:41,727
Erm…

461
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:44,327
It’s…

462
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:33,447
[I’m giving her back the time you stole from her. –Guy]

463
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:18,287
Hello.

464
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:26,007
Are you hungry?

465
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,207
Let’s have dinner.

466
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:29,887
Come.

467
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:39,727
Here.

468
00:36:42,487 --> 00:36:46,247
Oh, these are all my favorite.

469
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:48,646
They are.

470
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:50,247
You like shrimp nuggets.

471
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:54,846
Guy loves stewed eggs, but only from this restaurant.

472
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:55,847
Am I right?

473
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:59,807
How do you know that, Mom?

474
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:03,487
What mother doesn’t know what her children like?

475
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:08,767
Smile.

476
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:09,583
No!

477
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:10,686
Why not?

478
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:10,967
No.

479
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:11,327
[Ladin1970: I’m glad you got the snacks I sent you.]

480
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:12,327
Fine.

481
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:14,847
Did you guys see him?

482
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:16,207
He’s cute, isn’t he?

483
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,126
I have to go for now.

484
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:21,006
But if you’re interested in that shirt over there,

485
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:23,687
just leave it in my inbox.

486
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,767
Is that my shirt?

487
00:37:30,687 --> 00:37:31,687
Well, I…

488
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,767
I’ve been watching you two.

489
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:39,127
Before this,

490
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:42,687
I only ever saw your faces on screen.

491
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:52,287
But getting to see you in person and sharing a meal like this…

492
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:54,687
It’s a dream come true.

493
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,687
It’s okay now, Mom.

494
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:06,127
We’re here.

495
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,207
Here.

496
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:26,247
It’s hot so be careful.

497
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:27,927
Thank you.

498
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:32,607
Where’s Gale?

499
00:38:33,567 --> 00:38:35,687
She’s streaming in her room.

500
00:38:38,807 --> 00:38:44,207
What did your father say when he knew you were coming to see me?

501
00:38:46,127 --> 00:38:47,127
Well…

502
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:49,207
Probably not happy.

503
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:52,727
You’re the side of himself he doesn’t want us to see, after all.

504
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:57,407
I’ll say this one thing to you right here and now…

505
00:38:57,927 --> 00:39:02,767
I won’t tell Gale about your father’s and my history.

506
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,367
That’s something between us adults.

507
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:09,447
I think it’s wrong to pressure children to take sides or make judgments.

508
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:17,007
But I had to tell you because I had to defend myself for what your father put in your head.

509
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:19,487
But it’s all up to you, Guy.

510
00:39:19,887 --> 00:39:21,807
You decide how you feel about this.

511
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:25,247
I know.

512
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:29,967
It’s all the more reason for me to want to live by myself.

513
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,647
I’ve always thought Dad was the best guy ever.

514
00:39:35,287 --> 00:39:37,087
I wanted to be just like him.

515
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:39,767
But now that I know,

516
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:45,807
I want to be alone so I can learn more about both you and him.

517
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:53,127
As for Gale, I’ll talk to her later about what she wants to do.

518
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:57,367
Am I causing you trouble, Guy?

519
00:39:58,647 --> 00:39:59,647
No, you’re not.

520
00:40:00,847 --> 00:40:04,167
I actually think you’re helping me grow and learn.

521
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:06,887
And I have grown.

522
00:40:07,567 --> 00:40:09,727
I think it’s time I move out.

523
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:15,767
Come to think of it, I think we should thank Liu for this.

524
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:21,847
And the preserved flower, that was also Liu’s idea, wasn’t it?

525
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:26,487
She said I should prove it if I didn’t believe you.

526
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,167
But…

527
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:33,286
If you can’t smell,

528
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:35,287
how do you make perfumes all these years?

529
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:38,567
Do you know about Beethoven?

530
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:41,807
He lost his hearing during the last years of his life.

531
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:44,327
But he kept writing music.

532
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:46,327
I heard about that.

533
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:49,807
I guess I’m not that different.

534
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:52,487
When it’s something you do every day,

535
00:40:52,727 --> 00:40:54,607
and it’s something you love,

536
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:56,527
you remember.

537
00:40:56,967 --> 00:41:02,087
Actually, I find that writing music and making perfumes are quite similar.

538
00:41:02,487 --> 00:41:06,087
Both are the kind of beauty you can’t touch,

539
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:08,687
but both are still so beautiful.

540
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:17,927
Have you found a place to live yet?

541
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:19,607
Do you need my help with anything?

542
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:21,246
It’s alright.

543
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:23,367
I’ll work something out on my own.

544
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:26,367
I want to live near campus.

545
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:31,407
You don’t need my help.

546
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:35,647
You want to stay close to campus.

547
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:39,727
I have a feeling you just want to be close to someone.

548
00:41:57,967 --> 00:41:59,607
Sorry for calling so early.

549
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:01,647
Can I see you today?

550
00:42:10,407 --> 00:42:13,127
You said you wanted to talk, but now you’re quiet.

551
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:18,127
I’m thinking where to begin.

552
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:22,887
I have a lot to thank you for, and a lot to apologize.

553
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:27,807
I have something like that to say to you, too.

554
00:42:28,887 --> 00:42:29,887
Really?

555
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:33,367
You first.

556
00:42:36,847 --> 00:42:38,247
I want to thank you,

557
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:43,406
Thank you for making me talk to my mother,

558
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:46,727
and for making me understand so many things I’ve never known before.

559
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,206
Oh, I owe you an apology for that.

560
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:50,247
What do you mean?

561
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:53,607
I’m sorry I never knew you went through something like that,

562
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:55,927
and that you actually despise perfumes.

563
00:42:57,727 --> 00:43:01,126
That day in junior high when you took me to that perfume store,

564
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:04,407
you tried your best to talk to me about it,

565
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:06,887
even when you hated it.

566
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:11,687
When I thought you were looking down on me,

567
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:13,967
it was just because you felt bad that I like what you hate.

568
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:23,887
Then I’m also sorry I never knew that my actions offended you.

569
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:27,727
Did I spook you when I wrote that perfume’s name on the attendance sheet?

570
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:28,623
So badly.

571
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,847
Not as bad as when you called out my name to sit next to you, though.

572
00:43:30,927 --> 00:43:34,367
I just recognized you and thought I wanted to talk to you.

573
00:43:34,687 --> 00:43:37,247
But then you told me I was the worst,

574
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:39,487
even worse than those people who bullied you.

575
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:41,087
I’m sorry…

576
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:47,407
…and thank you for saving me when Mac was blackmailing me.

577
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:49,687
You got hurt because of me.

578
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,127
It’s alright.

579
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,207
Can I ask you one thing, though?

580
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:55,607
Yeah?

581
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:58,406
If something like that ever comes up again,

582
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:00,007
can you please not use your fists?

583
00:44:00,647 --> 00:44:02,327
I don’t want you to get hurt again.

584
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,687
I want to be able to even try that.

585
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:08,887
I never had any problem with this before.

586
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:13,607
But now I’m starting to be afraid I might turn out just like Dad one of these days.

587
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:16,487
You won’t.

588
00:44:16,527 --> 00:44:18,487
You’re so far from that.

589
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:23,247
Everything you do is for someone else, not yourself.

590
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:26,046
So I don’t have to stop using my fists?

591
00:44:26,047 --> 00:44:27,047
You do.

592
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:29,127
Then help me out.

593
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,407
Me? How could I even help you with that?

594
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:33,447
Try not getting into trouble.

595
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:35,247
Be strong.

596
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:38,087
I’ll try.

597
00:44:41,487 --> 00:44:42,527
Thanks.

598
00:44:45,887 --> 00:44:47,127
Can I ask you something?

599
00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:48,263
Hmm?

600
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:50,287
How did you recognize me?

601
00:44:54,647 --> 00:44:59,246
They say humans have five senses…

602
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:03,447
Sight, taste, smell, sound, and touch.

603
00:45:04,687 --> 00:45:08,207
They say the first thing people forget is sound.

604
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:12,247
And the last to forget is smell.

605
00:45:14,487 --> 00:45:19,287
So… no matter how differently you look,

606
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:23,567
the smell of your perfume remains in my mind.

607
00:45:28,047 --> 00:45:29,127
Funny, isn't it?

608
00:45:29,647 --> 00:45:31,727
I said I hated perfumes,

609
00:45:32,487 --> 00:45:36,927
but maybe I was just resenting my mother.

610
00:45:39,207 --> 00:45:42,687
Does that mean you’re fine with perfumes now?

611
00:45:44,127 --> 00:45:45,127
Umm.

612
00:45:45,727 --> 00:45:46,727
I guess.

613
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,527
Then I’ve got something for you.

614
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:56,807
I made this in Ms. Linda’s lab.

615
00:45:57,687 --> 00:46:01,287
I was thinking of you when I made it, but I didn’t think you’d want it.

616
00:46:05,087 --> 00:46:07,487
Does it have a name?

617
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:09,927
You name it.

618
00:46:12,327 --> 00:46:13,727
Do you have a pen?

619
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,287
I’ll go with this one.

620
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:34,727
So you know we have always seen each other,

621
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:36,167
since then and even now.

622
00:46:49,887 --> 00:46:51,007
Try it.

623
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:57,367
Do you like it?

624
00:46:58,207 --> 00:46:59,207
Yeah.

625
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:02,927
Does that mean we’re friends now?

626
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:14,847
Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

627
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:16,383
Are you looking for a place to live?

628
00:47:16,407 --> 00:47:17,607
It’s none of your business, isn’t it?

629
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:19,327
Well, I don’t want you to be homeless.

630
00:47:20,647 --> 00:47:21,886
It’s already time for the fair?

631
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:23,806
See how unpleasant this is?

632
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,087
You should know whoever asks you to join the event isn’t your friend.

633
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,606
I promised the upperclassmen I’d find someone to help out.

634
00:47:29,607 --> 00:47:32,526
But now that I know what kind of booth it is, I can’t even ask anyone.

635
00:47:32,527 --> 00:47:34,206
That girl’s fake all over.

636
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:36,167
Being touched a little wouldn’t leave a dent.

637
00:47:36,207 --> 00:47:39,126
The upperclassmen keep making Liu deal with crappy customers.

638
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:42,287
They said Liu’s entire body is fake so it’s fine.
