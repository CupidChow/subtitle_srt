1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,709
I’ve lost my sense of smell.

2
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,369
How could you not know?

3
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,820
You’re a perfumer.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,060
Is this fair for me to take all the blame?

5
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:16,480
I just want to have dinners with my children and meet up sometimes.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,019
Before this,

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,940
I only ever saw your faces on screen.

8
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,859
But getting to see you in person and sharing a meal like this…

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,900
It’s a dream come true.

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,448
We’re here.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,140
Then I’ve got something for you.

12
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:30,629
I’ll go with this one.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,672
So you know we have always seen each other.

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,699
The two main characters are guys from the faculty of engineering.

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,260
Then what?

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,940
Excuse me.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,579
If you have a room available, you can contact me anytime.

18
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,379
There is no room available at the moment.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,179
Why don’t you leave your contact info?

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,100
I’ll contact you if there’s a room available.

21
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,780
Sure.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,420
Nam.

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,380
I brought you a plant.

24
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,499
Thank you, Saint.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,579
I’ll put it here.

26
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,220
Thank you.

27
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,220
Do I know you?

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,220
No, you don’t.

29
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,220
Okay.

30
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,620
Don’t tell him I came here to look for a room.

31
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,100
I think he already knew it.

32
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,260
Why do you need to keep it a secret?

33
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,500
Do you want to surprise Liu?

34
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,499
Stop acting like you don’t know.

35
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,540
What acting?

36
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,140
I don’t know.

37
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,940
I really don’t know.

38
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,939
If there’s a room available,

39
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,419
I hope I will get the room the way I’m supposed to.

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,180
I hope no one will try to hinder it.

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,340
Are we rivals?

42
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,619
I’m touched.

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,379
You view me as your rival.

44
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,259
If there’s a room available,

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,499
I hope you won’t get in my way.

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,899
That’s not going to be easy.

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,020
I think no students will move to a new apartment in the middle of the semester.

48
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,979
Jobholders are unlikely to quit their jobs.

49
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,619
Most of the employed tenants here are public servants.

50
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,819
Some of them are permanent residents.

51
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,820
Anything is possible.

52
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,660
Maybe I get lucky.

53
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,259
A tenant may have to move out.

54
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260
That’s impossible.

55
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,340
I hope you find a good place to live somewhere else.

56
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
I’m relocated to work in Nakhon Phanom.

Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

63
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
Did you just get here?

64
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
Actually, I’ve been waiting for you for a while.

65
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,100
I’m worried you may be too afraid to walk in.

66
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,980
Thank you.

67
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,380
Do you like the perfume that I gave you?

68
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
Yes.

69
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,220
But I was surprised that you thought that kind of scent matched my personality.

70
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,020
Does the scent match my personality?

71
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,980
You may seem rough on the outside.

72
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,420
But deep down, I think you are profound and sensitive.

73
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,660
Do you want to borrow my lecture note?

74
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,396
It’s okay.

75
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,020
Faye saved the classroom presentation for me.

76
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,340
Is that so?

77
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,940
You should drop your prejudice against her.

78
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,820
She is not a terrible person.

79
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,780
Even though you asked me to do that, I…

80
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,820
Guy.

81
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,660
If she doesn’t stir up trouble,

82
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,100
I’ll try to be nice to her.

83
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,980
Guy. Liu.

84
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,860
Where should we go during the university fair?

85
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
How about the beach?

86
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,900
Is it almost time for the university fair?

87
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,459
Were you only looking at each other while walking here?

88
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,620
Look around.

89
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
There.

90
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
There.

91
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,900
They are preparing for the fair.

92
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,780
Aren’t we supposed to help out?

93
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,899
Why would we do that?

94
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,460
It’s so boring.

95
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,819
The university suspends all classes during the fair.

96
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,260
We should go on a trip.

97
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,980
The activity is not interesting.

98
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,460
Do you know what they are going to do this year?

99
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,500
They will do what they did every year.

100
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,020
It’s boring.

101
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,740
[Don’t forget to visit the Lab Bar of the chemistry department.]

102
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,499
I told you.

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
Who would want to participate?

104
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,100
I heard that they would change the concept this year.

105
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,100
A junior is pushing for the change.

106
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,980
Are you talking about Milin?

107
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,620
She lost.

108
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,620
I knew why she lost.

109
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,340
In the end, they chose to keep the glorious tradition of the chemistry department.

110
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,500
So where should we go?

111
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,659
The beach, the mountains, an amusement park, or a water park?

112
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,700
I’ll drive.

113
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,460
You guys can choose.

114
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
I don’t think I can join you.

115
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,180
I have an errand to do.

116
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,579
About the fair, you must not agree to help them.

117
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,419
If someone asks you to help, it means that person has ill intentions.

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,420
Liu.

119
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,900
Do you want to help out at Lab Bar during the fair?

120
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,099
I already asked Mimi.

121
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,019
It will be fun if we do it together.

122
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,100
Paula already said no because the booth uses too much plastic.

123
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,820
He can’t stand it.

124
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:10,820
Are you having fun, asking your friend to do this kind of thing?'

125
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,580
What is that sound?

126
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,620
It sounds like someone wants to get attention though it has nothing to do with him.

127
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,819
I think you ask me to do it because you still don’t know what Lab Bar is like.

128
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
I know. We sell drinks in a lab-themed booth.

129
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
You know but you still ask her to do it?

130
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,780
Yes, we will sell drinks.

131
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,940
But I think you don’t know how revealing the outfits are.

132
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,859
I’m sorry. I didn’t know it.

133
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,219
If I knew, I wouldn’t have asked you to do it.

134
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,220
I’m sorry.

135
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,940
It’s okay.

136
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,460
Faye.

137
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,060
Are you okay?

138
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,140
Why don’t you take some rest?

139
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,780
I’ll do your work.

140
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,540
I’ll go take some rest.

141
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Film.

142
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,739
Faye looks downhearted.

143
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,020
She looked high-spirited in her live-streaming yesterday.

144
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,940
My girlfriend was once like that.

145
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,379
Why don’t you go tell her a funny joke?

146
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,419
She will definitely feel better.

147
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,420
Really?

148
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,580
Film.

149
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,620
She is not your girlfriend.

150
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,660
She is an idol.

151
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,260
She’s my girlfriend.

152
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,580
Your idea doesn’t sound bad.

153
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,900
Watch me.

154
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,380
I’ll take this.

155
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,460
Faye.

156
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,500
I don’t have a solvent.

157
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,859
But when I am close to you,

158
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,380
I am melting.

159
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,260
How the hell would he win her heart with that?'

160
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,499
See how good my joke is.

161
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,739
My face is not made of glass like a beaker.

162
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,100
It’s not that fragile.

163
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,739
Mork, you are funny.

164
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,780
How can you come up with the joke?

165
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,980
I’m happy to see you smile.

166
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,179
You look downhearted.

167
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,259
Is there something bothering you?

168
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
You can tell me.

169
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,979
I have something to think about.

170
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,420
But I feel better now because of you.

171
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,219
I’ll go back to help Liu.

172
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,740
I don’t want to burden her.

173
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,059
Liu, I’m back.

174
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,180
Do you have anything for me to do?

175
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,020
Can you hold this for me?

176
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620
Faye.

177
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,979
Faye, I’m sorry.

178
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,180
I thought you already took it.

179
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,140
Faye, are you okay?

180
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,540
Faye, let me take a look.

181
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,420
Go wash it off.

182
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,379
Liu, what the hell did you do?

183
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,380
I’m sorry.

184
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
I’ll clean it.

185
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,340
Be careful.

186
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,860
You may get hurt too.

187
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,299
You’re bleeding.

188
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,540
Faye, does it hurt a lot?

189
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,900
A little.

190
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,300
I’m sorry, Faye.

191
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,500
It was my fault. I wasn’t careful when I handed you the beaker.

192
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,860
It’s okay.

193
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,820
My wound is not caused by the substance but by a piece of the broken beaker.

194
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,019
It was my fault.

195
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,420
I was distracted.

196
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,460
Faye, what is bothering you?

197
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,580
I promised that I would find people to be servers at our booth.

198
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,220
But when I saw the outfits,

199
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,499
I don’t dare to ask anyone.

200
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,020
I don’t know what to do.

201
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,980
I’m worried about whether I can do it by myself.

202
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,580
Now I’m injured because I wasn’t being careful.

203
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,940
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said it.

204
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,940
I didn’t mean to make you feel bad.

205
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,940
I’ll figure something out.

206
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,100
I’m okay. Don’t worry.

207
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Why don’t you ask them to change the outfits?

208
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,380
If they say yes,

209
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
I’ll do it.

210
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,980
Me, too.

211
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,299
I’d love to help but they use a lot of plastic.

212
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,139
I don’t want to be part of it.

213
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,739
It’s okay. I get it.

214
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,980
I think it’ll be fine if these two help me.

215
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,780
I’ll go talk to them about it.

216
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,260
Why aren’t you going in?

217
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
Hey.

218
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,220
If you are planning to compete with me in winning Faye’s heart.

219
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,340
You are no match for me.

220
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,340
We can go in now.

221
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,540
Faye.

222
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,700
How are you doing?

223
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,780
Are you okay?

224
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,340
Yes, I’m okay.

225
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,579
About the fair…

226
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Don’t tell me that she got herself injured to get you to agree to help out at the fair.

227
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,060
Can you tell Ann for me?

228
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,220
I can’t go with her anymore because something came up with my family.

229
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,460
Excuse me. I need to call my mom.

230
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,340
Thank you.

231
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,220
Thank you.

232
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,180
Have a good day.

233
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
Nam.

234
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,500
Are you going to give the room to the guy from the other day?

235
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,500
The guy from the other day?

236
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,860
You mean your friend?

237
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,780
I don’t consider him my friend.

238
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,780
I don’t consider him my friend.

239
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,860
The line is good.

240
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,140
I don’t consider you my friend.

241
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,819
He’s on a waiting list.

242
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,539
Many people want to rent the room.

243
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,540
Alright.

244
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,739
I don’t consider you my friend.

245
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,556
[Karin Sayapisit]

246
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,060
Then what I am to you?

247
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,020
Are you looking for an apartment?

248
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,579
There is a room available on the next street.

249
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,180
It’s none of your business.

250
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
I’m worried that you won’t be able to find an apartment.

251
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
What do you want from me?

252
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,659
Why are you so skeptical?

253
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,499
I heard that there is a room available on the next street.

254
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,780
I can take you there.

255
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,859
It’s okay if you’re not interested.

256
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,539
If you want to continue your endless hunt for an apartment,

257
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,540
That’s fine by me.

258
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,979
It’s up to you.

259
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,980
I’m leaving.

260
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,700
Where is it?

261
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,140
I’ll send you the address.

262
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,100
These are the servers at this year’s Lab Bar.

263
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,780
Is that Milin that people talk about?

264
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,100
She’s so pretty.

265
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,619
(She has big round eyes.)

266
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,739
(Her nose is tall.)

267
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,019
(Her face shape is great.)

268
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,740
(I’ll give her 80 points.)

269
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,339
(This woman has small but sparkling eyes.)

270
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,820
(Her nose is tall and teardrop-shaped.)

271
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,099
(She has chubby cheeks and looks pretty.)

272
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,819
(I’ll give her 75 points.)

273
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,059
Milin, aren’t this year’s server pretty?

274
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,739
I guarantee that we will have a higher sale this year.

275
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,539
I checked the social media.

276
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,940
Netizens rated their beauty as follows…

277
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,300
There.

278
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Faye got 100 points.

279
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,219
Liu got 98 points.

280
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,340
Mimi got 90 points.

281
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,740
But these points don’t mean anything.

282
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,740
What you need to do is get a lot of tips.

283
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,980
That is our main profit.

284
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,820
The person who gets the highest tips will be selected as the best server.

285
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,300
What do I need to do to get a lot of tips?

286
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,820
That…

287
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,339
You will figure it out.

288
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
That’s right.

289
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,940
This is confusing.

290
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,260
Milin, stop doing the glum face and focus on your work.

291
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,780
Are you disappointed that you are not pretty enough to be a server?

292
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,739
If you stop doing the glum face and your height is a bit higher,

293
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
I would see some potential in you.

294
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,436
That’s true.

295
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,499
Da, you too.

296
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,020
If you lose a few pounds,

297
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,180
You will look similar to the actress Davika instead of Kang Fu Panda.

298
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,180
I’m just joking to lighten up the mood.

299
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,780
Don’t take it seriously.

300
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,860
Milin and Da, take them to get measured for the outfits.

301
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,780
We need to talk to other staff.

302
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:38,860
I’m sorry that we don’t have enough budget to stop using plastic cups.

303
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,700
Have you changed the outfit design?

304
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,420
Yes. It’s all done.

305
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
That’s right.

306
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,580
Do you have papers and tailor tapes?

307
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,900
Yes.

308
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,620
I think we need to get a handyman to fix the door.

309
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,260
Mimi, can you help take note of Faye’s measurement?

310
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Sure.

311
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,660
Are you okay with the joke earlier?

312
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,100
I want to look pretty like Liu, Faye, and Mimi.

313
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,580
So they can’t nag me.

314
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,540
But you are pretty.

315
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:36,074
Really?

316
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Milin.

317
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,020
Liu said I am pretty.

318
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,980
I always tell you that but you’ve never believed me.

319
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,620
Faye, what did you say to convince them to change the outfit design?

320
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,860
I didn’t say much.

321
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,980
I don’t know why they changed their mind.

322
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,020
Third. Jo.

323
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,740
No one wants to be a server at Lab Bar if you don’t change the outfits.

324
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,500
Can’t you change to pants?

325
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
No.

326
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,300
We got a lot of tips because of the outfits.

327
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,140
That’s why we chose the concept of hot servers.

328
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,140
You won’t look hot if you wear pants.

329
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,060
What about these shorts?

330
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,580
This is not bad.

331
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,900
I guarantee that this year’s booth will be amazing.

332
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,620
Am I right?

333
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,540
Of course.

334
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,180
We are proud to present it.

335
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,659
You won’t be disappointed to trust me to carry on our booth’s tradition.

336
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,939
That’s great, Third.

337
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,020
Can you check the booth for me?

338
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,459
Sure. I’ll do it.

339
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,260
It’ll be fine.

340
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
Get it ready.

341
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,899
Mork, do you see Milin and Da?

342
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,660
They told me to help make drinks.

343
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,060
I thought you were going to the beach.

344
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,180
How could I go?

345
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,180
Both Guy and Liu flaked on me.

346
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,020
Guy said he needed to look for an apartment.

347
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,020
Liu said she had an errand with her family.

348
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,980
How could she run an errand with her family?

349
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,620
I just saw Liu in the dressing room with Faye.

350
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,620
Didn’t they say they would change to pants?

351
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,740
What the hell is this?

352
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,740
They only let the girls wear slip shorts.

353
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,939
I’m sorry.

354
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,940
I didn’t know that it would turn out like this.

355
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,620
They are jerks.

356
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,419
What are we going to do?

357
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,500
Do you have other outfits?

358
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,099
If you change the outfits, they will accuse you of stirring up trouble

359
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,899
because you lost in the voting for the booth concept’s change.

360
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,060
I did not lose.

361
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,820
Those seniors didn’t let us change the concept.

362
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,380
What are you going to do?

363
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,300
If you guys are not comfortable with the outfits,

364
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,980
I’ll do it alone.

365
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,980
Because this is my fault.

366
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,380
How can you handle everything? There will be a lot of customers.

367
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,660
If we are going to do it, let’s do it together.

368
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,300
I don’t you to shoulder it alone.

369
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,619
How about this?

370
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,259
If you can’t take it anymore, you need to tell me right away.

371
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,620
I’ll switch with you.

372
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,500
Ann will help us too.

373
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,420
Yes.

374
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Okay. Here.

375
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:56,939
Please have a look at our menu.

376
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
I’ll have an iced Coke.

377
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
Here.

378
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,779
Thanks.

379
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,139
It’s easier for billing.

380
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,780
Look, the line to our booth is so long.

381
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,060
Well done.

382
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Is that a compliment?

383
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,340
You drop something.

384
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,219
How is it going?

385
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,219
Are there a lot of online comments on the girls?

386
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,020
I haven’t checked it yet.

387
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Wait a sec.

388
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,860
They are typical comments like in the previous years.

389
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,700
Look.

390
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
[The servers are very pretty.]

391
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,420
[Their legs are flawless.]

392
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,996
[Wow, what a bombshell!]

393
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,420
[Faye is mine.]

394
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,780
[Mimi is mine.]

395
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,206
[Liu is mine.]

396
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,913
[Do you like a plastic girl?]

397
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
I’ll be back with your drinks.

398
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,140
I’ll help Film get the ice.

399
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,220
Are you okay?

400
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,460
Didn’t you tell me you had an errand with your family?

401
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,540
I just wanted to help Faye.

402
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,020
Please don’t tell Guy about this.

403
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,020
I don’t want them to fight again.

404
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,980
Third. Jo.

405
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,739
I can’t stand the customers at that table.

406
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,580
They keep telling me to wipe the table to stare at my chest.

407
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,516
Liu.

408
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Come here.

409
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,420
Can you go take care of that table instead of Faye?

410
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,540
Take the wiping cloth.

411
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,180
It’s okay.

412
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,460
She’s all plastic.

413
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,300
A bit of staring and touching wouldn’t tarnish her, unlike a natural beauty like you.

414
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,340
Why isn’t Faye coming here anymore?

415
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,500
You can wipe the table for us.

416
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,899
Do you want to order anything else?

417
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,419
Two iced chocolates.

418
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,499
There’s a trash here.

419
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,580
Can you pick it up?

420
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
Third.

421
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,059
The customers at that table stared at my legs.

422
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,660
They also secretly photographed me.

423
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,860
This is normal.

424
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,779
It’s your job to make customers satisfied.

425
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,660
The more photos they take, the higher sales we will get.

426
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,539
It’s not a big deal. Just let them do it.

427
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,860
This way you will get a lot of tips.

428
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,220
Liu.

429
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,060
Serve the drinks to the customers.

430
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,020
Take them.

431
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
Thank you.

432
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,140
Can you wipe the table again?

433
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,940
Please also pick up the trash.

434
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
Thank you.

435
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,299
Aren’t there rooms available on the next street?

436
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,460
Yes, there are but I don’t like them.

437
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,540
You are very picky.

438
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,860
Well…

439
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,179
Why? Are you going to help me search for another room?

440
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,460
I…

441
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,060
I…

442
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,660
I am…

443
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,460
Hey.

444
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,939
Are you here to rent the room?

445
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,139
You have a room available?

446
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,060
Yes.

447
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:12,219
Didn’t Saint tell you that you are first on the list?

448
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,979
Isn’t that why you are here to sign the contract?

449
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,939
Saint, it’s so sweet of you.

450
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,820
Let’s go in and sign the contract.

451
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,660
Otherwise, I’ll give the room to the next person on the list at 6 pm.

452
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,260
I’ll get the contract ready.

453
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
What’s up?

454
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,700
I think Liu is not okay.

455
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
What happened?

456
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,220
Liu is at the university fair.

457
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,619
Third sent her to take care of perverted customers.

458
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,219
He said Liu is all plastic so she would be fine.

459
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,420
Can you come to help her?

460
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,740
You need to sign on two pages. Here and here.

461
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,500
[Notifications of Ann sending several photos.]

462
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,740
Hey.

463
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,180
You are a piece of work.

464
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,980
Conflict.

465
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Thank you.

466
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,620
Excuse me.

467
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,180
Please be respectful.

468
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,100
I’ll give you an additional tip as an apology to you.

469
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
Wait.

470
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,420
If I give you more tips,

471
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,380
can I touch you a bit more?

472
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,019
I’m kidding.

473
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
Here.

474
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Use it to buy snacks.

475
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,020
Hey.

476
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,779
Why are you staring at me?

477
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,460
As a service worker, you need to keep your manners.

478
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,500
Manners are the thing that we all should have.

479
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,419
Do you want to order anything else?

480
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,580
I’ll be at your service.

481
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:32,420
Do you want to order anything?

482
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
No.

483
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,260
Thank all of you for working hard at our department’s booth.

484
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,020
I’ll have Film and Jerry announce our sales for today.

485
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,620
Wait a sec.

486
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:01,900
I haven’t finished counting the money.

487
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,940
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you sooner.

488
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,980
It’s my fault. I wanted to help Faye.

489
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,780
I am not mad at you.

490
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:16,761
Yeah!

491
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,500
We broke the record for last year’s first-day sales.

492
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,340
However, the sales were slowing down because someone interrupted our plan.

493
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,660
You showed up briefly at the booth.

494
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,460
But you stealthily drink with us.

495
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,340
You didn’t help us prepare for the fair.

496
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,220
But you showed up and made quite a scene.

497
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Manners are the thing that we all should have.

498
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,740
What I said is true.

499
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,499
That’s enough.

500
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,060
I’ll recap today.

501
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,860
I would like to thank all of you.

502
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,220
Our first day went incredibly well.

503
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,620
Special thanks to Faye, Liu, and Mimi who have worked hard all day.

504
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,516
True.

505
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,980
You all did very well.

506
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,300
Right, we did everything when you did nothing.

507
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
What did you say?

508
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:09,179
I heard it.

509
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,380
I helped post photos on social media.

510
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,380
Am I right?

511
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:12,940
Yes.

512
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,940
I helped check feedback on social media.

513
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
Look.

514
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:21,819
Our booth is trending on social media because of Faye as expected.

515
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,420
Please give her a round of applause.

516
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,060
Why is there a picture of Guy?

517
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Right.

518
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,059
This is unfair.

519
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,060
He only showed up briefly but is trending as a shipped couple.

520
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,340
I heard rumors about these two for a while.

521
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,099
Did Guy show up at the fair because he couldn’t stand watching Faye wearing a revealing outfit?

522
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,460
He came to protect her.

523
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,580
Is that true, Guy?

524
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,100
That’s not true.

525
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,780
We hate each other.

526
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,500
It’s good that you know it.

527
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,620
I saw many enemies turning into lovers.

528
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,140
Enough about shipping.

529
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,659
Let’s announce the best server.

530
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,860
The best server aka the hottest server for today,

531
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,540
That person is…

532
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,820
Liu!

533
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,620
Please give her a round of applause.

534
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,699
I think the customers must be impressed by your service.

535
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,500
Film, Jerry, why don’t you read comments about her?

536
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:36,459
The comment said, “I like when she wipes the table.”

537
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,940
“She’s great at picking up trash on the ground.”

538
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,020
I think you will be assigned to wipe tables and pick up trash tomorrow.

539
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Right?

540
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,780
What Liu did is paying off.

541
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,419
She helped take care of her friend’s table and raise our booth’s income.

542
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,380
Am I right, Third?

543
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:54,940
Yes.

544
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,940
That’s great.

545
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,820
Excuse me.

546
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,100
Where are you going?

547
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,100
We need to talk.

548
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,620
About what?

549
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,700
Don’t pretend like you don’t know.

550
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,340
It’s about Faye.

551
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,100
You came here today because you wanted to make a move on Faye, right?

552
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,940
Let’s have a drinking duel with me.

553
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,340
Whoever wins gets Faye.

554
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,420
Sure.

555
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,860
We need to straighten things up.

556
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,900
- Mork, Mork, Mork. - Guy, Guy, Guy.

557
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,460
Who can drink more will get Faye.

558
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,739
There you go.

559
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,260
Mork, Mork, Mork.

560
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:19,838
Guy, Guy, Guy.

561
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:58,340
[This booth has a great view.]

562
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,980
[The servers are very cute.]

563
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,580
[The highlight of the fair.]

564
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:31,893
♪ Because reality is not beautiful ♪

565
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,949
♪ It’s different from what I dreamed of ♪

566
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,300
Oh.

567
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
What’s up, honey?

568
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Mom.

569
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,579
Liu, what’s wrong?

570
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,180
Why is your voice shaky?

571
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,180
Are your friends teasing you about the plastic surgery?

572
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,620
Is there something happened to you?

573
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Mom.

574
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:14,180
Can you tell me what I need to do to be a valuable person?

575
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,220
What happened?

576
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,460
When I was not pretty, no one cared about me.

577
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,700
When I underwent plastic surgery and became pretty,

578
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,380
why do people think they can treat me any way they want?

579
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,900
If I wasn’t born with the looks that fit the beauty standard,

580
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,940
No matter how hard I try,

581
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,900
I will never be viewed as a valuable person like others, right?

582
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,940
I don’t understand.

583
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,620
Why do people judge me only by my looks?

584
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,620
One more shot, one more shot.

585
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,300
Is this the only way for us to be on top of this society?

586
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,855
One more shot, one more shot

587
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,220
Do I need to let it go on like this?

588
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,380
Is there nothing I can do to change it?

589
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,860
The winner is Guy.

590
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,940
Will someone notice this dysfunction?

591
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,779
Will they do something to change it?

592
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,500
Faye, please go to Guy as his reward.

593
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,893
I think it would be nice

594
00:36:18,373 --> 00:36:24,733
if someone sees me as a human who has feelings just like them.

595
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,900
Can you stop doing this to other people?

596
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,300
What the hell were you thinking?

597
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,300
To come up with such a game.

598
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,820
Do a drinking duel to get Faye.

599
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,820
Have you ever asked her if she wants to have you or me?

600
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,939
Who the hell do you think you are

601
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,420
to think that you have the right to set up the rules without asking her?

602
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,219
Why the hell are you bringing this up now?

603
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,300
You were drinking with him.

604
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,860
I was waiting to see if someone would stand up against it.

605
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,020
I’m not surprised to see what happened at Lab Bar.

606
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,460
Are you criticizing our department’s tradition?

607
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,699
Why can’t I do that?

608
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,236
Hey!

609
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,756
Stop it.

610
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
Stop it.

611
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,300
Please stop fighting.

612
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,580
What Guy said is right.

613
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:29,180
I don’t feel good about this from the beginning.

614
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,980
You were quite furious earlier.

615
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,980
I did well that I called you over.

616
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,580
I was already in a bad mood because of someone.

617
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,020
The person keeps interrupting my plans.

618
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,700
So you still can’t find an apartment?

619
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,740
How could I find one when Saint keeps getting in my way?

620
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,220
I think that is a good thing for you.

621
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,980
If Saint is that kind of person,

622
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,940
you are more likable than him.

623
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,620
There is a higher chance that Liu will choose you over him.

624
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,140
Really?

625
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
Yes.

626
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,820
If he is that kind of person,

627
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,140
he is not different from those jerks

628
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
He never gave Liu a chance to choose.

629
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,620
He makes the decision for Liu about who she should be with.

630
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,940
This is your chance.

631
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,580
You should go to see Liu and score points with her.

632
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,020
If you want me to get there fast, you need to give me a ride.

633
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,780
You will be surprised by my baby’s speed.

634
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
What is this?

635
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,100
Are you going to fool me to rent a room somewhere else?

636
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,020
I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you earlier.

637
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,900
You need a guarantor to rent a room here.

638
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,340
I was discussing it with Aunt Linda.

639
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,779
After you left, I called Aunt Linda to take care of it.

640
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,780
You did that even though you kept telling me to look for a room somewhere else?

641
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,700
When did I do that?

642
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,339
I was worried that you wouldn’t have a place to stay.

643
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,899
There were five people on the list before you.

644
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,900
Your chance to get the room was very low.

645
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:00,060
If you got the room,

646
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,780
it was great.

647
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Great?

648
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,500
How?

649
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,460
So none of us will be at a disadvantage in this game.

650
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,980
Liu can choose the best man for her.

651
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,219
What are you going to do?

652
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,660
Are you moving in tonight?

653
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,619
I forgot to tell you another thing.

654
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,060
Aunt Linda didn’t pay the deposit for your room.

655
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,620
I paid for it.

656
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,820
She said you insist that you will not take money from her.

657
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,060
It’s okay.

658
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,660
You can pay me back any time you have the money.

659
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,580
I’ll charge interest to you daily.

660
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,140
Okay?

661
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,260
Let’s go. I’ll help you move your stuff.

662
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,380
Darn it.

663
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,740
I think he is a better choice than you.

664
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,236
Hey!

665
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,700
Are you sure you are my friend?

666
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:30,740
[I believe one day you will meet someone who sees you as a valuable person.]

667
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,291
It’s so heavy.

668
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Where should I put it?

669
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,316
Huh?

670
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,340
Where should I put it?

671
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:43,698
(Someone who respects you.)

672
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:44,500
Put it there. (Someone who respects you.)

673
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:45,580
(Someone who respects you.)

674
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,380
Put these two boxes on the bed.

675
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Yes, Mr. Guy.

676
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:54,979
(I believe that you are not alone.)

677
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,300
But it’s better to put them on the shelf.

678
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
On the shelf?

679
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,300
(Even though you don’t find that person,

680
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:08,700
(I believe you can overcome this by yourself.)

681
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,900
(Just like you have done it.)

682
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:48,059
[Mom, I’ll give it a try.]

683
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,340
[I sent you a backup. You can trust him.]

684
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,620
A backup?

685
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,020
Saint.

686
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,739
Saint is living here.

687
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,180
What are you doing here?

688
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,340
My room is over there.

689
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,420
Huh?

690
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,740
Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

691
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,174
We won’t just blindly follow that stupid tradition.

692
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:45,917
Thank you for coming up with this, Liu.

693
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:47,946
I’ll make you a hero.

694
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:50,109
You keep staring at Faye.

695
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,991
I have to keep an eye on her.

696
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,940
Liu is sweet.

697
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,340
I’m not surprised that her classmates nominated her to be the hot girl.

698
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,220
From now on,

699
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,940
Guy won’t be the only one keeping an eye on you.
