1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,096
I’ll help you.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
Really?

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,960
Thank you.

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,880
We need a ship that’ll make us even more famous.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,440
Using other people to become successful,

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,160
so this is your special skill.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,480
You need to accept that she rejected you.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,199
I guess the surgery can only change her face but not her brain.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,360
What the hell is wrong with you?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,480
You did this because of me.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,039
I think he should date someone who is in the same league.

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,880
I think he should date someone who is in the same league.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,319
The person you think of as perfect

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,960
may not be all that different from you.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,960
Guys.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,119
The Thailand Content Creator Award is here.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,520
Look!

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,760
My deepest apologies for not being able to accept this in person.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,040
I honestly never expected

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,440
my plain ordinary life

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,320
life to be an inspiration to anyone at all. [You’re pretty and intelligent.]

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
[I used to hate you. Thought you’d be pretty but mean.] Let me ask you something…

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,879
How did I inspire you? [[But you always stick up for your friends. Now I know you’re really kind.]

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,119
I’ll be reading every comment.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,720
Allow me to unbox the rest for now.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,160
Oh, this is absolutely cute, guys!

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,159
Is this a cat bowl? [Kind. Cat lover. Sincere.] [Do you like my gift?]

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,400
Oh, it’s really adorable. Thank you. [Kind. Cat lover. Sincere.] [Do you like my gift?]

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,776
Oh?

30
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,280
Oh, no, I ripped it.

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,840
Look, guys.

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,840
I ripped a giant hole in this.

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,120
I’m so sorry. I messed it up big time.

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,159
But it’s alright. I’ll eat this anyway.

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,120
Thank you for the gift.

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,880
Because in real life,

37
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,120
no one is all good and perfect.

38
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,440
- Even the people you think are perfect… - It’s so cute!

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
…may not be all that different from you, Liu.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
“Not different,” you said?

41
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,800
I think we’re extremely different.

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,520
[BASED ON LINE WEBTOON “MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY” BY KI MAENGGI]

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,080
Let’s get back to vapor pressure.

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,440
This will be included in the midterm, by the way.

45
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
Speaking of exams,

46
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,440
I believe you guys know how you did in the previous test?

47
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,400
Well, if you’re not happy with the result, I hope you try a little harder.

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,440
And congratulations to Karin and Chananchida for getting top scores.

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,240
That leads me to my next point.

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,880
I want you two to represent our university

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,679
in a research contest at the upcoming International Academic Seminar.

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,079
What do you think?

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,680
I don’t think I can decide for both of us when Karin isn’t here.

54
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,720
But do you yourself want to participate?

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,680
We can ask him later.

56
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,000
I do.

57
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,480
Well, try to curb down the lovey-dovey act, okay?

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,560
Oh, Professor…

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
I’m definitely bringing back the Guy-Faye hashtag.

60
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,160
Right away, actually. [#GuyFaye]

61
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,016
[Even our Professor knows.]

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
[Feels like he’s their biggest shipper.]

63
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,056
[He even wants them to work together.]

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,040
Guys, let’s get back to our lesson, shall we? [They’re perfect for each other in looks and brains.]

65
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:38,080
As you all know, when liquid evaporates, the molecules…

66
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,880
Sorry I’m late.

67
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,999
I was talking to our Professor about the research.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,840
I also just talked to Guy on the phone.

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,040
He seemed interested.

70
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,639
Of course he does.

71
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,680
He gets to work with you, after all.

72
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,216
So true.

73
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
You look perfect for each other,

74
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
and similar in social standings.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,480
Not to mention your brains are on par.

76
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,040
Some upperclassmen told me they dropped you off at home once during the orientation.

77
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,640
You live in the middle of Thong Lor,

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
in a building as tall as this.

79
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,960
And your room looks stunning in your stream.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,439
All your stuff looks expensive.

81
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,760
Not at all.

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,120
Weird.

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
I didn’t know that area is called Thong Lor.

84
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,480
What do you mean, Ann?

85
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,240
Well…

86
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,440
Didn’t we bump into each other this morning in some run-down neighborhood?

87
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Faye?

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,720
Oh, it’s really you.

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,040
What are you doing around here?

90
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,040
Oh, I’m here to tutor some kids.

91
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,840
But from what I know, there aren’t any high school kids in that neighborhood.

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Only old people live there.

93
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Are you…

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
hiding something from us?

95
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:31,200
We only ever see one corner of your place in the stream.

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,240
Nobody actually ever gets to drop you off in Thong Lor.

97
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,480
Maybe, that room…

98
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,320
I have to go for now.

99
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,680
See you.

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
Bye.

101
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
…is just a setup?

102
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,120
I really was there to tutor someone.

103
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
Not high schoolers, though.

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,560
Actually…

105
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,080
They’re blue-collar workers who never got to finish school

106
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,080
but they still want to study.

107
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Is that so?

108
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
Yes.

109
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,240
But there really is something I’m hiding…

110
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,640
Well, I don’t live in Thong Lor.

111
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,080
But I didn’t mean to lie about that.

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,119
Someone wanted to give me a ride home and I didn’t want to reveal where I live.

113
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,040
But all your stuff makes it look like that’s what you’re trying to make people think.

114
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,240
Oh…

115
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,280
Some of the stuff are gifts from my fans.

116
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,560
The rest, I worked really hard to save up and buy them.

117
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,119
I just want everything to look nice on screen.

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
What would you do that for?

119
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,760
Because people want to see nice things, Ann.

120
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,400
I should know, because I live in that neighborhood.

121
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:37,080
People just want to watch something that gives them hope to keep on living.

122
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,480
That’s why I created this hopeful life.

123
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,600
I want to show them that even a girl like Faye from their neighborhood can do

124
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,600
And so can they.

125
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,640
“I don’t like studying at all. What’s the point?”

126
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,919
As for the people watching me through the screen,

127
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,160
I just want to make them know how important education is.

128
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,320
Education brings stability and a better job.

129
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,520
And that makes everyone want to go back to school.

130
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,640
Sorry for disappointing you guys.

131
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,159
Not at all, Faye.

132
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,240
Well, it was us who assumed you were rich.

133
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,920
You never even told us that.

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,960
I’m not as perfect as you guys think, am I?

135
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
What are you saying?

136
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,560
You’re the most perfect girl I know.

137
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,679
Really?

138
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,680
What a relief.

139
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,319
I was afraid I wouldn’t be perfect for Guy anymore.

140
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,256
Right, Liu?

141
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,960
What, do you have a crush on him or something?

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,680
Don’t tell me you guys are a thing now?

143
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,680
From Mr. Saint.

144
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,800
[Let me know when class is over. Let’s go home together.]

145
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,800
I think he’s perfect for you, Liu.

146
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,800
He’s kind and generous.

147
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,280
If it’s this guy, then I’m rooting for you.

148
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,176
She’s right.

149
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,760
He was so nice during the fair. He took such good care of you.

150
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Speaking of the fair,

151
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,919
weren’t you also eyeing someone that day, Mimi.

152
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,360
You are?

153
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,296
Who is he?

154
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
Is he nice?

155
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,240
Uhh...

156
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:48,719
If he’s someone like Note, don’t you even think about it.

157
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,440
I think you deserve someone better.

158
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
If you’re going to date someone,

159
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,480
you deserve someone nice and perfect for you.

160
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,880
That’s what I think.

161
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,120
[Can you meet me at the student society’s office? I need to talk to you.]

162
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,240
Why didn’t you come to class this morning?

163
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,360
I had something I needed to think about.

164
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,200
But you agreed to that research contest with Faye.

165
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Yeah.

166
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,520
I thought you’d avoid it.

167
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,400
That’s what you want me to do, isn’t it?

168
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,440
You don’t want me to be on bad terms with Faye.

169
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,560
Well, yes…

170
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,160
But you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to.

171
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,040
I can’t do that.

172
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,000
Actually…

173
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,440
I should do what I’m supposed to do sometimes, right?

174
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,160
Like you said, no man is an island.

175
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,840
I’m really sorry, Liu,

176
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,600
for telling you I wanted you to fight again,

177
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,800
when you’ve already done enough fighting for one life.

178
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,720
You don’t need to be with someone who wants you to keep fighting.

179
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
You deserve someone…

180
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
you can rest your bones with.

181
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Guy.

182
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,680
I’ll patch you up.

183
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Follow me.

184
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,280
Here.

185
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,000
I didn’t know you’re into perfumes.

186
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,760
What did you think brought me and Liu together if not perfumes?

187
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
I just thought you guys were neighbors.

188
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,120
You… taking a dig at me?

189
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
No.

190
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,360
Come. Let’s get you sorted.

191
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,080
I didn’t understand at all why it couldn’t be me.

192
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,720
But I have some ideas now.

193
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
About that, I…

194
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,400
I want to talk to you, too...

195
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Saint.

196
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,160
Can make Liu a famous perfumer?

197
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,760
Can make her dream come true?

198
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Of course.

199
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,360
 Among the countless people who pass me by 

200
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,560
He’s so different from me.

201
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,120
 The one I await walks away, I wonder why 

202
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,960
With him, you won’t have to fight again,

203
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,360
no matter what lies waiting for you up ahead.

204
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,880
I just realized what a selfish guy I am.

205
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,600
Just because I knew you in the past

206
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,960
doesn’t mean I deserve your future.

207
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,200
I was entirely against the term “perfect for each other” before this.

208
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,360
But now that I know Saint…

209
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,159
I finally understand what it means. [Liu/Saint]  I felt like the whole world 

210
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,600
[Liu/Saint]  I felt like the whole world 

211
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,160
 Was lonely and empty at first 

212
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,160
I’ll be very happy for you

213
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
if it’s him you’re in love with.

214
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,839
 Seeing you standing right by my side 

215
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,840
I’ll ask you one thing…

216
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:17,000
Please don’t stop being my friend because of that.

217
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,120
 I’ve just realized the whole world 

218
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,199
 Seems empty and lonely if here you weren’t 

219
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,800
I really know where my place is now.

220
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,399
I won’t cross that line again.

221
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,360
 Is right here, just within reach 

222
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,799
 But I was blind 

223
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
And as a friend,

224
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,800
it will make me very happy to see you happy.

225
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 You were just within reach, but I was blind 

226
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,640
Oh.

227
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,840
Look.

228
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,760
Way to make an entrance!

229
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,280
He’s just waiting right here where everyone can see?

230
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
I thought he’d pick somewhere more discreet.

231
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,600
That’s cute.

232
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,480
[Isn’t that the famous Saint? Who is he here to fool now?]

233
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,359
[Liu, freshman, Chemistry.]

234
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,320
[Saint and Liu are dating?]

235
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,799
[Pretty and Handsome are perfect for each other.]

236
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,960
[That’s wicked of him for snatching another pretty girl.]

237
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,520
They’re perfect for each other, aren’t they?

238
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
They are.

239
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,800
[I guess a fake guy deserves a fake girl.]

240
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,440
[You’re right.]

241
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:25,856
[Saint is a womanizer. Liu is plastic.] [A match made in Hell, so to speak.]

242
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,360
[One is fake-face. The other is a casanova.]

243
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,680
This?

244
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,400
Why did you come pick me up from campus today?

245
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,120
I just wanted to.

246
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,600
Do I need a reason for that?

247
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,720
You know people talk about us?

248
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,080
Do they?

249
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,600
What does the worst one say?

250
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,840
The worst one says we deserve each other.

251
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,760
The worst one isn’t all that bad, is it?

252
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Not at all.

253
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,920
So you can smile now?

254
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,440
Well… yes.

255
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,320
I can’t believe that’s possible.

256
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,040
You mean…?

257
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,120
Me being in love.

258
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,840
What do you like about me?

259
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,280
Your face.

260
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,200
You know my whole face is fake, right?

261
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,920
Well, I like it.

262
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,720
What’s wrong with falling for someone’s appearance first?

263
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,480
There’s gotta be something that attracts you to someone

264
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,000
before you learn more about who they are

265
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,080
and fall deeper for them, right?

266
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,560
I never thought there would come a day I could laugh at these mean comments.

267
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,840
I always took them so seriously.

268
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,560
See?

269
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,880
When you know what’s coming,

270
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,280
it is so much easier to handle, isn't it?

271
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
Yes.

272
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
When I’m with you,

273
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,880
I feel like every tough situation is so easy to get through.

274
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
It’s like Guy said,

275
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,000
you’re like my future.

276
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,160
You’re someone who won’t let me break a sweat again.

277
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,560
You’ve talked to Guy, then?

278
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Yes.

279
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,000
He said he wanted to talk to me today.

280
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,880
He said he understood now what “perfect for each other” means.

281
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
He knows what I think now,

282
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,000
and wants us to be friends like before.

283
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,040
It seems like everything’s falling into place, doesn’t it?

284
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,800
I have you by my side,

285
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,280
reassuring me that it’s okay to love.

286
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,640
And I get to protect Guy, just like I wanted to.

287
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
There’s a “but” in there somewhere, I take it?

288
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,960
I don’t want there to be…

289
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,680
But there is.

290
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,039
When Guy talked about being “perfect for each other,”

291
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,400
about how I wouldn’t have to put up with what anyone thinks of me anymore,

292
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,120
about being friends again…

293
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,160
Actually…

294
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,680
I should do what I’m supposed to do sometimes, right?

295
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,920
Turns out everything I wanted ended up hurting Guy.

296
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,240
Like you said, no man is an island.

297
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I make him think he…

298
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,280
What a selfish guy I am.

299
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,880
But the selfish one is me, isn't it?

300
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,759
I’m making up conditions because of my past

301
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,880
to make sure I never have to go through the same thing again.

302
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,880
Now, instead of protecting him,

303
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,800
I’m the very thing that hurts him the worst.

304
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,720
I make him think he’s insensitive,

305
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,080
when in fact, it’s all me who can’t get over my past.

306
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,800
And it’s me…

307
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,320
who puts you in this equally tough spot.

308
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,440
Dating me…

309
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,200
You said it was good for you,

310
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
but it isn’t at all, is it?

311
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Liu.

312
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
You may hurt Guy,

313
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,280
but you’re not hurting me one bit.

314
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,840
You said it was all your fault.

315
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,320
I don’t think that’s fair.

316
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,720
Actually…

317
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,080
I may be as guilty as you feel.

318
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Sorry?

319
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,680
When you told me you liked Guy,

320
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,240
instead of reassuring you that no matter what happens,

321
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,640
you and Guy would be alright,

322
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,120
I made this happen.

323
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
It was my wishful thinking.

324
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,000
I thought I could be the answer for you,

325
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,720
that I’d be your way out.

326
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,760
But as it turns out,

327
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
I’m leading you to a dead end.

328
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
I didn’t know at first, until I heard what you said.

329
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,600
Faye likes Guy.

330
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,640
I think it’s the best solution to this.

331
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,080
Faye is the perfect match for him.

332
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,200
And I have you.

333
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Hold on, Liu.

334
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,920
When was Faye ever in the picture?

335
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
It makes me realize that

336
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,600
I shouldn’t have made use of your confusion and turned it into my advantage.

337
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,520
I should have been the one who makes you see…

338
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,280
that it doesn’t matter how they look at you,

339
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,536
[A fake face like her deserves a guy like him.]

340
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,679
or whatever they say about you, [A fake face like her deserves a guy like him.]

341
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,920
[A perfect match. A fake-nice and a fake-face.] [Serves her right. He’ll mess her up.] [He’s definitely fooling her. Same way she’s fooling people that she’s pretty.]

342
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,560
[He’s definitely fooling her. Same way she’s fooling people that she’s pretty.]

343
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,560
you’ll be able to laugh at it if you’re strong enough.

344
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,960
[World peace at last! The scammers are falling for each other!] [They should get married and build their messed up family.]

345
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:00,799
[Is Saint getting played now? Finally! A womanizer like him deserves it.] [Oh, good news. Save everyone else the trouble of ever getting fooled by these fake people.]

346
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,399
[Fooling girls vs. Fooling people] [Who’s fooling who? Freaking glad they end up together, though. I ship them now.]

347
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,559
[Saint doesn’t have to jump from girl to girl anymore if Liu just gets another surgery.] [Now that’s a perfect match.]

348
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,000
[I think he’s serious about this one. Liu is always willing to get a new face for him.] [All she needs when he gets bored of her is another surgery.]

349
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:21,600
I’m glad you realized all by yourself that what we’re doing isn’t right.

350
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,440
I never doubted you wouldn’t.

351
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,280
So… this short little date of ours

352
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,120
is the best gift you could ever give me.

353
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
Saint.

354
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:51,160
This is only a tiny rest stop for you before you’re back to fighting,

355
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,200
but just know that this time,

356
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,840
you’re not fighting alone anymore.

357
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,840
Being like your first lover,

358
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,640
being the one to make you realize you’re allowed to be in love,

359
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,520
I take it as an absolute honor.

360
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Saint.

361
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,360
Why are you so nice to me?

362
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,520
Even that doesn’t make you love me.

363
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,240
But it’s okay.

364
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,720
I may not be your boyfriend,

365
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,000
but I believe we can still be friends.

366
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,560
And I still hope you’ll come and work for me, Liu.

367
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,880
This time, I get to choose.

368
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Alright.

369
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,320
Just go. Go to Guy.

370
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:04,440
Go before he decides to get over you and we’re all doomed.

371
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
Yes.

372
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,920
Thank you, Saint.

373
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,360
My pleasure.

374
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,880
[Liu/Saint]

375
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,400
Guy?

376
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,640
[Guy]

377
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,120
Ann, do you know where Guy is?

378
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,400
[Ms. Linda]

379
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,920
Ms. Linda?

380
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,120
Liu, I have a missed call from you.

381
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,120
Can I ask you something?

382
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,400
Do you happen to know where Guy is right now?

383
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,040
Is something the matter?

384
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,840
I… have something important I’d like to talk to him about.

385
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,800
Oh, Liu.

386
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Go.

387
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,720
Yes.

388
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,880
Do you have a box, Mom?

389
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,880
I want to wrap this up.

390
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,400
Wait, or should I go with a ribbon?

391
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
Ribbon sounds nice.

392
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,400
I thought you were with Saint.

393
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,720
I was.

394
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,440
But now I’m not.

395
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Huh?

396
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,640
I’m here to see you.

397
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,080
You’re here to see me?

398
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,520
What kind of perfume are you working on?

399
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,800
Oh, I…

400
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,280
Aquatic?

401
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Yeah.

402
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Yes.

403
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,760
For Gale?

404
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,120
For you.

405
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,320
Listen…

406
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,120
I know you turned me down.

407
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:51,280
But you gave me a bottle of perfume when we became friends.

408
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,720
So I thought I’d do the same for you

409
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,000
if we’re going to be friends again.

410
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,680
Why aquatic?

411
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Well, because…

412
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,400
You’re…

413
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,080
No matter what storm you run into,

414
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,480
no matter how deep the ocean pulls your current under,

415
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,000
you’re a tide that always makes your way back to shore.

416
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,600
But your waves aren’t brutal.

417
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,840
Your waves are safe, never meant to hurt anyone.

418
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,280
That's how I see you.

419
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,120
So… ribbon?

420
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,040
Yeah.

421
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,040
That would be nice.

422
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,960
If I don’t accept it, will it make you really sad?

423
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,520
What?

424
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,880
It’s a hypothetical question.

425
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,440
Don’t be so mean to me.

426
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,840
I just want to do something nice for you.

427
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,840
I want to be your friend.

428
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,600
Can’t I?

429
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,720
What if…

430
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,080
I don’t want to be your friend anymore?

431
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,360
What do you mean?

432
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,000
You mean you don’t want anything to do with me at all?

433
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,040
No.

434
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,479
I don’t want to be your friend…

435
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,000
because I want to be your girlfriend

436
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
What?

437
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,280
I just want to tell you that…

438
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,720
None of this happened because of your selfishness.

439
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,640
It wasn’t even your fault.

440
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,400
It was all mine.

441
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,040
And worse of all,

442
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,560
it was my fault

443
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,120
for not admitting that I’m in love with you.

444
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Will you…

445
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,160
Will you forgive me?

446
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,880
If I do, will you go out with me?

447
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,080
If you’ll still have me.

448
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,480
Of course I will.

449
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,680
 You make my whole world shine so bright 

450
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,680
 No longer alone like before 

451
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,000
 I fix my gaze on your forevermore 

452
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,160
 On my focus 

453
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,136
[They’re perfect for each other.]

454
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,736
[Really perfect.]

455
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,200
[So perfect.]

456
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,719
[They are perfect.]

457
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
[#GuyFaye]

458
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,360
[#GuyFaye]

459
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,960
[They must be dating. #GuyFaye]

460
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,800
[No one is more perfect for Faye than Guy. #GuyFaye]

461
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,519
[Correction: no one is more perfect for Guy than Faye. #GuyFaye]

462
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,599
[This isn’t just a ship. This is so canon. #GuyFaye]

463
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,280
[This isn’t a ship. This is a couple. #GuyFaye]

464
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,840
[Fake! #GuyFaye]

465
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,840
[They’re the real deal. Just wait and see. #GuyFaye]

466
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,080
Hey, you’re the kitty from campus.

467
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,560
How did you get here, kitty?

468
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
Did you follow me?

469
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,640
You want to come home with me, don’t you?

470
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,719
Come on, then.

471
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,320
Let’s go home.

472
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,320
I’m making you a new perfume.

473
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,720
It’s still going to be aquatic, but…

474
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,960
I’m not making this one as a friend.

475
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,920
Does this new perfume have a name?

476
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,920
No.

477
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,000
Why don’t you name it?

478
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,000
Hey, perfect timing. She can be your date for the Chem-Re Party.

479
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,440
Most couples come out with their relationship at this event.

480
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,720
Chem-Re Party is next week.

481
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,480
Do you want to wear a matching ring with me?

482
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,080
I don’t think I can promise you right now.

483
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,440
I have to talk to Faye first.

484
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,280
Is everything okay? You’re acting strange.

485
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,240
I don’t think Guy will fall for you.

486
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,159
Does he despise me?

487
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,480
He’s already dating someone else.

488
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Who?

489
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
Me.
