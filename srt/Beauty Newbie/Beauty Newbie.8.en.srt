1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,980
I’ll make you a hero.

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,259
Guy won’t be the only one keeping an eye on you.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,340
I will, as well.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,699
You said our costumes were too revealing.

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,380
Well, you didn’t do a much better job there, did you?

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,059
You told us to put something sexy on and said, “it sells.”

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,499
What do you think we are?

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
That’s too much.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,140
I know I thanked you for what happened at Lab Bar.

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,500
But I haven’t for Speed Date.

11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,260
You had to lie that you liked me to get me out of there, you know?

12
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,780
I like her.

13
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,219
New Caption

14
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,500
I meant what I said.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,980
I almost fell for it.

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,540
Your acting was quite good.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,316
Right.

18
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,300
I’m just kidding.

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,300
Let’s find a way to get out of here.

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
Liu.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,300
What if I’m not kidding?

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,340
If I really meant what I said, what would you do?

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,620
It’s hard to open the door.

24
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,980
We need to call someone to fix it.

25
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,020
True.

26
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,100
Oh, Liu. Guy.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,980
Did you two come here to watch the fireworks alone?

28
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,500
No, I accidentally dropped my glass on my shirt.

29
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,979
So I came here to look for a shirt to change.

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,339
The door was jammed.

31
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,580
Our phones’ batteries were dead.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,779
Unintentionally, you two were alone together when the fireworks started.

33
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,340
We should return the costumes to Saint.

34
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,180
They are in this box, right?

35
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,980
Yes.

36
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,499
Excuse me. I need to return this to Saint.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,619
Thank you for opening the door for us.

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,100
I should return it to Saint.

39
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,979
Liu.

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,596
Liu.

41
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,620
Liu.

42
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,340
Saint is here.

00:03:59,941 --> 00:04:04,861
[What you said in the student society’s office, you were kidding, right?]

45
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:08,501
[Are you really having feelings for me?]

46
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:15,741

[I want to explain what I said in the student society’s office.]

50
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:39,821
[I mean what I said.]

51

[Are you still awake? Can I call you?]

52
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:48,621
[Are you still awake?]

53
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,581
[How do you really feel about me?]

54
00:04:52,141 --> 00:04:55,541
[What happened in the student society’s office, let’s pretend it never happened.]

55
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:00,981

[I like you.]

00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,501
[Damned it.]

59
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:31,661
Why did he unsend it?

60
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:44,661
Hey.

61
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:48,621
Hey.

62
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:51,061
You woke up quite early.

63
00:05:52,701 --> 00:05:55,741
Yes. I have a morning class.

64
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:58,301
Me too.

65
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:02,381
We are in the same class.

66
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,461
- The weather is nice. - It looks like it’s going to rain.

67
00:06:32,821 --> 00:06:34,061
Yes, it looks like it’s going to rain.

68
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,061
But the weather is still nice.

69
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:43,861
Liu.

70
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:47,220
About yesterday, I…

71
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:50,021
We still don’t know yesterday’s final sales.

72
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:58,061
I forgot to ask Milin and Da about it.

73
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:04,261
I…

74
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,341
What happened in the student society’s office yesterday…

75
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:10,021
My ride is here.

76
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:12,101
See you at the university.

77
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,981
What’s up, loverboy?

78
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:37,901
Stop teasing me.

79
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,341
I’m not teasing you.

80
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:43,581
I saw you took Liu to watch the fireworks.

81
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:44,701
Did something happen?

82
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:48,661
I have something I want to talk to you about.

83
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,940
What?

84
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:51,541
What kind of wedding should you have?

85
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:54,700
Nonsense.

86
00:07:54,701 --> 00:07:55,821
What?

87
00:07:58,501 --> 00:07:59,501
Liu.

88
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:00,821
Faye.

89
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:03,181
I’m sorry for passing out yesterday.

90
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,701
Everything went chaotic because of me.

91
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:08,020
It’s okay. I should be the one who apologizes for your passing out.

92
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:09,621
Are you feeling better?

93
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:13,620
I want to ask you to thank Guy for me

94
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:16,261
and the other guy who brought my stuff to me.

95
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:18,701
Do you mean Saint?

96
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,821
He was with me until I woke up.

97
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:25,141
Did he say anything about me?

98
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,101
I haven’t talked to him since yesterday.

99
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:31,461
Really?

100
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:35,141
I thought he rushed out to watch the fireworks with you.

101
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,821
I didn’t watch it with him.

102
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,341
Who were you with?

103
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,541
Let’s go to the classroom.

104
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,501
Faye. Liu.

105
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,781
We saved the seats for you.

106
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:16,501
Faye, how are you feeling?

107
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,180
I’m okay.

108
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,541
It was too bad that I didn’t get to see everyone’s cool actions.

109
00:09:21,581 --> 00:09:23,621
Yeah, it’s too bad that I wasn’t a part of it.

110
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:26,381
Many things happened yesterday.

111
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:27,821
There were also strange things.

112
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,060
Right, Mimi?

113
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,420
No, nothing strange happened.

114
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,940
I didn’t watch the fireworks with anyone.

115
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:33,981
Mimi.

116
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,581
I mean it. I went straight home.

117
00:09:35,621 --> 00:09:37,380
I didn’t see the Sakura-shaped fireworks.

118
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:38,821
I didn’t see it.

119
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:41,141
Okay, I’ll come back to you later.

120
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:44,181
The strangest thing is them.

121
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:46,980
Don’t you think Mork looks different?

122
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:50,341
His dressing style looks familiar.

123
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,221
Yes, it looks very familiar.

124
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:55,701
But I can’t think where I’ve seen it.

125
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,101
Mork.

126
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:59,901
Are you trying to copy someone’s dressing style?

127
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:01,901
Whose style?

128
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:04,621
I’ve been dressing in this style for a while.

129
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,421
Oh.

130
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:21,221
Did you buy it from the Spring Day channel?

131
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:23,701
Are you also following Gale?

132
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,741
You also bought your clothes from her channel, right?

133
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:31,260
How was your trip to Koh Tao?

134
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,541
The water was crystal clear.

135
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:35,541
I’ll ask you to go with me next time.

136
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,021
Let’s go together.

137
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:45,421
Hey.

138
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:47,021
I think it is over.

139
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,021
I don’t think it’s that bad.

140
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:50,461
Really?

141
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:54,901
I think she just doesn’t know how to act around you.

142
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,221
You need to make your move now.

143
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,501
Make her know that you are serious with her.

144
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:03,381
Otherwise, it’s going to be too late.

145
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,381
Are you talking about Saint?

146
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:08,861
It’s not just about him.

147
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,340
This is what’s happening.

148
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:14,900
People are not only buzzing about what happened at Lab Bar yesterday.

149
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:17,661
They are also talking about the hashtag #GuyFaye.

150
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:18,541
Look.

151
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,740
[Guy is a knight in shining armor. #GuyFaye]

152
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:23,260
[They kept looking at each other yesterday. Today, they take care of each other.]

153
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:25,740
[Guy is very protective of Faye.] [Look at the way he looks at Faye. He must be worried about her.]

154
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:27,940
[They are a match made in heaven.]

155
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:29,340
[I think they are a real couple.]

156
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:33,101
Saint was the one who carried her out but why do they ship me with her?

157
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:36,781
Shippers can imagine things out of a small gesture.

158
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,701
Look at Mork.

159
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:42,461
He’s copying your dressing style.

160
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:45,821
Do you think why he’s doing that?

161
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:49,421
Because he thinks he can get Faye’s attention if he copies you.

162
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:56,181
Now people think you like Faye, not Liu.

163
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:59,421
I did a speed dating with Liu yesterday.

164
00:11:59,461 --> 00:12:01,061
Why did no one talk about it?

165
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,061
They did talk about it.

166
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,381
This is what they said.

167
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:07,580
[Guy must love Faye so much that he sacrificed himself to help her friend out of the speed dating. #GuyFaye]

168
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,620
[I thought they were dating for real. I was bummed. The only girl he should date is Faye. #GuyFaye]

169
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:10,740
Look.

170
00:12:10,741 --> 00:12:12,701
The buzz on social media is against you two.

171
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:14,700
If you are hesitating and don’t make any moves,

172
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:18,461
I think she will misunderstand you.

173
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:20,060
What should I do?

174
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,701
She keeps avoiding me.

175
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:23,821
Find a way to ask her out.

176
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:26,101
You must ask her out on a date.

177
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,581
Okay.

178
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,141
Liu.

179
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:49,901
Can I talk to you alone?

180
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:56,021
I’m sorry. We have a meeting with a professor.

181
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:58,021
Can we talk in the lab class?

182
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:02,901
Hey.

183
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:05,260
Do you know that she has a chatting app?

184
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:06,941
You can text her.

185
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:11,060
I want to see her face when she gives me the answer.

186
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:13,661
Oh.

187
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:26,861
[Do you want to have dinner with me this Saturday?]

188
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:41,461
I forgot to bring my lab coat.

189
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:43,381
I’ll go borrow it.

190
00:13:54,261 --> 00:13:55,781
You can use mine.

191
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:59,461
Are you sure?

192
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,061
Yes, I’ll go get another one.

193
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:05,421
Thank you.

194
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:20,741
I’ll put these back.

195
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,701
I forgot something in the pocket of my lab coat.

196
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,581
Can you get it for me?

197
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:36,021
I’m about to return it to you.

198
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,701
Take it.

199
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:04,741
[Top 10 most romantic places for dates]

200
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:21,381
Do you want to go have dinner with me?

201
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,740
I’m not talking about today.

202
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:29,101
I mean when we both have free time.

203
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:31,181
How about this Saturday?

204
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,061
It doesn’t have to be a meal. We can go to a café.

205
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,740
I am browsing through the internet and see many interesting restaurants.

206
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:39,741
This one got a 4.7-star rating.

207
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:46,061
That sounds interesting.

208
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:48,941
This restaurant?

209
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,500
I’ve been wanting to visit it.

210
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:51,941
I’m hungry.

211
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:53,341
What do you think?

212
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:54,901
Shall we all go together?

213
00:15:54,941 --> 00:15:55,557
Wait.

214
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,701
- I’m not asking you. - Hey.

215
00:15:56,741 --> 00:15:58,140
Why did you say that?

216
00:15:58,141 --> 00:15:59,461
You asked me.

217
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,501
Didn’t he?

218
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:01,477
Yes.

219
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,461
It’s a good idea that we all go together.

220
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:04,501
It will be fun.

221
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:07,861
How do we go there?

222
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,781
Shall we take my car?

223
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,221
I just bought it.

224
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:14,781
I’ll put my stuff back in my room.

225
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:17,181
Sure.

226
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:24,181
What?

227
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:26,300
What’s with the face?

228
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,101
Stop pretending like you don’t know.

229
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,980
You know that I’m trying to ask her out on a date.

230
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,341
Yes, I do.

231
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:34,781
Why did you get in my way?

232
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,220
No, I didn’t.

233
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:38,221
I was trying to help you.

234
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:40,221
She was about to say no to you.

235
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:41,901
Say no?

236
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:45,661
You asked her to go out this Saturday, didn’t you?

237
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:47,421
She is busy this Saturday.

238
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,221
So she was going to say no to you.

239
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,221
How did you know that she is busy?

240
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:56,021
Because she is going out with me.

241
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,661
[There is an interesting event. Do you want to go with me?]

242
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,660
A perfumery contest was opened earlier this year.

243
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:16,021
Did you know about it?

244
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:21,221
The judges will gather at the perfume museum to select the winner.

245
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:23,501
They asked me to join them.

246
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,101
I think you may want to go with me.

247
00:17:25,141 --> 00:17:26,461
So I called to ask you.

248
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:28,781
Has the museum been opened?

249
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:33,821
Yes, but it’s not an official opening.

250
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:35,261
When is the event?

251
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:39,140
This Saturday.

252
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,940
Are you free that day?

253
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,381
Yes, I’m going with you.

254
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:43,341
Great.

255
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:47,300
Don’t forget to dress up and wear a nice perfume.

256
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:48,821
You will meet experts in the field.

257
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,101
You need to make a good impression on them.

258
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:51,901
Yes.

259
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,640
She seems to be excited about our date this Saturday.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,880
I think she may start to have feelings for me.

261
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,040
Are you okay?

262
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,240
Girls.

263
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,240
Can you help me pick a perfume?

264
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,000
I have an important appointment this Saturday.

265
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Hey.

266
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,200
She seems to be serious about it.

267
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,360
She’s not that serious.

268
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,440
She took only three perfumes for them to choose from.

269
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,880
I think these perfumes are for teenagers.

270
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,239
Do you have any perfumes that smell more mature?

271
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,320
Mature?

272
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,720
Liu, what are you doing?

273
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,640
I’m buying a new perfume.

274
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,159
You are buying a new perfume?

275
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,480
Why are you serious about it?

276
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,760
Do you still think that she’s not serious about it?

277
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,400
Yes.

278
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,880
Where are you going to wear the perfume?

279
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,720
I have an important appointment this Saturday.

280
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,240
You are so serious about it.

281
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,120
Are you having a date?

282
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,000
No, I’m going to the perfume museum.

283
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,800
Are you having a date at the museum?

284
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
That sounds so romantic.

285
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,959
I want to go with you.

286
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,040
Mimi, you can go anywhere except on her date.

287
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,039
He will take her to the perfume museum for the date.

288
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Saint is so smart.

289
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,920
I guess my friend is out of the game.

290
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,240
Why do you have to rub salt into my wound?

291
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,319
I think you have two options right now.

292
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Firstly, give up.

293
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,680
Secondly, choose a better place for a date than the perfume museum.

294
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,280
Of course, I have to choose the second option.

295
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,047
I have so much to discuss with you.

296
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:44,487
Let’s have a meeting to talk about the perfume later.

297
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:45,527
Gun.

298
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:47,423
Hello.

299
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,087
I’m talking about you.

300
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:50,607
You will complete your degree soon.

301
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:52,607
Are you preparing to found your own company?

302
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:55,286
I’m not ready yet.

303
00:21:55,287 --> 00:21:56,687
There are many things I need to do.

304
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,807
I took a friend with me today.

305
00:22:01,807 --> 00:22:02,807
Here she is.

306
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:06,127
This is Liu. She’s my junior at the university.

307
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:07,566
Hello.

308
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:08,847
She is the owner of Liu’s Scent page on Facebook.

309
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:11,727
Right. The Facebook page about perfumes.

310
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,487
I’m your follower.

311
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,566
Your articles are great.

312
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,086
I found many of them interesting.

313
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,406
Thank you.

314
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:21,406
You have quite a large collection of perfumes.

315
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,007
I saw many classic perfumes.

316
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,807
I’m trying to collect as many perfumes as I can.

317
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:29,006
Please feel free to look around and see if there are any perfumes you like.

318
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:31,286
If there are any perfumes you want to try, please let me know.

319
00:22:31,287 --> 00:22:31,783
Thank you.

320
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:32,807
Sure.

321
00:22:58,287 --> 00:23:00,047
How is it?

322
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,087
Are you interested in any perfumes in particular?

323
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:04,047
Chevalier de la Nuit.

324
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:07,127
I can’t believe that you have it.

325
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:10,007
The Knight of the Night.

326
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:14,487
The shape of the bottle resembles a knight's armor.

327
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:18,127
The glass cap resembles a knight’s helmet decorated with feathers.

328
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:21,247
I accidentally found it.

329
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:24,167
It was hidden among other perfumes in a shop in an old market.

330
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:26,967
When I spotted it, I immediately bought it.

331
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:28,327
What does it smell like?

332
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,087
Its smell?

333
00:23:30,127 --> 00:23:31,806
Use your imagination.

334
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:34,607
It smells like flower scents at night.

335
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:39,647
When a woman wears it, she will feel like she is protected by a knight who shows

336
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:41,006
her respect.

337
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:42,566
Chevaliers have codes of chivalry.

338
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,767
They need to show women respect.

339
00:23:44,807 --> 00:23:46,687
This one is also interesting.

340
00:23:48,007 --> 00:23:52,367
This is Clarence. I bought it from France.

341
00:23:53,087 --> 00:23:54,367
Please feel free to look around.

342
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:55,967
I’ll talk to you later.

343
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,647
Saint.

344
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:01,167
The perfumes that I sent you.

345
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,327
Do you like any of them?

346
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:06,567
I like a few of them.

347
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:08,327
But I’m not going to tell you which ones.

348
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:13,127
Is she your girlfriend?

349
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:14,327
No.

350
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:15,967
I shouldn’t call her your girlfriend.

351
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:18,127
Because you always date many girls at the same time.

352
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:22,326
When will I be free from the accusation?

353
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,806
You have dated many women but you have never introduced any of them to me.

354
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:28,047
This is the first one you introduced to me.

355
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,007
I guess you have changed.

356
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,567
It’s true that I’m serious with her.

357
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:37,447
But I didn’t take her here to introduce to you as my date.

358
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:42,167
I want you to look at her as a future perfumer.

359
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,167
Are you serious?

360
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:58,567
The first perfume is Mae Jam Richful by Kwanreuk Chatthongdee.

361
00:24:58,607 --> 00:24:59,607
Please write it down.

362
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:14,567
You can comment on it.

363
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:16,767
It will have a slight influence on my evaluation.

364
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:17,807
Really?

365
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:18,967
Yes.

366
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:23,367
What are your opinions about it?

367
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:29,567
It has a great base note.

368
00:25:29,607 --> 00:25:31,527
Can you share it with me?

369
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:40,567
I think it has a great base note.

370
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:48,207
The scent reminds me of grass fields, earth, and rain.

371
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:51,527
It’s the scent of a season in Thailand.

372
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:54,207
It smells like a rice field in the morning.

373
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,286
Interesting.

374
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:57,223
Right?

375
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:59,727
But I think something is missing.

376
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:06,687
I think it smells more like aromatherapy oil than a fine perfume.

377
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:14,767
If you have something to say, just say it.

378
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:22,367
I think it lacks a twist to give complexity to the scent of this perfume.

379
00:26:22,407 --> 00:26:25,287
Probably the scent of sunlight.

380
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:26,967
Sunlight.

381
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:33,846
If we add the scent of sunlight by adding black pepper.

382
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:38,207
It will give a glowing and sparkling scent to it.

383
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:44,287
Or you can use Hedione to add a luminous scent to the perfume.

384
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:46,886
It can help enhance our imagination.

385
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:51,527
I mean it will be great if it has a scent conveying sunlight or rainbow.

386
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:54,887
I agree.

387
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:00,167
The scent of sunlight?

388
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:02,726
Did I do well?

389
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:05,927
Am I good enough to work as a perfumer at your company?

390
00:27:05,967 --> 00:27:10,687
If you can create a perfume that reminds people of sunlight,

391
00:27:12,127 --> 00:27:16,007
I think it will have good sales.

392
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,287
Are we going to become rich?

393
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:21,327
Did you say “we’?

394
00:27:21,887 --> 00:27:24,286
You bought my idea.

395
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:25,727
Aren’t you going to hire me?

396
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:28,246
You need to complete your degree first.

397
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,687
Why are you in such a hurry?

398
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,127
One more thing,

399
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:35,127
When you complete your degree,

400
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:37,607
you may have other options apart from my company.

401
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:39,127
Really?

402
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:45,327
At today’s event, there were two experts and two entrepreneurs in the perfume industry.

403
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:49,687
The perfumery contest is a place where entrepreneurs come to search for perfumers.

404
00:27:51,047 --> 00:27:56,767
I think they not only met perfumers through the perfumes but also in person.

405
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:01,927
Moreover,

406
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:04,487
I don’t think I am your only choice.

407
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:09,007
Are you saying you won’t hire me?

408
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,487
I’m the one who is afraid that you may not choose me.

409
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:14,887
What are you talking about?

410
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:18,647
Guy confessed his love to you, didn’t he?

411
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:25,167
In the office, while you were watching the fireworks.

412
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:29,687
You had to lie that you liked me to get me out of there, you know?

413
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:31,687
I wasn’t lying.

414
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:32,847
I meant what I said.

415
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,687
From what I see,

416
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,687
I think you also feel the same way.

417
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:44,487
Liu.

418
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:46,287
Saint is here.

419
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:54,047
That’s why you don’t know how to act around him.

420
00:28:56,327 --> 00:28:57,327
I…

421
00:28:57,887 --> 00:28:59,407
Do you want to make infused water?

422
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:04,607
Yes.

423
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:07,647
You can choose the ingredients as you like.

424
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:08,727
You can use everything.

425
00:29:08,767 --> 00:29:11,607
I’ll go prepare the equipment for you.

426
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,407
It looks like you want to relieve stress.

427
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:35,527
Why?

428
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:38,087
Why do you feel stressed after receiving a love confession?

429
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,927
I thought that was a good thing for you.

430
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:46,527
It was good.

431
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,007
I was so happy when I heard it.

432
00:29:52,247 --> 00:29:54,247
To be honest,

433
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:58,647
my heart was fluttering when we were doing speed dating.

434
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:02,127
I like her.

435
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:08,887
When I thanked him for helping me out,

436
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:13,207
I thought he would say it was not a big deal.

437
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,207
I would have suppressed my feelings.

438
00:30:16,847 --> 00:30:19,047
I didn’t expect him to say that he meant it.

439
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:27,687
I thought that I felt fluttered because I received a love confession.

440
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,727
But after thinking about it,

441
00:30:33,127 --> 00:30:34,407
I think

442
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:39,207
since I have known him,

443
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:46,206
no matter how terribly I treated him

444
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:49,047
You just won’t stop ruining my life, will you?

445
00:30:49,087 --> 00:30:50,926
Or when I gave him the cold shoulder

446
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,967
Stay away from me.

447
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:58,247
But Guy has never abandoned me.

448
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:06,727
He always protects me as much as he can.

449
00:31:07,487 --> 00:31:10,287
There were many times that he was injured because of me.

450
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:13,207
No matter what happens,

451
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:17,727
He does his best to be there for me.

452
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,367
He always listens to me

453
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,967
and tries to be a better person.

454
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:27,207
He is the kind of person

455
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:30,927
who can easily make people fall in love with him

456
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,247
without realizing it.

457
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:42,127
I’m falling for him.

458
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:49,047
I don’t know when it started.

459
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:52,887
I can’t tell how it began.

460
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,647
Before I realized it,

461
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:00,487
I already fell hard for him.

462
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:04,687
That sounds like a good thing.

463
00:32:06,127 --> 00:32:07,127
Right?

464
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:12,367
I should be very happy right now.

465
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:20,087
The person that I have feelings for confessed his love to me.

466
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:23,167
I also feel the same way as him.

467
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:29,247
But I can’t date him.

468
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:34,087
It’s better for him this way.

469
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:39,214
Why can’t you date him?

470
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:45,414
Because I know what will happen

471
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:49,694
if we fall in love and start dating.

472
00:32:51,694 --> 00:32:53,694
What do you think will happen?

473
00:32:55,614 --> 00:32:58,974
The same thing that happened when I was young.

474
00:33:03,294 --> 00:33:05,134
I used to have a friend.

475
00:33:06,414 --> 00:33:07,694
His name was Pun.

476
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:12,454
He was a good friend.

477
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:16,814
He was helping me in every way he could.

478
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:18,174
I’ll pair up with you on this assignment.

479
00:33:21,814 --> 00:33:23,414
It was my fault.

480
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:26,094
I developed feelings for him.

481
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:33,373
You two look good together.

482
00:33:33,374 --> 00:33:35,774
The kind mortician and the ghost face.

483
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:39,214
After that,

484
00:33:40,094 --> 00:33:42,014
instead of being friends,

485
00:33:46,294 --> 00:33:48,214
we could not have any kind of relationship.

486
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:49,654
I’m transferring him to another school.

487
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:51,654
I made up my mind.

488
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:54,094
He had never been involved in a fight.

489
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:56,614
But lately, he got into many fights.

490
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,454
Pun.

491
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:08,654
He didn’t do anything wrong.

492
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:11,494
He was just being nice to me.

493
00:34:14,574 --> 00:34:17,934
Guy also didn’t do anything wrong. He’s just being nice to me.

494
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:23,174
But things will get complicated because of me.

495
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:26,093
But now things have…

496
00:34:26,094 --> 00:34:27,374
I know what you try to say.

497
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:31,014
Things have changed.

498
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,534
I’m not called a ghost face anymore.

499
00:34:36,934 --> 00:34:39,094
Guy won’t be teased like Pun was.

500
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:44,414
The thing that has changed is my looks.

501
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:49,614
But the thing that remains unchanged is…

502
00:34:52,654 --> 00:34:56,054
[Guy isn’t that dumb to date Liu. She’s all plastic.]

503
00:34:56,774 --> 00:34:58,934
people will keep saying that I’m not a good match for him.

504
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:06,254
I know that Guy won’t pay attention to those words.

505
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:12,214
But we don’t know what will happen.

506
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:19,614
Guy finally stops using violence.

507
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:24,414
He may start doing it again

508
00:35:26,734 --> 00:35:28,414
though he doesn’t want to.

509
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:32,414
I’ve never thought about it.

510
00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:37,294
But now I started to worry that I may turn out to be like my dad one day.

511
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,094
Saint.

512
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:46,574
I like him so much.

513
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:53,814
I like him so much that I want to protect him.

514
00:35:57,014 --> 00:36:00,894
I want him to become the man he wants to be.

515
00:36:03,214 --> 00:36:05,894
I don’t want to be the one who pushes him to use violence again.

516
00:36:08,574 --> 00:36:10,694
If I like him this much,

517
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:16,213
I should protect him

518
00:36:16,214 --> 00:36:19,814
in the same way that he has been protecting me, right?

519
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:29,494
That’s why I try to not cross the line more than I already did.

520
00:36:31,294 --> 00:36:32,414
At least,

521
00:36:33,934 --> 00:36:39,614
I won’t lose him the way I lost my good friend, right?

522
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:47,734
That’s why I keep avoiding him.

523
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:49,854
Liu.

524
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:51,854
Can I talk to you alone?

525
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:56,214
I’m sorry. We have a meeting with a professor.

526
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:58,214
Can we talk in the lab class?

527
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,734
Do we have a meeting with a professor?

528
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:03,054
You can use mine.

529
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,534
[Do you want to have dinner with me this Saturday?]

530
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:26,414
Can’t you secretly date him?

531
00:37:28,774 --> 00:37:32,014
I want him to be happy.

532
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:35,374
I don’t want him to have worries like me.

533
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:41,414
Are you sure you want to give up on him?

534
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:43,334
Yes.

535
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:50,573
I believe if you tell him your reason,

536
00:37:50,574 --> 00:37:52,574
he will never give up on you.

537
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,454
He’s not a quitter.

538
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:01,774
Even if you try to push him away,

539
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:06,734
he will come back to you as a new person and you’ll fall even harder for him.

540
00:38:16,454 --> 00:38:19,214
This is your idea for an amazing date?

541
00:38:19,734 --> 00:38:21,734
If you take her to your old school,

542
00:38:22,454 --> 00:38:24,334
I think she’s going to feel more depressed.

543
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:27,174
Her life in the past was depressing.

544
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:29,174
She never had a chance to live her life.

545
00:38:29,894 --> 00:38:32,094
I want to take her back here.

546
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:35,334
So she will have a chance to live the life that she didn’t have at this school.

547
00:40:01,814 --> 00:40:06,614
[Let’s go create new memories together.]

548
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:30,054
(Are you sure you can keep pushing him away?)

549
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:43,414
[There are seven photos left in the film. Let’s take them together.]

550
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:47,054
(Are you sure you can push him back to the friend zone?)

551
00:40:56,814 --> 00:41:01,734
Guy wants to take me back to our old school to live the life I didn’t have.

552
00:41:02,094 --> 00:41:03,934
He wants to replace my old memories with new ones.

553
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:07,134
It must be hard for you.

554
00:41:10,254 --> 00:41:12,494
I don’t know what to do.

555
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:15,734
Liu.

556
00:41:17,454 --> 00:41:19,334
You know this, right?

557
00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:21,534
Whatever happened in your past,

558
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:24,734
you still have a right to find love.

559
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:27,934
Really?

560
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:34,094
I don’t want your past to make you think that you don’t have a right to fall in love.

561
00:41:34,134 --> 00:41:35,574
You have that right.

562
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:41,774
But I don’t want to cause trouble to anyone.

563
00:41:44,454 --> 00:41:48,054
What if that person won’t be troubled by it?

564
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:54,854
What if that person is not viewed as a flawless person?

565
00:41:55,534 --> 00:41:59,854
Everyone views him as a player and a womanizer

566
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:03,134
who is flirting around and cannot be trusted.

567
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:05,014
Wait.

568
00:42:05,854 --> 00:42:07,174
Please hear me out.

569
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:11,894
I have never dated more than one woman at the same time.

570
00:42:13,254 --> 00:42:18,494
I don’t get why everyone keeps thinking of me that way.

571
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:21,853
They say any woman who chooses to date me will run into problems.

572
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:23,253
She will not find happiness.

573
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,294
We will end up breaking up.

574
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:30,414
See? I’m also dealing with the same thing as you.

575
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:34,414
Saint, are you saying…

576
00:42:35,174 --> 00:42:36,174
Yes.

577
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:41,134
If you want Guy to back down

578
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:44,614
and give up on his hope to step up his relationship with you.

579
00:42:44,654 --> 00:42:47,414
If you want to have a good reason to tell him

580
00:42:47,454 --> 00:42:49,814
without lying that you don’t love him,

581
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:54,134
I think this is a good solution.

582
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:59,173
Are you saying that we should pretend to date?

583
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:00,174
No.

584
00:43:01,254 --> 00:43:02,894
We will not pretend to date.

585
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:06,054
I want to date you for real.

586
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,533
It may sound strange to you.

587
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:11,534
But…

588
00:43:12,494 --> 00:43:17,094
You don’t like me enough to feel bad if you have to cut me out of your life.

589
00:43:17,734 --> 00:43:21,414
Why don’t you use this chance to fall in love?

590
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:29,974
You are worried about what other people will say about you dating him.

591
00:43:30,614 --> 00:43:34,294
If you date me who everyone thinks is a bad person

592
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:37,934
People may say that we are a good match.

593
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:45,294
Because they think we both are damaged goods.

594
00:43:46,254 --> 00:43:48,174
But I don’t think this is a good thing for you.

595
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:49,454
Why?

596
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:52,974
You just confess to me that you like Guy.

597
00:43:53,654 --> 00:43:57,134
This means I barely stand a chance with you.

598
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:04,414
This is the only chance I will get from you.

599
00:44:08,414 --> 00:44:10,134
This chance.

600
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:15,734
Can you give it to me?

601
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:21,894
Will you date me?

602
00:44:35,793 --> 00:44:37,433
Should I ask her out again?

603
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:41,592
You wanna try?

604
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:42,993
I’ll exchange some coins.

605
00:44:43,633 --> 00:44:44,633
It’s okay.

606
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:45,553
Do you want to give it a try?

607
00:44:45,554 --> 00:44:47,473
No. You go for it.

608
00:44:47,633 --> 00:44:48,633
Do you like it?

609
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:50,193
Take it.

610
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:51,832
I’m going to the toilet.

611
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:53,473
I just want it to be a good day.

612
00:44:53,513 --> 00:44:55,033
Why can’t you just give me a chance?

613
00:44:55,353 --> 00:44:57,113
Don’t tell me you’re already dating Saint.

614
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:01,609
It’s alright now.

615
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:05,232
I feel like he’s trying to be nice to console you.

616
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:06,233
Huh?
