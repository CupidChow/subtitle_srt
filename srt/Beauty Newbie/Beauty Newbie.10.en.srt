1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,769
Sir, how much would you sell me this one?

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:05,099
I think she’s already won it, though.

3
00:00:07,747 --> 00:00:08,616
We’re ruining it by mixing it together, aren’t we?

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,729 --> 00:00:11,400
Thank you, Liu.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,040
If it wasn’t for you, Guy wouldn’t have become so mature.

7
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:16,502
Why?

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
I…

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,480
I think I’m in love with Guy.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,280
I’m sorry.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,680
I’m really worried about this lately.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,440
I want to talk to you about it.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,520
Do you think it’s strange that I’m in love with Guy?

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,560
No.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,560
I’ve just never noticed that you feel this way about him.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,320
You can say that it’s strange.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,760
I get it.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,800
Actually, it started on the night of the first day of the campus fair.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,120
You left early so you probably don’t know what happened.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,120
The boys had a drinking duel to win me.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,800
I felt terrible that they did that to me.

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,160
But Guy…

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,880
You can’t do this to Faye.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,680
I was shocked that he stepped up to protect me.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,360
Though it was only a short moment,

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,760
he made me feel safe.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,320
Do you think what I said is nonsense?

28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,400
No.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,880
This is why I want you to be the first one to know.

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,760
I know that you will understand the feelings that I have for him.

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,800
I hope that you will help me.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,320
You are close to him but I’m not.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,400
Can you help me get close to him?

34
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,720

[BASED ON LINE WEBTOON “MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY” BY KI MAENGGI]

39
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,400
Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

40
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,440
This episode contains a scene depicting an eating disorder that some viewers may find disturbing. Viewer discretion is advised.

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,120
[I just noticed that Guy secretly looked at Faye. He must have feelings for him. I’m sure. #GuyFaye] (Other people may think it’s nonsense that I need your help.)

42
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,600
[They just walk past each other but look sweetly into the eyes. They are lovebirds. #GuyFaye]

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,800
(But you know that my relationship with him is bad.)

44
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,040
(Liu, you are the only one who knows how to win his heart.)

45
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
Oh, you are here.

46
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:28,096
I was waiting for you at the dorm for a while.

47
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,096
I thought you would come to school with me.

48
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,376
I’m sorry.

49
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,736
I didn’t know that you would wait for me.

50
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:34,816
I got up early this morning.

51
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:37,416
So I left early because I didn’t have anything to do at home.

52
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:40,496
Yesterday was great.

53
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:44,336
Are you talking about the movie for our assignment?

54
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:49,416
I’ll draft the paper and send it to you.

55
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,416
I’m talking about something else.

56
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:52,976
I mean overall.

57
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:56,056
I’ve never had that kind of conversation with my mom.

58
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,856
I’ve never known that you are worried about me.

59
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:04,976
It’s almost time for class.

60
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:06,415
I need to go to the bathroom first.

61
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,136
I’ll see you in class.

62
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:15,296
Okay, everyone. Today, we will learn about titration.

63
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:17,015
You need a partner to do this experiment.

64
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,295
I’ll give you time to find your partner before we start.

65
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:22,296
I’ll be right back.

66
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:32,456
I don’t want to be Guy’s partner anymore.

67
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:34,536
Liu, do you want to switch your lab partner?

68
00:05:34,576 --> 00:05:35,656
Let’s do things differently.

69
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:36,592
Really?

70
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:39,176
That’s great. I want to be Guy’s partner.

71
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:43,216
I mean…

72
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:47,016
You said you want to do things differently.

73
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,296
You can pair up with Liu. I’ll pair up with Guy.

74
00:05:49,336 --> 00:05:50,616
But I don’t want to pair up with you.

75
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:52,296
How could you say that?

76
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,696
You are so mean.

77
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:57,616
Let’s change things to get a sense of refreshment.

78
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:11,496
Right. I’m okay to pair up with Ann.

79
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:20,976
Good luck.

80
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:24,056
Thanks.

81
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:40,736
I’ll do it.

82
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,696
No. I’ll do it.

83
00:06:43,896 --> 00:06:45,176
He is a gentleman.

84
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:47,736
It’s okay. I’ll do it.

85
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:53,296
Now, the classroom has turned into a romantic scene.

86
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:56,136
Don’t say things that aren’t true.

87
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,216
Right.

88
00:06:57,256 --> 00:06:59,856
Stop talking about the thing that is impossible.

89
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:02,296
How could you say that is a romantic scene?

90
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:04,296
Don’t touch it. You will break it.

91
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:05,472
I want to try it.

92
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:07,896
Guy just doesn’t trust Faye.

93
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:11,216
Mork, why are you so pessimistic?

94
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,616
They can become a real couple one day.

95
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:17,976
Mimi, have you ever seen him doing anything alone?

96
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:20,176
He always respects other people.

97
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:23,576
He’s doing this because he doesn’t trust her.

98
00:07:23,616 --> 00:07:27,576
Mork, are you trying to ruin the ship?

99
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:31,776
The more you try to ship them, the worse things will be.

100
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:34,896
Guy will get annoyed and try to shut Faye out.

101
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:38,776
He doesn’t like to be told what to do.

102
00:07:40,056 --> 00:07:44,496
Faye’s fans are now turning to be Guy’s fans.

103
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:46,296
Things change so fast.

104
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:48,576
You are so smart.

105
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:52,456
If you are a bit smarter, only for a little.

106
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:55,416
You will know why Guy will never develop any feelings for Faye.

107
00:07:55,456 --> 00:07:57,416
It’s because Faye likes me.

108
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,056
Right.

109
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,136
I’m leaving now, Liu.

110
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:15,856
Guy.

111
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:18,576
Can you give me a minute?

112
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:20,496
What do you want?

113
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:24,216
I want to talk to you.

114
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:26,336
It won’t take long.

115
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,336
Fine.

116
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,696
Hey, Kitty.

117
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,256
Come and play with it.

118
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,696
Kitty, say hi to Guy.

119
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:51,016
What do you want from me?

120
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,496
What did you know?

121
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:55,216
What are you talking about?

122
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:57,896
I just want to get close to you.

123
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:00,456
This will be good for Liu.

124
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:05,296
You know that she feels uncomfortable when she sees us on bad terms.

125
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,336
Are you sure it’s about that?

126
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,136
Yes.

127
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:15,376
I know that it’s awkward for you to suddenly befriend me.

128
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,376
That’s why I took you here.

129
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,376
We can start our friendship from here.

130
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,696
So you won’t feel pressured.

131
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,695
You don’t have to be my friend now.

132
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,976
But we both can befriend with this kitty.

133
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:35,176
I saw that you often like cat videos on social media.

134
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:39,856
Come on, Guy. Why don’t you pat it? It’s cute.

135
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:44,176
You need to stop doing this stupid thing.

136
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,336
You know that I’m allergic to cats.

137
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,456
I didn’t know it.

138
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:52,016
I thought we could become friends if I did this.

139
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,696
There’s no way that I will be your friend.

140
00:09:57,736 --> 00:10:00,296
Can you leave me and Liu alone?

141
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:20,096
Did your “kitty” plan work?

142
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,856
I shouldn’t have made a move on him.

143
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:26,896
He misunderstood me and thought I was trying to tease him.

144
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,416
How would I know that he’s allergic to cats?

145
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:32,136
I saw he liked funny cat videos.

146
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:37,416
I’m sorry that I didn’t warn you about it

147
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:39,856
though I promised that I would help you.

148
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:41,256
It’s okay.

149
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:44,936
It was my fault that I did it without consulting with you first.

150
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:49,736
That was because when I asked you to help me…

151
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:52,936
Can you help me get close to him?

152
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:56,256
You seemed hesitant.

153
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,976
So I decided to try to do it by myself.

154
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:02,296
With what happened today,

155
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:07,496
I now understand why you were hesitant.

156
00:11:09,056 --> 00:11:14,336
It’s because you know that it’s impossible for Guy to like me.

157
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:16,336
That’s why you don’t want to help me.

158
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:18,295
It’s not like that.

159
00:11:18,296 --> 00:11:20,136
I was hesitant because…

160
00:11:20,176 --> 00:11:21,616
I know.

161
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:24,776
I’m not good enough for him.

162
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:27,296
No.

163
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:29,296
You don’t need to comfort me.

164
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:30,736
I get it.

165
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:35,776
Although everyone thinks I am beautiful, smart, and nice.

166
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,976
In his eyes,

167
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:42,256
I’m just a foolish girl.

168
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:51,696
I think I should go home and try to get over him.

169
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:56,696
This way, you will no longer feel bad for me.

170
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:02,376
The girl that he likes will never be me.

171
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:11,016
I wasn’t lying.

172
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:12,656
I meant what I said.

173
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,536
If you want Guy to back down.

174
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:20,296
If you want to have a good reason to tell him

175
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:22,896
without lying that you don’t like him,

176
00:12:22,936 --> 00:12:24,736
I think this is a good solution.

177
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:27,416
I think I’m in love with Guy.

178
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:50,856
Faye.

179
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,936
Don’t give up yet.

180
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:00,936
I’ll help you.

181
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,136
Really?

182
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:05,615
Do you really mean it?

183
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:06,352
Yes.

184
00:13:06,376 --> 00:13:07,496
Really?

185
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:10,576
Thank you

186
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:36,176
Are you free today?

187
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:37,936
Yes.

188
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:39,376
Yes.

189
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,256
I want to ask you to dine out with me.

190
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:45,336
Dine out?

191
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,136
Sure.

192
00:13:47,176 --> 00:13:48,576
Are we going right now?

193
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,736
Yes, we can go now.

194
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:55,296
I have a coupon for a buy 1 get 1 free promotion at the restaurant that we went to the other day.

195
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,376
Are you hungry?

196
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,312
Yes.

197
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,336
I’m starving.

198
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:17,576
Spaghetti carbonara and cream sauce salad.

199
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:18,616
Yes.

200
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:25,735
I thought you would order a meat dish.

201
00:14:25,736 --> 00:14:27,496
You usually don’t eat salad.

202
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:30,296
I want to try something new.

203
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,296
I want to eat healthy food.

204
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:36,616
After finishing the meal, do you have any plans?

205
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:39,016
Can you go shopping with me?

206
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:42,136
What do you want to buy?

207
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:47,496
Plates, cutlery, glasses, and…

208
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,416
I’m not sure.

209
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,536
But I know that you can help me.

210
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:54,336
Oh.

211
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:57,295
What a coincidence.

212
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,336
Faye.

213
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:00,535
You came here alone?

214
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,336
Yes.

215
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:05,336
Guy.

216
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,176
I’m sorry about yesterday.

217
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:09,176
I really didn’t know it.

218
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,656
I’ll pay for this meal to apologize to you.

219
00:15:12,696 --> 00:15:13,976
No need for it.

220
00:15:14,016 --> 00:15:16,656
We have a coupon for a buy 1 get 1 free promotion.

221
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:18,056
It’s for two people.

222
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,376
You are an excess.

223
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:23,376
Forget about the promotion.

224
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,136
Come and sit with us.

225
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:26,256
Am I bothering you?

226
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:27,296
No.

227
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,176
I’ll let you two talk.

228
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:42,016
I need to go to the bathroom.

229
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:43,856
Liu.

230
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:52,656
Here’s your food.

231
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:02,656
What do you want?

232
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:04,855
I came here to have a meal.

233
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:07,536
It’s a coincidence that I walked into this restaurant.

234
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:09,016
Drop your act.

235
00:16:09,056 --> 00:16:11,415
I saw through your acting since the moment you walked in here.

236
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:16,056
Do you have a lot of free time to interrupt other people’s lives?

237
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:20,896
To be honest, I don’t have a lot of free time.

238
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:25,656
For this, I think it’s worth my time.

239
00:16:56,936 --> 00:16:58,376
Liu.

240
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,776
I saw you went out with Guy.

241
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,496
How is it going?

242
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:07,416
How long are you going to keep fooling Liu?

243
00:17:07,456 --> 00:17:09,416
I am not fooling her.

244
00:17:10,176 --> 00:17:12,336
I’m just doing what I want.

245
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,536
Unfortunately,

246
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,176
I want to be your girlfriend.

247
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,375
Nonsense.

248
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,416
It’s not nonsense.

249
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:23,936
If we are dating,

250
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,336
Think how surprised everyone will be.

251
00:17:27,816 --> 00:17:30,336
Everything we do has always been a big buzz.

252
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,536
We can change it into money and fame.

253
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:38,216
In the end, it will turn into power.

254
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:42,936
Using other people to become successful,

255
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:46,016
so this is your special skill.

256
00:17:47,056 --> 00:17:48,056
Yes.

257
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:51,096
I’ll take that as a compliment.

258
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,856
You can manipulate anyone that you want.

259
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:59,736
But can’t you leave me and Liu alone?

260
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:05,016
For all this time, isn’t it clear to you how much I hate you?

261
00:18:05,576 --> 00:18:07,576
That’s okay.

262
00:18:08,976 --> 00:18:10,976
I hate you very much too.

263
00:18:12,136 --> 00:18:14,056
So what?

264
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:18,216
Are you going to let your personal feelings ruin our opportunity?

265
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:20,416
You are a smart guy.

266
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:26,176
You should know that those feelings are for the fools.

267
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:29,114
Are you a psychopath?

268
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,754
Can you live like normal people?

269
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:36,514
Isn’t this what people call normal?

270
00:18:37,114 --> 00:18:42,954
A young good-looking couple enjoys a wonderful and romantic meal.

271
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,674
Instead of accompanying by a plastic girl

272
00:18:46,714 --> 00:18:48,674
and try to say that it’s normal.

273
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:51,994
I’ve never looked at it that way.

274
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,114
Is that so?

275
00:18:54,114 --> 00:18:55,554
It’s okay

276
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:58,154
as long as Liu sees it that way.

277
00:19:11,794 --> 00:19:14,634
I thought you were just trying to come between me and Liu.

278
00:19:14,674 --> 00:19:16,634
But you are planning to brainwash her.

279
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:19,434
Wait.

280
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,794
I can’t brainwash anyone.

281
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:24,234
Things turn out this way.

282
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:29,114
It may be because she agrees with this way of thinking.

283
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:31,234
For example,

284
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:35,354
she thinks we are a good match and should be together.

285
00:19:35,394 --> 00:19:36,594
That’s not true.

286
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,754
Liu knows that I have no feelings for you.

287
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:40,594
She also knows that…

288
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:41,714
Wait.

289
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:46,314
Don’t tell me that you think she has feelings for you.

290
00:19:48,034 --> 00:19:49,714
I think you misunderstand it.

291
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:57,354
Do you think she will give up on the man that she likes for her friend without saying anything?

292
00:19:58,274 --> 00:20:00,633
She helped me by taking you here.

293
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:02,514
She ordered the salad for me.

294
00:20:02,554 --> 00:20:04,594
She excused herself so we would be alone.

295
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:07,514
Look at the situation.

296
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:12,674
If you are not a fool, you should be able to tell that she chose not to be with you.

297
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:16,354
That she chose not to be with you.

298
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:19,674
Stop talking nonsense.

299
00:20:20,994 --> 00:20:23,754
It’s up to you.

300
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,954
You can go ask Liu.

301
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:33,434
It looks like she is leaving so we can be alone.

302
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:38,714
The buy 1 get 1 free promotion is meant to be for us from the beginning.

303
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:43,634
Liu.

304
00:20:43,914 --> 00:20:44,914
Liu.

305
00:20:45,354 --> 00:20:47,234
Why are you doing this?

306
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:53,834
Faye just wants to talk to you.

307
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:57,474
Why do you believe every word that Faye says?

308
00:20:58,034 --> 00:21:00,914
You know that there’s no way that I will date Faye.

309
00:21:00,954 --> 00:21:03,234
You know how I feel about you.

310
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,674
I know. This is my answer.

311
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:11,394
This is not your true feelings.

312
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:14,154
I think you are just confused.

313
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:15,914
Because Faye said she wants to be with me

314
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:20,274
or people think that Faye is a better match for me than you.

315
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:22,714
But that’s what other people think.

316
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:25,833
How can you think that other people’s opinions are more than our feelings?

317
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:28,434
We are not living alone in this world.

318
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:31,594
Tell me.

319
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:36,114
Can we live our lives without caring about what other people think?

320
00:21:36,914 --> 00:21:38,634
If we could do that,

321
00:21:38,674 --> 00:21:41,034
no couples would break up or get a divorce.

322
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:44,593
If this is what I think,

323
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,514
aren’t you going to try to understand or listen to me?

324
00:21:47,914 --> 00:21:51,114
Are you sure you want to do this because of that?

325
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:55,114
It’s true that we need more than love.

326
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:57,394
But I think we can work it out together.

327
00:21:58,674 --> 00:22:00,834
All you need to do is tell me how you feel.

328
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:02,834
I’m ready to be by your side.

329
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,274
From everything I did, do you still not get it?

330
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:07,914
I don’t believe it.

331
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:11,874
I don’t believe that you have no feelings for me.

332
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:14,914
You can’t even say that to me.

333
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:26,314
Please don’t do this.

334
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,594
We can work it out together.

335
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,074
You need to hear it, don’t you?

336
00:22:40,314 --> 00:22:41,394
Fine.

337
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:56,474
I had no feelings for you.

338
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:59,074
I’ve never had any feelings for you.

339
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:04,274
I did everything because I felt that way.

340
00:23:04,314 --> 00:23:07,874

341
00:23:07,914 --> 00:23:12,433

344
00:23:50,154 --> 00:23:51,154
Hey.

345
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:53,834
You need to tell me.

346
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,194
If you keep drinking and say nothing,

347
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,034
I don’t know how to help you.

348
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:00,714
I don’t know how to begin.

349
00:24:01,754 --> 00:24:03,434
I thought that our relationship was going well.

350
00:24:06,754 --> 00:24:08,114
Do you think what is her reason?

351
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,233
Is it because of Faye or something else?

352
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,834
Whatever her reason is, it’s not important anymore.

353
00:24:14,474 --> 00:24:19,234
You need to accept that she rejected you.

354
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:23,314
She cried when she rejected me.

355
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:28,674
Why did she cry if that was what she wanted?

356
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:39,154
Wasn’t she supposed to feel relieved as she was able to say what she wanted?

357
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:41,154
Hey.

358
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:47,834
You need to stop asking questions that you will never know the answers.

359
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:51,834
Accept her decision.

360
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:54,994
The person that she chose

361
00:25:00,514 --> 00:25:01,714
is not you.

362
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:53,914
Do you want to make rose water with me?

363
00:25:59,154 --> 00:26:00,154
That’s a good idea.

364
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:02,794
Let’s go.

365
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:12,674
It’s strange.

366
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:16,194
I thought this was the right decision.

367
00:26:17,194 --> 00:26:18,994
But I feel so horrible.

368
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:23,794
The worst thing is that I hurt Guy.

369
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:27,434
But you are as hurt as he is.

370
00:26:29,274 --> 00:26:31,554
Now I’m not sure

371
00:26:32,554 --> 00:26:35,154
if this is really the right decision.

372
00:26:37,154 --> 00:26:41,194
I think you shouldn’t ask yourself if it’s the right decision.

373
00:26:41,234 --> 00:26:46,154
You should ask if this is the best choice that you have.

374
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:57,914
I think this is best for Guy and me.

375
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:00,434
We feel hurt now.

376
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:03,354
But I think it’s better for us in the future.

377
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:06,314
That’s true.

378
00:27:06,354 --> 00:27:09,514
When we break up with someone,

379
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:13,514
it hurts but it’s a good thing for both of us.

380
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:16,274
It’s irony.

381
00:27:17,314 --> 00:27:21,234
I never had a boyfriend but I learned how to break up.

382
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:25,234
What you learned is not breaking up with someone.

383
00:27:25,274 --> 00:27:28,634
You learned to love someone

384
00:27:29,834 --> 00:27:33,434
You did this because you love him, didn’t you?

385
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:48,194
Saint, don’t you feel bad that I keep talking about Guy?

386
00:27:49,714 --> 00:27:51,233
Why would I feel bad?

387
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:55,634
I’m happy that I am someone you can talk to.

388
00:27:56,234 --> 00:27:58,234
This is how I show my love to you.

389
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:04,994
It’s unbelievable that you can casually talk about it.

390
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,914
I guess I’ve experienced different forms of love.

391
00:28:11,074 --> 00:28:12,474
For me,

392
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:18,754
I think finding someone you are comfortable to be with is more important than love.

393
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:28,514
I think honesty and the ability to tell everything to that person are more important for relationships.

394
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:32,914
Feelings will fade away one day.

395
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:38,114
But the bond will last forever.

396
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:42,634
So?

397
00:28:42,914 --> 00:28:44,234
Don’t I sound cool?

398
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:45,274
Yes.

399
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:54,074
I said that because I know I can’t compete with him in winning your heart.

400
00:28:56,354 --> 00:29:00,953
It would be wrong to say that love is not important.

401
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:01,954
Anyway.

402
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:05,154
Though you may have no feelings for me now,

403
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:09,874
I will make you fall for me one day.

404
00:29:12,674 --> 00:29:15,074
When that day comes,

405
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:18,074
I think Guy’s wound will be healed and he is ready to start a new relationship with someone.

406
00:29:18,874 --> 00:29:21,514
I hope that he can have a new relationship soon.

407
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:27,274
I don’t want to see him sad because of me for a long time.

408
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:32,034
There’s a person who is the right match for him.

409
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:35,314
He just hasn’t noticed her yet.

410
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:38,754
Who are you talking about?

411
00:29:39,954 --> 00:29:41,554
Faye likes Guy.

412
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:45,594
I think it’s the best choice.

413
00:29:46,394 --> 00:29:48,714
I want to stay away from Guy.

414
00:29:49,194 --> 00:29:51,194
Faye is perfect for him.

415
00:29:51,274 --> 00:29:54,354
Meanwhile, I have you.

416
00:29:54,954 --> 00:29:56,114
Wait, Liu.

417
00:29:56,634 --> 00:29:58,634
When did Faye come into the picture?

418
00:30:03,314 --> 00:30:04,594
What’s up, Ann?

419
00:30:04,634 --> 00:30:06,393
Liu, do you have the phone number of Guy’s mom?

420
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:07,594
Can you give it to me?

421
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:09,234
Yes.

422
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:11,113
But why do you need it for?

423
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:12,154
What happened?

424
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:16,314
Guy is arrested because he was involved in a fight.

425
00:30:25,914 --> 00:30:27,594
I called Guy’s mom.

426
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,114
I’m on my way to the police station.

427
00:30:29,154 --> 00:30:30,914
What happened?

428
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,914
Guy and I were drinking at a bar.

429
00:30:32,954 --> 00:30:36,394
We ran into Third, Jo, Mork, and his friends.

430
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,274
Third came to comfort Guy about the rejection.

431
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:42,914
But his way to comfort Guy was…

432
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:46,274
Why are you sad about it?

433
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:48,234
A girl like Liu,

434
00:30:48,274 --> 00:30:52,154
you can find a dozen of them at a plastic surgery clinic.

435
00:30:58,634 --> 00:31:01,474
A girl like her should know her place.

436
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:04,314
It was like a miracle for someone like you to ask her out.

437
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:05,994
How could she say no to you?

438
00:31:06,794 --> 00:31:08,594
Why can’t she say no to me?

439
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:13,594
Her original face was so ugly.

440
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:16,954
If she had a boyfriend like you,

441
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:19,514
it was worth the money she paid for the plastic surgery.

442
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:24,074
I guess the surgery can only change her face but not her brain.

443
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:29,114
What the hell did you just say?

444
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:33,354
I think the person who needs surgery to alter the brain is you.

445
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:34,554
What did you say?

446
00:31:34,954 --> 00:31:37,794
You are an adult but your brain is filled with bad attitudes.

447
00:31:37,834 --> 00:31:38,834
Bastard.

448
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:42,314
What is wrong with you?

449
00:31:42,794 --> 00:31:44,314
Didn’t you hear what he said?

450
00:31:45,114 --> 00:31:47,314
I shouldn’t waste my time to comfort you.

451
00:31:47,354 --> 00:31:49,914
How could you fall for a plastic girl like her?

452
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:51,514
What the hell is wrong with you?

453
00:31:51,754 --> 00:31:53,074
Why do you keep looking down on her?

454
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:59,434
Come and help me stop him.

455
00:32:03,954 --> 00:32:05,674
How is it going?

456
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:07,474
They are still arguing with each other.

457
00:32:07,514 --> 00:32:09,674
Did you call Guy’s mom?

458
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:13,034
I’ll wait for Aunt Linda here.

459
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:14,433
You should go inside.

460
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,434
Yes.

461
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:18,394
You said Mork also saw what happened.

462
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:19,634
Yes. Why?

463
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:22,954
I think you should work things out.

464
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:24,954
The other party is not a stranger.

465
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:26,674
You both study at the same university, right?

466
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:29,234
It’s better for you to not have a criminal record because of this.

467
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,314
No.

468
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:33,314
If he doesn’t bow his head and apologize to me,

469
00:32:33,794 --> 00:32:35,114
I will take legal action against him.

470
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:39,594
Guy, why don’t you apologize to him to end this whole thing?

471
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:41,594
It was my fault.

472
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:43,594
I should have hit him harder.

473
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:44,833
Assh*le.

474
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:46,194
- Stop it. - What did you say?

475
00:32:47,194 --> 00:32:48,754
Don’t have another fight here.

476
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:50,754
Otherwise, you will be pressed for another charge.

477
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:55,474
Guy.

478
00:32:57,754 --> 00:32:59,754
Why did you tell her about this?

479
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:02,514
Do you know what you are doing?

480
00:33:02,554 --> 00:33:05,394
Why did you have a fight with him and get into trouble?

481
00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:07,713
You need to learn how to control your temper.

482
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:10,194
Liu also thinks this was your fault.

483
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:13,833
You should reflect on your wrongdoings and apologize to me.

484
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:16,314
You are the one who needs to apologize.

485
00:33:18,434 --> 00:33:20,714
Guy was wrong that he hit you.

486
00:33:20,754 --> 00:33:22,714
You were wrong that you insulted me.

487
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:24,994
I want you to apologize to me.

488
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,330
Please take a look at it.

489
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:34,794
Bastard.

490
00:33:36,234 --> 00:33:37,474
What is wrong with you?

491
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,874
You started the fight.

492
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:41,594
Why?

493
00:33:42,074 --> 00:33:44,714
Why don’t I have a right to choose who I want to date?

494
00:33:45,194 --> 00:33:48,754
Even if I underwent surgery to change my entire face

495
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:50,754
or I did nothing and was still an ugly girl,

496
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:53,714
I have a right to choose who I want to be with.

497
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,914
She is right.

498
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,274
If you apologize to Liu,

499
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:03,834
I’ll drop the charges.

500
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,593
What are you going to do?

501
00:34:06,594 --> 00:34:07,834
Apologize to her.

502
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:09,674
Third.

503
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:11,234
Fine.

504
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:13,114
I’m sorry.

505
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,914
Like I said, I’ll drop the charges.

506
00:34:23,634 --> 00:34:26,194
Who do I have to bail out?

507
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:27,834
You don’t need to do that anymore.

508
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:40,794
I’m sorry for all the trouble.

509
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:41,954
It’s okay.

510
00:34:41,994 --> 00:34:43,954
It’s good that things ended well.

511
00:34:44,034 --> 00:34:47,234
I got to see Liu scolding you today.

512
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:48,874
I will have a good sleep tonight.

513
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:51,154
I got to go now. See you.

514
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:58,554
I’m sorry.

515
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:00,554
Thank you for helping me.

516
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:03,954
I was the reason you got into this fight.

517
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:08,194
I’m sorry that I broke my promise.

518
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:10,194
I promised that I wouldn’t use violence.

519
00:35:10,914 --> 00:35:14,394
But when it was about you, I couldn’t help it.

520
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:18,034
I know.

521
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:22,234
You did this because of me.

522
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,194
That’s not what I mean.

523
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:26,234
It’s okay.

524
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:28,034
What you said is true.

525
00:35:28,274 --> 00:35:32,754
Everything about me always ends in trouble.

526
00:35:34,274 --> 00:35:39,394
It’s better for you if we stay away from each other.

527
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:40,834
Liu.

528
00:35:43,314 --> 00:35:46,194
Guy, I’ll talk to you later.

529
00:35:46,234 --> 00:35:48,194
I have something I need to talk to Liu.

530
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:49,514
Saint.

531
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:51,554
Can you give him a ride home?

532
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:54,554
Sure.

533
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:57,474
Let’s go.

534
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:12,994
Thank you for taking care of Liu.

535
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,274
You don’t need to thank me.

536
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:19,794
She rejected you because…

537
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:22,114
You don’t need to remind me about it.

538
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:24,114
I know what you are going to say.

539
00:36:25,034 --> 00:36:27,994
Maybe you don’t know.

540
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:29,474
I know.

541
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:30,834
Let’s go.

542
00:36:41,594 --> 00:36:43,794
I need to apologize to you.

543
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,074
I’m the reason why Guy constantly got into trouble.

544
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:48,514
Liu.

545
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,274
You don’t need to apologize to me.

546
00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:54,074
I should be the one who apologizes to you.

547
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:56,994
Apologize to me?

548
00:36:57,754 --> 00:37:01,914
Guy caused many troubles to you.

549
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:03,833
Look at what happened today.

550
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:07,553
I heard that you rejected him.

551
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:10,634
I’m sorry that I tried to set you up with him.

552
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:11,210
I didn’t know…

553
00:37:11,234 --> 00:37:12,314
It was not your fault.

554
00:37:15,594 --> 00:37:17,234
What you did didn’t make me feel bad.

555
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:25,514
Actually, I have feelings for him.

556
00:37:29,954 --> 00:37:32,794
Can I ask you something?

557
00:37:35,634 --> 00:37:37,634
You have feelings for him.

558
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:40,914
But why did you reject him?

559
00:37:44,194 --> 00:37:46,074
I…

560
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,754
I want him to be happy.

561
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:54,914
I want him to have a good life.

562
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:58,834
I want his life to be full of laughter and smiles.

563
00:37:59,874 --> 00:38:02,714
That’s the kind of life I can’t give him.

564
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:08,114
I want him to be happy with someone who is the right match for him.

565
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:14,154
There’s a friend who has feelings for Guy.

566
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,594
My life at the university?

567
00:38:18,994 --> 00:38:20,474
I need to manage my time well.

568
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:22,193
I have a lot of assignments.

569
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:24,754
It’s almost time for the final exam.

570
00:38:26,034 --> 00:38:28,833
Look at this big pile of books.

571
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,114
They are heavy.

572
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:32,754
Sometimes, I have eye strain after reading books for a long time.

573
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:34,834
But I need to do it.

574
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:38,554
She is talented and smart.

575
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,834
Her beauty is natural.

576
00:38:51,874 --> 00:38:54,514
She is perfect both inside and out.

577
00:38:58,194 --> 00:39:01,194
To get all A's, let’s study together.

578
00:39:01,234 --> 00:39:02,170
Let’s start.

579
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:03,394
She is honest.

580
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:07,074
If I can help you all get better grades, I will be very happy.

581
00:39:07,114 --> 00:39:08,354
She is nice.

582
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:12,114
When someone like her says she falls for Guy,

583
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:16,234
I think he should date someone who is in the same league.

584
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:18,954
Someone who is in the same league?

585
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:25,434
What do you mean by that?

586
00:39:28,474 --> 00:39:29,754
Liu.

587
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:32,474
Listen to me.

588
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:38,354
When I was dating Guy’s father,

589
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:42,074
everyone said we were right for each other.

590
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,674
We were perfect in every way.

591
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,834
But you see how it ended.

592
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:53,554
I’m not saying this because I want to set you up with Guy.

593
00:39:54,154 --> 00:39:58,634
But I want you to rethink the idea of a perfect match.

594
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:04,154
No one is perfect.

595
00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:09,834
The person that you think is perfect.

596
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:14,474
Maybe she is imperfect just like you.

597
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:21,834
Everyone, I need to end the streaming and go back to my study.

598
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:23,594
I’ll do the live-streaming later.

599
00:40:23,634 --> 00:40:25,993
See you. Good night.

600
00:40:25,994 --> 00:40:26,034
Bye. See you. Good night.

601
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:27,034
Bye.

603
00:41:36,948 --> 00:41:38,391
Don’t tell me you guys are a thing now?

604
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,153
You look perfect for each other,

605
00:41:40,154 --> 00:41:41,753
and similar in social standings.

606
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:43,816
You don’t want me to be on bad terms with Faye.

607
00:41:44,723 --> 00:41:45,954
I’ll be very happy for you

608
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,594
if it’s him you’re in love with.

609
00:41:51,963 --> 00:41:53,234
When I’m with you,

610
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,874
every tough situation feels so easy to get through.

611
00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:57,501
Saint.

612
00:41:57,554 --> 00:42:00,114
Can make Liu a famous perfumer?
