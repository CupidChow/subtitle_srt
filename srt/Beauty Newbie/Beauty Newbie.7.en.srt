1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,750
These are the servers at this year’s Lab Bar.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,390
She’s all plastic.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,829
A bit of staring and touching wouldn’t tarnish her.

4
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,029
If I give you more tips,

5
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,310
can I touch you a bit more?

6
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,750
Manners are the thing that we all should have.

7
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,189
No matter how hard I try,

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,550
I will never be viewed as a valuable person like others, right?

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,030
I was waiting to see if someone would stand up against it.

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,990
I’m not surprised to see what happened at Lab Bar.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,670
Saint.

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,750
My room is over there.

13
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,070
Huh?

14
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,749
I see.

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,830
So Saint helped you find a place to live.

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,550
He might have found me a room,

17
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,950
but for the most part, he was just being a nuisance.

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,190
Nuisance?

19
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,470
Hell yeah.

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,790
You were nitpicking, fussy, and meddling.

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,909
All the nitpicking, fussying, and meddling was necessary,

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,229
when your survival skill’s way below zero.

23
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,670
How the hell would you get by with what you brought with you?

24
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,670
You only brought books and a fish tank.

25
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,030
Wh...

26
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,150
There are… only books and a fish tank?

27
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,150
What about bed sheets?

28
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,830
Where are your clothes, toothpaste and toothbrush, cleanser and shampoo?

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,390
I can buy those later.

30
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,150
Ann.

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,470
Help me with this table.

32
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,030
You had no business talking to me about feng shui, though.

33
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,270
Feng shui?

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,749
Dude, you can’t put it there.

35
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,190
It’s bad feng shui.

36
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,070
Now this… is good feng shui.

37
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,990
But doesn’t it make life easier for you?

38
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,270
Who the hell puts a table there?

39
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,070
It’s my place.

40
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,589
I can put whatever I want wherever I want it.

41
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,470
Come and take your pillows and blanket back today.

42
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,110
I’ll go get them when you have your own.

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,830
And here I thought you guys hated each other.

44
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,309
Who knew you actually got along so well?

45
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,310
- Who would get along with this guy? - Who would get along with this guy?

46
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,310
Okay.

47
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,590
You don’t get along, I got it

48
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,710
Saint, but…

49
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,110
What did my mother tell you?

50
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,070
Well…

51
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,470
You’re still going back after that?

52
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,190
You’re going back after that?

53
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,270
Yes.

54
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,350
If I run, that means I let everyone else face it on their own.

55
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,830
But I’m going back to stop it from happening again.

56
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,790
What do you mean?

57
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,990
Can you two… help me with something?

58
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,750
[BASED ON LINE WEBTOON “MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY” BY KI MAENGGI]

59
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:38,659
I thought we’d have to make two trips to get everything.

60
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:44,179
If you wanna call me a genius for coming up with the idea to borrow Ann’s car…

61
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,899
Be my guest.

62
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:47,979
Why would I do that?

63
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,939
You don’t call me a genius for getting everything Liu wants in such a short time.

64
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,139
But I don’t need your compliments anyways.

65
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:59,739
I didn’t do it for you. I did it for Liu.

66
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:05,179
I guess I gotta…

67
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:09,499
send some photos to win over the heart of Mrs. Sunee.

68
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:11,779
Mrs. Sunee?

69
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:14,539
Who’s that?

70
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:15,859
Liu’s Mom.

71
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,419
You don’t know?

72
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,859
Well, no wonder.

73
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:24,339
The person she trusts to take care of Liu is me, after all.

74
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,099
You idiot, slow down!

75
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:39,138
Like I said, I don’t want us to go through what we did yesterday again.

76
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,739
I want to show them that we won’t just blindly follow that stupid tradition.

77
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:49,779
But if we don’t, won’t Milin and Da get in trouble for that?

78
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,619
That’s why I want to talk to you all first.

79
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,659
If you’re not okay with this, just please tell me now.

80
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,499
Liu, I understand your feelings.

81
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,939
But Milin and I fought for this once,

82
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,499
and it fell through.

83
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,299
If we’re to fight for it again, it just won’t look good.

84
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:11,739
It’ll make us...

85
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,739
Look.

86
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,179
I don’t think they should put up with this even for another day.

87
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:17,715
Hey.

88
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:21,739
I know you’re worried those guys are going to call me out for it.

89
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:25,419
But these girls are literally telling us they’re not okay with this.

90
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,939
We can’t make them put up with it.

91
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:35,658
Screw them.

92
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,019
Whatever happens happens.

93
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:38,819
I don’t care about those idiots anymore.

94
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,819
We have to go for it.

95
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:47,419
If you say so, then I have your back.

96
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,299
Count me in.

97
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,099
What about you, Faye?

98
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,979
I’m so sorry.

99
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:06,139
This is all because of me.

100
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,019
I didn’t make it clear enough with them about the costumes.

101
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,739
I put you guys through this.

102
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:12,059
I’m sorry.

103
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:14,658
Don’t blame yourself.

104
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,578
It’s not your fault.

105
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:19,619
Let’s do this together.

106
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,499
Well, where’s the stuff?

107
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:40,899
Here they are.

108
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:49,539
Thank you for coming up with this idea, Liu.

109
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,898
I couldn’t stop this absurdity at all before.

110
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:55,779
But I believe you can do it.

111
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:58,619
I’ll make you a hero.

112
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,619
Thank you, Faye.

113
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:06,515
Alright.

114
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,499
Let’s go get them, guys.

115
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,939
I feel bad about yesterday.

116
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:20,059
What Guy said actually hit me.

117
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,299
I shouldn’t have challenged him to a drink.

118
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:24,819
Oh, the man thinks.

119
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,219
My dude here actually has brains, you know?

120
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:32,059
Are you saying he didn’t before?

121
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:34,939
You’re not helping, bro.

122
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:40,738
Speaking of which, it’s strange you’re nice enough to come back to help, Ann.

123
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,179
I’m not being nice.

124
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,739
I’m only here for the drama I heard will be happening.

125
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:56,219
How was it?

126
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,259
All good?

127
00:08:58,419 --> 00:08:59,699
See for yourself.

128
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:18,779
Milin.

129
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,459
What’s with the mascots?

130
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,419
Where are Faye, Liu, and Mimi?

131
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:24,219
They’re all here.

132
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:33,939
What? That’s Faye?

133
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:40,939
What?

134
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,019
How can you do this?

135
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,179
Did you forget what our gimmick is?

136
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:45,938
Nobody forgets that.

137
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:48,139
We just refuse to do it again.

138
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:51,218
Don’t you think you’re going to disappoint the customers who are here to see...

139
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:52,219
See what?

140
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,699
To see the sexiness!

141
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:56,539
Who the hell would want to look at you like this?

142
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,979
If it’s sexiness you want, it’s here.

143
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:01,699
What’s that?

144
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:03,979
Creativity is the new sexy.

145
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:07,698
We’ve come up with new drinks.

146
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:11,259
If you want Lab Bar to do well, it gotta start with the menu.

147
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:13,859
We have to do things differently than the rest.

148
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,619
You think this kind of thing can up our sales?

149
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,699
Come on.

150
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:29,779
It wouldn’t hurt to let them try for half a day, right?

151
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,499
We’re opening soon.

152
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:35,299
If you want the old way, they have to spend at least an hour dressing up.

153
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,179
Why don’t we let them try for half a day?

154
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:40,739
If it doesn’t work, they’ll just stop being stubborn.

155
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:44,499
Whatever you guys say.

156
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:48,979
Fine.

157
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,659
You’ll see what actually works and what doesn’t.

158
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:53,899
I’ll be keeping a watchful eye on you two.

159
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:59,219
If we don’t make progress by then, it’s back to the changing room.

160
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,259
Fine.

161
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,899
Welcome!

162
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:18,579
Welcome to our booth!

163
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:19,818
Come on in.

164
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:22,419
Where are all the pretty girls?

165
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,419
Well, I’ve been told

166
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,139
that creativity is the new sexy.

167
00:11:30,219 --> 00:11:31,219
What’s that?

168
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,019
There it is.

169
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:49,739
I’m going with scent marketing.

170
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:53,499
Uhh, what is that? I don’t get it.

171
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:58,739
It’s a strategy to attract customers by scent.

172
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:01,778
Something that smells amazing can increase people’s appetite.

173
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,859
Most restaurants use this strategy.

174
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,259
And so will we.

175
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,459
The first scent I’m going for is vanilla.

176
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,618
Vanilla smells sweet and inviting, not to mention relaxing.

177
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:20,539
We’ll leave diffusers on the tables so people catch a whiff of it,

178
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,579
nothing too strong, though.

179
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:24,699
Hey, this booth smells amazing.

180
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:25,595
Shall we?

181
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,179
Welcome. Please come in.

182
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:28,858
Hi there. Why don’t you take a look?

183
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:31,659
We’ve got a lot of new items on the menu.

184
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:32,219
Here.

185
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:33,219
Wow.

186
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,459
See?

187
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,819
What else do you think we should add?

188
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,059
I think it still lacks something.

189
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,299
Here.

190
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,379
Try this.

191
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,019
Oh?

192
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:51,875
Just top it up generously.

193
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:52,978
It looks so much better.

194
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,418
Here you go, Faye.

195
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,538
Go for it.

196
00:12:55,539 --> 00:13:01,019
As for drinks, we can add rosemary which helps with memory,

197
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,138
and in turn makes people remember our drinks better.

198
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,339
Oh, that looks great.

199
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:09,499
- This would look amazing on social media. - Please come in.

200
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:12,859
Oh, we apologize,

201
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,258
but you’ll have to wait in line because we’re packed right now.

202
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,099
Oh?

203
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,059
Please kindly wait.

204
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,139
Of course.

205
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:35,179
I told you we can still sell even if we don’t do the same old thing.

206
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:37,299
Nonsense.

207
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:40,059
You haven't sold as much as we did yesterday.

208
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:43,419
One more thing, our regulars are those photographers,

209
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:45,859
and I bet they’re really disappointed right now.

210
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:48,178
Hmm.

211
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:49,338
Sure looks like it.

212
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:49,899
Snap!

213
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,579
One more. One, two, three.

214
00:13:51,619 --> 00:13:53,459
-Another one.

215
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,139
Another one.

216
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:56,579
Third, my dude.

217
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,338
Love your booth, man.

218
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,699
People keep asking me to take a photo for them with these mascots.

219
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,299
Guess who’s making so much dough!

220
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:08,499
You’re right. We haven’t reached yesterday’s sales.

221
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,619
But it won’t be for long.

222
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:13,899
Let me help with the till here.

223
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,418
Gotta go.

224
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:18,859
We’re busy today.

225
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,739
Are the drinks even that good?

226
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,059
Do you want to try some?

227
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,259
Those two love it.

228
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:39,218
[The Lab Bar booth is sooo adorable today.] - Of course.

229
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,859
[Arghhh! I want to be there.] - Would you like to pay with QR code or in cash?

230
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,939
Of course.

231
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:45,458
Look here, guys. [The drinks are divine! Rosemary smells great.]

232
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:47,299
[Good presentation. This year’s booth is great!]

233
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:49,579
[It smells amazing inside. Bravo!]

234
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:51,179
[Guyssss, Lab Bar is so rad!]

235
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:52,739
Here’s your order. [Hurry up before they’re sold out.]

236
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,458
[I literally went twice because the drinks are that good.]

237
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,219
[They sell creativity, not just drinks.] [I literally went twice because the drinks are that good.]

238
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:01,899
How much have we made so far?

239
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:02,819
We’re going steady.

240
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,259
We nearly make as much as yesterday.

241
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:06,299
Okay.

242
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:07,299
Liu.

243
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:08,299
Hmm?

244
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,339
Water?

245
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,339
It’s okay. Saint already got me some.

246
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:21,219
[Liu]

247
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:25,019
Oh, dear.

248
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,699
Looks like you’re falling behind.

249
00:15:28,619 --> 00:15:30,379
I’m not surprised, though.

250
00:15:30,419 --> 00:15:32,138
Your eyes aren’t on Liu at all.

251
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,259
Mork said you keep staring at Faye.

252
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:37,258
Mork did?

253
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,259
Yeah.

254
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,579
Dude’s been observing you, you know?

255
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:42,499
What’s with you, though?

256
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,899
Why are you staring at her?

257
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,339
I have to keep an eye on her.

258
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,539
She said something suspicious back in the student society’s office.

259
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,698
Thank you for coming up with this idea, Liu.

260
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:55,579
I couldn’t stop this absurdity at all before.

261
00:15:55,939 --> 00:15:58,939
But I believe you can do it.

262
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,619
I’ll make you a hero.

263
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:03,259
Thank you, Faye.

264
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:13,698
Here are your drinks.

265
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:15,499
Please enjoy.

266
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:19,938
Hello.

267
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:21,339
What would you like?

268
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,379
Yeah…

269
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:24,299
She does seem weird.

270
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,859
Seems like she’s working hard, though.

271
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,219
That’s exactly what’s weird about this.

272
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,859
Faye, how are you doing? Are you alright?

273
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:36,899
I am.

274
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:38,459
Faye, drink something.

275
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,819
You haven’t had anything to drink all morning.

276
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:40,898
Thank you.

277
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,099
Mork, order’s up.

278
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,498
Can I have some water?

279
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:45,899
Here you go, Mimi.

280
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:49,299
Thank you.

281
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,019
Today’s so much fun.

282
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,339
I’ve been asked for a photo countless times.

283
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,979
Even Note asked for one.

284
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:02,779
Guess we won them over a little?

285
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,699
If it wasn’t for you, we wouldn’t be having such a great time, Liu.

286
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:09,779
True.

287
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,019
You guys look really amazing on camera.

288
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:12,778
But everyone’s so full of energy today.

289
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:13,475
That’s true.

290
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,619
You guys look really amazing on cameras.

291
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,339
What do you think?

292
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,539
That’s adorable.

293
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,539
Thank you, Liu.

294
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,618
If it’s like this every year from now on,

295
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,579
I’ll build a statue to commemorate you and enact it right in the middle of Lab Bar.

296
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:33,739
That’s too much.

297
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,099
I’m getting back to work.

298
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:41,858
She’s really nice, isn’t she?

299
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,179
Now I understand why you guys voted for her to represent our major.

300
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:47,499
But the day’s still a long way from being over, Da.

301
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,979
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves just yet.

302
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:50,539
That’s right.

303
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,618
We all still have to work hard for this.

304
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:54,739
Guess we have to make these drinks faster to deserve a statue, too, huh?

305
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,658
Then what are we waiting for?

306
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,698
Back to work, guys.

307
00:17:58,699 --> 00:17:59,899
Mork, go grab more ice.

308
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:03,219
Faye.

309
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:04,579
Here’s the drink.

310
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:05,299
Alright, sir.

311
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,619
Work fast. We’re swamped with orders.

312
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:08,979
Mork, I said go get more ice.

313
00:18:16,499 --> 00:18:18,019
How are we doing, Guy?

314
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,179
One more drink sold and we’ll exceed what we made yesterday.

315
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:40,459
Faye?

316
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,258
Faye, what’s wrong?

317
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,099
Faye?

318
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,035
Faye.

319
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:44,595
Faye.

320
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:45,139
What happened to Faye?

321
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,059
- Faye. - Faye.

322
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:46,915
- Faye. - Faye.

323
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,059
- Faye. - Faye.

324
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:50,818
Get the suit off of her.

325
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:52,059
She needs air.

326
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,379
Got it!

327
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,179
[Lab Bar server down! She looks so sexy under that mascot!]

328
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,099
[Great show at Lab Bar! Here I thought there wouldn’t be any more sexy ladies.]

329
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,195
Stop.

330
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,059
Don’t take photos.

331
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,139
-No photos. [Girl just stripped.]

332
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:14,419
Please stop taking photos.

333
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:14,859
Don’t take any photos.

334
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:15,435
[Creativity really is the new sexy!] - Don’t take any photos.

335
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,059
[Creativity really is the new sexy!] [As expected of the Chemistry major.] -Don’t take photos.

336
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:17,875
Don’t take photos.

337
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:18,379
Don’t take photos.

338
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:19,299
Hey, we say no photos.

339
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:20,299
No photos, please.

340
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:22,898
[Lab Bar finally did it.] [Anyone has this girl’s handle?]

341
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:24,099
[Anyone got a compilation of that?] [I rushed back to the booth so fast.]

342
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:25,419
[Back with their gimmick, to no one’s surprise.]

343
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,299
Don’t take photos.

344
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:28,259
Stop.

345
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:29,219
Don’t take any photos!

346
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:30,075
Please stop.

347
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:30,755
No photos.

348
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:31,779
Stop.

349
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,058
Don’t take photos.

350
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:35,179
Stop taking photos.

351
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:36,658
Hey, we say no photos.

352
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,859
Stop taking photos!

353
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:40,059
Hey, grab some towel.

354
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:41,099
Quickly!

355
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,099
Go grab something, Jerry.

356
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,019
No photos!

357
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:53,419
Let’s take her to the infirmary.

358
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,395
Stop taking photos!

359
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:55,539
I said stop!

360
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:57,098
Does she have to wear something so revealing?

361
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:57,499
No photos.

362
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,779
Stop taking photos.

363
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,235
Excuse me.

364
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:01,259
Make way.

365
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:02,499
No photos.

366
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,419
What happened?

367
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:14,595
She passed out.

368
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,619
Alright.

369
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:25,099
Why don’t you go back out there?

370
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,099
I’ll handle things here.

371
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,579
Everything’s all good now, but we’re currently closed.

372
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:42,659
We’re sorry.

373
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,475
Really sorry.

374
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:44,979
Crap. What should we do?

375
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:46,979
People are posting Faye’s photos.

376
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,059
We can’t report all this.

377
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:51,138
Film, aren’t you good with computers?

378
00:20:51,139 --> 00:20:52,579
Help Faye out.

379
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,059
I’m helping.

380
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,499
But the feed is just swamped right now.

381
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:57,019
Do you see it now?

382
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,298
Not only does changing things up doesn't help,

383
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,739
it causes us even more problems.

384
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:03,379
You said our costumes were too revealing.

385
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,899
Well, you didn’t do a much better job there, did you?

386
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,778
I didn’t want any of this to happen, you know?

387
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,299
But it did happen, Milin.

388
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:12,299
It doesn’t only hurt Faye’s image,

389
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,619
but it also hurts our major’s reputation.

390
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,899
It’s time now, and you couldn’t do what you promised.

391
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:24,779
We’re sticking to our agreement.

392
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:27,059
Everyone, go get changed.

393
00:21:27,699 --> 00:21:29,099
We’re going back to our old concept.

394
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:31,939
But you can go, Milin.

395
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:33,979
Don’t come back here.

396
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:47,099
If I were you,

397
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:52,419
I’d turn around and apologize to everyone for causing so much trouble.

398
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:59,099
Look.

399
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:00,339
I…

400
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,459
I think this...

401
00:22:01,939 --> 00:22:04,419
I don’t think Milin owes anyone an apology.

402
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,339
If you’re trying to blame her for coming up with this idea,

403
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,499
then you got the wrong girl.

404
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,459
This is my idea.

405
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,459
Milin only went along with me.

406
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,379
So it was you who did all this?

407
00:22:21,939 --> 00:22:23,539
I get it.

408
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:27,179
Are you jealous that your friend’s prettier and people treat her better?

409
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:28,459
Were you trying to get back at her?

410
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:29,979
No.

411
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,899
I did all this because I hated how you treated us.

412
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:37,819
You told us to put something sexy on and said, “it sells.”

413
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:39,699
What do you think we are?

414
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:42,819
You people think too much.

415
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:45,338
It’s just what’s always been done.

416
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,939
Nobody ever had a problem with it before.

417
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:49,899
Yeah, it sure isn’t your problem

418
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:52,099
because you didn’t have to strip down for anyone to look and gawk.

419
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,939
But it is our problem.

420
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:57,099
Someone complains every year and you never listen.

421
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:58,579
Shut up, Da.

422
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:02,779
You’re only saying that because you never get to put something pretty on.

423
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:06,539
Well, no one can help you with that when you’re fat.

424
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:07,579
Watch it.

425
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,658
So what if I’m fat?

426
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,259
Did I freaking beg you to feed me?

427
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:14,658
You love calling people names and passing it off as a joke.

428
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:18,579
As if you’re on some pedestal and can criticize or rate anyone with numbers.

429
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:21,379
Would you want someone to rate you, too?

430
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:25,339
You want us to do that and follow it with, “Dude, we’re just joking! Learn to laugh!”

431
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:26,035
Hey.

432
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:26,555
Milin.

433
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,475
Yeah?

434
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:28,475
I literally quoted it from you.

435
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:32,499
Not so funny now when it’s your turn, is it?

436
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:34,899
From what I’ve been listening,

437
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:39,779
isn’t it kind of weird that you keep thinking we’re doing this because of jealousy?

438
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:43,178
You said Milin is jealous of you for getting to host this event,

439
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,299
and Da is jealous of other girls who get to play dress up?

440
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:47,819
But when it actually comes down to it,

441
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,859
don’t you see that, whenever there’s a problem,

442
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,699
it’s always us sorting things out on our own?

443
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:57,699
She’s right.

444
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:00,059
All you guys do is blame us.

445
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:03,739
What the hell do you want?

446
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,779
I’m just trying to maintain our major’s image.

447
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:07,899
Don’t you care about our reputation?

448
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:10,779
I think you should care more about us, not our major.

449
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:12,195
Liu.

450
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,459
That’s too much.

451
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,059
I don’t think Liu’s said anything wrong.

452
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:22,155
He’s right.

453
00:24:22,179 --> 00:24:23,898
And I’m glad Liu brought this up.

454
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:26,619
Nobody should continue this tradition of yours next year.

455
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,459
I agree.

456
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,819
You told us to learn from you so we can host it next year.

457
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:35,699
The truth is… this makes me kind of uncomfortable.

458
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:37,499
Me, too.

459
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:40,019
It also makes me uncomfortable.

460
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,539
Hey, cool it.

461
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:49,459
Third, they have a point.

462
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,859
Don’t be a jerk about it, man.

463
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:56,619
It really was our fault this time.

464
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,299
And they outnumber us.

465
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:05,739
Just let this slide, dude.

466
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:22,155
Alright, guys.

467
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:23,339
Let’s all calm down.

468
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:25,539
I think Third’s got it now.

469
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:27,619
He just hates to lose face.

470
00:25:29,739 --> 00:25:31,699
We actually made a killing this morning.

471
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:36,699
If we continue to help each other out,

472
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:38,899
in a way that we can all agree on,

473
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,779
then I’m sure we can even exceed last year’s sales.

474
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,979
So… let’s make Lab Bar fun for everyone.

475
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:51,579
Yes.

476
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:51,899
Yes.

477
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:52,899
Okay.

478
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:58,139
Are you in?

479
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,219
Well?

480
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:08,419
Fine.

481
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:09,779
We’ll do it.

482
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,379
We’ll be back in ten minutes.

483
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:18,579
Go get ready, guys.

484
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,059
Crap.

485
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:25,619
This is a masterpiece.

486
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:27,059
I’ve uploaded it.

487
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,418
Mork, why don’t you just change your major to Arts Comm?

488
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:31,738
You’re quick when it comes to this.

489
00:26:31,739 --> 00:26:32,739
Am I?

490
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:36,099
Hello.

491
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,259
Welcome to Lab Bar, you guys.

492
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,739
We’ve got some fresh and new drinks that everyone will surely enjoy.

493
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:47,139
Just wait patiently for a moment. We’ll get to you soon.

494
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:49,995
Hello.

495
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:51,739
Welcome everyone to Lab Bar.

496
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:54,859
We’ve got some fresh and new drinks that everyone…

497
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,259
How are we doing with the sales, Milin?

498
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:00,979
I honestly don’t care about that anymore.

499
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,738
I just want us to do this the way we want.

500
00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:04,739
So true.

501
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:08,299
We’re almost sold out.

502
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:10,858
Da and I can wrap things up on our own from here.

503
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:13,459
Why don’t you go and enjoy the event, Liu?

504
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:16,499
Maybe you have someone special you want to spend the night with?

505
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:19,379
There’ll be fireworks, too, you know?

506
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:21,059
It’s pretty romantic.

507
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:22,618
I don’t have anyone like that.

508
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,899
If you’re all good here, I’ll go see Faye and then return the mascot suits.

509
00:27:27,859 --> 00:27:29,858
You can go take care of that.

510
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:31,059
I’ll go see Faye.

511
00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:32,355
Okay.

512
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:33,779
You need some muscles?

513
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,859
Yeah. Let us help carry some stuff.

514
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:39,899
No need.

515
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:41,739
I’ll help her.

516
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:44,259
Like, only the two of you?

517
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:48,419
I got it.

518
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:50,778
Shall we?

519
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:51,779
Yeah.

520
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:00,339
Milin.

521
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:02,179
When is the firework show?

522
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:03,659
8PM.

523
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:09,379
What’s the rush, buddy?

524
00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:26,179
Saint.

525
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:29,499
Have you been waiting?

526
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:30,779
Yes.

527
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:33,779
How are you feeling?

528
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:34,979
Any better?

529
00:28:36,099 --> 00:28:38,099
Yeah, a little.

530
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,179
I didn’t think you’d be waiting.

531
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,179
That actually kind of makes me blush somehow.

532
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:50,379
Why wouldn’t I wait?

533
00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:55,579
I have something I’d like to talk to you in private, Faye.

534
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,459
You do?

535
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:00,139
What is it?

536
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:03,899
Well…

537
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,659
Faye…

538
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:12,499
Why did you pretend to pass out?

539
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:19,419
What do you mean?

540
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:23,499
I thought what you said back in the office was weird.

541
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:26,819
And then I heard you refused to drink anything all day.

542
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:37,259
If you didn’t want to help your friends out, you could have just said so, you know?

543
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:39,259
Now you made everyone worry about you.

544
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,539
But well, never mind that.

545
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:46,179
Things turned out well in the end.

546
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:54,819
This confirms one more thing for me…

547
00:29:57,019 --> 00:29:59,299
It was you who were messing with Mac back then, wasn’t it?

548
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:02,298
What are you saying?

549
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:03,619
I don’t understand.

550
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:06,059
Oh, I was right on the money.

551
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:08,259
Saint.

552
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:10,819
Don’t worry.

553
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,659
I’m not going to do anything for now.

554
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,939
I only waited for you to wake up to tell you that,

555
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:18,659
from now on,

556
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:21,819
Guy won’t be the only one keeping an eye on you.

557
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:24,419
I will as well.

558
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,019
Well, then.

559
00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:30,059
That’s it.

560
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:31,619
Bye.

561
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:52,459
Will you thank Ms. Linda for lending us the aroma diffusers for me?

562
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:54,778
It’s nothing.

563
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:56,898
She’s been all about you lately, you know?

564
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,379
She’ll give you anything.

565
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:03,578
Well, then thank you for all the support.

566
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:05,019
You made a lot of things easier today.

567
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:06,939
I barely did anything.

568
00:31:07,459 --> 00:31:08,699
It was all you guys.

569
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:13,179
You were all so brave for speaking your minds today,

570
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:14,379
especially you.

571
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:16,299
Hmm?

572
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:21,459
I just didn’t want Milin to take the blame for what was my idea.

573
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:24,819
But you encouraged her to fight again.

574
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:30,459
I think you should take credit when it’s due and accept the compliment.

575
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,339
I’d love to.

576
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,859
But I don’t think I deserve it.

577
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:40,819
Honestly, Third and the rest really made me see the worst in myself.

578
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:44,658
When they were choosing who to be the servers,

579
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:46,899
they chose based on how we look.

580
00:31:47,499 --> 00:31:49,499
I used to do that, too.

581
00:31:57,979 --> 00:31:59,979
I was the worst.

582
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:04,419
I only realized it was bad to put numbers on people when I got to experience it myself.

583
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,779
It was a wake-up call for me.

584
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,459
“What am I even doing,” you know?

585
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:17,339
Well, are you going to do that again?

586
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:19,339
No. Definitely not.

587
00:32:20,459 --> 00:32:23,139
Then you should take the compliment.

588
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,659
You’ve learned to know what you don’t like,

589
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:28,819
and changed yourself into someone that you do.

590
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:35,339
Oh, then you deserve a compliment, too.

591
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:36,939
What for?

592
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:40,379
When you stopped Third today, you didn’t use your fist.

593
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:42,859
I see.

594
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:46,499
Take some credit for that, amazing guy.

595
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:02,778
I think we don’t need to hurry with returning the mascot and all that.

596
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:07,299
We can just take a walk around here until it’s 8…

597
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:08,579
Yes, Saint?

598
00:33:14,499 --> 00:33:16,098
Is everything alright over there?

599
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,059
Yes. No problem at all.

600
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,259
No problem at all.

601
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,899
Well, where are you?

602
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,899
Where should we meet?

603
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,899
Are you coming to me?

604
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:26,075
Yes.

605
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:29,219
I’m currently at…

606
00:33:30,699 --> 00:33:31,779
Hold on.

607
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:35,459
I’m currently at the booth called...

608
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:39,618
Welcome to Speed Date!

609
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:41,418
Why don’t you come on in?

610
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,539
[Let’s Prove the 8.2-Second Theory!]

611
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:43,859
Come on.

612
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:45,858
Join us.

613
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,099
Hurry up and sit down, please.

614
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:52,859
We’re really happy to have such a pretty girl join us tonight!

615
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:57,419
Shall we begin?

616
00:33:58,419 --> 00:33:59,355
Alright, guys.

617
00:33:59,379 --> 00:34:02,618
We’re here to prove the theory that says,

618
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:04,939
if you stare into each other’s eyes for 8.2 seconds,

619
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:06,819
you’ll fall in love with them.

620
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:09,098
If you feel like this is true, put your hands up.

621
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,739
If not, wait for the time to run out and then switch partners.

622
00:34:11,779 --> 00:34:17,459
We’ve got a prize for the pairs that fall in love!

623
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:21,659
I think we’re short one person…

624
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:24,059
I don’t mind withdrawing.

625
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,298
I only happened to pass by...

626
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:28,419
The thing is, we barely get any participants all day, so help us out…

627
00:34:31,459 --> 00:34:36,499
I think we’ve got one more hottie here!

628
00:34:37,539 --> 00:34:39,538
How do you know when the game is over?

629
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:42,139
When you fall in love with each other, of course.

630
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:45,339
Well, let’s begin, shall we?

631
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,339
Wanna get out of here quickly?

632
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:55,378
Timer starts in three, two, one…

633
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:56,458
Eight.

634
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:57,459
Seven.

635
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:57,955
Six.

636
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:58,979
I like her.

637
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:15,539
Congratulations!

638
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,858
We’ve got a new couple!

639
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:20,339
Yeah!

640
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:23,939
Thanks.

641
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:25,019
Let’s go.

642
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:27,939
Wait, Guy, we have to return the mascots

643
00:35:27,979 --> 00:35:28,979
and we have to meet up with Saint.

644
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:30,779
I have to call him back.

645
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,219
But you’re all drenched.

646
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:50,458
Why don’t you get changed over there?

647
00:35:50,459 --> 00:35:53,299
I saw someone put a clean T-shirt there this morning.

648
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:57,139
I’ll… wait outside.

649
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:10,339
It’s stuck?

650
00:36:10,979 --> 00:36:12,979
Milin was complaining the other day, too.

651
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:18,579
It’s okay.

652
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,579
I’ll call Ann.

653
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:27,259
Let me.

654
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:42,979
Uhh… You can change over there.

655
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:44,619
I’ll wait over there.

656
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:45,395
Hurry up, though.

657
00:36:45,419 --> 00:36:47,499
Someone might get the wrong idea if they see us like this.

658
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,379
Don’t peek.

659
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,499
I won’t.

660
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:08,579
Actually what’s been going on lately

661
00:37:09,339 --> 00:37:11,699
reminds me of something from my childhood.

662
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,299
You mean about Ms. Linda?

663
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:17,659
Yeah.

664
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:21,459
I tripped and fell once when I was a kid.

665
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:23,779
Dad told me,

666
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:29,259
“Boys should be strong. Don’t let anyone see you cry.”

667
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:35,299
What’s strange is that I took that to heart and stuck to it.

668
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:39,379
But now that I see Mom again,

669
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:44,179
I remember what happened afterwards.

670
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:51,259
Guy, baby.

671
00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:52,779
What’s wrong?

672
00:37:53,259 --> 00:37:55,818
Why are you holding it in?

673
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:58,139
Boys shouldn’t cry.

674
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:00,459
Who told you that?

675
00:38:00,939 --> 00:38:04,059
Of course you can cry if you’re hurt, even if you’re a boy.

676
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:06,619
Cry when you’re in pain.

677
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,819
Boys can feel vulnerable, too.

678
00:38:10,459 --> 00:38:15,099
Whatever your gender is, you can do anything.

679
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:19,859
Does that mean I can like perfumes like you, too?

680
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:22,298
Of course, baby.

681
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:25,218
Anyone can like perfumes.

682
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:30,699
There is nothing to stop anyone from any gender from liking something.

683
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:32,058
But Dad said...

684
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:37,179
Nobody gets to tell you what to like or what not to like.

685
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:38,819
Will you keep this in mind, baby?

686
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:45,419
Only you get to decide for yourself.

687
00:38:47,499 --> 00:38:48,499
Mom…

688
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:51,779
It hurts.

689
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,258
Oh, it’s okay, baby.

690
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:58,139
You’ll be alright.

691
00:38:58,259 --> 00:38:59,619
It’s okay.

692
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,458
Cry it out.

693
00:39:03,459 --> 00:39:05,699
I don’t know why it just popped into my mind just now.

694
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,419
I never even thought about it before.

695
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:12,739
My heart was full of hatred and anger towards her.

696
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,859
But now that we’re reconciled,

697
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:19,739
all the good memories are starting to come back.

698
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:25,499
There must be so many other memories lost over the years.

699
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:28,579
I guess.

700
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:33,379
But I got these good ones back

701
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:35,579
because of you.

702
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:38,659
Thank you.

703
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,219
How many times are we going to say “thank you” tonight?

704
00:39:44,699 --> 00:39:46,699
What else is there to say?

705
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:49,539
“Thank you” is right.

706
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:52,099
That means we did something good for each other.

707
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:55,859
You’re not wrong.

708
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:01,059
I have to thank you, too.

709
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:05,059
I know I thanked you for what happened at Lab Bar.

710
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:06,979
But I haven’t for Speed Date.

711
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:08,939
What do you mean?

712
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,579
You helped me out of the Speed Date booth.

713
00:40:14,939 --> 00:40:16,579
You don’t have to thank me for that.

714
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:17,619
I do.

715
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:20,715
You don’t.

716
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:21,859
It’s no big deal.

717
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,418
You had to lie that you liked me to get me out of there, you know?

718
00:40:26,419 --> 00:40:27,778
I wasn’t lying.

719
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:28,899
I meant what I said.

720
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,979
♪ I felt like the whole world ♪

721
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:42,018
♪ Was empty and lonely at first ♪

722
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:49,859
♪ What I’ve learned, what I’ve searched ♪

723
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:57,058
♪ Is right here, just within reach ♪

724
00:40:57,059 --> 00:41:02,499
♪ But I was blind ♪

725
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,538
Hey. I think it’s over.

726
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:19,458
Maybe she just doesn’t know how to act around you.

727
00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:22,459
You gotta hurry up and let her know you’re serious.

728
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:23,379
Let’s have lunch, Liu.

729
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,778
I know some interesting places.

730
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:26,018
That sounds great.

731
00:41:26,019 --> 00:41:27,098
Should we all go together?

732
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:29,098
You know I’m trying to ask her out on a date.

733
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,059
Why are you in my way?

734
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,339
Because she’s got a date with me.

735
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,018
Two options for you:

736
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:34,098
One, back off.

737
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:37,259
Two, pick a dating spot that’s way better than the perfume museum.

738
00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:38,459
Option two, all the way.
