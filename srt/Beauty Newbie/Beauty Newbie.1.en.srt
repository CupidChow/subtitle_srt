00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,520
Hello.

2
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,040
This is a very popular perfume.

3
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,680
It's a favorite among beautiful actresses and models.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,280
But there's another bottle that might suit your face better, ma'am.

5
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,560
Ghost-face Liu!

6
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,200
Ghost-face Liu! Ghost-face Liu! Ghost-face Liu!

Ghost-face Liu! Ghost-face Liu! Ghost-face Liu!

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,600

15
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
You want a ruler, dear?

16
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
'Cause I have one.

17
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,080
Come on, Dad.

18
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,400
What's with you, my dear Liu?

19
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,200
Are you still unhappy with how you look?

20
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,600
Even after that whole-face surgery?

21
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,760
You know, honey...

22
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,360
Hmm?

23
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Even if people have nothing to say about her beauty,

24
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,120
they might still call our daughter a cosmetic surgery addict, you know?

25
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,160
People these days love to bully.

26
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,808
Exactly.

27
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,137
That's exactly the reason why

28
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:34,328
your father and I have a surprise for you.

29
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,880
It's our clothes.

30
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,600
Your father and I will be staying with you for two whole weeks.

31
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
And of course I've brought this...

32
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,200
Fragrance distiller kit to make some relaxing essential oils.

33
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,397
I went and asked the building staff

34
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:53,360
if we could pick some flowers around here.

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,960
Look at this. Look what I found in all shades of red and pink.

36
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,440
While you're at campus, your mother and I will have everything prepared.

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,253
Once you're back, everything's already distilled,

38
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:04,904
and there you'll have your instant mood lift.

39
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,880
Just put it away for now, please.

40
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,440
I have to prepare breakfast for our daughter, you know?

41
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,360
Grab that one, hon. Dad. Mom.

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,400
I will be fine.

43
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,440
I'm only putting on makeup to boost my confidence.

44
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:24,624
I have absolutely nothing to worry about.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,600
With this face, no one will bully me again.

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,920
Well, then, how much would you rate your face now?

47
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,040
Popular almond-shaped eye surgery.

48
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,680

Natural looking V-shaped face contouring.

54
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,080
All in all, 85 points.

55
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,520
Wow, that's a lot. Can you guys even tell I've been under the knife?

56
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,720
Of course not!

57
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,240
But still... I'm worried about you running into someone from school who might recognize you.

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,480
I don't think so.

59
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,520
You sure there's no one you know at this university? Yeah, are you?

60
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,200
I've checked everywhere.

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,520
There's definitely no one I know.

62
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,800
Liu...

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,080
You do know we don't want you to go through what you did in school again?

64
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,920
I know what lovely parents I have.

65
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,480
Thank you for staying by my side all these times.

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,720
But I've got a new face now.

67
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,240
I won't have to go through what I did ever again.

68
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,057
I just want you two to enjoy your lives to the fullest and

69
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:52,984
wait with ease while I study hard to become a perfumer.

70
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,515
Liu, dear,

71
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,864
if you're sure you'll be fine, then I trust you. Be strong, dear.

72
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,640
I believe this place will be good to you.

73
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,320
You won't run into what you faced before,

74
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,480
especially those who look down on you for what you love.

75
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,520
Even someone like you...

76
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,080
likes perfumes?

77
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,000
Of course. I won't go through anything like that again.

78
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,720
Alright. Then we're going home.

79
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,560
Take the bag, will you?

80
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,200
Yes, hon.

81
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,600
Oh, hold on.

82
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,360
If there's an emergency you don't feel like telling me,

83
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,440
feel free to talk to your next-door neighbor. Hmm?

84
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,440
I've talked to him. He looks nice and dependable. Not to mention that gorgeous mug to go with it.

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,280
Mom.

86
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,240
I'm sure I won't have to depend on anyone again.

87
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,520
Okay, okay, okay.

88
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,800
Let's go, hon. Yeah. Grab the bag.

89
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,600
Of course.

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,520
(List of Successful Candidates for School Year 1/2024)

91
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Look at these photos of Faye I took. Wow.

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,400
I khow.

93
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,200
Look.

94
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,200
Oh, Mork. Your photos are much better than during the orientation.

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,560
Wow.

96
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,040
You should come to my girlfriend's events and take some photos of her.

97
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,120
I want something just like this.

98
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,760
Film, let me tell you one thing, bud...

99
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,960
The photos turned out well, because I snapped these with my love for Faye.

100
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,360
And can you please quit saying that that idol's your girl?

101
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,560
She's a freaking idol. You're just a fan.

102
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,680
That's not true—

103
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,280
It's not so bad to get a grip on reality, Film.

104
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,070
See? Listen to this guy, dude.

105
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:43,544
Take some advice from our year's second smartest person.

106
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,560
- I told you she's been texting me! - Okay. I've never seen those three before.

107
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,600
Ain't no way that's her real profile

108
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,760
But it is!

109
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm sick of hearing your delusional nonsense, dude.

110
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,480
Oh, hey, Ann.

111
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,980
You back now? You bolted out of the orientation

112
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:56,864
on the first day for "lunch" and never returned.

113
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,280
Get lost. Oh?

114
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,840
So cool.

115
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,280
She looks so fierce, mature, and dependable.

116
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,259
She's both pretty and handsome.

117
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,000
(Eagle-sharp double eyelid)

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,805
I bet her features are natural.

120
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,180

122
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,328
75 points.

(Surgery free)

124
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Mimi, will you please take your eyes off your phone

125
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,344
and look where you're going?

126
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,816
My boyfriend said he was going to go take a shower

127
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:17,760
two months ago and never replied.

128
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
I'm worried about him.

129
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
Worry about yourself, girl.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,720
Alright?

131
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,600
What do you mean?

132
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Why should I worry about myself?

133
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,080
Let's just take our seats, shall we?

134
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,960
What?

135
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,600
Alright. I don't know those two, either.

136
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,600
But isn't that girl adorable?

137
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,661
She's got that innocent look. I think she's friendly.

138
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:35,701
Cute dainty features, too.

139
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:36,275
(Round adorable eyes)

140
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,353

(Naturally upturned nose) (Thin beautiful lips) (Surgery free)

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,280
Faye!

143
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,280
Over here!

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Flawlessly beautiful, like an angel.

145
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,960
And she was definitely born with that face.

146
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:01,208
(Natural double eyelid) (God-given oval-shaped face) (Flawless nose)

147
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,464
(Angelic lips) (100% Natural)

148
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,160
Can I sit here, Jerry?

149
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,560
Oh, of course.

150
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,320
Thanks.

151
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,360
Lemme sit over there. Get your stuff away.

152
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,280
How long do you plan to keep blocking the way?

153
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,640
Oh, sorry.

154
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,280
Even someone like you...

155
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,360
likes perfumes?

156
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,040
Guy...

157
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,440
What did you just say?

158
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,080
Hey.

159
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,960
Have you guys seen Garin and Prima?

160
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,560
They were the only two people who didn't show up at our orientation.

161
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I don't know about Prima.

162
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,720
But Garin, who got in with a top score,

163
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
has been famous since junior high school.

164
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,680
His family owns some hotel chains so he's rich.

165
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
He's also an athlete.

166
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,600
His name is Guy.

167
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Guy...

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,280
What did you just say?

169
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,040
Hi— I said "hi." Why don't you go in first?

170
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,200
Oh, is that him? Isn't he super hot?

171
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,720
Not really?

172
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,960
I'm way better looking than him.

173
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,160
Sure you are.

174
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,280
Is this seat taken?

175
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,200
Sorry, bud.

176
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,560
We're packed here.

177
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,400
Guy's here.

178
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,200
But Prima still hasn't shown up.

179
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,360
Maybe she dropped out?

180
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,120
If she really did drop out,

181
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,840
I guess you're representing our major as the Hot Girl,

182
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,480
together with Guy, that is.

183
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,800
There's an empty seat here.

184
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,280
Hot Girl. Hot Girl. Hot Girl.

185
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,760
Stop it, you guys.

186
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,240
I don't care about that kind of thing.

187
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,120
But you're the prettiest girl in our major.

188
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,600
You're exaggerating.

189
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,920
Is there another empty seat?

190
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,760
Can you scooch over?

191
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,320
Prima.

192
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,000
Hey, she's here.

193
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,920
Doesn't she look...

194
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,445
I wouldn't show up to the orientation either

195
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,535
if my face is still swollen from the knife.

196
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,600
Who the hell revamps their entire face if they're not a freak?

197
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,880
I mean, she's hardly human anymore,

198
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,040
more like walking plastics.

199
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,321
Her eyes aren't even symmetrical.

200
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,560
She must have spent a few grand on that ugly mug.

201
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,040
Oh, I think it's even more—

202
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,960
Hey.

203
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,160
Are you alright?

204
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,080
You suddenly froze up.

205
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,880
It's nothing.

206
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
I'm fine.

207
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,520
I'm glad you're okay.

208
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm Faye.

209
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
What's your name?

210
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,360
Liu.

211
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,280
Liu.

212
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,440
Guys, this is Liu, our final classmate.

213
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
And she's really pretty.

214
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,520
Isn't it unfair how mother nature gave her such a pretty face?

215
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,200
My face... isn't—

216
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,680
I don't know if someone so naturally beautiful as you

217
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,000
would ever want to be friends with a normal girl like me, though...

218
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,240
I'm–I'm not—

219
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,200
You don't want to be friends?

220
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,320
I do.

221
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,720
Yes, I do.

222
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,880
I'm so happy.

223
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,440
Can I sit with you?

224
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,240
I saw you eyeing that seat up front.

225
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,560
Let's go.

226
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,640
Can we sit here?

227
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Thank you.

228
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,800
Let me go grab my things.

229
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,760
Where's the attendance sheet?

230
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
Oh, it's over there.

231
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,920
Can I have the attendance sheet?

232
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,360
Thanks.

233
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,680
Here, sign your attendance.

234
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,600
(Prima Patpimol)

235
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,800
Thank you for sitting with me.

236
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
Well, you looked like you didn't want to sit anywhere near that guy.

237
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,960
Bad blood?

238
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,800
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

239
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,480
But... it looks like he's coming this way, Liu.

240
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,240
Ten.

241
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,280
Nine.

242
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,160
Eight.

243
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,520
Seven. Six. Five.

244
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,320
Four. Three. Two...

245
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,040
One!

246
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,320
Thank you.

247
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,440
Don't thank me yet.

248
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I actually have ulterior motives.

249
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
I needed to take you somewhere.

250
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,163
At the orientation, this was the first place

251
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:37,224
the upperclassmen took us freshmen to.

252
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,520
They said every new student should pay their respect here.

253
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,000
You have to make a wish out loud.

254
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,565
Say why you wanted to get into this faculty

255
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,904
and what you want to be in the future.

256
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,760
The louder you pray, the more likely for your wish to come true.

257
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,400
Let me show you.

258
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,080
I want to study chemistry so I can become a researcher.

259
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,040
I want to be a smart professor who makes loads of money.

260
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,680
Please help me out.

261
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,800
I want to be a perfumer.

262
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,040
I want to make perfumes.

263
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,880
I want to have my own brand one day.

264
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,560
But before all that, please make my blog go super viral!

265
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,880
Please keep quiet, students!

266
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,000
But–But you said—

267
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,880
I lied.

268
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,040
(Please pray in silence.)

269
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,680
But if you prayed silently,

270
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,160
I wouldn't get to know you, right?

271
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,000
I want to be your friend, Liu.

272
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,240
Will you be mine?

273
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
This is the friendship book they gave us during the orientation.

274
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,560
We were supposed to ask our classmates and upperclassmen to autograph

275
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
so we could get to know each other.

276
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,400
Will you write your name here so we can be friends?

277
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,440
I'm not the only one who wants to be your friend, though.

278
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,280
Those two, too.

279
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,920
Faye.

280
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
You could have waited for us.

281
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,320
Sorry.

282
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,920
Why don't we take some selfies?

283
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,720
One, two, three.

284
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,960
One more. One, two, three.

285
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,840
Can I have some photos with just Liu? Of course.

286
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,920
Mimi, let's pray.

287
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,000
Alright.

288
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,640
One, two, three.

289
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,320
Since you just pocketed the cue ball...

290
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,760
I guess that's your cue to drink, Mac.

291
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,640
And I will.

292
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,080
Cheers.

293
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,280
Cheers.

294
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
Anyone wants to take over?

295
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,920
Go ahead and play. I'll go grab another drink.

296
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Oh, hold on a sec.

297
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:23,280
Don't forget to tell your friends to vote

298
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:26,424
for the Hot Guy-Girl representatives.

299
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,720
I need names for 'em student society idiots over there.

300
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,720
They need to submit the names for the uni-level contest soon.

301
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,291
If we don't get the names today,

302
00:21:36,316 --> 00:21:37,903
those guys are gonna lash out at me again.

303
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,800
They keep saying all I do is drink.

304
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,440
But all you do really is drink.

305
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,520
Well, can't argue with that!

306
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,800
You got it, bros?

307
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,920
Of course, bro. I'll deal with it. See ya.

308
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,880
Hey, guys.

309
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,200
We heard.

310
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,240
So this very important thing you said was "mandatory" for all students

311
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,840
was this?

312
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,760
Yeah.

313
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,440
Gimme the link to vote so I can be on my way.

314
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,520
I think we should all stay until we get the results.

315
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,560
What for?

316
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
Can't you just cooperate for once, Ann?

317
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,480
What's the rush?

318
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,840
This is the first time we have everyone in our major together, you know?

319
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,200
And?

320
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,880
Here.

321
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,320
Take it.

322
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,680
Excuse me for a minute.

323
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,520
Hey, Mac. Hmm?

324
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,440
Am I right to hear that your nickname is Body-count Mac?

325
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
I'd like you to give me some tips on how to hit on girls.

326
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,080
Oh, if it isn't Body-count Mac.

327
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,600
Good luck tonight, bro.

328
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,240
Thanks.

329
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,520
Damn.

330
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,040
From what I see,

331
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,160
you must be killing the ladies with your sense of humor, aren't you?

332
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,760
Well...

333
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,880
The nickname "Body-count Mac" didn't only come from my sense of humor.

334
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,160
It's a combined effort of all my greatest attributes.

335
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,440
I—

336
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,560
Oh, I'd love to see these "attributes" of yours, Mr. Body-count Mac.

337
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,120
Oh, hey, Saint.

338
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,720
What are you doing here?

339
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,320
My friends and I are out drinking.

340
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,080
We'll probably be upstairs.

341
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,760
But don't mind me...

342
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,400
I can't be more interesting than how Body-count Mac bags all the ladies.

343
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,640
This is Mork, by the way. He's a freshman.

344
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,920
This is Saint. He's a graduate from our faculty.

345
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,440
He's currently doing a Master's in MBA, though.

346
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,720
Hello.

347
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,480
Hey.

348
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,720
I'm only introducing you to this guy because I am a complete amateur,

349
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,880
compared to him, that is. Are you for real?

350
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,480
You threw me under the bus, huh, Mac?

351
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,560
I wasn't lying, at least!

352
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,880
Right? I just want this rookie to learn from the best.

353
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,720
Here's the thing, big bro.

354
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,640
The girl I'm crushing on is kind of an influencer.

355
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,440
She's got her own YouTube channel and all, and she's super popular.

356
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,576
And like, if I text her a lot, I'm afraid she'd

357
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:03,504
think I'm a freak, you know what I mean?

358
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,360
Or should I go a more sugar-daddy route?

359
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,360
I'm broke as hell, though.

360
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,960
What should I do to get her to notice me?

361
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,760
Help me out. Fine.

362
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,440
Show me her Instagram.

363
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,040
Here.

364
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,840
Hmm, not bad.

365
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,240
Let me see...

366
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,960
I'll start the convo for you, but you do the rest.

367
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,913
Just that?

368
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:32,904
I've been replying to her stories and she ignores me every time.

369
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,040
I doubt something as simple as just texting her would work, bro.

370
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,800
Here.

371
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,400
What the—

372
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,560
Are you for real?

373
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,400
Damn.

374
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,360
You see?

375
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,480
Thank you.

376
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,200
He's got a knack for that, don't you agree?

377
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,280
Is she a freshman here, too?

378
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,720
What does she look like in person?

379
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,520
See for yourself.

380
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,720
Her name's Faye.

381
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,120
Hey...

382
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,240
Who's that next to her?

383
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,520
Alright. Everyone's already voted. Here's the results.

384
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,800
For the Hot Guy... One no-vote.

385
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,640
In first place is Guy, with 18 votes.

386
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,600
In second place is Mork, with one vote.

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,720
Did you vote for yourself?

388
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,200
Yeah, so?

389
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,080
There's no rules against that. Am I right?

390
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,560
I'm a confident man.

391
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,160
If I don't try,

392
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,600
I'll never win, right?

393
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,680
Well, I lost anyway!

394
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,080
But at least I'm proud I did that.

395
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,520
Good for you, bro.

396
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,360
I think it's a very brave thing to do.

397
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,560
'Let's toast to Mork, guys.

398
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:14,121
Alright.

399
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:16,544
I guess Guy is the male for our Chemistry department.

400
00:26:16,856 --> 00:26:18,480
Moving on to the female rep...

401
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,160
One no-vote.

402
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,800
In third place is Mimi, with one vote.

403
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,960
Oh!

404
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,560
Someone thinks I'm pretty.

405
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,320
That'd be me.

406
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,240
A consolation vote because I feel bad for you about your boyfriend.

407
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,280
What about my boyfriend? He just likes to take long showers.

408
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Can I just get back to this?

409
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,400
It's a tie between the second and first places.

410
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,720
Faye and Liu, with nine votes each.

411
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,160
Now how do we decide this?

412
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,960
I think it's better if Faye represents us.

413
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,280
I just got here and I never attended any school events, so...

414
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,680
And... Faye is really pretty and really nice.

415
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,760
If Liu says so, then Faye will—

416
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,840
But I think Liu is the perfect choice for this.

417
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,200
Hear me out, guys.

418
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,360
To represent our Chemistry department,

419
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,200
it isn't just about being born pretty,

420
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,560
but it's about honesty and the determination to be studying here.

421
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,040
If Liu wasn't here,

422
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,640
I might have let you guys talk me into this whole thing.

423
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,840
But Liu is here, and she's shown me how unfit I am to represent you all.

424
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,280
Do you guys know that Liu wants to be a performer?

425
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,280
That means Liu understands chemistry and nature really well.

426
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:56,865
As you all know,

427
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,064
chemistry is the art of making something new from nature.

428
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,120
And Liu's perfumes are exactly that.

429
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,880
It's the tangible kind of chemistry that people can understand.

430
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,400
How can I not want Liu to represent us all,

431
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,600
when Liu is both a true natural beauty,

432
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,880
and the core of our department?

433
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,800
Right?

434
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,760
I think Faye's got a point.

435
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Guy leans more on the academic side of chemistry,

436
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,440
if it's Faye, who's also focused more on the academics,

437
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,080
it would be repetitive, right?

438
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,720
If we go with that, the other majors would think all we do is study.

439
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,640
Exactly.

440
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,480
I think we should revamp the face of the chemistry major.

441
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,480
We're not just lab nerds and researchers,

442
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,160
but we can be this, too.

443
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,760
Liu is the real thing, the real deal.

444
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,600
Liu has a blog on perfumes,

445
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,120
and she's never once used her beauty to make people like her blog.

446
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,120
I think Liu's honesty is her greatest asset.

447
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,360
Now who wants to join me in voting for Liu?

448
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,400
Is there a problem, Guy?

449
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,000
You had something against her before this, too.

450
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
Why are you being so antisocial?

451
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:24,206
I have a right not to vote for something I don't believe

452
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:26,144
to be true, don't I?

453
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,760
Just ignore him, Faye.

454
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,320
Everyone agrees with you.

455
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,120
That means Liu will be our department's Hot Girl.

456
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,920
Yes

457
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,680
Faye's right.

458
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:41,310
There's no one better to represent us than Liu,

459
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:43,200
a true beauty and honesty.

460
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,080
A role model for modern chemists.

461
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,960
Yeah!

462
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,280
Liu.

463
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,680
Say something.

464
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,040
I...

465
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,640
I...

466
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,600
I can't be the kind of representative you guys are talking about.

467
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
I–I am sorry.

468
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,360
Liu, please, don't be so humble.

469
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,000
You're really pretty.

470
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,720
You're a true natural beauty that needs no filter.

471
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,080
Right, guys?

472
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,680
There's nothing natural about me, Faye.

473
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,440
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
I only look like this because...

475
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,880
Because of plastic surgery.

476
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,200
I'm sorry.

477
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,360
What an Academy Award-worthy performance.

478
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,920
Are you happy now?

479
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,400
What do you mean?

480
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,480
To see me tell everyone how I've gone under the knife.

481
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,520
You're approaching me because you recognize me, aren't you?

482
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,040
So you do remember me.

483
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,000
How could I forget being looked down on?

484
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,520
Was that why you got plastic surgery?

485
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,560
So no one would mock you?

486
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,080
If that's the case, then what about it?

487
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,920
It doesn't seem to help, is all.

488
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,040
Plastic surgery?

489
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,840
I honestly couldn't tell.

490
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,040
She should have said something earlier.

491
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:28,840
True.

492
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,360
She just kept quiet.

493
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,040
It's okay, Faye.

494
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,960
We didn't know.

495
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,520
No matter what you do,

496
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,240
people will still find something about you to pick apart.

497
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,200
Even if you're prettier now,

498
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,080
it won't help you with anything.

499
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,600
But it did.

500
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,240
What'd you know?

501
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,400
You think I did all this just to be pretty?

502
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,760
Just so I don't get bullied anymore?

503
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,360
If that's not the reason, then why did you do it?

504
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,480
Because I just want a normal life like everyone else does.

505
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,200
I just want to have friends.

506
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,800
When I looked the way I did before,

507
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,680
I had no one.

508
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,520
We don't need any more members.

509
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,468
(Science Report)

510
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:25,144
I never understand

511
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,120
why everyone made a joke out of my face,

512
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,320
or why that meant I should be alone,

513
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,080
why my parents had to constantly worry about me.

514
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,960
I knew I would get made fun of anyway for getting surgery.

515
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,080
But at least,

516
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,600
I got to experience a normal life like anyone else.

517
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
I finally got to make friends.

518
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,400
That was worth all of it.

519
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,960
Even if it lasted only for a very short time.

520
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,960
If you want to find a friend in someone,

521
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,680
it can't possibly be Faye.

522
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,480
Why not?

523
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,360
She's been nothing but nice to me.

524
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,840
Guys, please don't blame Liu for this.

525
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,960
I still think Liu deserves to be the Hot Girl.

526
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,120
It wasn't her fault that she didn't tell us about her surgery.

527
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:40,871
I actually think it was my fault

528
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:43,232
for not making Liu feel comfortable to share that with us.

529
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:46,760
Faye, you did nothing wrong.

530
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,720
Right?

531
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,200
What should we do about this now?

532
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,960
What if they found out Liu's beauty isn't natural...

533
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,320
Beauty is beauty.

534
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,880
It doesn't matter whether it's artificial or natural.

535
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,520
I want us to be open about this.

536
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,040
For Liu.

537
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,240
Whoa, Faye.

538
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,840
You're really something.

539
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,440
You're such an angel, Faye.

540
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,480
What are we waiting for? Let's give it up for Faye!

541
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,840
Bottoms up.

542
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,760
"Nice"?

543
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,240
I doubt it.

544
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,400
Prima still hasn't shown up.

545
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,520
Maybe she dropped out?

546
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,560
There's an empty seat here.

547
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,387
If she really did drop out,

548
00:35:35,412 --> 00:35:36,903
I guess you're representing our major

549
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,784
as the Hot Girl, together with Guy, that is.

550
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,080
Stop it, you guys.

551
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,400
I don't care about that kind of thing.

552
00:35:42,425 --> 00:35:43,940
(Paid for a full-face surgery for our daughter.)

553
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,477
(She's going to be a beauty now!)

554
00:35:45,502 --> 00:35:46,480
Prima.

555
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,240
I'm glad you're okay.

556
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,640
I'm Faye.

557
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,840
What's your name?

558
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,520
Liu.

559
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,960
This is Liu, our final classmate.

560
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,400
And she's really pretty.

561
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,400
Isn't it unfair how mother nature gave her such a pretty face?

562
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,720
He's coming this way, Liu.

563
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,560
...Two. One!

564
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,600
Hear me out, guys. To represent our Chemistry department,

565
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,800
it isn't just about being born pretty,

566
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,640
but it's about honesty and the determination to be studying here.

567
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,200
What an Academy Award-worthy performance.

568
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,520
Faye.

569
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,960
Hey, watch what you're saying.

570
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,080
Faye didn't know.

571
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,960
If Liu didn't admit it herself, who could even tell?

572
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,480
Did you really not know?

573
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,400
Or did you just act clueless to push Liu to say it herself?

574
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,800
Now you're just asking for it.

575
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,760
Mork, no.

576
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
Come on.

577
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,760
Cool it, Guy.

578
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,400
Why don't you go outside and calm down?

579
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm so sorry.

580
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,040
I really didn't know. It's okay.

581
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,520
Nobody knew.

582
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,040
Guys, let's go ahead and promote Liu as our major's Hot Girl.

583
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,440
Let's do it together for Liu. Of course.

584
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,640
Let's do it.

585
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,640
(Liu is voted Chemistry's Hot Girl. So pretty.)

586
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,360
(We don't judge people for getting plastic surgery here.)

587
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,480
(Liu is the new Hot Girl.)

588
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:31,640
(Liu is the new Hot Girl.)

589
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,400
(Our major has the best girl!

590
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,880
(Beauty is beauty.)

591
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,840
(Let's all vote Liu as our campus belle.)

592
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,800
(Oh, so we're calling plastics beautiful now?)

593
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,040
(What about Faye? Why not go with Faye?)

594
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,000
(Natural beauty VS Plastic beauty)

595
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,280
(Faye deserves this more.)

596
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:42,880
(Why didn't they vote for Faye?)

597
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,120
(Liu? For real?)

598
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,240
(Faye's so pretty.)

599
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,600
(Liu's so fake.)

600
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,240
(It's weird that Faye didn't get the title.)

601
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,720
(I honestly think Faye should win this. Many people voted for her.)

602
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,160
(Faye's prettier.)

603
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,560
(Plastics will never measure up to the real deal.)

604
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,440
I get it now.

605
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,320
You just won't stop ruining my life, will you?

606
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,000
That's why you said that.

607
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,480
What are you talking about?

608
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,200
You have always looked down on me.

609
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,640
Hold on, Liu.

610
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,520
What exactly is the memory of me in your head?

611
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,440
If she said no,

612
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,440
isn't it the right thing to do to let her go?

613

Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

614
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,280
I don't think I'm misunderstanding you.

615
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,840
You're just pretending to be nice to me,

616
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,680
like you did at the perfume store.

617
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,840
I hate it.

618
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,080
You're worse than everyone else.

619
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,560
I just thought it was the only thing I could talk to you about.

620
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,200
Leave me alone.

621
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:44,082
I know we just met and all that, but...

622
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:45,000
I like you, Liu!

623
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,040
You were at the orientation, right?

624
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,080
Tell me about Mac.
