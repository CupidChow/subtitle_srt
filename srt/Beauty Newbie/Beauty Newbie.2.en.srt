1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
But I've got a new face now.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,920
I won't have to go through what I did ever again.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,120
I want to be your friend, Liu.

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,280
Will you be mine?

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,517
I'm worried about you running into someone

6
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,584
from school who might recognize you.

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,680
But I think Liu is the perfect choice for this.

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,440
Now who wants to join me in voting for Liu?

9
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,760
Is there a problem, Guy?

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,000
How could I forget being looked down on?

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,200
If she said no,

12
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,520
isn't it the right thing to do to let her go?

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,800
Are you okay?

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,400
She is okay.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,680
You can leave.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,040
She's my friend and we are just talking.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
I've been watching you two for a while.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,160
I don't think that is what is going on.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,280
She doesn't seem to think you are her friend.

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,400
But this is is none of your business.

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,400
Whether it's my business or not, she should be the one who decides.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,400
Do you still want to talk to him?

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,400
Or do you want me to keep him away?

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
Please keep him away from me.

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,960
Alright.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
Now you know who is unwanted here.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,840
Thank you.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,560
I'm Saint.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,800
Alright, Saint.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
Excuse me.

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,560
Don't blame me for this.

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,960
You should blame yourself.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,080
I think that is none of your business.

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,160
Really?

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
But I think it is.

36
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,280
Nam.

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,200
Yes, Liu.

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
Someone is following me.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,960
Can you help me?

40
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,600
If he acts suspiciously, please call security.

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,800
Hurry and go to your room. I'll handle it.

42
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,720
Go, go, go.

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,560
Aargh!

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,840
(Nam, how is it going?)

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,520
Aren't you tired from running up the stairs?

46
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,400
You!

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,600
Stay away from me.

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,440
What did you do to Nam to be able to come up here?

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,880
I'll call the police.

50
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,160
Nam just let me walk in.

51
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,560
Aargh!

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,960
Please go in.

53
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,480
That can't be true.

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,960
What did you lie to him?

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,280
Nam is so strict.

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,000
There's no way he would let a non-tenant in the building.

57
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,880
Because I'm not a non-tenant.

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,600
I also live here.

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,680
Huh?

60
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,600
You were not following me.

61
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,520
You were just walking back to your room.

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,280
If there's an emergency you don't feel like telling me,

64
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,880
feel free to talk to your next-door neighbor.

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
Baifern Pimchanok

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,200
Win Metawin

67
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,000
Great Sapol

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,120
Jane Ramida

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,680
(BASED ON LINE WEBTOON "MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY" BY KI MAENGGI)

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,480
Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

71
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,427
(Who would have thought that she underwent plastic surgery?)

72
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,840
(I want to see her old face.)

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,982
(It's okay that she wanted to look pretty,)

74
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:57,440
(but why did she have to lie about it?)

75
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,720
(True. When people praised her beauty, she didn't tell them the truth.)

76
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,480
(Maybe she wanted to pretend as if she had never been unpretty.)

77
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,105
(Why did the chemistry department insist on sending her to the contest?)

78
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,129
(Faye is way prettier than her.)

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,680
(Liu's mom is video-calling her)

80
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,760
Hello.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
Dad, look.

82
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
She looks cheerful.

83
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,000
She looks fine.

84
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,560
Has your new and happy chapter of your life begun?

85
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
Mom, I got a message from my friend.

86
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,240
I need to go answer it.

87
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,040
See? She has friends.

88
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
She has friends.

89
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,640
So what?

90
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,880
We have a bet.

91
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,040
- Give me 500 baht. - 	Right now?

92
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,680
Why do you need to take it right away?

93
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,560
Are you placing a bet on my life?

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,000
Dad, did you bet that I would have a bad life?

95
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,640
It was not like that.

96
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,320
I saw that you were selected to be your department's hot girl.

97
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,320
But people still left negative comments about you.

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,200
I was worried that you might be sad because of that.

99
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,480
I told your mom to call you.

100
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,000
But she insisted that these comments could not hurt you.

101
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,920
Yes.

102
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
Is that true?

103
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes, they could not hurt me.

104
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,600
Then who sat sadly in front of the bar last night?

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,880
How long have you been here? Is that Saint, sweetie?

106
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
What happened last night?

107
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,120
Sweetie?

108
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,720
Hello, Dad and Mom.

109
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
Hello.

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,480
Dad and Mom?

111
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,280
Um.

112
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,840
They told me to call them that.

113
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,880
Wait.

114
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,480
What happened last night?

115
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,879
Last night, Liu was criticized by her friends when they found out

116
00:07:43,904 --> 00:07:45,640
that she had plastic surgery.

117
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,640
She went out and sat sadly in front of the bar.

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,760
She was afraid that they would outcast her.

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,360
She is probably still sad.

120
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,480
You have no right to tell my parents about that.

121
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,080
When you called her, she pretended to be fine.

122
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,040
I think she hides a lot of worries inside.

123
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,440
Saint.

124
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,640
What?

125
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,960
If you lie to them, they will be more worried.

126
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,880
How about this?

127
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,360
If you want me to help you lie,

128
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,560
then you need to tell me if something happens to you.

129
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,320
Otherwise, I can't help you lie to your parents.

130
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,280
Why do I need to tell...

131
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,200
He's right.

132
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
If you don't want to talk to me about it, you should go talk to him.

133
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
This way, I won't be too worried about you. Okay?

134
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,040
Why are you talking like you've known him for a long time?

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,640
You only met him once yesterday. I can feel that he is a good person.

136
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,040
Look at his good physiognomy.

137
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,040
His eyes are sweet.

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,280
His nose is tall.

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,400
That's not a good physiognomy.

140
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,800
It is called good looks.

141
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,560
You just like good-looking guys.

142
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,720
Anyway.

143
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,400
If you don't want to tell me about it, you should go talk to Saint.

144
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,240
If you don't want to talk to Saint, you need to tell me the truth.

145
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,920
If you don't talk to anyone about it, we will be worried about you.

146
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,880
Do you get it?

147
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,120
It means that you carry the world on your shoulders.

148
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
That is not okay.

149
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,760
I get it.

150
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,440
Think about what you want to do.

151
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Now, I have decided.

152
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,800
Mom, give the 500 baht back to me.

153
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,920
- Give it back. - What?

154
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,760
- You took my money. - No.

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,160
What will you do?

156
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,920
Are you going to talk to your mom or me?

157
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,880
What did you do to make my parents completely trust you?

158
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,640
I didn't do anything.

159
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,280
They make me feel that I need to be cautious around you.

160
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,160
Huh?

161
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,920
They don't act close with me because they trust me.

162
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
It's more like a warning.

163
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
Now they know me. I shouldn't do anything bad to their daughter.

164
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,880
Yesterday, they were investigating me.

165
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,040
They probably searched for all the information about me.

166
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,040
What are you going to do?

167
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,920
Are you going to talk to your mom or me?

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,960
I...

169
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,840
How about this?

170
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,560
In the meantime, if that guy bothers you again, you need to tell me.

171
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,000
Who?

172
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,240
The guy from last night.

173
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,040
Guy.

174
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,280
Yes, him.

175
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,240
Remember this.

176
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,560
If you have an emergency, you can always tell me.

177
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,480
Alright.

178
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,880
Since you agree to do that.

179
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,040
Then...

180
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,760
(Saint sent an emoji to her phone.)

181
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,520
That was fast.

182
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,381
(I don't think you need to worry too much.)

183
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:06,480
(You seem to have a good friend.)

184
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,472
(dedew.sxx: How can you call her pretty? Her entire face is fake.)

185
00:11:08,497 --> 00:11:15,664
(fayejourney: Whether it's natural beauty or not, she still looks pretty!)

186
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,600
(Thank you for being the first friend in my life.)

187
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,720
Are you full now?

188
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,120
Come on.

189
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,640
Why aren't you eating? Are you full?

190
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,120
Faye.

191
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,720
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about my plastic surgery.

192
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,200
Were you negatively affected by defending me?

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
No.

194
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,880
I should be the one apologizing to you for giving a big speech about you.

195
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
I'm very sorry.

196
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,480
If I knew the truth, I wouldn't have said the things I said.

197
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,400
Are we still friends?

198
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,600
Of course.

199
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,480
Faye, you are the first friend I have in my life.

200
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,440
Here.

201
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,360
I have your friendship book with me.

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,440
I haven't written it but I booked a page for myself.

203
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
Give it to many friends to write messages to you.

204
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,840
Um.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,560
You need to smile a lot.

206
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,640
You are now the representative of our department.

207
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,120
Go out and make them see that you are beautiful.

208
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,080
I want to talk to you about this.

209
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm not going to join the hot girl contest.

210
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,080
Why?

211
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,000
I think you...

212
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,120
If more people know the truth,

213
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,280
they will try to dig into my past to see my old face.

214
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,040
I don't want them to see it.

215
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,080
I don't want people to know.

216
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,920
I'm sorry.

217
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,760
My arrangement stresses you out again.

218
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,640
It's okay.

219
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,320
I know you have good intentions.

220
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,320
I'll drop out of it.

221
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,640
I think dropping out is not enough.

222
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
If it causes you so much trouble,

223
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,000
we should cancel the contest.

224
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,760
A beauty contest is ridiculous.

225
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,040
Why do we need to compete to see who is the prettiest?

226
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,760
Wow.

227
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,960
You are so cool.

228
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,560
No.

229
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,715
I'll gather signatures from our friends to

230
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,744
submit a petition to the student society.

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,960
Mimi told me that she wanted you to recommend a perfume for her.

232
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,560
Really?

233
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,800
She said she liked the perfume that you usually wear.

234
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,240
Jannyne.

235
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,960
I always carry it around with me.

236
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,560
Guy.

237
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,200
Can I borrow your T-shirt?

238
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,360
You are not borrowing it.

239
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,360
You are stealing it to sell.

240
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm borrowing it.

241
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,480
I'm not stealing it.

242
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,440
If you are going to sell it, then sell your own clothes.

243
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,080
Most of my fans are men.

244
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,600
Why would they buy my clothes?

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,240
Anyway, I'm borrowing it.

246
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,160
I'll return it to you later.

247
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,440
You just won't stop ruining my life, will you?

248
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,960
What exactly is the memory of me in your head?

249
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,280
Hello, everyone.

250
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,360
Welcome to the Spring Day channel.

251
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,760
Today, we are going to talk about traumatic experiences.

252
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,760
Please leave messages telling me about your traumatic experiences.

253
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,280
I believe that we all went through an experience that we can't forget.

254
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,280
Please share it with me.

255
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,680
Fa07 said her unforgettable experience was about her first love

256
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,480
How can a girl like you be interested in perfumes?

257
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,640
Why can't a girl like me be interested in perfumes?

258
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,480
Only pretty girls can do that, right?

259
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,800
I didn't mean that.

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
I was just surprised.

261
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,440
Since you like perfumes,

262
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,640
can you go to a place with me?

263
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,040
Hello.

264
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,160
Are you looking for any perfumes in particular?

265
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,080
It's okay.

266
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,080
She is an expert.

267
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,040
Alright. Please feel free to look around.

268
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,760
Sure.

269
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,360
Do you know every perfume?

270
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,600
Not really.

271
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,880
But you've been studying it for a long time, right?

272
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,120
Yes.

273
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,440
I...

274
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,200
I want you to help me find a perfume.

275
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,760
What does it smell like?

276
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,640
I don't know how to explain.

277
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,400
Does it smell floral, fruity, or woody?

278
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,640
I don't know.

279
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,480
Can you describe the person who uses the perfume?

280
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,800
Maybe I can guess the perfume that the person uses.

281
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,360
She was a very confident woman.

282
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,400
She was probably very talented and smart.

283
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I have a few perfumes in mind.

284
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,000
Is it the one you are looking for?

285
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,760
Is the perfume used by someone important to you?

286
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,760
Kind of.

287
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,760
Liu.

288
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Are you okay?

289
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
I heard that you left early last night.

290
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,600
I'm okay.

291
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,800
I feel much better now.

292
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,720
I dropped out of the contest and we are going to submit a petition.

293
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,800
Faye helped me with that.

294
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,360
Yes, we have gathered a lot of signatures.

295
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,480
Mac, why are you only asking about Liu?

296
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,200
It's nothing.

297
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,480
Saint asked me to look after Liu.

298
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
You know Saint?

299
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,760
Why do you have to do what Saint has requested?

300
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,560
I'm not only doing what he asked me to do.

301
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,040
I also want to do it myself.

302
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh!

303
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,760
Isn't she strange?

304
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,320
I'm talking about Faye.

305
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,680
I have a bad feeling about her since the orientation.

306
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,080
It's great that you also feel the same way about her.

307
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Do you remember me?

308
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,280
Do you know my name?

309
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,960
Yes.

310
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,120
Wow, our department's hot guy knows my name.

311
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,760
You went to the orientation.

312
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,760
Can you tell me about Mac?

313
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,840
Thank you everyone for joining the petition.

314
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,280
It's going to be okay, Liu.

315
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,920
Thank you, Faye.

316
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Of course, I signed it.

317
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,520
Whatever Faye asks me to do, I'll do it.

318
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,080
That's sweet of you.

319
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,360
Thank you, Mork.

320
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,360
Unlike someone who never gave any cooperation in anything.

321
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,800
You gave a big speech pushing her to be the hot girl.

322
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,320
Now, you changed your mind.

323
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,640
Isn't that strange?

324
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,920
Are you complaining because you still want to be the hot guy?

325
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,280
You are an attention-seeker.

326
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,840
No, you are an attention-seeker.

327
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Guy, you jerk.

328
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,360
Are you crazy? No, you are crazy.

329
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Students, what are you doing?

330
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
Go take your seat.

331
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,600
Why do I want to ship them after seeing them arguing?

332
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,200
Shipping them?

333
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,200
You need to show some respect to her man here.

334
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,480
Am I right, Jerry?

335
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,240
Yes.

336
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,120
A pretty girl like Faye is way too good for Guy.

337
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,320
Well said.

338
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,640
She's also too good for you.

339
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,120
Today is our first laboratory class.

340
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll explain the basic rules when using this room.

341
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,600
First of all, you need to tie your hair.

342
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Button your lab coat all the way up.

343
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,840
Wear your gloves.

344
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,153
The most important rule is that no food

345
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,824
and water are allowed in this room.

346
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,480
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,360
I'll get ready for the lab.

348
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,400
I somehow feel guilty for joining the petition.

349
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,400
We should have sent Faye to the contest.

350
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,520
Faye is so pretty.

351
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,960
Should we go grab something to eat?

352
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,320
You guys can go first.

353
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,320
I need to talk to the professor.

354
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,880
Bye.

355
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
See you.

356
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,040
Liu.

357
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,720
Can I talk to you?

358
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,040
I want to warn you about Mac.

359
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,600
I heard that he likes to flirt around.

360
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
That's how he got his nickname "Body-count Mac".

361
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,320
Who do you think you are to say bad things about other people?

362
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
I think you are worse than him.

363
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,240
Liu.

364
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,200
Liu.

365
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,440
Stop it.

366
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,360
I don't get why you are doing this.

367
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,920
Do you really don't know why?

368
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,080
What do you want from me?

369
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
Why can't you let me have a good life?

370
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,000
It's not like that.

371
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,320
You are misunderstanding me.

372
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,320
I'm not misunderstanding you.

373
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
I think I know you well enough.

374
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,040
You just pretend to be nice to me.

375
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,800
Just like when we went to the perfume store.

376
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,760
I want you to help me find a perfume.

377
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,880
Is it the one you are looking for?

378
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,400
Yes.

379
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,520
Really?

380
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,040
Do you know that this perfume changed my life?

381
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,560
I love it.

382
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,760
You also like it, don't you?

383
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,800
That's why you asked me to help you find it.

384
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,520
No.

385
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,720
I hate it.

386
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
You didn't share the same interests as me.

387
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,880
Even though you had never helped me when I was bullied.

388
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,080
Go in.

389
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,000
Stop resisting.

390
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,840
Open the door. I can't breathe.

391
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
I still thought we could be friends.

392
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,800
But the truth was

393
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
you took me to the store

394
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:08,120
to say bad things

395
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:11,464
about the perfume that inspired me to be interested in perfumes.

396
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,960
This perfume is so ugly.

397
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,960
But it's good to know.

398
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Now I know what the ugliest perfume looks like.

399
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,720
You are the most evil one.

400
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,080
Other kids were only teasing me about my looks.

401
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,280
But you looked down on who I was and what I liked.

402
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,640
It was not like that.

403
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,520
Then what was it?

404
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Why did you say that to me?

405
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,760
The woman that I hate uses this perfume.

406
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,760
To be honest, I have no interest in perfumes.

407
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,320
I don't know how to start a conversation with you.

408
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,320
I'm sorry.

409
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,880
I thought that was the only way I could start a conversation with you.

410
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,880
I thought that the topic would help us become friends.

411
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,280
Friends?

412
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,952
If you wanted to be my friend,

413
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:10,920
you should have helped me when I was bullied.

414
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,320
But you had never done that.

415
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,000
Liu has passed out.

416
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,440
Ouch!

417
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,200
Damned it. What the hell is wrong with you?

418
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,080
Nothing.

419
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,920
I'm just getting rid of trash.

420
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,440
I'll make you pay for this.

421
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,080
Liu.

422
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,960
Liu.

423
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,440
Now, I got it.

424
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,000
You said I have no right to say bad things about other people.

425
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,400
Because I was the most terrible person in your eyes.

426
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,480
I don't get it.

427
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,200
What do you want from me?

428
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,200
I want you to be happy.

429
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,720
I don't want you to go through what you experienced in school.

430
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,520
The ghost face has resigned from school.

431
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,680
Do you know what you need to do?

432
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,800
Stay away from me.

433
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,800
Can you do that for me as a friend?

434
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm begging you.

435
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,680
If that will put you at ease,

436
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,120
I'll do it.

437
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,160
Are you okay, Liu?

438
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,160
What were you arguing about?

439
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,960
I'm okay.

440
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
I'll take you home today.

441
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,360
Thank you, Mac.

442
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,440
Guys.

443
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,640
I made up my mind.

444
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
I will ask Liu out on a date.

445
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,080
Didn't you say you like Faye?

446
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,000
Then why you are asking Liu out?

447
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,200
Guys, Faye has over 100,000 followers.

448
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,560
She is too prominent.

449
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,240
She is out of my league.

450
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,600
I need to consider my success rate if I'm going to ask someone out.

451
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,640
Liu doesn't seem to have high confidence.

452
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,240
I think I have a higher chance with her than with Faye

453
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,720
who has received over a hundred love confessions.

454
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,680
So this is a secret tip of Body-count Mac.

455
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,480
Stop calling me by that nickname.

456
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,880
Wait.

457
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,680
Didn't Saint ask you to look after Liu?

458
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,040
Don't overthink it.

459
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
It's not like I will treat her badly.

460
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,000
Let's go.

461
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,120
Now?

462
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,120
Yes.

463
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,080
Aren't you going to warn her?

464
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,160
I can help keep Faye away.

465
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,440
No.

466
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,680
Are you that confident that you don't need my help?

467
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,320
No.

468
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,040
I'll stay out of it.

469
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,840
Huh?

470
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:42,880
But...

471
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,520
You don't need to say anything.

472
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,720
I'll really stay out of it.

473
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,800
Last night, I watched a series.

474
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,520
It was so good.

475
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,840
The leading actor was so handsome.

476
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,920
What is the title of the series?

477
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,440
The leading actor was gorgeous.

478
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,040
You should pay attention to the story, not to the actor.

479
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,640
Mac.

480
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,520
Are you here to see someone in particular?

481
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,680
Can I talk to Liu for a minute?

482
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,040
If things turn out well, I'll buy you guys lunch.

483
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
What things?

484
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,640
Mimi, you are slow-witted.

485
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,400
Watch them.

486
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,960
Liu.

487
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,320
I have something to tell you.

488
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,800
You may think it's too soon.

489
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,840
It probably is.

490
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,680
But I think...

491
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,560
I should hurry and tell you this.

492
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,480
I...

493
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,360
I like you.

494
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
What?

495
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
I know that we've known each other for only a short while.

496
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,840
But I am ready to take care of you.

497
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,560
If you're hungry, I'll run to buy you food.

498
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,600
If you feel tired, I will...

499
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,600
I will buy you more food.

500
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,280
Is he confessing his love to her?

501
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,280
Yes.

502
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Mimi, how slow is your brain?

503
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,880
Is this a good thing?

504
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,400
His nickname is Body-count Mac.

505
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,760
He's not a good guy.

506
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,000
He didn't get the nickname for dumping dozens of girls.

507
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,160
He got it because he was rejected by dozens of girls.

508
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,120
Huh?

509
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,200
Mac is inexperienced about love.

510
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,960
His friends tease him about it.

511
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,653
It becomes harder for him to find a girlfriend.

512
00:34:01,678 --> 00:34:03,411
Doesn't it mean that this will be

513
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:06,264
the first relationship for both of them?

514
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,280
Yes.

515
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,880
That's cute.

516
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm rooting for them.

517
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,720
Me, too.

518
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,120
That's why I didn't say anything.

519
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,120
Faye, you know about this, right?

520
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,800
Umm.

521
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
Mac, did you say you like me?

522
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Yes.

523
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,360
I like you.

524
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,280
I like you very much.

525
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,560
I like you so much that I want to tell you right away.

526
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,080
Liu, what do you think?

527
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,600
I...

528
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,200
I...

529
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,000
I need to go to the toilet.

530
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,640
Liu.

531
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,880
Liu.

532
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,080
Liu, hurry back.

533
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,120
Faye.

534
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,920
What's up?

535
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,120
Can I ask you something?

536
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,800
Yes.

537
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,040
I...

538
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,320
If I tell you that I don't want you to go out with Liu,

539
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,080
will you be mad at me?

540
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,400
What do you mean?

541
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,840
I...

542
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,400
I like you.

543
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,920
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said it.

544
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,760
I think this may be my last chance to tell you.

545
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,080
I hope you are happy with Liu.

546
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,080
Liu.

547
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,440
She has never received a love confession before.

548
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,520
She must be very excited.

549
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,800
She won't let this chance slip away.

550
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,360
I hope you are happy with Liu.

551
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,240
Faye.

552
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,720
Faye.

553
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,200
Faye, wait.

554
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,280
Faye.

555
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,920
What did you say to Mac?

556
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,120
I wish them to have a long-lasting relationship.

557
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,240
I...

558
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,080
Mac.

559
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,840
I'm ready to give you my answer.

560
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,200
Liu.

561
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,040
I want to go out with you.

562
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,000
I think I also like...

563
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,040
Liu!

564
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,720
Liu, what are you talking about? You must have misheard me.

565
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,440
You said you like me. Huh?

566
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,760
Liu, you misheard it.

567
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
Didn't you say you like me?

568
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,800
I said that?

569
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,080
I didn't say it.

570
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,120
Liu.

571
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,760
Are you imagining things?

572
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,320
Don't take it seriously.

573
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,040
How should I put it?

574
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,560
I just...

575
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,760
I just practiced my lines for the university's theatre.

576
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,040
I wanted to see if you had the potential to be the leading actress.

577
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,760
That was all.

578
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,560
Do you think I really asked you out?

579
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,840
Are you crying? Your acting is pretty good.

580
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,800
I think you will pass the audition.

581
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,840
Liu, come on.

582
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,200
You're making me look bad.

583
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,120
Don't take it seriously.

584
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,200
There are many men out there.

585
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,800
You shouldn't be so easy to men.

586
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,400
Mac, how can you say that to her?

587
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
- Liu. - Faye.

588
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,560
Liu.

589
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,320
Faye.

590
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,280
Faye.

591
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,600
Faye.

592
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,440
Sorry.

593
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,080
My leg suddenly jerked.

594
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,880
Directed by Aticha Tanthanawigrai

595
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,920
There's another person who is even more distrustful.

596
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,400
Do you know Saint?

597
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,680
This guy's bad news, Prof.

598
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,640
He'll even pick fights with women.

599
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,640
Be careful of her.

600
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,480
Guy can't seem to leave you alone.

601
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,120
Was there some history between you two?

602
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,920
Let's go out.

603
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,880
As long as Liu is here,

604
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,600
there is no way, Mac.

605
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,160
Isn't fooling people your area of expertise?

606
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,440
You fool people into thinking that you're beautiful

607
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:53,440
when your actual face looks like...
