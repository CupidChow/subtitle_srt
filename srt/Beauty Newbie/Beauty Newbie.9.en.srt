1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:01,627
Guy confessed his love to you, didn’t he?

2
00:00:01,827 --> 00:00:03,427
In the office, while you were watching the fireworks.

3
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:05,867
But I can’t date him.

4
00:00:06,387 --> 00:00:07,387
Even if you try to push him away,

5
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,826
he will come back to you as a new person and

6
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:11,427
you’ll fall even harder for him.

7
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:14,186
If you want Guy to back down,

8
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:16,747
and give up on his hope to step up his relationship with you…

9
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:19,586
Are you saying that we should pretend to date?

10
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:20,987
I want to date you for real.

11
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:40,987
I don’t need an answer right away.

12
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,707
I just want you to think about it.

13
00:00:44,747 --> 00:00:46,907
You might not think of me that way,

14
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:49,987
but…

15
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:52,707
That’s how I always think of you..

16
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:06,027
[I’ve been meaning to send you these but I kept forgetting.]

17
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:17,387
I thought talking to you would make me feel better…

18
00:01:18,347 --> 00:01:19,587
What even is going on?

25
00:02:45,393 --> 00:02:46,513
Thanks, Saint.

26
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,073
I didn’t know you’re a morning person.

27
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,233
Oh, not really.

28
00:02:51,873 --> 00:02:52,873
I just couldn’t sleep.

29
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:54,113
Well, you see…

30
00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:55,553
I just confessed to you last night.

31
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,713
This isn’t the time and place to be saying that out loud, you know?

32
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:02,153
What?

33
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:03,353
But it’s true.

34
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,713
I just want to reassure you that I meant what I said.

35
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,313
But why are you reassuring me here where everyone can hear us?

36
00:03:12,913 --> 00:03:14,633
If you keep getting closer to me like that,

37
00:03:15,313 --> 00:03:17,953
people will only keep staring, though.

38
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,833
They’re probably thinking we’re…

39
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:22,513
Being lovey-dovey.

40
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:45,633
That one is occupied.

41
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:47,313
I can see that it’s empty.

42
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:50,233
Excuse me, then.

43
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:51,993
Hold on, Liu.

44
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:54,033
Don’t forget to put the infused water in the refrigerator.

45
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:55,473
Okay.

46
00:04:09,753 --> 00:04:11,113
Did the date go well yesterday?

47
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,193
Hey.

48
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:28,553
Is this the face of a man going on a date?

49
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:34,633
What’s happened?

50
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:54,033
[Sorry but I can’t.]

51
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,233
Crap. For real?

52
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:00,633
But we put so much effort into planning that.

53
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:02,833
It’s okay, dude.

54
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:04,273
Don’t get discouraged.

55
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:05,249
Let’s try again.

56
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:06,273
The fight isn’t over.

57
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,113
How many more times are you going to keep sighing?

58
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,113
How could I not?

59
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,113
Do you have any idea what I had to go through this morning?

60
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:15,593
What happened?

61
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:18,433
If you’re not answering me,

62
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:20,433
I guess it didn’t go very well, did it?

63
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:27,633
Right on the money, huh?

64
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,233
Hey.

65
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,913
Oh, dear.

66
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:36,113
Your survival skill is really zero, isn’t it?

67
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,449
Look.

68
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:40,633
You’re supposed to turn dark clothes inside out before putting them in the machine.

69
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,513
Otherwise they would fade quickly when you hang them to dry in the sun.

70
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:43,913
- Here. - Hand it back.

71
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:45,273
I’ll do it myself.

72
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,313
These are dirty.

73
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:47,993
It’s alright.

74
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,713
I can wash my hands afterwards.

75
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:52,633
I can’t stand it if the laundry isn't thoroughly washed.

76
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:57,753
What the hell?

77
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,313
Buy some more clothes with colors, why don’t you?

78
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:05,513
Change things up a bit.

79
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,873
It looks more special on a date, you know?

80
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,753
Come grab some hangers from my room after this.

81
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,913
My hangers don’t stretch the fabric.

82
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,113
Wait.

83
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:17,633
Do you have an iron?

84
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:21,153
I’ll send you to my go-to laundry shop.

85
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,633
They always give me a discount.

86
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:23,953
It’ll save you money.

87
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,033
What is this?

88
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:32,313
I’m not asking you to pay me back what you owe me or anything.

89
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:35,033
Just pay me when you can.

90
00:06:35,713 --> 00:06:36,713
I’ll be sure to keep the interest low.

91
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,433
Bye.

92
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,033
Wait.

93
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:42,753
What do you want?

94
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:48,193
It’s alright now.

95
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:49,833
What?

96
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:52,913
What the hell?

97
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,073
What do you think that means?

98
00:06:58,633 --> 00:07:00,873
What did you ask him before that again?

99
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:02,753
I asked about the date.

100
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,233
I asked him how the date with Liu went.

101
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,633
From the way he acts,

102
00:07:09,313 --> 00:07:11,033
and Liu’s returning that bag,

103
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:15,113
I feel like he’s trying to be nice to console you.

104
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:19,913
You know, like, he’s confident that he’s already won.

105
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,273
Huh?

106
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:25,513
How could he be the winner here when I confessed first?

107
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:28,753
But you were slow in asking her out on a date, dude.

108
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,553
Should I ask again?

109
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:36,033
When she just turned you down?

110
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:39,713
What should I do, then?

111
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:46,273
Aren’t you taking the Pop Culture course?

112
00:07:49,113 --> 00:07:54,313
For the next assignment, you are to write an essay based on a film.

113
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:58,713
Work in pairs and choose whatever film you like.

114
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:03,113
Analyze the film in an essay…

115
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:07,513
Write your names down in this form in pairs.

116
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:33,433
Paula, can we work together?

117
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,513
Oh, I can’t.

118
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:36,553
I plan to pair up with my boyfriend.

119
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,633
You can work with Mimi.

120
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,113
Oh, that’s great.

121
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:41,473
What do you say?

122
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:42,489
I… I already paired up with someone else

123
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:43,169
Oh?

124
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:44,233
Who?

125
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:46,113
Who else from our year is taking this course?

126
00:08:46,273 --> 00:08:47,833
Oh, they’re not from our year.

127
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,153
But it’s alright, Liu.

128
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,513
I’ll find someone for you.

129
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:56,833
Oh, hey, perfect timing.

130
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,113
Guy, do you have a partner for your assignment yet?

131
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:00,713
Do you want to work with Liu?

132
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,513
Oh, I don’t think so.

133
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:05,033
Guy’s probably already paired up with Ann. Right?

134
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:08,713
Actually, Ann isn’t taking this course.

135
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:09,913
I don’t have anyone yet.

136
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:12,033
You don’t as well, right?

137
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:13,313
Good.

138
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:14,713
Then you guys can pair up.

139
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:18,312
Err, but I don’t think we…

140
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:19,913
Why? Do you have something against Guy?

141
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:22,393
No, I don’t.

142
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:23,393
Sure.

143
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:24,833
I can work with Guy. No problem.

144
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:25,609
Okay, then.

145
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,073
I’m glad you found a partner.

146
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:28,313
We have to go, though. Bye.

147
00:09:28,313 --> 00:09:29,313
You guys work nicely, okay?

148
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:30,793
Let’s go.

149
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,993
How does Saturday sound?

150
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,833
I have class on Saturday.

151
00:09:38,873 --> 00:09:40,273
I can meet you in the evening.

152
00:09:42,353 --> 00:09:43,353
Umm.

153
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:50,833
That was a close call, but you did it.

154
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,113
Good job, buddy.

155
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:58,233
Next up, you must make this a special film-watching experience for her.

156
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,633
And I mean before the film, during the film, and after the film.

157
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:03,993
Do you understand?

158
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:06,393
I already know that.

159
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:09,833
Professor Ann wrote some cue cards for you, kiddo.

160
00:10:09,873 --> 00:10:10,873
Skim through it.

161
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,913
I put a lot of effort into this, you know?

162
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,833
The most important thing here is that during the film,

163
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:21,713
you have to do whatever it takes to hold her hand.

164
00:10:29,353 --> 00:10:30,513
Don’t be shy, alright?

165
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:36,233
And after that, you must take her out to a romantic dinner.

166
00:10:41,593 --> 00:10:42,593
But…

167
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:47,633
You know going on a date is expensive, right?

168
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:51,833
But you have to pay for it.

169
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:53,632
It’s gotta be your treat.

170
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:57,633
Make sure she knows you’re not here as just a friend.

171
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:00,473
Do you have money?

172
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:12,073
Oh…

173
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:15,873
Is your ego so big that you can’t even ask your parents for some money?

174
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:18,713
How hard can it be to make some money?

00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:55,769
I can’t afford this.

370
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:00,369
I’m taking you here because I want to treat you.

371
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,169
Why would you do that?

372
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:05,769
Because I want to.

373
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:08,529
We’re here for class assignment.

374
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:10,049
This is too much.

375
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:15,769
Does it matter what we’re here for when we’re already here?

376
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,409
I just want to treat you to something delicious.

377
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:22,009
Please, don’t do this.

378
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,169
That should be my line.

379
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:27,169
I just want to hang out with you.

380
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:28,769
I just want it to be a good day.

381
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:30,969
Why can’t you just give me a chance?

382
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:36,529
Don’t tell me you’re already dating Saint.

383
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:40,609
No.

384
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:43,569
Then why are you alright with giving him a chance but not me?

385
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:46,409
I just want to buy you dinner.

386
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:48,369
I want to make it a good day.

387
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:51,089
Can you let me do that?

388
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:55,009
Excuse me.

389
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:13,689
Because I know what will happen if we fall in love.

390
00:26:15,329 --> 00:26:15,889
Look.

391
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,689
Isn’t that man so good-looking?

392
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,369
His girlfriend’s also pretty. They’re perfect for each other.

393
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:20,265
No way!

394
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,889
Don’t you know about that scandal on Twitter about the Chemistry major?

395
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,649
That girl is a friend of Faye’s.

396
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:27,209
They said her whole face is plastic.

397
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:32,089
I may look different,

398
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:35,729
but everyone will still say the same thing…

399
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,969
I think it’s worth it.

400
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:38,289
For her, yeah.

401
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:41,569
Too bad for the guy, though, for getting something fake.

402
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:46,969
We’re not perfect for each other.

403
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:59,168
I’ll take two crab cakes.

404
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,569
Two soups.

405
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:05,369
And also one ribeye steak, medium rare…

406
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:06,449
Oh, Liu.

407
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:09,089
Would you like fish or lobster?

408
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,169
Let’s go with two ribeye steaks.

409
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:15,008
And chocolate mousse for dessert, please.

410
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:15,769
[Budget: -2650]

411
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,769
Of course. [Budget: -2650]

412
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:19,769
Wait.

413
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:21,409
Why did you order so much food?

414
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,769
I just want to do what I want to do

415
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:27,249
without caring what anyone thinks.

416
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:36,489
That’s what you’ve been thinking about the whole day, right?

417
00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:38,249
That’s why you’ve been acting weird with me all day.

418
00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:42,969
Why should the way other people think of us matter more than what we want to do?

419
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,089
And does what you want to do, like ordering too much food,

420
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:48,889
make sense to your wallet?

421
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,889
Your mother told me you refused to take her money.

422
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:55,529
So why are you treating me to all these?

423
00:27:57,729 --> 00:27:58,729
What?

424
00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:01,889
You ordered so much food, but can you even pay for it?

425
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:03,489
You owe Saint some money, too, don’t you?

426
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:05,529
Your mother told me everything.

427
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:07,265
Hang on.

428
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:08,145
No way.

429
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:09,889
Get up right now and go cancel that order.

430
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:10,969
Quickly.

431
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:15,369
So the reason you’ve been refusing me to pay all day

432
00:28:15,609 --> 00:28:17,409
is not because you’re not giving me a chance,

433
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:20,809
but because you’re worried about my financial issue?

434
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:23,089
What?

435
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,649
Sir, how much is this?

436
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:25,729
20 baht.

437
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:27,648
Can you keep it for me for now?

438
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:28,889
I’ll come get it after the film.

439
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:32,889
One more, please.

440
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,289
Congratulations.

441
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:40,569
You’re worried about me, aren’t you?

442
00:28:43,145 --> 00:28:45,145
No, that’s not right!

443
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:48,225
How many times do I have to explain that I didn’t know it all this time,

444
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:50,064
but found out just now in the restroom in the restaurant?

445
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:52,145
Your mother called me because she was going to drop off some food for you,

446
00:28:52,185 --> 00:28:53,041
but you didn’t answer her calls.

447
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,585
So she called me instead.

448
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:55,705
Yes, Ms. Linda?

449
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:57,185
(Liu, dear.)

450
00:28:57,225 --> 00:28:58,585
Are you at your dorm?

451
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:02,105
Guy won’t answer the phone, and I’m here with some food.

452
00:29:02,385 --> 00:29:04,305
Can you give it to him?

453
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:06,745
I’m sorry.

454
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,025
I’m outside.

455
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:10,505
(Oh, is that right?)

456
00:29:10,745 --> 00:29:11,385
It’s okay.

457
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:12,905
I’ll try Saint.

458
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:17,065
I’m bringing him food and I don’t want it to go bad.

459
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:19,825
Guy needs it because he’s a bit tight on cash right now.

460
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:23,505
What did you just say?

461
00:29:24,145 --> 00:29:26,384
That was when I knew you’re broke,

462
00:29:26,385 --> 00:29:28,585
and that you still owe Saint for the deposit for the dorm.

463
00:29:28,705 --> 00:29:31,225
Do you hear me that I learned that just now, not all day?

464
00:29:32,345 --> 00:29:33,345
Oh, right.

465
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,705
It’s not like men must pay for dates nowadays.

466
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:39,184
It’s still a date even if we split the bill.

467
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:40,665
Are you even listening to me?

468
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:45,025
I’m sorry for making you feel uncomfortable all day.

469
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,225
That’s not the point.

470
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:52,625
Speaking of which, what does your Ms. Linda have for us?

471
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:53,785
I’m getting hungry.

472
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,505
You’re not listening to me.

473
00:29:55,945 --> 00:29:56,945
- You’re not. - Ouch.

474
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:03,481
Ms. Linda.

475
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:04,025
Yes?

476
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:08,905
Can you please tell Guy I really just found out he doesn’t have money?

477
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:10,105
Of course.

478
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:11,761
Guy.

479
00:30:11,785 --> 00:30:15,745
Liu asked me to tell you she just found out you don’t have any money.

480
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:18,304
Did she?

481
00:30:18,305 --> 00:30:19,305
Yes.

482
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:24,705
And now you’re going to think I asked your mother to lobby for me.

483
00:30:24,745 --> 00:30:25,865
Didn’t you?

484
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:29,265
Come on.

485
00:30:29,505 --> 00:30:31,105
It’s no big deal.

486
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:32,665
It is quite a big deal, actually.

487
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:33,825
Hey.

488
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,584
Are you two hungry?

489
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,344
Have you guys had dinner?

490
00:30:39,345 --> 00:30:40,945
Not at all.

491
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:44,145
Because his guy ordered the most expensive dishes ever.

492
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,905
We had to cancel our order and leave as fast as we could.

493
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:48,465
Think about it.

494
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:51,144
He didn’t have any money but still wouldn’t stop ordering dish after dish.

495
00:30:51,145 --> 00:30:52,985
Because you’ve already been splitting the bills with me all day.

496
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,385
But did you have enough money for that dinner?

497
00:30:54,465 --> 00:30:56,785
So you haven’t had anything to eat?

498
00:30:58,305 --> 00:31:00,905
Alright, Guy. Go grab some plates.

499
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:04,505
Liu, help me get all the food ready.

500
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:05,905
Quickly, Guy, dear.

501
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:11,625
Guy, dear?

502
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:13,025
Oh…

503
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:19,385
I don’t have anything.

504
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:24,305
Thanks.

505
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:32,025
You don’t have to return the plates any time soon.

506
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:33,105
I just feel bad for you now.

507
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:34,665
This is embarrassing for you, Guy.

508
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:37,865
Your survival skill is below zero.

509
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:39,945
And you still refused my money?

510
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:42,025
Who knows I need plates?

511
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:43,905
- Everybody does! - Everybody does!

512
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:46,505
Look at you.

513
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:49,225
Liu has to take care of you.

514
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:51,425
And you still refuse to let me help.

515
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:53,825
Don’t treat me like a kid.

516
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:55,505
I’m working part-time now, you know?

517
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:57,705
I’ll have money to buy plates in no time.

518
00:31:58,345 --> 00:31:59,345
Working part-time?

519
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:00,865
As a tutor.

520
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:02,705
Can I help?

521
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:05,305
I have someone who’s in need of a tutor.

522
00:32:05,945 --> 00:32:06,921
Who is that?

523
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:07,945
Gale.

524
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:10,121
I refuse.

525
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:11,145
I’m picky with my clients.

526
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,305
I pay 1000 baht an hour.

527
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:17,465
When can we start?

528
00:32:19,185 --> 00:32:20,504
Guy, I’m not joking.

529
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,105
I’m being serious.

530
00:32:22,385 --> 00:32:24,784
You have to make your sister better.

531
00:32:24,785 --> 00:32:25,425
I’ll be keeping an eye on you.

532
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:26,985
I’ll tell you when we start.

533
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:28,705
Okay.

534
00:32:31,505 --> 00:32:33,985
Well, how was your day?

535
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:37,985
I won that one from a Can Toss game.

536
00:32:38,825 --> 00:32:40,904
Oh, Liu. That must have been a big prize.

537
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,145
What did you get, Guy?

538
00:32:43,185 --> 00:32:44,305
This.

539
00:32:46,825 --> 00:32:47,905
That’s it?

540
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:50,225
I missed the targets.

541
00:32:51,465 --> 00:32:53,625
This was your first time watching a film in an outdoor cinema, right?

542
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:54,841
Right.

543
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:56,825
And I bet he doesn’t often take tuk-tuk.

544
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,225
He tipped generously.

545
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:01,185
Thank you, Liu.

546
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:04,585
If it wasn’t for you, Guy wouldn’t have become so mature.

547
00:33:05,785 --> 00:33:06,785
Try this.

548
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,625
Thank you.

549
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:11,745
Thank you.

550
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:16,345
Are you guys done with your food?

551
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,425
There’s ice-cream in the freezer. Would you like some?

552
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:19,865
It’s okay.

553
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:22,025
I’ll wash the dishes and return them to Liu first.

554
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:24,225
Do you even know how to do that?

555
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:26,625
I’m not stupid, you know?

556
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:27,641
Let me.

557
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:28,745
Do you have any dish soap?

558
00:33:30,985 --> 00:33:32,305
I knew you wouldn’t.

559
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:34,425
I’ve got some here.

560
00:33:36,905 --> 00:33:37,905
Here.

561
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:39,745
Okay.

562
00:33:39,745 --> 00:33:40,745
Give it to me.

563
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:42,185
I don’t think you know how.

564
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:42,921
I’ll show you.

565
00:33:42,945 --> 00:33:44,185
It’s alright. I can take it from here.

566
00:33:44,705 --> 00:33:45,601
Give it to me.

567
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:46,625
There’s no way.

568
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:47,985
Show me.

569
00:33:50,105 --> 00:33:51,225
It can’t be that hard.

570
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:53,225
You don’t put it in there.

571
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:54,465
Are you insane?

572
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:55,201
Oh?

573
00:33:55,225 --> 00:33:56,265
And you said you know how to do it.

574
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,665
Of course I do.

575
00:33:57,985 --> 00:33:59,785
You clearly don’t.

576
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:04,265
All done.

577
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:05,705
Have some ice-cream.

578
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:07,905
- Your spoons. - Thank you.

579
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:16,945
Is it good?

580
00:34:17,705 --> 00:34:18,361
Here.

581
00:34:18,385 --> 00:34:19,385
You want to try?

582
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:23,505
But this one is better.

583
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:26,985
We’re ruining it by mixing it together, aren’t we?

584
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,025
Yeah.

585
00:34:30,865 --> 00:34:31,865
Oh.

586
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:34,265
Sorry.

587
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:36,825
I’ve actually been taking some photos since before.

588
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:37,865
You look adorable.

589
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:46,745
It’s late.

590
00:34:46,746 --> 00:34:48,465
I think I should go.

591
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:51,624
Let me carry these back for you.

592
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:52,625
Alright.

593
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:55,025
Also…

594
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,225
Liu.

595
00:35:02,745 --> 00:35:05,825
I think you should take this little thing with you.

596
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,225
Guy would just let it sit lonely at home anyway.

597
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:13,385
What do you think, Guy?

598
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:23,305
Thank you.

599
00:35:23,585 --> 00:35:24,585
Excuse me.

600
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:25,265
Of course.

601
00:35:25,265 --> 00:35:26,265
Bye.

602
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:08,665
How did it turn out this way?

603
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,425
Well?

604
00:36:18,625 --> 00:36:21,865
There wouldn’t be moments like that if I didn’t show up, don’t you think?

605
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,425
I can do it on my own just fine.

606
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:28,145
You can just say thank you, you know?

607
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:33,465
You know what? I should just root for Saint now, I guess.

608
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:36,625
But I’m your son, Mom.

609
00:36:37,145 --> 00:36:40,185
Oh, that got you to call me Mom?

610
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:41,705
Uhh…

611
00:36:42,425 --> 00:36:44,705
Love really wins all, huh?

612
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:47,225
Yes.

613
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:47,105
Is everything alright?

614
00:37:47,505 --> 00:37:49,105
It’s late.

615
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:52,105
I’m sorry.

616
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:54,745
I have something important I need to talk to you about.

617
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,065
What is it?

618
00:37:59,785 --> 00:38:01,425
How was the movie?

619
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:05,145
The movie was…

620
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:08,225
It was a movie.

621
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:11,905
How are things with Guy?

622
00:38:14,785 --> 00:38:18,025
Guy isn’t a bad person, Faye.

623
00:38:19,025 --> 00:38:20,505
He’s a good friend.

624
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,185
I don’t want you to dislike him.

625
00:38:24,945 --> 00:38:27,705
I know Guy is a good person.

626
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:34,625
You’re surprised I said that, aren’t you?

627
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:40,265
This is actually what I want to talk to you about.

628
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:46,705
I just want to be sure first that you and Guy really are just friends.

629
00:38:54,825 --> 00:38:55,825
We’re just friends.

630
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,785
I’m relieved.

631
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:03,745
Why?

632
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:07,025
I…

633
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:15,305

642
00:39:54,705 --> 00:39:57,905
Just think about how much people would talk about us if we really dated.

643
00:39:58,385 --> 00:40:00,105
Maybe this ship is already sailing.

644
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:02,545
Why are you doing this to Liu?

645
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:06,065
I’m not. I’m just doing what I want.

646
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:09,025
I want to be your girlfriend.
