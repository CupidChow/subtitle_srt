1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first one is...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What's wrong with you?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Why are you laughing?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm sorry

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm f**king mad

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm so sorry

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm sorry

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm sorry

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today, you are joining the crew

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Who is the first one to be caught?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hello, brother Xia

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then, in the environment

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is...

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why don't you take a look at the film?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm a director of a TV show

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm a director of a TV show

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And this is...

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm a director of a TV show

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And this is...

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm a director of a TV show

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm a director of a TV show

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm a director of a TV show

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come on, brother Xia

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Come on, brother Xia

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Come on, brother Xia

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Come on

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, it's gone

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay, you can have a look

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's okay

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let Wu Xin Yan introduce himself

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to you

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's okay

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You think this is the end?

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, we don't deserve to lose

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We don't deserve to lose

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm just waiting for their chance

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and getting ready to be close

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's this?

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What's this?

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't know what's this

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's a red flag

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, red flag

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a red flag

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a red flag

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's a red flag

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's a red flag

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's a red flag

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a red flag

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a red flag

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a red flag

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Today

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's already the first day

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm going to warm up

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was out for a while

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I was very cold

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And you didn't see me

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I didn't wear any clothes

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I didn't wear any warm equipment

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and equipment

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was really warm today

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was in the sun

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was in the sun

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We were all in the room

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I didn't dare to come out

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It was sunny and comfortable

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And this side

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I was resting

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't see this

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I met this

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I met this

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I met this

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I met this

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I met this

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to eat

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to interview you

79
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You let me

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What are you talking about

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You didn't eat the egg

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I didn't eat the egg

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm so bored

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Then leave it

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The bitter melon

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What is that?

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You don't like it

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm going to film you

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Teacher, we're going to film

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm going to film you

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to film you

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to film you

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to eat

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What is this egg

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I've never eaten it

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've never eaten it

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's so big

98
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to eat it

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's so big

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to eat it

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to eat it

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going to eat it

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm going to eat it

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What?

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to be a good cook

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can't give up

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to fight for my life

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're so silly

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You don't talk

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Today

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You guys saw the movie

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then the weather is nice

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I won't be like you

114
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Then

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to be a good guest

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The next episode

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The next episode

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is this?

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What is this?

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm going to be a good cook

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you done?

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm done

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are you done?

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm finished

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you can't get the chance

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Then let's chat

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Actually we don't have

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Those

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Too

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Very

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That kind of drama

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Because we are the kind of

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Life is a little drama

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Little drama

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This kind of drama

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So every day

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Is

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You are very disappointed

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I haven't been to the movie

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I haven't been to the movie

143
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I went to see it when I was shooting

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a good movie

145
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's a good movie

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's a good movie

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm going to shoot the movie

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The movie will be on the 5th

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Everyone is there

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a very difficult movie

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There is a dance performance

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There is a dance performance

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There is a dance performance

154
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There is a dance performance

155
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So he's playing

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He's running

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have been shooting for 5 years

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Fortunately it's not that cold

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's cold

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's cold

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Basically what I do is

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I didn't eat

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I didn't eat much

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm very tired

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm very salty

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I made it too salty

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I ate two pots and I was soaked

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's a kind of

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
How about cooking

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Noodles and hot pot

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then this

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But there are still hot pot and barbecue

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is it coming?

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm going to take a video

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's coming soon

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm going to take a video

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Then you can take a video

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can
