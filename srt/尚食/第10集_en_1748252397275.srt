The whole world is full of love and passion

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000

00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The game is a little bit complicated

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The game is a little bit complicated

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I did everything for you

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Not a slave

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Will do it for the master

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I am happy for you

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The same thing

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Different mood with the kind people

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The taste is different

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think the kind people don't need to be kind

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How can it be, Your Highness

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How dare he

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your Highness

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's almost the time to go out

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Shang's Bureau is really busy

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's hard to be comfortable

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you are not satisfied with Miss Yao's craft

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I will go to the top of the mountain for you

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Pick another one

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Your Highness

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The prince of Han is in the Qianqing Palace

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He is not well

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The crown prince can't talk

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I just have to accompany him to kneel

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The crown prince consort asks you to go and see

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Can you persuade him to come back

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What do you say

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What to do

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Uncle

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's been more than two hours

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Kneel like this

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Can you eat it

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm not afraid

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
When the army is fighting

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I can eat for three days and three nights

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You don't have to eat

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Uncle

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you okay

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Come

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Uncle, you fainted

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Send him to the hospital

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hurry

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Dad, it's your turn

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not here

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come here

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Dad

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your Highness

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Your Highness

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your brother is very kind

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The prince will be very tired

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He will remove all the equipment

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Your Majesty

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Your Majesty

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The medicine of Lingqi Palace is very hot

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's very dangerous

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can't take it anymore

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Get out

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The letter of the face

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The letter of the letter of the face

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The letter of the face

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Today he advised that the emperor

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Use less medicine

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The emperor

Lei Tian

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
Aye.

125
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,280
Shear my heart,

I'm good and good at Ce 아� Your Excellency.

127
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,320
I am an enchantment thinker for Spring and Summer.

128
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,520
I have no power in my heart

129
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,040
but Your Excellency,

130
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,060
not to have your feelings in good and fair.

131
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,440
I got away from the field with no measures

132
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,500
but your Xiao-ero Ser helps me a lot.

133
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,700
Without any measures,

134
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,520
what do I do?

135
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,840
Polishing the varying shades of theicked latiss Hendl animations

136
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,400
Ji Zibai is ten

147
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,340
Maybe I get it wrong.

148
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,940
Please don't buy it.

149
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,460
I've read the script.

150
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,340
Remember it clearly.

151
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,180
You don't need to read it.

152
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,380
I don't believe it.

153
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,380

Today is the eighth day of the lunar month.

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
It's also my birthday.

161
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
Where's my longevity mask?

162
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,580

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,620
It's a gift from the Grand Master.

165
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,700
I don't want the eighth day of the lunar month.

166
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,900
It's my longevity mask.

167
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:36,380
The Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall

The Great Wall of the Great Wall

169
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,380
Is it good?

170
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,920
Yes!

171
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,380
Mom, have a bite.

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,080
No, No,Read it.

173
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,140
Is he even letting you die?

174
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,700
istent on this dragon boat

175
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,700
so that gakura will return.

176
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,860
Duke Zhou.

177
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Master.

178
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,980
The vegetables were raw.

179
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Not so much.

180
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:38,980
Don't listen to him.

181
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,780
Nonsense.

182
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,260
I haven't done anything recently.

183
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,660
He's all wrong.

184
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,900
I misunderstood.

185
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Today is the birthday of Lord You.

186
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,980
He only took a bowl of longevity noodles.

187
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,580
This is the top ten.

188
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,860
It's not just a temple.

189
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,020
It's not a top-tier temple.

190
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,180
It's not a temple that is not worth the food.

191
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,260
Stop talking.

192
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,020
The King of Yan is knocking on the door.

193
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,380
You should hide away.

194
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,460
You're so long-winded.

195
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,180
Stop talking.

196
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,860
What?

197
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,780
You're done with the game.

198
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,860
You even gave me a egg.

199
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,060
You're afraid he won't be able to beat you.

200
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,380
When I was a child,

201
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,100
my mother did this to me.

202
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,820
If I were a child,

203
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,580
you'd have to do this to me.

204
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,180
I'll give you two eggs.

205
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,820
How is it?

206
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,580
It's almost done.

207
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,620
Hurry up.

208
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,260
I'm so tired.

209
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
I'm so tired.

210
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
I'm so tired.

211
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,220
I'm so tired.

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,220

I'm so tired.

215
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
I'm so tired.

216
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
I'm so tired.

217
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
I'm so tired.

218
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
I'm so tired.

219
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
I'm so tired.

220
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
I'm so tired.

221
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
I'm so tired.

222
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
I'm so tired.

223
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
I'm so tired.

224
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm so tired.

225
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
I'm so tired.

226
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
I'm so tired.

227
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,100
I'm so tired.

228
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
I'm so tired.

229
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I'm so tired.

230
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
I'm so tired.

231
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
I'm so tired.

232
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
I'm so tired.

233
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,100
I'm so tired.

234
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
I'm so tired.

235
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm so tired.

236
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
I'm so tired.

237
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
I'm so tired.

238
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
I'm so tired.

239
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,060
I'm so tired.

240
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,060
I'm so tired.

241
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,060
I'm so tired.

242
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,060
I'm so tired.

243
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,060
I'm so tired.

244
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,060
I'm so tired.

245
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,060
I'm so tired.

246
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,060
I'm so tired.

247
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,060
I'm so tired.

248
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,060
I'm so tired.

249
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
I'm so tired.

250
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060
I'm so tired.

251
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,060
I'm so tired.

252
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
I'm so tired.

253
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,060
I'm so tired.

254
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,060
I'm so tired.

255
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,060
I'm so tired.

256
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,060
I'm so tired.

257
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,060
I'm so tired.

258
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,060
I'm so tired.

259
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
I'm so tired.

260
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
I'm so tired.

261
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,060
I'm so tired.

262
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,060
I'm so tired.

263
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,060
I'm so tired.

264
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
I'm so tired.

265
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,020
Is this the big plum you used for the arrangement?

266
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,020
Lord Huaiyou

267
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
used it to help with the plum porridge.

268
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
You can also take the plum porridge.

269
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,020
The plum is light and warm.

270
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,020
You can use it to make soup and cook porridge.

271
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,020
Lord You, what else do you have?

272
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
Why does everyone in the Shang's Bureau

273
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
fear me so much?

274
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
I said the last time.

275
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I just misunderstood.

276
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
I sincerely apologize to you.

277
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
Lord You.

278
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
You stepped on my plum.

279
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,060
Here.

280
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
Thank you.

281
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
Take a heart.

282
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
Here.

283
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,060
Help me take one.

284
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
I'm so tired.

285
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,060
A heart.

286
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Here.

287
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,060
Here.

288
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,060
A heart.

289
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
Thank you.

290
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,060
Thank you.

291
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,060
Thank you.

292
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,060
Thank you.

293
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,060
Thank you.

294
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,060
Thank you.

295
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,060
Thank you.

296
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
Thank you.

297
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
It's so delicious.

298
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,820
It's delicious.

299
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,180
Is Yohua still not back?

300
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,780
Yohua.

301
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,060
Oh, right.

302
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,060
You don't have anyone to prepare noodles for Lord Yohu, right?

303
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
No.

304
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,620
No.

305
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,060
We were busy preparing for the Labazhou yesterday.

306
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,420
I forgot to keep an eye on you.

307
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,620
If Lord Yohu comes today,

308
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,060
you must avoid him.

309
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,020
Why?

310
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,820
Why?

311
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,220
From his point of view,

312
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
the Labazhou Festival will come back to the inner court.

313
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,420
But for the people who are good at it,

314
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,620
they must be injured in March.

315
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,620
They wear a lot.

316
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,660
Everyone in the mountain world says

317
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,420
that the Labazhou Festival will come back to the inner court.

318
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,020
No matter what, they must avoid him.

319
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,620
Why are you still talking about it?

320
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,020
What?

321
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,020
You must have already been killed for him, right?

322
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,820
After the Labazhou Festival, it's the year.

323
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
You must be careful.

324
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,220
I won't marry you.

325
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,220
I won't marry you.

326
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,020
I am the real Emperor of the Dragon.

327
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,820
Grandfather, it's me.

328
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,060
Your Majesty,

329
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,020
you should learn from Imperial Physician Sheng.

330
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,020
No.

331
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
I don't want to.

332
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
I don't want to.

333
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
I don't want to.

334
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
I don't want to.

335
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
I don't want to.

336
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
I don't want to.

337
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,020
I don't want to.

338
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
I don't want to.

339
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,540
You know what?

340
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,980
You have died so much.

341
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,460
I am healthy now.

342
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,820
You don't need to talk to the doctor.

343
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
No.

344
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,700
Grandpa.

345
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,340
It's Rabazhi Festival today.

346
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,140
she is watching this.

347
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,740
But

348
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,340
myhh

349
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,460
I was afraid

350
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,420
Sleepilyn

351
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:45,900
Duised

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,860
Relax.

354
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,720
Kneel down for a while before anybody else knows.

355
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Yes.

356
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
Your Highness!

357
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Your Highness, there are some key soldiers.

358
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Your Highness, the news from the palace is here.

359

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
Your Highness, the news from the palace is here.

361
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
The plum blossom can be harvested?

362
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
The plum blossom is warm and fresh.

363
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,820
It can be harvested and harvested.

364
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
Your Majesty, everything is fine.

365
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Miss Yao, His Highness is in the palace.

366
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
Please go and bring the food and drink to him.

367
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,820
Yes.

368
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
Miss Yao, you are here.

369
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,820
You wait here for a while.

370
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820
Miss Yao,

371
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
you're here.

372
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
Miss Yao,

373
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,820
Miss Yao,

00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,820
you're here.

375
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
Miss Yao,

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,820
Miss Yao,

377
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,820
Miss Yao,

Then you wait here for a while.

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,820
I'll report to you.

382
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,740
Your Highness,

383
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,060
do you think I'm a gentleman?

384
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,780
Your Highness.

385
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,500
Your Highness, what are you looking at?

386
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,220
I'm innocent.

387
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,220
I'm a corpse.

388
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,620
I'm wearing your clothes.

389
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,900
I'm not.

390
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,260
I'll go back and change.

391
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,900
You go find me.

392
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,780
I'll be back in a while.

393
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,100
Your Highness,

394
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,740
the people from the city are here.

395
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,620
Really?

396
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:17,980
Your Highness,

397
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,180
I'll go now.

398
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,180
Miss Xiao,

399
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,140
let's go.

400
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,660
Your Highness.

401
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,180
Just wait and see.

402
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,780
Don't you know how to talk?

403
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,860
Are you going to die?

404
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,300
Do you want me to feel guilty?

405
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,420
I'm telling you,

406
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,140
even if you die,

407
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,700
I won't feel bad.

408
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,660
Your Highness,

409
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,260
the food is cold.

410
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,220
I'll go back and do it again.

411
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,140
Don't be angry.

412
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,420
The weather is too cold.

413
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
The food will be cold.

414
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,100
Your Highness, don't be angry.

415
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,060
I'll go back now.

416
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,940
Yao Zi Jin.

417
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,180
Your Highness, if you don't have any orders,

418
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,540
I'll really go back.

419
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,180
Okay.

420
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,300
I'll get you out of here.

421
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,620
Let's see if you can

422
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,100
treat the master in my way.

423
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,820
I'll go back.

424
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,700
I'll go back.

425
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,500
I'll go back.

426
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,340
I'll go back.

427
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,180
I'll go back.

428
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,660
Zhu Yong.

429
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:47,900
Zhu Yong.

430
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,480
That kid.

431
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,520
school register board.

432
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,940
Do you know

433
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,020
what your daughter has done?

434
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,840
Her whole family

435
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,580
vapour them.

436
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,100
I heard about the king

437
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,460
ARDOT's fault.

438
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,700
Your father had the wrong idea.

439
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,260
You agreed to a divorce?

440
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,420
For the past year,

441
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,940
he has been so kind and kind.

442
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,820
He insisted on going out to the palace to return the incense.

443
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,260
His Majesty didn't force him to return the incense.

444
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,460
He even gave him a lot of gold during the return of the incense.

445
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,420
I dare not compare myself with the virtuous.

446
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,260
But His Highness has already taken His Majesty as a shield.

447
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,980
His Majesty is so generous and generous.

448
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,300
His Highness has already made it clear to me.

449
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,860
How could he force a palace maid?

450
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,700
You are so lucky.

451
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,220
Have you forgotten everything?

452
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,980
How could he forget?

453
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
How could he dare to forget?

454
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,660
I am willing to give my heart to His Majesty.

455
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,380
I will give my heart to His Majesty.

456
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,060
I will not give up my love.

457
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,140
But His Majesty's heart

458
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,780
is really with me.

459
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,940
Although I am a humble servant,

460
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,260
I dare not give my heart to His Majesty.

461
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,780
Wait.

462
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,500
Wu.

463
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,380
Ask Yans.

464
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,460
Yans' son,

465
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,100
Pardon.

466
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,940
70 avoid 20olls.

467
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,420
were you wrong?

468
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,820
How big is the snow?

469
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,180
How wrong is it?

470
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,740
Weren't I act cute?

471
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,580
I'mSi Шrom.

472
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,100
Si Shi?

473
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,940
I'm sorry.

474
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,540
I'm sorry.

475
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,140
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,740
I'm sorry.

477
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,380
I'm sorry.

478
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:12,980
I'm sorry.

479
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,540
I'm sorry.

480
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:13,980
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,540
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,180
I'm sorry.

483
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,780
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,460
I'm sorry.

485
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:16,980
I'm sorry.

486
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,500
I'm sorry.

487
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,140
I'm sorry.

488
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
What color is he?

489
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,460
Let me see.

490
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,300
How is it?

491
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,660
It's so cold outside.

492
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,620
Why are you all frozen?

493
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,820
Aren't you wearing a umbrella?

494
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,900
I told you.

495
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,860
You're so weak.

496
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,420
Really.

497
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,140
Really.

498
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,020
Why are you still running?

499
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,540
You look much better now.

500
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,460
What's wrong?

501
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,420
You know what?

502
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,740
You just beat me with just one hand BECAUSE I BE literally standing there.

503
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,580
It's not true.

504
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,540
Don't be that hard right now.

505
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,580
What's wrong with them?

506
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,340
It's especially Förstary physically and mentally

507
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,580
a new type of expression

508
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,020
will always carry its way.

509
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,700
Guys can get a chance

510
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,660
to exchange gifts for future fortune.

511
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,180
The color of the rival's demi- figs

512
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,020
made them all suspect it this year.

513
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,880
What should we do?

514
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,780
No need to complain.

515
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,540
Does a needle need about 20 sqm?

516
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,900
Why is it so heavy?

517
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,040
How would the needle come about?

518
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,500
Let's see if there's anything else.

519
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,500
But Cao Zhou caused特 pastry.

520
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
This regarding the assurance of chief steward NPC,

521
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,360
did you find it very tough?

522
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,700
I asked them

523
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,100
to no longer send mother tongue.

524
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,200
But those people futuroled

525
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,580
Her Highnessεις into torturing them

526
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,880
even the Handlebreak

527
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,040
I took out

528
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:58,880
herself

529
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,580
unока

530
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,020
I'm afraid that in the winter,

531
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
the snow will break the house.

532
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,020
When the winter comes,

533
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
there will be a good news.

534
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,020
The day will be full of decoration.

535
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,020
I'm still worried about the death of

536
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
the soldiers.

537
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I'm worried about the death of

538
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
the soldiers.

539
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,020
I wish my father could give them a better life.

540
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,020
This is the real reason

541
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,020
for the women's virtue.

542
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,020
Now that we have the palace,

543
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,020
we can do our best.

544
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,020
It's not too late.

545
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,020
I'm afraid that

546
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,020
I can't forget

547
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,020
the love he gave me.

548
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Your Highness,

549
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
you are always smiling.

550
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,020
You are the queen of the world.

551
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,020
Princess Guo, please take a deep look.

552
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,020
If this is the message from the emperor,

553
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,020
how do you call him?

554
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,020
The palace is full of women like you.

555
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,020
You have the guts to act like a woman.

556
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,020
You are not afraid of being born into the Guo family.

557
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
The palace is full of women

558
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,020
who are jealous of the wind and make up for their crimes.

559
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
What?

560
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,020
Do you also admire the women?

561
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,020
Your Highness,

562
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
the garden is so big.

563
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,020
I feel dizzy after I have a flower.

564
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
I'm rude.

565
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,020
I'll take a step forward.

566
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,020
Your Highness,

567
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,020
don't be angry with him.

568
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,020
He is a soulmate of yours.

569
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,020
You should take care of yourself.

570
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
After all, this mucous membrane

571
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,020
is not a matter of marriage.

572
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,020
It's not good to be in a warm room.

573
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,020
I think the flower in front is blooming.

574
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,020
Let's go and take a look.

575
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,020
The Imperial Concubine Guo is so stupid.

576
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
How could her father come to the palace and get the credit?

577
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,020
How could she do such a thing?

578
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
The Imperial Concubine Guo is the concubine of her father.

579
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,020
She is our elder.

580
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,020
How could she have the ability to be a senior?

581
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Look at this little book.

582
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,020
It's so interesting.

583
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
It's so interesting.

584
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
It's so interesting.

585
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
It's so interesting.

586
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
It's so interesting.

587
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Wu Cai Ran,

588
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
where is the list of the urgent list of the Empress

589
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,020
that His Majesty prepared for His Majesty?

590
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,020
Miao Xian.

591
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
Here comes Yuan'an.

592
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Let's go.

593
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,020
Eunuch Wu.

594
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,020
In the ancient 16th century,

595
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,020
Niu Fei and Leng Xi 沒有人成功了

596
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,020
They survived byhorse,

597
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,020
but they died in fighting current.

598
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,020
Yun Muemura did not have six and a half.

599
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
That's a mistake.

600
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
Xuan How do you think

601
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,020
~~

602
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,420
I dare you to send him into the palace.

603
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,180
How the hell are you following?

604
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,980
Sichen, hope you will never have to be so na Gesundheits

605
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,540
like I did.

606
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,060
I'm a bit busy,

607
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,980
giving away preci slog stock

608
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,260
and keeping a wholeいく away

609
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,060
would do so

610
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:46,860
The жиоm has to be quite героic

611
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,300
but its taste

612
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,140
will tym be too grim for的是嗎

613
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,740
Is it man-wred asset

614
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,540
The bomb will damage the body of the user.

615
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,100
It will also ruin the conscience of the healer.

616
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,140
The heart is already broken.

617
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,300
What right do you have to heal it?

618
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,180
These ingredients won't be returned to me.

619
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,820
Yes.

620
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,580
Hurry and move. Hurry.

621
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,380
Mu Shang Shi.

622
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,300
For what wasGon to use in the palace,

623
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,980
Wu Yi is not great at this type of theory.

624
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,420
Someone like him has already appeared.

625
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,460
Hu Fei is just as logic as a larmed,

626
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,820
and has looked so oozing and off already.

627
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,520
She unshie meupposay busily.

628
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,020
Now every day, she keeps her rumors.

629
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,200
Now I have realized such a guerrilla gesture.

630
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,720
Come and take her aside.

631
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,300
Let's find out the ingredient.

632
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,820
Sir, you're lucky.

633
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,100
You have picked out the right one sooner.

634
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:17,180
I continue to этоr the ingredients

635
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,020
I diplomacy

636
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,940
Bastard!

637
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,360
Your shoes!

638
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:49,140
Tell me.

639
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,700
You'll put it on him!

640
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,400
Lord Connector

641
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,300
Move.

642
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,140
Bite him!

643
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,820
Good.

644
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,860
Bite him!

645
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,660
Go up!

646
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,300
Bite him!

647
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:02,860
Bite him!

648
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,380
Good.

649
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:03,820
Good.

650
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,700
Good.

651
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,940
Bite him!

652
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,860
Good.

653
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,820
Good.

654
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,500
Go up!

655
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,220
Bite him!

656
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,420
Your Highness.

657
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,460
Didn't you watch the chicken?

658
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,540
You've been kidnapped?

659
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,660
One big one, one small one.

660
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,300
Which one do you think is more suitable?

661
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,140
Small one.

662
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,020
Small one?

663
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,660
Then...

664
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,820
I bet off you

665
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,700
that I'll still be able to win this time.

666
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,500
Bring your Excuseum to 020.

667
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,020
This is the best we've got.

668
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,180
Thank you.

669
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,140
上海就是你的征城!

670
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,020
It's finished.

671
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,220
Miss Su.

672
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,740
Miss Su.

673
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,940
What's the matter?

674
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Master Siqing asked me to send a new menu.

675
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,100
This menu is personally sponsored by Meng.

676
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,540
It's just six dishes at home.

677
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,540
I don't know if it's appropriate.

678
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,540
No, we'll do it.

679
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,540
Wang Si Shan.

680
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,740
Look.

681
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,540
But you can make it thinner.

682
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,140
Okay.

683
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
I'll make it thinner.

684
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,140
Okay.

685
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,140
Okay.

686
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,140
Okay.

687
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,140
Okay.

688
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:31,940
Okay.

689
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:32,940
Okay.

690
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:33,940
Okay.

691
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:34,940
Okay.

692
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:35,740
Okay.

693
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:36,940
Okay.

694
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:37,940
Okay.

695
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:38,940
Okay.

696
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:39,940
Okay.

697
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:40,940
Okay.

698
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:41,940
Okay.

699
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:42,740
Okay.

700
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:43,940
Okay.

701
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,940
Okay.

702
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:45,940
Okay.

703
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:46,740
Okay.

704
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:46,940
Okay.

705
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:47,740
Okay.

706
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:47,940
Okay.

707
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:48,740
Okay.

708
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:48,940
Okay.

709
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:49,740
Okay.

710
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:49,940
Okay.

711
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,340
Okay.

712
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:50,940
Okay.

713
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,140
Okay.

714
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,540
Okay.

715
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:51,940
Okay.

716
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,140
Okay.

717
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,540
Okay.

718
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:52,940
Okay.

719
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,140
Okay.

720
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,340
Okay.

721
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:53,940
Okay.

722
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:23,940
Okay.

723
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:54,940
Okay.

724
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,140
Miss Su.

725
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
The menu has been changed.

726
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:30,980
The menu has been changed.

727
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:31,940
The menu has been changed.

728
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:38,540
The first line is still a treasured piece of paper.

729
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,540
We'll use the fire to burn the sea.

730
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,140
The last one...

731
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,140
is the Three Seasons of Conqueror.

732
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,740
The Three Seasons of Conqueror

733
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,140
will catch the rain, the sea,

734
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,540
the pure and so on.

735
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,340
The Three Seasons of Conqueror

736
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,940
But the soup should be served for ten hours.

737
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
They're here to serve us.

738
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,700
They want the food to be served in a strict manner.

739
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,900
They can't be wrong.

740
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,060
The food to be served in a strict manner.

741
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,220
What's your pleasure?

742
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,220
The food should be served in a strict manner.

743
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,940
Once you've used the food in the third room,

744
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,580
the food will be tasteless.

745
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,380
The last one is the golden one.

746
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,020
You can't delay the time.

747
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,500
Let's begin.

748
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,060
Yes.

749
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,700
My Lord.

750
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,020
Come with me.

751
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,060
My Lord.

752
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,140
The龐經 Palace stayed forbidden for such time.

753
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,020
His Majesty has done the measures.

754
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,900
He didn't dare to wallet it off easily.

755
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,780
When His Majesty passed on the safety guards to the emperor andредboy to President Liu,

756
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,740
we'll be their physicians.

757
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,820
Let's go.

758
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,180
Let Institute Master Ye

759
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,900
help the Emperor a little bit later.

760
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,540
I have told Duke Lian.

761
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,680
You shouldn't be talking about this.

762
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,080
Make sure Crown Princecock bag it.

763
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,700
Coming to do your work.

764
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

765
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:45,720
You know I won't stop you till you are satisfied.

766
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,240
Your Majesty.

767
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Why didn't you eat it?

768
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
Put it on the ground.

769
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Put it on the ground.

770
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
That's wrong.

771
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
It's from the mountain.

772
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
His Majesty just looked at it.

773
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
He never helped me.

774
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
I said before,

775
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
the charity is not good this year.

776
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,240
You can't listen to the shaman's words.

777
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
The food and food are not good.

778
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
The shaman can't be paid by the shaman.

779
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Are you angry?

780
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Are you angry?

781
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Go talk to him.

782
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Yes.

783
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
Hurry up.

784
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Get ready for the next one.

785
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
Let's go.

786
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,240
Did you give the shaman the blessing of the shaman?

787
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
The sea and the rain are so cold.

788
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,240
It's hard to give the shaman

789
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,240
more than ten hours of the shaman's soup.

790
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Besides,

791
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
it's too late now.

792
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
What about the lamb?

793
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
It's not good.

794
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Is it a game of losing?

795
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
I'll think about it.

796
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
Zijin,

797
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
what are you looking for?

798
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
Zijin,

799
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,240
what are you looking for?

800
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
It's a game of luck.

801
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
It's a game of luck.

802
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
You're just a kid.

803
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,240
You're just a kid

804
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
who doesn't know how to play the game.

805
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
That's all.

806
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
Grandpa,

807
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,240
the meat is tender.

808
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
And the soup is very rich.

809
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
Try it.

810
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Your biraz is extremely good.

811
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,240
It has a heavily sensual taste.

812
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,240
Let's get this table.

813
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
Okay.

814
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Okay.

815
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Okay.

816
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,040
Kindner.

817
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,840
Not a realスauce for빵菜.

818
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,480
It's supposed to contain

819
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,260
часов and clam meat and Whatu.

820
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,280
Just like you said,

821
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,680
it's an served meal

822
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,560
that was made by Crown Prince very specially.

823
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:44,840
Yes.

824
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,480
There's a saying in the folk.

825
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,960
No fire, no chicken, no spices, no duck, no fragrance.

826
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,360
No wine, no farm.

827
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,520
That's right.

828
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,800
It's a family.
