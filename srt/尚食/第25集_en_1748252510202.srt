00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short dance moves

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

The game is a little bit complicated

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000

The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The game is a little bit complicated

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
part 4

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,260
Serving himself as a total chic in heart,

23
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,980
the date of separation

24
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,660
will come to an end.

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,320
This young princess.

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,360
Before the game,

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,360
I fell in love with him instead of

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440
against him,

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,180
or about thebetrayal будут.

30
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,140
So sweet.

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,080
It's just like I can't

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,040
forget the past.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,600
Yes.

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,660
It's a pureable fairy travel.

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,980
Enjoy your way.

36
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,980
Episode 1

37
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,700
Since you left,

38
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,100
Father has always been thinking about you.

39
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,580
After all, it's a father and a daughter.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,500
Can't you really be heartbroken?

41
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,220
Before mother passed away,

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,460
he told me personally.

43
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,860
If I haven't been chosen,

44
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,420
I don't need to die.

45
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,260
I don't need to be cruel.

46
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,940
He said everything was because of me.

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,580
I want to see mother for the last time.

48
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,860
He took me to Pengchengbo Residence.

49
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,900
For the past half a year,

50
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,900
I only heard the wind and rain of the cold night.

51
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,820
I heard the family's life story.

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,420
At that time,

53
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,700
where was father?

54
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,700
Brother.

55
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,980
Where are you?

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,820
Your Majesty,

57
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,660
I came to see you.

58
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,180
It's so rare to see such a grace.

59
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,020
Sister.

60
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
You can blame us or hate us.

61
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,780
You can't just watch the whole Sun family suffer.

62
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,860
Third Brother, please.

63
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,660
I beg you.

64
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,500
You go first.

65
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,020
I don't want to see you again.

66
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,740
We always say that we all can't do anything to you.

67
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,340
What about the mother of the patient?

68
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
She has been concerned about you since childhood.

69
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,620
Did you complete her wish?

70
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,460
You didn't.

71
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,900
If she has the power to do anything,

72
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,340
she will watch her husband and her own son

73
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,740
die for you.

74
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,340
Can you do that?

75
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,340
You are not a threat to the Empress' marriage.

76
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,700
Third Brother,

77
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,940
you are worried about your wealth.

78
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,700
Don't worry.

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,940
If you really want to kill me,

80
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,740
you will not be the only one who will kill me.

81
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,220
Tang Hang's son, Zifeng.

82
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,220
Zifeng,

83
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,260
go after him.

84
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,300
Zifeng.

85
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,420
Sister.

86
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,620
He Ping,

87
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,220
go to the group.

88
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,900
Zifeng.

89
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,460
You are a greedy and afraid of death.

90
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,460
Don't fight.

91
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,060
Sister.

92
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,260
Get out of here.

93
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,020
Get out.

94
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,460
Get out.

95
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,900
Sister.

96
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,740
Zijin.

97
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,860
Mr. Meng,

98
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,460
Yuan Xianning gave Zijin a chance to attend the Shangyuan family banquet.

99
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,580
I think it's hard to get the chance to get the chance to attend the Shangyuan family banquet.

100
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,100
Is it...

101
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Mr. Shang.

102
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,780
You are still sick.

103
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,780
Mr. Shang.

104
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,780
Allow me to attend the Shangyuan family banquet.

105
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,300
As a kitchen cook,

106
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,940
you need to be careful when you are cooking.

107
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,340
Your hand is badly injured.

108
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,260
If you get hurt due to the injury in the family banquet,

109
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
will you be okay?

110
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,820
Mr. Meng,

111
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,220
he chose me as his assistant.

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,660
If I can only care about my own hand,

113
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,820
how can I be grateful to you?

114
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,780
I also made up my mind.

115
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,500
Please be sure.

116
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,540
Okay.

117
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
I promise you.

118
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,380
Greetings, Miss scores.

119
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,820
Master Hu.

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,580
She is good.

121
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,540
You're not quite confident.

122
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,860
Why don't you take it lightly?

123
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,980
I guess

124
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,740
you have been hiding your power

125
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,540
for years.

126
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,460
You took her to a shooting house to gain first aid.

127
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,140
This happened

128
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,080
made me require a longer periods of life and death,

129
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,100
This time,

130
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,300
God will stand by my side.

131
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,620
With this one,

132
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,140
you might not be able to hold it anymore.

133
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,260
Yes.

134
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,900
With this one,

135
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,740
I might lose my right hand.

136
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,980
I will see you fall in love with it.

137
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,060
The most desperate thing to lose is

138
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,060
leaving the capital.

139
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,860
You are indeed someone I have taught you.

140
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,380
Okay.

141
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,300
I will see

142
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,860
how you will achieve this.

143
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,500
The most desperate thing to lose is

144
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,620
leaving the capital.

145
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,260
I will see you fall in love with it.

146
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,660
I will see you fall in love with it.

147
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,060
I will see you fall in love with it.

148
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,460
I will see you fall in love with it.

149
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,860
I will see you fall in love with it.

150
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,260
I will see you fall in love with it.

151
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,660
I will see you fall in love with it.

152
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,060
I will see you fall in love with it.

153
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,460
I will see you fall in love with it.

154
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,860
I will see you fall in love with it.

155
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,260
I will see you fall in love with it.

156
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,660
I will see you fall in love with it.

157
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,060
I will see you fall in love with it.

158
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,460
I will see you fall in love with it.

159
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,660
I will see you fall in love with it.

160
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,060
I will see you fall in love with it.

161
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,460
I will see you fall in love with it.

162
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,060
I will see you fall in love with it.

163
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,460
You are so annoying.

164
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
So annoying.

165
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Stop following me.

166
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,620
The one who made a dream,

167
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,220
gave a lot of welfare to the new year for sure.

168
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,300
You don't even have to worry about that.

169
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,280
If there's something that you want to say,

170
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,340
do not say so.

171
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,000
Your Highness,

172
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,380
Jud vibe is used

173
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,380
among everyday guests.

174
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,340
Our princess is not like those bridges

175
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,380
thatISEUOutcape grouped out for Enjoying me.

176
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,520
They will have hiding places

177
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,820
I'll follow.

178
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,580
Indeed.

179
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,940
His Excellency,

180
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm at your service.

181
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
I'll give up if it hurts like this.

182
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Master Meng.

183
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,520
Why do you insist on participating in the competition?

184
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I can choose another one.

185
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Master Shang.

186
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
I asked Ji Dian Yao.

187
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
If I can rest assured,

188
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
when can I recover?

189
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
She said

190
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
I should take the heaven's will.

191
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
What if...

192
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
Then this is the result.

193
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Then this is the last chance in my life.

194
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
You're injured.

195
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
You even forgot the basic kung fu.

196
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
You can't use the sword too much.

197
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Otherwise, the golden belt will break.

198
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Come back.

199
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Yes.

200
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
I'll take the heaven's will.

201
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
I'll take the heaven's will.

202
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
Since this is your request,

203
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
I'll ask you for a strict request.

204
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,520
No matter if your hands will be broken,

205
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
you must stick to it.

206
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Yes.

207
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Go.

208
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520

Go ahead.

212
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,720
The emperor came.

213
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,880
It's automatic.

214
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,520
Why isn't the crown prince here yet?

215
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,400
Come on.

216
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400

Ziping,

220
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,320

221
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
It's too late.

222
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,280
We have an hour to go.

223
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,600
Why are you so nervous?

224
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,880
There's a festival today.

225
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,520
You must watch it.

226
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,520

Look at your hands.

243
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520

244
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Great.

245
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,820

246
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,420

I just want to make my mother happy.

255
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,860

00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,180

Why did you just break a box?

It's greasy and less fragrant.

446
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,540

You can't tell the real winner to choose based on the game, right?

479
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,580
The game is a fair one.

480

I...

573
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,380
I...

574
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,160
Your Majesty,

575
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,280
Jin asked Jin to spend whatever he wants

576
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,000
Crown Prince Fei.

577
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,320
Crown Prince Fei.

578
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,800
Are you okay?

579
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,800
I don't know how to talk.

580
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,080
Are there more fish than that?

581
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,160
How is this fish?

582
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,640
Bring me some tea.

583
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,240
Tea.

584
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,200
Master Hu,

585
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,400
are you ready?

586
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,240
Yes.

587
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,360
Yukuan.

588
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,720
Yukuan.

589
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,280
Be careful.

590
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,640
It's okay.

591
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,880
That's weird.

592
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,000
It's almost time.

593
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,560
Why isn't the nurse here?

594
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,360
Lawrence tea.

595
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,440
The liver is soft and the soup is fragrant.

596
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,600
the way of Crown Prince Solo實器習取給

597
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,200
your Majesty is the humongous gift.

598
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,200
•えused in tiny pieces.

599
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,720
• It is fear that day day

600
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,640
It's more delicious than the fish tongue.

601
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,640
It's more delicious than the fish tongue.

602
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,640
There's also a lot of vegetables in the goose's stomach.

603
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
It's not bad.

604
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Your Majesty,

605
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
let's eat together.

606
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,640
Your Majesty,

607
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
let's eat together.

608
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,640
The goose's meat is as soft as a tooth.

609
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
It's tender and tender.

610
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
It's also known that

611
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,640
there's also blood in the bone.

612
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,640
It's not as pure as the taste.

613
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
It makes people feel less hungry.

614
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
Right?

615
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Right?

616
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
Master Hu,

617
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,640
how did you make this dish?

618
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,640
You have to remember that

619
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
the dish that Master Hu gave us

620
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,640
is the legendary Fire-Cooking-Egg.

621
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Mother,

622
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
what is Fire-Cooking-Egg?

623
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
Your Highness,

624
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,640
that is to cook the goose with iron and dragon fruit.

625
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
It's a charcoal-cooked dish.

626
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
The goose is hot and it's a bit spicy.

627
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,640
The goose is dry and the goose is fat.

628
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,640
The goose is tender and the goose is tender.

629
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,640
It's not as tender as the goose.

630
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
How dare you!

631
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
You're so cruel!

632
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

633
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
Master Hu,

634
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,640
it's natural to be cruel when you're being cruel.

635
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,640
How could you be so cruel?

636
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
What are you doing?

637
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Your Majesty.

638
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,640
Your Majesty, you're so kind.

639
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,640
You've been so kind.

640
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
How dare I?

641
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
It's just that

642
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
the way to cook the goose

643
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
is very well-made.

644
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Please forgive me.

645
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,640
Please take a look at His Majesty.

646
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
What is this?

647
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Your Majesty,

648
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,640
this is the kohui of the vinegar.

649
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
This is kohui of the vinegar?

650
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
This goose is made with kohui

651
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,640
and is made with firewood.

652
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,640
It's called fire-cooking goose.

653
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,640
I have no idea.

654
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
I misunderstood you.

655
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,640
Please forgive me.

656
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,640
You're so kind.

657
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
You're so cruel.

658
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,640
You're so kind.

659
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,640
But you're so kind.

660
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
Let's be together.

661
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Your Majesty,

662
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
it's the festival of the holy month.

663
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
I'm so happy

664
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,640
because of these small things.

665
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
You two must be

666
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,640
feeling bored today.

667
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,640
So I've made you happy.

668
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
All right.

669
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
You may leave.

670
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,640
Get ready to cook.

671
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,640
Yes.

672
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Your Majesty.

673
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Are you all right?

674
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,640
Yes.

675
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
I think it's serious.

676
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,640
Why do you say that?

677
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,640
She's hurt like this.

678
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,640
She's still doing this.

679
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
I can't do it anyway.

680
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,640
I can't do it either.

681
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,640
Your Majesty,

682
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,640
don't you know

683
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,640
if she'll be affected in the future?

684
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,640
I think she'll be in a bad mood

685
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,640
if she gets hurt like this.

686
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,640
I'll get the rest of the bowl.

687
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,640
You're sweating.

688
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,640
I'll do the rest.

689
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,640
Go do something else.

690
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,640
Ziping,

691
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,640
can you do this?

692
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,640
I've seen it many times.

693
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,640
I've learned it.

694
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,640
You go do something else.

695
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
It's all right.

696
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Be careful.

697
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,640
Zijin,

698
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,640
this is my private treasure.

699
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,640
It's a miracle for the pain of the bone.

700
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
At least,

701
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,640
it can relieve the pain of a lifetime.

702
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:32,640
Zijin,

703
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,640
I'm sorry.

704
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
I'm sorry.

705
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,640
I'm sorry.

706
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,640
I'm sorry.

707
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
I'm sorry.

708
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,640
I'm sorry.

709
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,640
I'm sorry.

710
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,640
I'm sorry.

711
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,640
I'm sorry.

712
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,640
I'm sorry.

713
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,640
I'm sorry.

714
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,640
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,640
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,640
I'm sorry.

717
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,640
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,640
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,640
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,640
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,640
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,640
I'm sorry.

723
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,640
I'm sorry.

724
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,640
I'm sorry.

725
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,640
I'm sorry.

726
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,640
I'm sorry.

727
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,640
I'm sorry.

728
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,640
I'm sorry.

729
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,640
I'm sorry.

730
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,640
I'm sorry.

731
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,640
I'm sorry.

732
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,640
I'm sorry.

733
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,640
I'm sorry.

734
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,640
I'm sorry.

735
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,640
I'm sorry.

736
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,640
We were said this content is not appropriate.

737
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,640
It's not reasonable.

738
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,640
I'm sorry.

739
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,640
I think I'm sp chirpy.

740
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
I think I'm innocent.

741
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,640
We're so innocent.

742
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,640
We're so innocent and tender.

743
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,640
Look!

744
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,640
Excuse me.

745
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,640
Who are you?

746
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,640
Are you my maid?

747
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,840
Waiting for the loneliness to leave the firefly

748
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:10,120
And dream to meet the happiness in my dreams

749
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,080
Someone will come back to me

750
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,760
I thought

751
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:25,200
Waiting for the loneliness to leave the firefly

752
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,200
And dream to meet the happiness in my dreams

753
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:38,200
Someone will come back to me
