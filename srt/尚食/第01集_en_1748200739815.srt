193
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:02,900
You're so stupid.

194
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,580
You're so stupid.

195
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,300
You're so stupid.

196
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,060
You're so stupid.

197
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,820
You're so stupid.

198
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,540
You're so stupid.

199
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,300
You're so stupid.

200
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:07,860
You're awake.

201
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,860
Your Highness.

202
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,940
I'm not talking about you.

203
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,260
Why aren't you anxious?

204
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,620
Since when?

205
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,220
I'm not talking about you.

206
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,940
The rest of the family is in a mess.

207
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm afraid that the Eastern Palace will be in danger again.

208
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,420
It's hard to get up.

209
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,900
Father is used to it.

210
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,500
It's okay to be used to it.

211
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,340
But Lord Han has gone back this time.

212
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,420
I don't know how many things are going to happen.

213
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,380
Father will be used to it.

214
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,740
Your Highness.

215
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,740
The crown prince is still looking forward to your return to the capital for his own good.

216
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,700
Are you anxious?

217
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,740
Yes.

218
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,540
I'm anxious for the crown prince in the heart.

219
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,500
Not only you.

220
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,700
I'm anxious.

221
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,700
I don't move.

222
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,420
I don't move.

223
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,420
I don't move.

224
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,420
I'm so fast.

225
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
I have a way.

226
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,900
Your Highness, say it.

227
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,100
Turn around.

228
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,940
You must be anxious in the car.

229
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,020
It's better to go down and push the car to the right place.

230
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,260
Your Highness.

231
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,580
Your Highness.

232
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,460
I can't bear to lose it.

233
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:08,980
Move aside.

234
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,380
Your Highness, go up the horse.

235
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,540
The emperor said today that

236
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,060
everything is not easy.

237
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,740
It's a good idea to travel.

238
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,020
It's true that

239
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,740
it's hard to travel back and forth on the way.

240
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,020
It's hard to travel back and forth on the way.

241
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,340
But I've been lucky since I was a kid.

242
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,340
Master Yao said that

243
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,620
I had three wives.

244
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,860
I was lucky to help each other.

245
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,860
Even if I encounter something difficult,

246
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,060
I will be able to drive the mountain.

247
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,700
That's for sure.

248
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,220
I love you.

249
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,820
I'm going to be lucky like God.

250
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,620
I will be able to push the car.

251
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,900
I will be able to push the car.

252
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,180
Come on.

253
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,300
Let's try it again.

254
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,140
Come on.

255
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,580
Hurry up.

256
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:43,940
Come on.

257
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,420
Push the car.

258
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,460
Come on.

259
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,140
I'll push the car.

260
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,980
One, two, three.

261
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,700
Go.

262
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:48,940
Go.

263
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,060
Go.

264
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,100
Who is after Zuo?

265
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,100
Who is after Zuo?

266
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,980
Zuo so that

267
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,260
he can set up an engagement.

268
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,780
Lady Zou.

269
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,180
I hope so.

270
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,220
Sir,

271
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,500
she's good.

272
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,500
Are you sure?

273
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,940
Put her on.

274
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,980
I confess.

275
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,780
It's just a test and no one here

276
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,580
would know.

277
00:12:59,220 --> 00:12:59,660
Yeah, no.

278
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,740
There is no one here for me.

279
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,180
I'm just worried,

280
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,180
I will save her.

281
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:03,740
Thanks.

282
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,220
Yao Zijing,

283
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,220
these three people are out of the camp.

284
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,220
Both of you are good at fighting.

285
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,220
These three people are all so long-winded.

286
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
The judges are also hard to distinguish.

287
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,220
Please sit down and decide.

288
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,220
You will be the first to be nominated.

289
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
It seems simple, but it's a very challenging dish.

290
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,220
But it's still the first time I've met a senior or a male.

291
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,220
Do you three know

292
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,220
what the hidden tricks are?

293
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,220
The world is based on the art of poetry and literature.

294
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,220
That's right.

295
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,220
A good painting and a good word can pass through thousands of bones.

296
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,220
But I think

297
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
you are the God of the world.

298
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,220
The God of the world is the God of the world.

299
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,220
The great master of the world is a genius.

300
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,220
I entered the palace

301
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,220
to learn the real hidden tricks.

302
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,220
I met the holy banquet of the ancient sword

303
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,220
and became the world's first famous chef.

304
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
Such a big tone.

305
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,220
Don't say that.

306
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,220
I'm the first born of the world.

307
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,220
I'm just a rice soup that can save people's lives.

308
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,220
The current emperor is a famous monk who is a great cook.

309
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,220
The so-called intelligence

310
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,220
is the most expensive food

311
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,220
that can be used to make enough food for the rich.

312
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Those so-called famous holy banquet

313
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,220
are just a waste of time and waste of money.

314
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,220
I'm just a famous monk.

315
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,220
What about you?

316
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,220
If I don't enter the palace,

317
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,220
my father will force me to marry him.

318
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,220
So I have a reason to not enter the palace.

319
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,220
These three people

320
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,220
will leave the palace together.

321
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
Wang Sishan.

322
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,220
They have met the holy banquet and have been separated.

323
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,220
Why didn't they pass the banquet?

324
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Yin Ziping.

325
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,220
You have already passed the world's famous holy banquet.

326
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,220
Even if they didn't pass,

327
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,220
how could they dare to speak out their opinions?

328
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,220
And you, Su Yuehua,

329
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,220
are still young and talented.

330
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
Do you know what the cause of the coup is?

331
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,220
And the first place in the world?

332
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,220
As for you, Yao Zijing,

333
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,220
you are not right.

334
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,220
You are not sincere.

335
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,220
You are just a man of the world.

336
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,220
Lord Sishan.

337
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,220
I beg you.

338
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,220
Please give me another chance.

339
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,220
I will change it.

340
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
Lord Sishan.

341
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,220
Lord Sishan, I beg you.

342
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,220
Please forgive me.

343
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,220
Lord Sishan.

344
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,220
I will change it.

345
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,220
Lord Sishan.

346
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
Lord Sishan, I beg you.

347
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,220
Get up.

348
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,220
Get up.

349
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Lord Sishan.

350
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,220
I beg you.

351
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,220
Please forgive me.

352
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Lord Sishan.

353
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,220
I beg you. I will change it.

354
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,220
Wang Sishan.

355
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,220
It's a good fortune.

356
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,220
Please forgive me.

357
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,220
Let's go.

358
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,220
Don't touch me.

359
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,220
I will go.

360
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
Let me go.

361
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,220
I won't go.

362
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,220
I will stay.

363
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,220
Lord Sishan.

364
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,220
Mr. Meng, you are back.

365
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,220
Lord Sishan.

366
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,220
Greetings, Mr. Meng.

367
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,220
The emperor is back.

368
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,220
He just received the decree.

369
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
The officials of the palace tonight

370
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,220
will be rewarded by three soldiers.

371
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
The four of them will be sent to the battlefield.

372
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
They will be in a hurry.

373
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,220
I ask the minister to help them.

374
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Today, the person who will participate in the banquet

375
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
will be dismissed.

376
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Mr. Meng.

377
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Let's start.

378
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
Yes, sir.

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,140
It's late.

437
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,780

the public will be rewarded.

458
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,020
The first step of the first step, you must reward the people.

The company is rather Pawson.

527
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,040
It's terrible.

528
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,480

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,240
If we can't do it,

539
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
we'll be in trouble.

540
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,920
Is it still not enough?

541
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,160
If His Majesty doesn't use it,

542
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,920
will we be punished?

543
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
The law is in the hands of the people.

544
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,520
If His Majesty doesn't use it,

545
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,920
it means he's incompetent.

546
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,320
He's a incompetent person.

547
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,360
What's the use of keeping it?

548
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,400
What should we do?

549
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Hurry and find a way.

550
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,880
Don't worry.

551
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,760
This is Chongyang Palace.

552
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,160
That is the military office.

553
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,280
The fire department is not in time.

554
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,920
The military is about to be in trouble.

No, we can't.

560

The fire department is not over yet.

561
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
It's not over yet.

562
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,160

It's useless for you to stay.

566
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,000
Han Ying,

567
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,120
take someone with you

568
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,480
to the imperial decree.

569
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,720
Come with me.

570
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,280
You two go there.

571
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,400
Let's go.

572
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,040
What should we do, Hu Si Shan?

573
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,160
What about Wan Yan?

574
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
What should I do?

575
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,760
Go on.

576
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,840
Shall I?

577
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,880
That's for me.

578
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,160
Go on.

579
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
The 이제...

580
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,200
I had sent you

581
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,480
along with all the troubles

582
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,160
you had caused.

583
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,080
I must have it.

584
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,760
Why didn't the Crown Prince go to the outside of the city to win the throne?

585
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,800
Father, I'm very generous.

586
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,600
I'm not good at riding.

587
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,240
I'll be punished

588
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,080
if I'm late.

589
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,720
Please punish me.

590
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,040
Father.

591
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,320
We can't blame you for that.

592
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,160
I didn't blame anyone.

593
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,240
I only blamed it on those various social men.

594
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,620
When Ji cage

595
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,420
continuous against Hunting

596
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:44,920
in Beigui Court,

597
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:48,120
Its Minister Tab Agnes

598
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,440
is partly broke.

599
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,960
So he left Chang He

600
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm disappointed.

601
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,160
Father,

602
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,080
I can't handle it.

603
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,040
Please punish me.

604
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,640
Hurry up.

605
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,480
Hurry up.

606
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,120
Hurry up.

607
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,840
Hurry up.

608
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,520
Hurry up.

609
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,160
Hurry up.

610
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,960
Hurry up.

611
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
Hurry up.

612
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
Hurry up.

613
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,640
Hurry up.

614
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,320
Hurry up.

615
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
Hurry up.

616
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,840
Hurry up.

617
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,400
We're already here.

618
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,120
Where's the master?

619
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:23,760
Where's the master?

620
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,320
What's wrong?

621
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,160
Why didn't you come?

622
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,080
It's getting dark.

623
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,000
We haven't given up yet.

624
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,720
Yes.

625
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,480
I want to eat.

626
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,040
I want to eat with you.

627
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,800
Let's eat.

628
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,960
You're here to depend on the army.

629
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,120
Why haven't you given up yet?

630
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
The soldiers are really hard-working.

631
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,440
But we have too many people.

632
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,120
We have to be careful.

633
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,360
Be careful.

634
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,080
Right.

635
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,040
Don't go.

636
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,560
Don't go.

637
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,520
Minister Si Cheng,

638
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,040
you finally came.

639
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,880
Now,

640
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,200
we have our own pot.

641
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,600
And the one in the army.

642
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,720
We've used it all.

643
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,800
It's not enough.

644
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
It's too little.

645
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,920
The emperor has already sent the imperial decree.

646
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
We have to prepare

647
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,040
a dinner for thousands of people.

648
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,280
I really can't do it.

649
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,000
How about

650
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,440
we go out again

651
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,680
and find something in the storage room?

652
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,280
Can I find something?

653
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,800
Are there people in the imperial court?

654
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,280
The imperial court is so powerful.

655
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm sure there won't be a good one.

656
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,640
Yes.

657
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,760
Minister Zhao, yes.

658
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,360
Go ahead.

659
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,160
Okay.

660
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,400
Han Ying,

661
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,080
the Minister of State of Guanglu is so cruel.

662
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,960
How can he not be careful?

663
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,920
Moreover,

664
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,600
if the army is not full of impetus,

665
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
how can the king and the army be punished?

666
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,480
They deliberately

667
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,800
make things difficult for us.

668
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,880
It's chaotic here.

669
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,120
Let's go back to the palace.

670
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,520
Now, we have to resist

671
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,840
and kill ourselves.

672
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,640
Back then,

673
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,040
the Minister of State of Guanglu

674
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,600
was a good man.

675
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,760
The Minister of State of Shang is a good man.

676
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,200
That's the rule.

677
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,560
But the Minister of State of Meng is not good at it.

678
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,680
Now,

679
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,360
I'm looking at you.

680
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,120
Minister Zhao,

681
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,280
is the Minister of State of Guanglu

682
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,400
not our business?

683
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,560
Fine.

684
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,000
I've brought 500 ministers of state.

685
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,200
You can use them all.

686
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,320
But now,

687
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,400
do you have any tricks?

688
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,040
I'll go to the palace.

689
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,480
Where should I go?

690
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
I have my way.

691
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,600
But,

692
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,720
can you delay for another half an hour?

693
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,600
Don't talk about half an hour.

694
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,800
Even one moment,

695
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,000
you can't delay.

696
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,160
You want to run away, right?

697
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,800
You can come back in half an hour.

698
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,000
I can.

699
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,240
You, come here.

700
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,560
Take some people with you.

701
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,960
Yes.

702
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,200
Where are you going?

703
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,360
Hurry up.

704
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,280
Stop.

705
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,440
Someone's here.

706
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,200
Someone's in there.

707
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,600
Open the door.

708
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,880
Someone's here.

709
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,960
Open the door.

710
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,400
The emperor has called for you.

711
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,120
The school in the left-hand side is Yang Shiqi.

712
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,640
The Talisman is missing.

713
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,160
The four cities in Honglu are Liu Shun.

714
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,760
The memorial is lost.

715
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
Minister Li is traveling.

716
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,000
The teacher is teaching.

717
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,920
Minister Li is in charge of the Talisman Talisman.

718
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,280
The teacher is absent.

719
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
The teacher is absent.

720
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
The teacher is absent.

721
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
The teacher is absent.

722
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
The teacher is absent.

723
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,520
Everyone is waiting.

724
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,400
The teacher is absent.

725
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
The teacher is absent.

726
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,160
Your Majesty.

727
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,360
The crown prince is in charge of the school.

728
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,080
Even if he's guilty,

729
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,160
he'll be punished by me.

730
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,720
I'm willing to take the punishment.

731
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,840
Your Majesty.

732
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm willing to take the punishment.

733
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,080
I'm willing to take the punishment.

734
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm willing to take the punishment.

735
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,400
Your Majesty.

736
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
Father.

737
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,640
His Majesty is in charge of the Talisman Talisman.

738
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:40,960
It's so early for the Talisman maintenance to come.

739
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,960
Long time no see.

740
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,680
The governorтя gave us an pouvezzie in the form of a memorial ceremony.

741
00:34:43,680 --> 00:35:03,480
The publishing house of the speeches qualifies WeChat

742
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,440
Go!

743
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,160
My dear son,

744
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Hurry up! Everyone come help us.

745
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Let's go and have a meal.

746
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
It's hurt! It's hurt!

747
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
Hurry up!

748
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

749
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

750
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
The fish is here!

751
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

752
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Come on, hold it.

753
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

754
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

755
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

756
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

757
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Hurry up! Hurry up!

758
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,160
Mr. Zhao,

759
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
didn't you say they were in the wrong country?

760
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
Then,

761
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
let's see if we can make it.

762
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Yan Tao, tell the other campers to prepare the first dish.

763
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,160
We'll do as you say.

764
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Okay.

765
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
I hope he can come back in time.

766
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
According to the imperial decree of the Beizheng Stone,

767
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
His Majesty's body is not in a bad condition.

768
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
But this journey is full of ups and downs.

769
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
It must be a long journey.

770
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,160
Why is it useless?

771
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
Hu Si Shan.

772
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
I was afraid that I'd be bold to say something

773
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,160
if I went into the palace for a long time.

774
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Please believe me once.

775
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160
You guessed right today.

776
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
You can stay here.

777
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
If you guess it wrong,

778
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,160
what should we do?

779
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
The country has limited numbers.

780
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
It's too late to be afraid of being held by others.

781
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
It's time.

782
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
It's not enough to drag us down.

783
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
He's coming.

784
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
He's back.

785
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
He's back.

786
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
Why did he come to such a big country?

787
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
I've been through a lot.

788
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,160
Let's go.

789
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Let's go back to the capital.

790
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Okay.

791
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Hurry up.

792
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
So it is.

793
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Your Majesty.

794
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,160
Your Majesty.

795
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
The palace is full of people.

796
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
I'm afraid that His Majesty will be displeased.

797
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
I chose to kill the chicken liver.

798
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
After the throne,

799
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
I'll go to the dragon and steam the water.

800
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
I'll make a soup.

801
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
Please taste it.

802
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
Your Majesty.

803
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
Your Majesty.

804
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,160
Your Majesty.

805
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,160
The tofu is very tender.

806
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,160
It's so tender and delicious.

807
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
Your Majesty.

808
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Your Majesty.

809
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
It's so delicious.

810
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
Your Majesty.

811
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
When I was cooking,

812
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
I used the sesame seeds,

813
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
the cinnamon,

814
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
the tofu and the Chinese medicine.

815
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
It was delicious.

816
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
So it's fragrant and rich.

817
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
It's so delicious.

818
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
It's even more delicious.

819
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
I choose it.

820
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:12,380
It must be

821
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,780
and the emperor finally built up his power.

822
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,080
just do this.

823
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,100
This thing can't rest in peace.

824
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,240
Let me do it.

825
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,420
Mr. Meng.

826
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,940
Mr. Meng.

827
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:36,960
Ummm.

828
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
As for the crown prince...

829
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Father!

830
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
Father!

831
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Father!

832
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Greetings, father.

833
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
Why is the crown prince here?

834
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
Father!

835
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
My army has been fighting for a long time.

836
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,160
Mother will leave here in person.

837
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
She will be punished by father.

838
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Mother is kind-hearted.

839
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,160
She has been fighting for a long time.

840
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,160
She is a military officer.

841
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
She is a good person.

842
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
She is a courtier.

843
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
I can't bear to see her kindness.

844
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
I can't bear to see her kindness.

845
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
According to my army,

846
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
Chen Xi is a good person.

847
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
He is a good person.

848
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I will help father to live long life.

849
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
May the world be blessed with a long life.

850
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
May the world be blessed with a long life.

851
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Father!

852
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,160
This is the title of the title of the child's mother.

853
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
Father!

854
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
Father!

855
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
Father!
