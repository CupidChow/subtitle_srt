1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,960
The world is full of love

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,120
A mouthful of love

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,320
The whole world is full of love

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,600
The flow of the flow of the flow of love

5
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,600
The flow of the flow of love

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,960
The flow of the flow of love

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,960
The flow of the flow of love

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,960
The flow of the flow of love

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,960
The flow of the flow of love

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,400
The flow of the flow of love

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,600
The flow of the flow of the flow of love

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,200
The flow of the flow of love

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,200
The flow of the flow of love

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,840
That darkness

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,720
Is your wish only

16
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,900
No Love by ball

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,280
This is the crab king of husband and son

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
I can't eat the filling, but it's very sticky.

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
I've been asking Noble Consort Wei about this for the last time.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,280
After I go back, I can't smell the crab's smell.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I thought I can't eat it anymore.

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Who said you'd stay and eat it?

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
Go back now.

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Don't even want to eat it.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm the one who's going to follow the new path.

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm the one who's going to let go.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Free-Fa...

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,280
The Powerful Eight is charged at a charge of over 200 kilometers.

29
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
The enemy will bring you to the right place.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
It tastes good.

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
It's just too hot.

32
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Your Majesty,

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
the car should be parked outside.

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Su Si Shan,

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
you made the dishes too delicate.

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Lord Liu is afraid that it's not enough.

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Don't go out and eat the cake.

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Thank you.

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
You're welcome.

40
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Hurry up.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
It's delicious.

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,280
It's delicious.

43
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Coming.

44
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
V anything.

45
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
It's just dirty.

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
It's nothing to brag.

47
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
I'm embarrassed if I漂亮 the neatness of the dishes.

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Please eat it.

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Lord Ye.

50
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Even though fine dishes can be changed,

51
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
they may need healthy one at first training.

52
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
The pork belly should be steamed for a while.

53
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
It's safe.

54
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,280
It's just sour vegetables and crab meat.

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
The taste is very clear and delicious.

56
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
It's really delicious.

57
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Brother, you should try it too.

58
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
You must be hungry.

59
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
What kind of food is this?

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Your Majesty,

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,280
the original army was retreating from Jiangxi south-west.

62
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
The food in the city was washed away.

63
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
A lady who was very careful

64
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
found the rice in the ground.

65
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
So she collected it and made it into rice and ginger.

66
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,280
The steamed rice in the pot

67
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
contains various ingredients.

68
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
She added the cooked tea oil.

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
It's a very delicious rice-flavored soup.

70
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
It's very delicious.

71
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
It looks very normal.

72
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
It's very delicious.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Your Highness, you can't be anxious to be hungry.

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280
The candy bag looks like it's not full of equipment.

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Be careful.

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280
You'll be in trouble.

77
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
What the Lord said is true.

78
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
When the rumors spread that

79
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Sun Quan married and married Liu Bei,

80
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,280
she loved crab meat since she was little.

81
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,280
She was more considerate after she left the country.

82
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,280
Someone made crab meat with crab meat

83
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
to make the soup.

84
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
It's to commemorate her.

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
It's a little hot.

86
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
It's still hot.

87
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
It's hot.

88
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
It's a little bit spicy after it's cooled.

89
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
The fat sausage and rice vermicelli

90
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,280
are well-mixed.

91
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
It's still the cold

92
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
that the three countries

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
have been selling for a long time.

94
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
I forgot to remind you that

95
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
there are pepper powder in it.

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Try the fried cakes or the candy.

97
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Lord You,

98
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
do you like it?

99
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Do you think I look okay?

100
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
I'm sorry, my Lord.

101
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
I've put a lot of pepper powder in it.

102
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,280
Are you afraid of putting a pot of pepper powder

103
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
in it and giving it to me?

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Yunzhou often leaves the capital for business.

105
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
I think the food in each country

106
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
has been tasted once.

107
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,280
You can't eat anything.

108
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
The world is full of delicious food.

109
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Even if you eat three meals a day,

110
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
you can eat fresh food.

111
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
You can't finish it

112
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
until you're 1,000 years old.

113
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
This is the lamb head.

114
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
When Song Dynasty was in the imperial court,

115
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
it was famous for its rich and noble.

116
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Only when it was in the late night reading,

117
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
he loved this lamb head the most.

118
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
It's said that the best person in the palace

119
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
is not the kitchen in the palace,

120
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,280
but the wife of the old lady.

121
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Who is she?

122
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
This story has to be told slowly.

123
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Noble Consort Sun,

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I like the story of Yin Si Shan.

125
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Let her serve me in the future.

126
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Your Highness the Empress,

127
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
you escaped from Su Si Shan.

128
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Now, even Yin Si Shan has to escape.

129
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,280
If I can't eat the food other people cook in the future,

130
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,280
what should I do?

131
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
I'll go to the palace to eat the food

132
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
that you prepared for me.

133
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
What should I do?

134
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll go to you.

135
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
This...

136
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm afraid it's not good.

137
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Since the Empress likes it,

138
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I'll let Yin Si Shan

139
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
serve you in the future.

140
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

141
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,280
I'll leave the edict.

142
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,340
The Emperor's court

143
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
We can't wait any longer.

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
It's the best in the past.

145
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Drive on.

146
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll go.

147
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
They're all in the room.

148
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,840
Let's go.

149
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,880
Let's go.

150
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Eunuch Chen didn't guard outside the city to serve His Majesty.

151
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,680
Where did he go?

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
When Yin Si Shan wants to prepare the food,

153
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll go around.

154
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,600
Go around?

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,560
You look little awkward now.

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm going to the steps.

157
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,040
You don't need to Stuff yourself.

158
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,720
I have to see if the soup is ready.

159
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,840
I'll go and see

160
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,480
how the food in Yin Si Mountain is.

161
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,960
Your Highness, please.

162
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,800
Your Highness.

163
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,320
Noble Consort, you are really generous.

164
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,040
You even sent me a chef.

165
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
As far as I know,

166
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
Yin Si Mountain is a different civilization.

167
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,560
It's been a long time since I read it.

168
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,000
It's not as good as the food in the army.

169
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,120
Who is the person who told the story?

170
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,560
He is a sage.

171
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,840
He dares to question me.

172
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,920
He is really a sage.

173
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,280
Do you know how many people in the city

174
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,440
have a lot of people?

175
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,360
Some things he doesn't even dare to touch.

176
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,560
There is a reason behind it.

177
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm afraid that

178
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,520
the officials and officials who are involved

179
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,480
will hate you for being innocent.

180
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,880
You don't even want to live.

181
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I am a person with a short life.

182
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,600
I can only care about the future.

183
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,440
What?

184
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,360
Your Highness.

185
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,880
I only like Guo Kui.

186
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,720
I can't care about the rice flour.

187
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm sure.

188
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,320
Who can care about you?

189
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,240
Can I have a drink?

190
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,440
I am probablysen't

191
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,880
youremploSD Forget it.

192
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,040
Please have a drink.

193
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,160
I can take a sip.

194
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,560
Now that Aquiper Sun

195
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,880
holds the emperor's Discord now,

196
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,680
it's all out of the world.

197
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,400
It should be the maid

198
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,680
that made all the suggestions to secure Ahijus' military autonomy.

199
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,440
is 배洶하

200
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,840
It's if and Whom you retire

201
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,520
to久不君

202
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
and the only glory in the world.

203
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
He also said that if you didn't stop him,

204
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
he would have made a big mistake.

205
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,520
So, you were the one who was destined to die.

206
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
You made him realize it in one go.

207
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
The soup is here.

208
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
The soup.

209
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
It's the soup.

210
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Your Majesty,

211
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
didn't you insist on giving the royal consort the gold and treasure?

212
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Tell her that I'm pregnant.

213
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Okay.

214
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Your Majesty.

215
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Your Majesty.

216
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Stand there.

217
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
PA's啊,

218
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
What are you doing here?

219
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
Sorry, theforties.

220
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Do you have to then transport your seat belt?

221
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Yes sir.

222
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Do we even next time?

223
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Yes sir.

224
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
What are you going to bring back for us?

225
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
You nearly banged me in.

226
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
You are so lazy.

227
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,280
You were so careless

228
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,320
that I asked her to go out with you.

229
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,200
Eunuch,

230
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,440
this won't be counted as fair battle

231
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
for Your Highness just because Your Highness is here.

232
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,440
I was so ashamed of myself that I gave my Rong Le

233
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,960
a life in vain.

234
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,320
I received it from the empress.

235
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,360
Your Highness,

236
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,560
I'm afraid that

237
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,720
the food delivered to Kunning Palace

238
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,560
will be checked by Ziqi.

239
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,680
I'm not afraid of that.

240
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,960
What are you worried about?

241
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,680
Noble Consort Sun is not a coward.

242
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,160
She's kind to the heart of the people.

243
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,960
Her Highness the Empress

244
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,840
is so angry that

245
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,280
she left the goods with her.

246
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,320
Moreover,

247
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,080
how many cooks are there in the restaurant?

248
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,080
The cooking skills of Yin Si Shan

249
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,000
are not necessarily...

250
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,440
It's fragrant and crispy.

251
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,200
It's crispy.

252
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,040
Have a taste.

253
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,960
Yin Si Shan is a good cook.

254
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
But she's so good at cooking.

255
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,440
That story was good.

256
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,640
We'll hear it tomorrow.

257
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,600
My Lord.

258
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,800
The emperor suddenly summoned us.

259
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,120
You need to go to more places.

260
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,080
What places?

261
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,560
What places?

262
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,240
My Lord.

263
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,080
After the emperor's return to the palace,

264
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,600
he sent all the guards.

265
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,240
The soldiers and the imperial guards

266
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,320
were severely injured.

267
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,920
What if the emperor is angry with you?

268
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,560
My Lord.

269
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,200
My Lord.

270
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,080
Let's go.

271
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,480
Eunuch Chen.

272
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,160
Where are we going?

273
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,480
I'll tell you on the way.

274
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,440
I'll get in the car.

275
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,440
Go.

276
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,120
Go.

277
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,640
It's this one.

278
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,360
It's a good one.

279
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,960
Two people from the north and two from the north are chasing after it.

280
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,680
If you have any news, come and report it immediately.

281
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,400
Yes.

282
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,240
You, follow me.

283
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,040
Yes.

284
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,080
Go.

285
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,040
Go.

286
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,240
Go.

287
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,320
Good morning,�

288
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,480
Eunuch Chen.

289
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,760
You, the farmer is getting more and more demonstrationable.

290
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,920
Immortal You is quite fraudulent.

291
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,200
The guard is here.

292
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,000
But his head is still cracked?

293
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,200
Isn't he here to helping him.

294
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,560
Know the farm cause?

295
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,800
He wishes that we don't cause suspicion.

296
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,280
Please pardon him.

297
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,800
Hey, what are you looking at?

298
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,800
Mr. Jiang.

299
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,640
You are still in runner-up because you are so old.

300
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Thank you for your hard work.

301
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,760
You're the young man who came here.

302
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,080
Sometimes you don't know anything.

303
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,680
You're not even a good man.

304
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,400
You're still hungry.

305
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,640
People say that spring is coming.

306
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,800
Autumn is coming.

307
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,360
You have to go down the road.

308
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
You can rest when you arrive in winter.

309
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,480
Winter?

310
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,280
You have to take the medicine in winter.

311
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,680
If you can't do it,

312
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,640
you'll be in trouble.

313
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,880
Yu. Yu.

314
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,560
Can you let me try it?

315
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,560
Grandpa?

316
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,680
I studied with my grandpa

317
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,560
for a while.

318
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,000
Okay, you try it.

319
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,040
Sir, this is not right.

320
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
Take it back. Don't eat it.

321
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,560
Yu. Yu.

322
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,960
Old man,

323
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,920
since you're so hard-working,

324
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,560
why don't you go and buy some?

325
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,240
You can do whatever you want.

326
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,240
The people are always busy.

327
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,600
Mr. Wang is a big man.

328
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,600
If you don't meet the weather,

329
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,840
you can get a warm hug.

330
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,880
You can go out and do business.

331
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,200
Where's the money?

332
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,400
You can pick a bag

333
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,760
and run 200-300 miles a day,

334
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,360
and make a few pounds of barley.

335
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,720
If you meet a bad man,

336
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,520
you can't even talk.

337
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,040
You're not as good as a local.

338
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Go. Go. Go.

339
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,000
What kind of people are they?

340
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,520
They're warm and gentle.

341
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,040
Come out. Come out.

342
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,120
Hurry up. Hurry up.

343
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,400
Okay.

344
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,360
Your Majesty.

345
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,240
Differentan grass like this

346
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,280
tend to make folks injured while filming.

347
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,000
Please be careful, Your Majesty.

348
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,080
There's nothing impolite about Lin Zhou.

349
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,120
I haven't been out yet,

350
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,000
but there's news from the field.

351
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,360
It's not enough to know.

352
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,600
The most difficult thing

353
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,120
in this world is the people of Zhongtian.

354
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,920
That's true.

355
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,400
People live in the world for a thousand years.

356
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,760
When will they stop crying?

357
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,960
Who will stop them?

358
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,600
The Story of the Phoenix

359
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,120
Episode 19

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,040
Your Highness, you've been running for a long time.

361
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,320
You've been out of the palace for a long time.

362
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,000
His Majesty went out of the palace?

363
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,920
Where did he go?

364
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,560
Your Highness, you asked me this.

365
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,000
We're servants.

366
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,520
How dare you ask me where I'm going?

367
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,920
Fine.

368
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,160
Your Highness, what else do you have?

369
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,160
Jin.

370
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,160
Let's go.

371
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,180
I'll definitely give aed

372
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,800
this view to our Fengğim.

373
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,520
Mr. Yuan,

374
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,420
Will Noble Consort Sun

375
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,200
have known that you're wanting to take a fall from the Aaa of Qampong?

376
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,160
Such a good洗 has Sheraven't been sleeping,

377
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,000
far and wide.

378
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,480
I know much more about Charlotte than her.

379
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
What are you afraid of?

380
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,360
You'll fear what?

381
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,320
What are you afraid of?

382
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
Tell you what instead.

383
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,840
There's no H青 Book in this palace.

384
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,640
His Majesty is de얼.

385
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,720
It'sело야

386
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,200
I just want to see Noble Consort.

387
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,280
How old are you?

388
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,200
Don't say it.

389
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,680
Let's go.

390
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
Hurry up.

391
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,640
Let's go.

392
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,480
Hurry up.

393
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,920
Give me a break.

394
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,720
Hurry up.

395
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,240
Let's go.

396
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,120
Hurry up.

397
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,120
Wait for me.

398
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,840
Hurry up.

399
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Wait for me.

400
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,640
Come on.

401
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,960
Are you okay?

402
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm fine.

403
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,440
Let's go.

404
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,000
Come on.

405
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,480
Here.

406
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,000
Let me help you.

407
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,160
I'll do it.

408
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,400
Thank you.

409
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,720
It's okay.

410
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,360
Where do you live?

411
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,200
We'll take you back.

412
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,520
Right in front of us.

413
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,320
Okay.

414
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,760
Come on.

415
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,240
Thank you.

416
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,320
It's okay.

417
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,320
anny.

418
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,720
Take a break here.

419
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,600
Okay.

420
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,760
Come on.

421
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,400
Keep it here.

422
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,860
Come on.

423
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,120
Come on in.

424
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,000
Come in.

425
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,240
Come on in here.

426
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,480
I can drink some water too.

427
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,520
Dad.

428
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,440
Two Oil Erase Manager,

429
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,480
and Excellency Dong Yuan,

430
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,840
In the past,

431
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:10,480
A man might

432
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,600
remind people

433
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,280
toKendra

434
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,920
The emperor wanted to let the old people of Gu Gua

435
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,480
go to Yangji Garden.

436
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,240
The bandits have everything.

437
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,560
But...

438
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,120
Your Majesty.

439
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,640
There are 4,500 people

440
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,880
who live in Yangji Garden in Beijing.

441
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,440
The court is full of burden.

442
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,160
There is a big loss in the world.

443
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,640
Why do you blame yourself?

444
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,760
No.

445
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,360
I did it wrong.

446
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,080
I did it in Japan.

447
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,920
How many people are in the capital?

448
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,400
Only 500 people.

449
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,560
I feel sad.

450
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,440
If everyone can be as loyal as you,

451
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,160
the people of the world

452
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,320
may be much better.

453
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,840
Before, the emperor and the emperor

454
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,640
protected your talent.

455
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,200
From now on,

456
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,800
I will let you go.

457
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,880
I will do what you really want.

458
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,480
Water is coming.

459
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:27,800
Here.

460
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,320
Drink some water.

461
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,880
Thank you.

462
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,120
Here.

463
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,320
Sit.

464
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,200
streets

465
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,840
for privately refurbishing through Xu'an betrothalまか

466
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,800
that can cure Yan State property.

467
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,040
If no authorities can c eure the vote,

468
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,160
nothing will be lost.

469
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,680
Anyone who dares to opening your gates

470
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,400
will be punished to dust!

471
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,840
Yes.

472
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,120
Your Majesty,

473
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Should we go back to the palace?

474
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
The Empress has a good appetite today.

475
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,120
But she likes sweet soup.

476
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,120
When will she be able to eat it?

477
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Your Highness,

478
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Yin Si Shan will go to Yongming Palace every day.

479
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
She will be back in an hour.

480
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Your Highness,

481
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
you are...

482
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,120
It's too bad that you are so pitiful.

483
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Your Highness.

484
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
Your Majesty,

485
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
why are you hurt?

486
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
No.

487
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Where is the memorial?

488
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
The memorial is on the case.

489
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
But...

490
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Why are you here?

491
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Your Majesty.

492
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
Your Majesty, you came back late at night

493
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
after you were out of the palace.

494
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
If the Empress Dowager knows about it,

495
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
she will be worried.

496
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
What are you doing?

497
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Your Majesty,

498
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
speak up.

499
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
I will go first.

500
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Let them come.

501
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
In fact,

502
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,120
what's the use of doing something

503
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
for the people?

504
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Why don't you leave?

505
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Are you waiting for your mother?

506
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,120
I went to many places today.

507
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I saw an old man.

508
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
His grandson

509
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
died at the battlefield.

510
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
He could only have a meal

511
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
in two days.

512
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
He was out of the palace.

513
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,120
He had nothing else.

514
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
I was ashamed.

515
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
I was...

516
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
sad.

517
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Your Majesty.

518
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
I know.

519
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
I know.

520
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Don't wash it.

521
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
I'm hungry.

522
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
Shanshan.

523
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
I did it myself

524
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,120
without the memorial.

525
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Your Majesty, don't mind it.

526
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
You are so selfish.

527
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
You will be late next time.

528
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
Don't wait for it.

529
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Your Majesty,

530
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
you came back late at night

531
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
to see me.

532
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Are you happy?

533
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
Yes.

534
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I'll wait for you.

535
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
No matter when you come back,

536
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
I'll be waiting here.

537
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
If you are tired,

538
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
you can take a rest.

539
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
What?

540
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
You are not afraid of the harem?

541
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
I won't wait for you.

542
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,120
Have more.

543
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Okay.

544
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Have some.

545
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
I'll take it.

546
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,120
Take it.

547
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
This one smells good.

548
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
This one is good.

549
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Yes.

550
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Come on.

551
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Take it.

552
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
This one is good.

553
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,120
I'll take it.

554
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
This one is good.

555
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
This one is good.

556
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Okay.

557
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,120
It's good.

558
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
Mr. Chen,

559
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
you must have eaten first

560
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
after you are hungry.

561
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

562
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

563
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

564
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

565
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Okay.

566
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Hot.

567
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
It's hot.

568
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Take it slow.

569
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
It's good.

570
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Have a bite.

571
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
It's good.

572
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Your Highness,

573
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
have a bite.

574
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Your Highness.

575
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
Your Highness.

576
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,120
Wait.

577
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,120
Your Highness.

578
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
Your Highness.

579
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Your Highness,

580
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
your appetite is open now.

581
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
You can't just eat and eat snacks all day.

582
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,120
I've prepared the meal today.

583
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Your Highness, have a taste.

584
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
Yinsishan,

585
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
this is the meal.

586
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
It's delicious.

587
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
It's delicious.

588
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
It's delicious.

589
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
It's delicious.

590
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
It's delicious.

591
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
It's delicious.

592
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
It's delicious.

593
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
It's delicious.

594
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Yinshian,

595
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120
what is this?

596
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,120
This is lotus root

597
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
that I picked specially for you.

598
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,120
I planted this lotus root for Your Highness.

599
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,120
I heard that Westerners love to pick lotus root for their own good.

600
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
That's why they have a beautiful and beautiful appearance.

601
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,120
So, the rumors are that

602
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,120
lotus root is very fresh and cool.

603
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,120
It's also good for your health.

604
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,120
Qingzhou is the best with fried fish and snacks.

605
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Didn't you say it was hot yesterday?

606
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
I prepared a special meal today.

607
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
This is lotus root.

608
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
It's delicious.

609
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I'll have a taste.

610
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Let's go.

611
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Your Highness.

612
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
I don't know why I made a mistake.

613
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
I made you suffer.

614
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Your Highness,

615
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
Imperial Concubine Song is waiting outside the hall.

616
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,120
Let her in.

617
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
Yes.

618
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,280
Your Highness, please be seated.

619
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:58,480
Greetings to Your Highness the Empress.

620
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,640
I'm from Shan Bu Zhou.

621
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,840
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

622
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,560
No need.

623
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,480
Noble Consort Sun,

624
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
take her back.

625
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,600
I don't want to see her again.

626
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,960
Your Highness the Empress.

627
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,320
I have something to say to you, Your Highness the Empress.

628
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,480
You may leave.

629
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Your Highness the Empress,

630
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,680
please may I fetch the arrow for you?

631
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,080
If you cannot take the arrow

632
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,000
say,

633
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,420
If she hates me,

634
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,900
Zhou's seed is already weak.

635
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,240
Pleas yourself.

636
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,960
If you want met honey,

637
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,120
I will have it.

638
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,380
Staylax flower soup.

639
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,960
your daughter hates me我

640
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,460
because of drinking Ho accessories.

641
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,920
Your Highness.

642
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,820
IVerly hate you.

643
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Because of this, I was able to see you.

644
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
How could you have such a misunderstanding

645
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
about that intelligence?

646
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Unless

647
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
you were able to give me

648
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
the anger and anger

649
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
that you lost your loved one.

650
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I sincerely

651
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
hope that Heaven will pray

652
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
for your safety and happiness in your life.

653
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
That's all I have.

654
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You said you didn't enter the palace.

655
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
What if there's no you in the world?

656
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Your Highness,

657
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
you lost your sister.

658
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
What about me?

659
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You have become a queen.

660
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I have no place to stay in the world.

661
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
There's no one who can protect me in the world.

662
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Have you ever thought

663
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
about the past situation in my life?

664
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Everything is destined to happen.

665
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Can a person

666
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
not bear to die?

667
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Look at me.

668
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Is my life a unchanging thing?

669
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Life is always a long way to go.

670
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's always uncertain.

671
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Why must you accept it?

672
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What were you thinking

673
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
in those years?

674
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Water

675
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
is not a fight for everything.

676
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
No matter how hard it is,

677
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I will tell myself

678
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
that if there's a mountain ahead,

679
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I will go around.

680
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
What if I can't go around?

681
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
If I can't go around,

682
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
there will be a day when the water is running down.

683
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
His Majesty

684
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
went out for a trip to the palace

685
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
and died.

686
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
After the battle,

687
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
it's already the fourth day.

688
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Zhiying wanted to be a wise emperor.

689
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Someone was riding the horse

690
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and was listening to the news.

691
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
He could only go to the palace

692
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
and see it himself.

693
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Even the blood was broken.

694
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
The emperor is still in the middle of the world.

695
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
He's not only a son of the commoner.

696
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Your Highness.

697
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Please rest in peace.

698
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
You must live well.

699
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Your Highness.

700
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
The food is cold.

701
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Your Highness.

702
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I told you not to send me off.

703
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But you changed your face.

704
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
How do you persuade

705
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
the Empress to be generous?

706
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The weather is hot.

707
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
The food is busy.

708
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
His Majesty is hard to avoid.

709
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
He's more angry.

710
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He should use

711
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
the food that is made with heat.

712
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I've read

713
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
the list you sent.

714
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
There are some dishes

715
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
with crab, pepper,

716
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and other ingredients.

717
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You've changed them all.

718
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Why don't you speak?

719
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Why are you looking at me?

720
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Yes.

721
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I've changed them all.

722
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'll go back now.

723
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I was so surprised

724
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
when I saw you

725
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
eating food.

726
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
But others still say

727
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
you're a kind and kind person.

728
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
You're playing the emperor

729
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
in the ancient times.

730
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Do you think

731
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
His Majesty is

732
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
kind and kind?

733
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
You...

734
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You're too kind.

735
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
You're too kind.

736
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You're too kind.

737
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
You...

738
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
You'll go to Song Mountain later.

739
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Let them talk.

740
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm going.

741
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Do you have a son?

742
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm asking you.

743
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Do you have a son?

744
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I have a son.

745
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
You have a son?

746
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Why don't you

747
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
send your son to study at the palace?

748
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Your Majesty.

749
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
If the palace is not enough,

750
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
it's useless.

751
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
How could you

752
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
want to go to the capital

753
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
to study in the same way as the 5,000 children?

754
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You're also a father.

755
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Don't you know

756
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
how to remind others' parents?

757
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Your Majesty.

758
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
This...

759
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
This is all the important arrangement.

760
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm just a temporary courtier.

761
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
A temporary courtier?

762
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
As a minister of the palace,

763
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
you should listen to what you should do

764
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
and what you should do.

765
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Get out!

766
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You're also the key to the palace.

767
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Your Majesty.

768
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I don't know

769
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
what's going on.

770
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Your Majesty.

771
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
It's really not me.

772
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Your Majesty.

773
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Your Majesty.

774
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Don't forget me.

775
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Sitting on this chair,

776
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
you should be able to

777
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
treat the great Ming Dynasty as a ancestor.

778
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
You should be able to treat the people of the world

779
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
as a citizen.

780
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Ziqian.

781
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
It's hard for me too.

782
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm sorry.

783
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'm sorry.

784
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Your Majesty.

785
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I thought...
