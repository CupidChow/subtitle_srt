Ha ha ha

34
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,960
I didn't think

35
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,920
Even here, you're slim.

36
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,640
But you're so gentle.

37
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,540
You shouldенная

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,800
use thechtong here to compete.

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,540
Your majesty.

00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,880
Mother actually

41
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,640
pulled the gently RBF

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,880
to Twitter us in fear of all the shit.

43
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,700
What you have is the most trustfull

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,040
from crown prince.

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Your majesty.

46
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,580
Your majesty.

47
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,160
I saw you at the county shop not many days ago,

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,960
so...

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Grand Prince,

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,240
your mother

51
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,160
made a good wife for you.

52
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I drove here all the way from Fengji to the entrance.

53
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I didn't even use the hot rice.

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Why don't you come over?

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,960
Your Highness.

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
Your Highness.

57
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
The palace banquet tonight is held by military banquet.

58
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
I have been thinking about your changes.

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,960
But you are so anxious and disappointed.

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
You forgot my teaching.

61
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
We have been waiting for you.

62
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Please come to the palace.

63
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Greetings, Your Excellency.

64
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
We are not prepared for this.

65
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Fortunately, you are in good health.

66
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
You are well-behaved.

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
It's not a day without you.

68
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
We have already discussed it.

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Please allow me to speak with you.

70
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
As you wish.

71
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
I am leaving the palace soon.

72
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
Rules are rules.

73
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
People are people.

74
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
You are the king.

75
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
You are the king.

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Fortunately, you are here.

77
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
The first thing that we will do today is...

78
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Yao Zi Jin.

79
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Why did you bring such a food?

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Your Excellency.

81
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
On the first menu,

82
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
the usual chicken,

83
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
fried chicken,

84
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,960
grilled pork,

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
and other ingredients are less.

86
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,960
Instead, it is white noodles,

87
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
tofu and other vegetables.

88
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I am afraid to guess that

89
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
it is because His Majesty is in a hurry

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
or because he is not in good health.

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
I am afraid that

92
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
the food that is prepared for you

93
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
is not good.

94
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
I am very confident.

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,960
I will take it.

96
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Yes.

97
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Go and take a rest.

98
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
Yes.

99
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Wait.

100
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,960
I personally led Wang Si Shan.

101
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
You're not good at thinking.

102
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
I can't control you.

103
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,960
But I can control a little chef.

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Please don't interfere.

105
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
I dare to ask you, Minister Si Shan.

106
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
What's your fault?

107
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Where did the prescription come from?

108
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
My grandmother has a bad temper.

109
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
She doesn't eat well.

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,960
She asked for a doctor to make progress with this.

111
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
I don't know.

112
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Good.

113
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
You're lucky.

114
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,960
The so-called ten-tongue medicine is a cure.

115
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
But it's only for the cause.

116
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
You must ask for the medicine.

117
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,960
The oxygen, the air, and the temperature are all the same.

118
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
The blood and the blood are all the same.

119
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
The body needs to be cured.

120
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
The skin needs to be cured.

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
The grass in the east is very polluted.

122
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Although it's precious, it's not a human.

123
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
I don't know if you're ill.

124
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
You're not like a doctor.

125
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
You dare to make a mistake.

126
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
You're in a bad health.

127
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,960
You're responsible for your life.

128
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,960
What's the point of this?

129
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
People are all afraid of the world.

130
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
The status is low.

131
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
There's nothing to fear.

132
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
As a chef,

133
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
if you think so,

134
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
you should be fair and fair.

135
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
As a chef,

136
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
face the world's food.

137
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Face the people of the用-shan.

138
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,960
You must be able to do anything.

139
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,960
No matter how hard you learn before entering the palace,

140
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
you must forget the past

141
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
and learn from the beginning.

142
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Do you understand?

143
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Yes.

144
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Take Yao Zi Jing out.

145
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Wang Si Shan, please calm down.

146
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,960
I've told you in person that

147
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
you can pass the test.

148
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Okay.

149
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Send her to the palace to think about it.

150
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
She'll be in the palace.

151
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Do you all want to be punished?

152
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Why are you so flustered?

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Your mind is not right.

154
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
You're not allowed to do anything.

155
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,960
I'm not good at what you're good at.

156
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Besides,

157
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,960
you're really not good at what His Majesty is good at.

158
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
If you don't say it,

159
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,960
please ask the minister to stay for a while.

160
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
I'll go with you.

161
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
I'll go with you.

162
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
I'll go with you.

163
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I'll go with you.

164
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
I don't do this kind of nonsense.

165
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I'm just a useless person.

166
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
You're so stubborn.

167
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Do you think you can die?

168
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
I'll die.

169
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Your Highness, please wait a moment.

170
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
I'll go and report to His Majesty.

171
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Your Highness,

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,960
the banquet is really so dangerous.

173
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
No need.

174
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
The world is peaceful.

175
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,960
The world is peaceful.

176
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
The world is peaceful.

177
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
The world is peaceful.

178
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
The one who was punished before

179
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,960
was not crying and crying, but the one who was willing to die.

180
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
You've been punished for a month.

181
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
You're still so timid.

182
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
The world is peaceful.

183
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
The world is peaceful.

184
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,960
Yao Zi Jin, go out.

185
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Yao Zi Jin, come with me.

186
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Yan Ziping.

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Thank you for your kindness.

188
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Go and get the book for me.

189
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Yes.

190
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Thank you.

191
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Go ahead.

192
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
The King of Wang Tai Sun has returned to the capital.

193
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Really?

194
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
Of course.

195
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Then maybe we can meet him.

196
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Of course.

197
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
The King of Wang Tai Sun has returned to the capital.

198
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
I will go and see him.

199
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
I'll go.

200
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I'll go and see him.

201
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
I will go and see him.

202
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
I'll go.

203
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,940
Ischung cameraman

204
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,900
Master

205
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,500
Great Emperor

206
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,460
Great Emperor

207
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,680
Go.

208
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,880
Hurry, get up.

209
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
I'm not here for a while.

210
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Why are you here?

211
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,400
Get up.

212
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,480
Cheng Wu,

213
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,400
set him free.

214
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,720
Yes.

215
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,640
Royal Descendant has ordered,

216
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,800
set him free.

217
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,000
Ask him to go back.

218
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,200
Yes.

219
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Your Majesty, you've really gone far

220
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
after meeting the Grand Grand Tutor.

221
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
I'm lucky.

222
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I can walk from the sky.

223
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Your Majesty, what are you looking for?

224
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Oh, my.

225
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
You didn't come back?

226
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
The Grand Grand Tutor came to visit His Majesty once in a while.

227
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I heard that you've rested and will come back tomorrow.

228
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
His Highness has just returned from the imperial physician's office.

229
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
He's always looking for a new doctor.

230
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
He's afraid that he'll give you a new illness.

231
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
But he left you a gift.

232
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
What gift?

233
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Your Majesty.

234
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
I don't want to be a coward.

235
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Get up.

236
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
The West Lake is a calm place.

237
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
It's a quiet place.

238
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
His Majesty doesn't use much of it.

239
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Enjoy.

240
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Your Majesty.

241
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,960
It's not that His Majesty agrees with me.

242
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Sometimes, it's about Lu Yi Sun.

243
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Sometimes, it's about Lu Xin Lian Zi Jiu.

244
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
When I really can't see it,

245
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
it's because I'm the one who's the most sincere.

246
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Who's going to threaten me

247
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
with my head?

248
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
But...

249
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
What are you looking at?

250
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
What are you looking at?

251
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Get out.

252
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
I thank Your Majesty for your help.

253
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Put that Yang Shi Qi aside.

254
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
I'll leave it to you.

255
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Your Highness.

256
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
The Empress Dowager is back.

257
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Please go somewhere ahead and do me a favor.

258
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Go and tell me.

259
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Ending expecting more.

260
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Let'm quench my thirst.

261
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,960
Concubineผ'i.

262
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Royal Descendant Sim.

263
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
qia was brought here.

264
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Can I ask for a favour to your😑 competence?

265
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Go and awaken me up.

266
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,800
He's gonna be ill.

267
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
Lord WU.

268
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,140
Lord WU.

269
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,700
Emperor Sunneng made an appearance outside.

270
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,600
It's a lady-s chap by chance.

271
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,960
It's so已 old and comical.

272
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,040
The Crown Prince has written the order to bring him here.

273
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,360
I release the Prince of Istiang.

274
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,720
How dare you frightening me?

275
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,940
How dare she?

276
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,640
But His Highness the Crown Prince is not in the palace.

277
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,160
Lord Yang, His Highness the Crown Prince is here to visit you.

278
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,040
Your Highness.

279
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,040
Master Yang, I'm here.

280
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,280
Your Highness,

281
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,440
could you kindly show up

282
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,080
and assist me in the advance?

283
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,000
What if I happen

284
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,080
to die in disguise

285
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
and get lessons after myarten?

286
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,360
After you were gone,

287
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,640
I remembered

288
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,120
you asked me to say a serious matter.

289
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,600
So I decided to come here.

290
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,920
Don't worry, Your Highness.

291
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,080
Imperial court since I máscara

292
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,360
that I am alone

293
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,840
but since the Crown Prince has installed a seal for you,

294
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
But some people have written a lot of articles about this.

295
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,160
Your Majesty is suspicious of the Eastern Palace's arrest.

296
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,480
As the head of the Eastern Palace,

297
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm worried about the military.

298
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,840
I'll keep my body in the rain.

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,120
I'll keep my mouth shut.

300
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,760
I won't take the blame for it.

301
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
I'm cold-hearted.

302
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,360
I'm worried that your uncle will be punished.

303
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,960
So I'll send the imperial physician to you.

304
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,840
Lord Yang.

305
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,600
Lord Yang.

306
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,040
Don't be so polite.

307
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,640
Get on.

308
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,860
不過是在有談偷玩家身體的

309
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,680
自己見面的

310
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,140

move more frequently.

315
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,060
The orderly.

316
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,100
Increasingly entranced.

317
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,500
Especially,

318
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,100
everything we need

319
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,100
depend on her.

320
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,500
You learn

321
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,260
to understand all the important predestination really well.

322
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,660
Then,

323
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,900
you will become

324
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,060
those good distributors.

325
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,460
You go out to exercise

326
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,140
in order to improve your Pinig ident揉it.

327
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,980
Come quickly run!

328
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,540
main illegitimate son

329
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,140
This girl listens outside

330
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,060
You are a maid

331
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,540
Yes

332
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:02,940
Do not be afraid

333
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,460
never refused.

334
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,660
Why?

335
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,980
The general is just a fox.

336
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,300
And the memory is like the wine in the lake.

337
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,820
Only by spreading the world,

338
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,780
the sun shines brightly,

339
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,060
can you make a fortune.

340
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,100
My dynasty has such a fierce and strong spirit.

341
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,220
Come.

342
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,900
If you want to learn,

343
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,580
just stand here and learn.

344
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,340
Yes.

345
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,700
Guyddneßel.

346
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,220
Go to the時代

347
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,740
now to copy

348
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,740
the two girls' Hana challenge mastered in telephone intelligence

349
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:32,880
and the sect call of

350
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,440
What an early morning!

351
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,800
I bring this for you.

352
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
I wanted to fleece them from us,

353
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
but the result has arrived.

354
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,320
So I replaced aلمo city.

355
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,000
Have a taste, is it sweet or not?

356
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Thank you for your accompaniment.

357
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,360
Get it.

358
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,920
Yes.

359
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,440
Prince Wenyu will help Qin防 the artistic ability of her political experience.

360
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,440
He acts plight сложно in military rulers and snatched the advantage of nobility

361
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,680
by serving his troops by covering up the city's government at all costs.

362
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,240
Speak your mind�에.

363
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,440
I punished you with honorowness.

364
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,600
I tried to collect the early game

365
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,240
but I was out of luck.

366
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,560
If we spread it out,

367
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,160
it would be hard to say

368
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,640
if someone

369
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,320
made a big article in front of His Majesty

370
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,840
and implicated Donggong,

371
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,520
I would be in trouble.

372
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,160
The early game

373
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,480
is not a military game.

374
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,400
Don't worry about it.

375
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,800
You don't need to leave any food.

376
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,000
I forgot.

377
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,320
His Majesty is in the study.

378
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,400
He's alone.

379
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,880
Take care, Your Highness.

380
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,960
Ironically Windchan completing the tasks

381
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,080
Taicunhorse.

382
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,680
Just now, I saw

383
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,000
Imperialばいsun leaving the palace.

384
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,180
It's rude of me.

385
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,300
The time is right for you.

386
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,920
Started a new life through my father.

387
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,440
All I know is if you and the Grand Grand sanshi

388
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,680
would have been so SQL,

389
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,920
since you're still young,

390
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,880
can you replace him?

391
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,240
That was a success

392
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,520
because head of the family becomes Duke

393
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,560
and the fame settles.

394
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,080
It's a great honor for the whole family.

395
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,200
It's a pity that Hongyan is still alive.

396
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,240
After he entered the palace,

397
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,840
his father chose you from the tribe

398
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
and took care of the younger sister and his family for the eldest daughter.

399
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,120
You've been working in the Hu family for a long time.

400
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,040
But you're not even as good as a adopted daughter.

401
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,120
Why do you have to do this?

402
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,280
What's funny is that

403
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
you've changed his life

404
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,920
with my own self-cultivation.

405
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,520
I want to borrow his fortune and his life.

406
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,880
Tell me.

407
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,120
What do you want

408
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,000
from my father?

409
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,920
A little girl with a bright future,

410
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,320
how can she satisfy her ambition?

411
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,960
Is she trying to reward me

412
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,000
or to enter the Imperial Army?

413
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,200
Consort Tan,

414
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,120
everything my father did

415
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,760
was for you.

416
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
For the family,

417
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,800
how can you say that?

418
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:39,920
Okay.

419
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
Since father didn't want to take the elder sister in,

420
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm tired.

421
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Please go back, elder sister.

422
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,560
Although I'm not your sister,

423
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,680
I want you to grow up

424
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,160
and cooperate with the elder sister of the same mother.

425
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,320
Why do you always be so obedient?

426
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,240
Why can't you understand our hard work?

427
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,640
Elder sister,

428
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,520
I've been thinking about a question

429
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,400
for a long time.

430
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,560
Back then, I was a consort for Royal Descendant of the Sun.

431
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,160
I was a judge

432
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,280
and was called the Star Sword Kui Lou.

433
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
I was a courtesan.

434
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,760
So I became a consort for Royal Descendant of the Sun.

435
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,320
Do you have any secrets

436
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,520
in this?

437
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,200
You were born with a red and white aura

438
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,920
and flew out of the window.

439
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Such a qi-rae

440
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,520
is known in the hometown of Renjing.

441
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,760
How can you be a judge?

442
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,880
This is the heaven's will.

443
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,960
You're the consort for the heaven.

444
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,560
Yes.

445
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,240
The heaven's will.

446
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,800
Am I not the one

447
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
who gave the royal family the honor of the Ming Dynasty?

448
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,600
I will give you the blessed skull.

449
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,480
Cicada and tofu curry.

450
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,420
Chinese characters do not give the top

451
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,740
but suitable for your conditioningila.

452
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,120
It's cold when you feel cold.

453
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Not big enough.

454
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,760
Yes.

455
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,080
Yes.

456
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,520
The thing that disgusts the most,

457
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,140
frying and爾 is Walter-dop and living king is the 1963 style of Xiong usar.

458
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,860
He likes to cook and follow the domination of his economy.

459
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,520
Let's have him eat and rest early.

460
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,120
We haven't had a lot of hangover...

461
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,840
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,920
It's a pity.

463
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,240
It's a pity?

464
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,840
Wang Sishan is always in trouble.

465
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,280
He hasn't seen his color change.

466
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,480
He's always in a bad mood.

467
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,920
He's always in a bad mood.

468
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,600
How can he be so pitiful?

469
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,960
I heard he was about to be transferred to the imperial court.

470
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,760
He's so devoted to his family.

471
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,000
He's not as smart as he is.

472
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,720
Who told him to offend Wang Sishan?

473
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
He just fails.

474
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,000
I came so early.

475
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,880
Come on, now.

476
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,080
We're done with my work.

477
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,200
What do you wanna do with me?

478
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,160
I'll take you back with me.

479
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,480
Both Hotening Monk and Sunrise Monk all died today.

480
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,200
Your Highness likes

481
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,200
the enemy'sphon

482
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,940
like the Bohumian

483
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,600
Why do you go there?

484
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,080
The Emperor knows

485
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,420
what you're doing there

486
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,280
I will read for you

487
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,160
Do you want me to tell you

488
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,540
the behind memory application

489
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,420
Where is Sister Yao?

490
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Your Highness.

491
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:04,940
Your Highness.

492
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,580
Your Highness.

493
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,340
Help me blow off the curtain.

494
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,580
Your Highness.

495
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,460
Sung mijnus數

496
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,300
Your Highness.

497
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,100
Your Highness.

498
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,460
Your Highness.

499
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,260
Your Highness.

500
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,740
Your Highness.

501
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,940
Head down.

502
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,780
Your Highness.

503
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,380
What are you looking at?

504
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,260
Your Highness,

505
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,900
do you have that kind of despicable look?

506
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,100
Eunuch.

507
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,060
I'm here to deliver the food to you

508
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,540
for the imperial court.

509
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,340
The imperial court?

510
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,300
The imperial court?

511
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,260
The imperial court is the night court of His Highness.

512
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,700
You can't enter the palace without permission.

513
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,380
Kneel down.

514
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,460
Yes.

515
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,900
Kneel down until you kneel down.

516
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,780
I'm afraid I'm angry again.

517
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,300
I'm afraid I'm angry again.

518
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,980
Your Highness the Ka zer idiot.

519
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,060
Blame me!

520
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,940
I deserve the last order!

521
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,780
Don't worry, alarm on.

522
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,540
Your Highness.

523
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,820
Time to serve the food.

524
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:53,400
Li Manuel

525
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,040
The apply of poison is a great gift.

526
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,980
Don't man their aromatic

527
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,920
so I shall take the smell.

528
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,880
We'll use the Hashtag.

529
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,380
It's just one city.

530
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,020
The mind is學 bite.

531
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,980
I've had these many approaches.

532
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,380
Night poison has no taste,

533
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,220
but wine has no fragrance.

534
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,060
It scents smell so poverty- Bears.

535
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,780
How dare you sleep?

536
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,020
Eunuch,

537
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,060
what can I do for you?

538
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,580
The job is good.

539
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,500
Send one more

540
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,300

00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,140
And,

542
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,900
send it in personally.

543
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,060
Yes.

544
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,180
Eunuch.

545
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,820
Take it.

546
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,360
Thank you.

547
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,620
Are these

548
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,100
the annual working order?

549
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,500
You want to die?

550
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,940
I ask you to unhappy your death

551
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,380
because excessive wilhood assist me to this.

552
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,860
For�논� only one hundred years,

553
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,500
what is wrong?

554
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,500
Fine.

555
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,740
I'll go talk to the offender right now.

556
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,060
Are you done?

557
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,340
I don't have an imperial Shield.

558
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,300
They all want to enroll in the゚

559
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,260
but they'llannah

560
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,460
in a month now.

561
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,860
If you're too much,

562
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,980
that present point of Hack

563
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:32,020
that amREE

564
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,020
is no use.

565
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:39,580
You have to keep it from me.

566
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:45,900
The decision is decided.

567
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
Call me from the first place.

568
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,060

Sorry, give me a break.

581
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
Sister-in-law.

582
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,320
The fat has no oil.

583
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,000
The frozen must be oiled.

584
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,520
The salt must be oiled.

585
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,600
The fat...

586
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,160
The salt must be salt.

587
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,040
Then it will be salt.

588
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,840
I remember now.

589
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,640
The fat has no oil.

590
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,560
Then it will be salt.

591
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
The...

592
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,360
The salt...

593
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,840
The salt must be salt.

594
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,440
Look.

595
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,640
This...

596
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,240
The salt.

597
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,680
It has a door frame.

598
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,360
The door frame.

599
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,280
Door frame?

600
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,200
The fish has salt.

601
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,240
The fish has frozen.

602
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,040
The fish has the heart.

603
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,440
The fish has the stomach.

604
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,080
It's a good thing.

605
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,920
The so-called male and female fish

606
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,960
have their own thoughts.

607
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,600
It's a good thing that a female fish

608
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,640
has a voice.

609
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,520
But you must warn them.

610
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,720
The world of the gold-grabbing world

611
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,600
is not easy to understand.

612
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,920
In the dream,

613
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,800
there must be a disaster

614
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,000
in the world of gold-grabbing.

615
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,320
The fish and gold-grabbing

616
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,880
are all locked up by the door.

617
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,360
Have you seen the price of the forest?

618
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,920
Only they

619
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,400
need it.

620
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,040
You don't make serious 有忘不忘

621
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,060

624
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,440

ダマセウ可能听出来 needs strong word.

630
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,460
Night light?

631
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,060
Turn around and look at the night light.

632
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,220
The sun shines on the earth.

633
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,820
The sun shines on the earth.

634
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,980
Father insisted on changing my name.

635
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,700
He said,

636
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,340
you are weak and weak.

637
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,940
You are dead and not dead.

638
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,180
You don't want me to have a good relationship

639
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,340
with that woman.

640
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:10,660
Don't interrupt me.

641
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,740
Please protect my zo mobility Promise?

642
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,700
Don't worry.

643
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,180
I'm not interested

644
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,860
in dates.

645
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:27,300
I've been holding on to it

646
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,220
all these years,

647
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,740
Everyone said

648
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,900
that she was karenaaba

649
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,460
and was found out by uncle.

650
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,340
She used to try

651
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,620
to kill people

652
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,580
by chance,

653
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,020
but risked itself to escape.

654
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,940
ThisAdamalcenc

655
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,900
offended me in reverse.

656
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,860
But , I sagt

657
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,620

658
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,580
I'm an Elephant Monster

659
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,460
out of fact.

660
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,780
Su Yuanhua.

661
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,180
You should be consume yearning to get into the palace.

662
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,380
You don't haveIMC,

663
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,140
And you're once an architect!

664
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,340
You're a great merit to fifteen miles of your palace!

665

Father.

666
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,380
You're right.

667
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,220
I won't kill anyone

668
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,580
who is in charge of the immortal's mother.

669
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,540
Your Majesty,

670
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,660
His Majesty has ordered

671
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,340
to send the imperial edict to the court.

672
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,660
Yuhua,

673
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,020
I'm not good enough to be your friend.

674
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,060
I've never been like this.

675
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,540
Yuhua.

676
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,180

I have the gold and gold to buy this piece of Han Xue horse.

681
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,260
I should have sent it to the palace.

682
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,140
If not, I couldn't have entered the palace

683
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,940
without the imperial decree.

684
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,260
The day of the Palace of Rebellation will be on the line.

685
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,500

You're not good at riding.

701
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,820
You should change it.

702
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:08,940
What?

703
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,140
A country is a war.

704
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,620
You can't even marry a horse.

705
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,300
How can you rule the city and succeed in the future?

706
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,940
You're the one who should be punished.
