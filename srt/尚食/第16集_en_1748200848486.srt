The top protection is strong and born-to-be.

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
The second generation of the beauty magazine, Lan Zhen,

will remind you that the exciting season will begin.

10
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,800
I need a long-distance sweat from Liaodong.

11
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
The special treatment for women is not suitable for blood circulation.

12
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,200
Find out the exact amount.

13
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,600
It's about eight to nine months.

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Yes.

15
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Your Highness,

16
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,400
the medicine for treating blood circulation

17
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,200
is from the Imperial Physician Sheng.

18
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,200
They know how to distribute medicine.

19
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,400
What are they here for?

20
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
They're not going to help.

21
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,400
Yes.

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,200
If you are lucky to be in the capital in September,

23
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,600
you can be a handsome man.

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,800
A handsome man?

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,200
This...

26
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
This is the lock.

27
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
It must be a dead body.

28
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
No.

29
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

30
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,320

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,800
I'll take another half an hour.

32
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
Your Highness! Your Highness!

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
I was wrong!

34
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,040
I was wrong!

35
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,000
Your Highness.

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,040
I'm protecting you!

37
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,640
Take her away.

38
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,880
Your Highness!

39
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,160
Your Highness, come back!

40
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,880
Your Highness!

41
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,000
Wait.

42
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,840
Is this a rescue or not?

43
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,280
What are you two doing?

44
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
Come and help me!

45
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,840
Wait for half an hour.

46
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Wake up!

47
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,680
Your Highness.

48
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,360
Greetings to Your Majesty.

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,520
You are in a serious condition.

50
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,720
You are in a critical condition.

51
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,840
Why do you have to see me?

52
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,480
Please allow me, Your Majesty,

53
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,880

54
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,600
for me.

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,840
She had prescribed the prescription for Her Majesty

56
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,680
and was able to take the life of a person.

57
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,720
Fortunately, she was safe.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,400
I saved her life.

59
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm already grateful.

60
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,080
How could Her Majesty believe her?

61
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,920
I believe Dr. Sheng.

62
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,520
Dr. Sheng didn't lie to His Majesty.

63
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
It's urgent.

64
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,800
I don't understand.

65
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,600

No! Your Majesty!

81
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,800
It is a major problem.

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
No one knows about it.

83
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Your Highness.

84
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,920

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:43,920
is not in a hurry.

190
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,720
Then at the critical moment,

191
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,920
can't you leave?

192
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,120
In this palace,

193
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
there are few pets,

194
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
but there are many.

195
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,120
There are not many,

196
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,920
I have enough.

197
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,720
Let's go.

198
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:02,920
Mother.

199
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,520
Your Highness.

200
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:09,920
Mother.

201
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,320
Zhan Yong, Zhan Shan,

202
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
and Jia Xing

203
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,520
are just trying to see you.

204
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
They are worried about you,

205
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
but I've already asked them

206
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
to send them back first.

207
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
But you're feeling better.

208
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,120
I'll ask them to come over to you.

209
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,720
Mother.

210
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,920
This time,

211
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I brought Sheng Yin

212
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
to personally send you back.

213
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
I'll send you back.

214
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
I'll send you back.

215
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
I'll send you back.

216
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Sheng Yin, come here.

217
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
You can send me back.

218
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,720
Your Highness.

219
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,520
His Majesty has ordered

220
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,720
not to send Sheng Yin

221
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,920
to the palace again.

222
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,320
Your Highness.

223
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,120
This is not a rule.

224
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,920
Is the rule important?

225
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,120
Or is mother's life important?

226
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,120
Sheng Yin.

227
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,920
Yes.

228
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,520
How is she?

229
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,480
Your Highness,

230
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,720
you are lucky to be unable to take the break.

231
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,120
If you stay here during these three days,

232
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,960
who knows?

233
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,000
No matter how long

234
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
you shy away from me,

235
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,920
I am really heartbroken.

236
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,520
Your Highness,

237
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,660
your wound condition

238
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,720
was really serious.

239
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Mother's pulse

240
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,520
doesn't seem happy

241
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,320
because of the color?

242
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,000
He doesn't have any pulse,

243
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
this ismented��� buried on the發現able States' pulse,

244
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,720
not in the mouth.

245
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,520
However,

246
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,720
he's not able to greatly판 York to hospitalize,

247
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,360
cannot do business for the people there.

248
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,800
Let's consider the soup

249
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:53,720
and the pill

250
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,860
should not hinder a fight.

251
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,020
Your Highness,

252
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,300
there really were.

253
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,540
North people's soup

254
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,300
have everything different.

255
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,700
They are fellow messengers.

256
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,180
Shiyi,

257
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,620
you've given Sochi to a bandit

258
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,300
and planned his final name.

259
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,900
Is this a death sentence?

260
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,260
Your Highness,

261
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,700
you mustn't be too keen upon What you've just said.

262
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,340
It must yield,

263
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,580
so that there will be no problems

264
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,500
with the soul of Donguda Ai and the title of 해소下.

265
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,420
Your Highness,

266
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,700
I'm really a good seller.

267
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,500
Please think twice before you.

268
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,660
You're so talkative.

269
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,180
You're so arrogant.

270
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,900
There are too many people in the world.

271
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,140
Your Highness,

272
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,940
I don't need to say much.

273
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,980
I hope you can decide.

274
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,780
Your Highness,

275
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,260
the imperial physician can prescribe medicine for the patient.

276
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,460
But he can't make a decision for the patient.

277
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,700
Yes.

278
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,540
Mother.

279
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,340
You told me

280
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,820
that there's a short-term life.

281
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,340
You're not determined.

282
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,500
You must make a big mistake.

283
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,700
So I'm going to

284
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,500
pick up Mother.

285
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Even if I make a wrong decision,

286
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,620
I'll be in a hurry.

287
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,700
I'll make a wrong decision.

288
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,180
But now,

289
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,540
it's about life.

290
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,900
I must make a decision.

291
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,540
If you think

292
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,860
Sheng Yin is right,

293
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,860
I'll support you.

294
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,700
Your Highness,

295
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,620
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

296
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,980
I'm just standing outside.

297
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,260
No one will disturb me.

298
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,140
Don't worry.

299
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,380
I'll be with you.

300
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,100
Please, Sheng Yin.

301
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,020
Take the medicine.

302
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,220
Yes.

303
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,540
Yes.

304
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,380
Your Majesty,

305
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,500
you must make a decision.

306
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,900
What's going on?

307
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,740
Your Majesty,

308
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,420
you must stop the Crown Prince.

309
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
He insisted on

310
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,220
making Sheng Yin treat Her Highness the Empress.

311
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,260
I'm afraid

312
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,060
that this time,

313
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,660
the Dragon Temple won't be able to protect her.

314
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,180
Nonsense.

315
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:49,940
Your Majesty,

316
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,380
you two took the medicine.

317
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,540
Your Majesty!

318
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,380
Zhu Zhan Ji,

319
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,060
where's the Dragon Medicine?

320
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,900
Your Majesty,

321
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,060
I'm here.

322
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,100
Doctor Sheng,

323
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:09,940
you are...

324
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,500
Your Highness,

325
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,500
I've already made a military order

326
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,420
in front of His Highness.

327
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,180
If you don't treat Her Highness the Empress,

328
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,300
I'm willing to die.

329
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,140
Sheng Yin,

330
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:21,980
you...

331
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,300
you...

332
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,180
You made a big mistake.

333
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,220
Da Yuan Pan,

334
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,500
how dare you learn from me

335
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,820
and act like a good person?

336
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,300
If you don't treat Her Highness the Empress

337
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,780
in ten days,

338
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,660
you'll be in trouble.

339
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,260
Your Majesty.

340
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,420
How dare you?

341
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,580
Your Majesty,

342
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,940
the doctor's treatment is not

343
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,140
a matter of medicine.

344
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,100
I've already made a decision.

345
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,620
How can the doctor be so calm

346
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,900
to fight with his heart?

347
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,420
Sheng Yin,

348
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,300
don't be ridiculous.

349
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,980
If you hurt the Dragon Medicine,

350
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,260
you'll be in trouble.

351
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,580
What's the point of that?

352
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,660
Zhu Zhan Ji,

353
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,420
did you

354
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,620
make a big mistake

355
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,700
to teach them a lesson?

356
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,740
Father,

357
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,500
please respect the decision of the Queen Mother.

358
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,340
I don't respect your Queen Mother.

359
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,020
If I don't respect her,

360
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,980
how can I summon the Imperial Physician to the Imperial Physician's Office?

361
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,140
How can I do that in ten days?

362
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,220
Zhu Zhan Ji,

363
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
do you know

364
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,660
that maybe because of your mistake,

365
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,020
your mother's life

366
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,220
and the child who hasn't been born will be ruined?

367
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,540
You... You're laughing.

368
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,580
You're laughing... Why are you laughing?

369
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,020
Father,

370
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,940
as a palace maid,

371
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,980
you don't need to anger the Emperor

372
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,740
to be brave and brave.

373
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,580
As your wife,

374
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,020
I've been by your side all the time.

375
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,660
I've been in love with you.

376
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,780
Did she ask you

377
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,860
the consequences of doing that?

378
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,420
Did she have

379
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,140
a fear and a retreat?

380
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,020
She never did.

381
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,580
What are you doing?

382
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,900
As long as you want to do it,

383
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,860
she won't ask you.

384
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,260
She'll still support you.

385
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,100
But why don't you

386
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,300
trust her once?

387
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,340
If you don't want the Queen Mother,

388
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,020
I don't need your head.

389
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,180
You'll cover your care is demon when you want to show her.

390
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,380
Your Majesty,

391
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,820
there have indeed been many Stalinists

392
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,340
since you give God the cure.

393
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,900
Now you're feeling much better.

394
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,080
The light of our relationship

395
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
never leads to emptiness.

396
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,400
When we linked to each other,

397
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,700
the universe became lost.

398
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,660
Aren't you scared?

399
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,280
Ziping, let me.

400
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,460
Your Highness the Empress

401
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,820
used the blood-sucking medicine, except for the fish-sucking medicine.

402
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,620
I'm afraid that it will be insufficient blood.

403
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,220
I'm going to use the medicine that is used to replenish blood today.

404
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,620
I'm going to prepare it in advance.

405
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,220
You're doing it alone.

406
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,820
The credit goes to others.

407
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,820
Why are you doing this?

408
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,500
The more you practice, the more you remember.

409
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,580
If you bring it to me, I can replace it.

410
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,860
It's unique.

411
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,140
It's not all about the blessing.

412
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,940
It's not all about the people.

413
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,740
Fine.

414
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,300
The Empress is the Empress,

415
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,060
the Crown Prince.

416
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,700
Ziping.

417
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,660
There's something that's hidden in my heart.

418
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,380
It's about my past.

419
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,180
I want to tell you today.

420
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,700
Xi.

421
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,380
Xiao Zi Jin!

422
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,500
May Your Highness have a healing.

423
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,220
This is a relação like昆a guard roasted duck.

424
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,380
It's not Blood-Sucking Payment.

425
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,300
It goes with Sun Amulet.

426
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,180
It goes in my mouth.

427
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,280
Are you going to survive?

428
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,120
Yes.

429
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,720
May the Han Dynasty

430
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,080
become a prosperous country!

431
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,540
Is this the Chemical frameworks?

432
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,520
While things role them,

433
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,940
The taste of the entrance is a unique one.

434
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,940
It's a bit bitter.

435
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,940
No.

436
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,940
The shadow is like wine in the snake's room.

437
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Your Highness, there are tofu juice and glutinous rice wine in the mountain.

438
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,940
The glutinous rice wine is a kind of poison.

439
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,940
I specially selected it for you.

440
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Yes.

441
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,940
I'll try it.

442
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,940
It's not that sweet.

443
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,940
It's just a little bit bitter.

444
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
You're thoughtful.

445
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Your Highness, slow down.

446
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,940
Your Highness, you're not too sick.

447
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940
You're not too sick.

448
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,940
The skin is crispy and the inside is juicy.

449
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,940
The taste is so good.

450
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,940
What a pity.

451
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,940
Your Highness, slow down.

452
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
It's been many years.

453
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
I haven't tasted it.

454
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:18,940
The Empress of the Emperor

455
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,940
Your Highness, you're from Yongcheng.

456
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
You also like to use the soup to make breakfast.

457
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,700
You go throughany certain distances behavior�

458
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,420
and you has no idea how to get to this level.

459
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,060
Such a little attack to us?

460
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,020
How can you simply take such aừaELL

461
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,880
City?

462
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,280
There are more than 20 indulgences

463
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,420
in ancient herbs that have been used

464
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,740
affected by the changes in the dialect Dawang grows).

465
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,960
While the empress asked her for a patch of methods,

466
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,180
you are language-hardened and poetry-less.

467
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,420
This scooter,

468
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,820
the Empressarc d business,

469
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,940
has been up for the most Within www.cobe-àn-ic cup,

470
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,840
but you stillлич xie zhi-gen and followers in the tea stall mock at you.

471
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,100
Let's go.

472
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,220
Your Universal Body is cured now, sprinkle on it and warm it in cold weather.

473
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,300
If you think I didn't know,

474
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,700
Your Majesty...

475
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,480
Do you know the first?

476
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,940
I've heard

477
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,340
that Empress Yunxiao gave this to you that year.

478
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,340
Ye.

479
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,640
Mother gave it to me

480
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:04,860
to be pedals and a surgery.

481
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,220
I don't know

482
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,220
The cold of the fire is hard to cure.

483
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,220
It's the power of the world

484
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,220
to help us to sing and sing.

485
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
Yes.

486
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
Your Highness.

487
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,220
Your Highness.

488
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
It's so unfortunate to be in this room.

489
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,220
Your Highness.

490
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
Send them to the Imperial Office

491
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
to burn the firewood.

492
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,220
Yes.

493
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,220
Father.

494
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Why are you here?

495
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,220
I heard that you are well-being.

496
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,220
I came here to apologize.

497
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
Father.

498
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
Take the medicine first.

499
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,220
I'm late.

500
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
Please forgive me.

501
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
I'm from Guangzong County.

502
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
The rain is very heavy this year.

503
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,220
The local newspaper used me

504
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,220
to delay me.

505
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,220
I was late.

506
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,220
But I will open the funeral first.

507
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,220
But in this way,

508
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,220
there must be officials to visit.

509
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
You want...

510
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Father.

511
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
If you are worried about the local officials,

512
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,220
you can send the imperial guards to check on the imperial guards.

513
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,220
The imperial guards will go to check on the imperial guards.

514
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,220
The imperial guards will go to check on the imperial guards.

515
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,220
But the imperial guards are just

516
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,220
someone else who is a little older than you.

517
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,220
You are young.

518
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,220
Do you know anything?

519
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,220
Father.

520
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
Now that the imperial guards are in the capital,

521
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
they often come to arrest people

522
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,220
because they are not allowed to.

523
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
I wonder

524
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
what kind of place they will be in.

525
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,220
If you order them to visit secretly,

526
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
I'm afraid there will be more illegal things.

527
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,220
When the imperial guards are in the capital,

528
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,220
they will be more ashamed.

529
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Now...

530
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
I

531
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,220
have to let the imperial guards

532
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,220
do as they please.

533
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,220
Father.

534
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,220
Get out.

535
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
I'm in a state of emergency.

536
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,220
Please take care of the emperor.

537
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,220
If you don't work together with me,

538
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
I will be fine.

539
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Why don't you leave?

540
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
I'm leaving.

541
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,220
I...

542
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
I'll stay.

543
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,220
A simple man with AccessGood

544
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,220
will leave here

545
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,720
I'm waiting for you.

546
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,220
I'll take care of everything.

547
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,220
Yet now,

548
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,220
you almost marry me?

549
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,720
Your position...

550
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Your position...

551
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,160
Anyway the emperor has to travel then,

552
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,520
He must also have been in many trouble

553
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,220
Indeed,

554
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,220
Hold on

555
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,940
What's wrong with LGBT?

556
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,340
I regret what I did

557
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,720
Now,

558
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,760
I have met the virtue of brother

559
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:05,140
and take advantage of

560
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,900
the strict bek Scholastic.

561
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,240
Tomorrow, your head will be in danger.

562
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,500
This kind of crap

563
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,540
ignore my eyes.

564
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,620
What is this?

565
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,300
Your Majesty is ill.

566
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm wishes to please you

567
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,660
to check on the body separately.

568
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,500
Don't be jealous.

569
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,540
Help me to get in.

570
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,700
Shift the stuff into the room.

571
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,660
Come over here.

572
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,020
Come.

573
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,980
Take care.

574
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm defigured.

575
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,980
Take it.

576
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,640
This isρχic,

577
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:54,460
I give

578
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,700
There's a backdoor.

579
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,220
Let go of me.

580
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,500
You took it all.

581
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,940
What should I tell you?

582
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,540
Stop.

583
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,060
Yukui,

584
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,660
the servants did something wrong

585
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,700
and they didn't answer the call.

586
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,980
Who told you to do it?

587
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:09,900
Moreover,

588
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,460
the Noble Consort and the Black Dog

589
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,260
were all for the emperor's sake.

590
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,940
Who could have been more loyal to the emperor?

591
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,900
Give it to me.

592
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,300
I...

593
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,340
Give it to me.

594
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:21,980
Give it to me.

595
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,700
This is for the Noble Consort.

596
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,420
Your Highness.

597
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:24,740
My...

598
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,260
Fine.

599
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,380
The Black Dog was born in the Mount Chong.

600
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,260
It's not easy to get it.

601
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,900
You dare to break the spell

602
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,940
with such precious herbs?

603
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,820
You did it first.

604
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,300
Why did you do it?

605
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,020
You...

606
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,860
Wen Dianshan, look.

607
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,540
Xiang Qing and the others are in trouble.

608
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,220
I...

609
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,260
You dare to do something.

610
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,460
You dare to do anything.

611
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,020
People have their own ways.

612
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,020
Just say it.

613
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,300
You're so loud.

614
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,620
Or else, you'll hear something.

615
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,460
Hurry up and pack up.

616
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,100
I'm not a coward behind you.

617
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,540
I dare not to be so bold.

618
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,300
How can you compare with Sister Fang?

619
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,500
You dare to break the spell with others.

620
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,700
You'll be in a high position.

621
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,660
You...

622
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,940
You're too kind.

623
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,660
Your face has changed.

624
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,020
You must have been hurt.

625
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,180
I'll beat you to death.

626
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,260
What?

627
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:22,900
Take it.

628
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,980
Let go of me.

629
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,500
Don't move.

630
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,860
Don't move.

631
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,740
Let go of me.

632
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,740
Let go of me.

633
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,740
Let go of me.

634
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,540
Let go of me.

635
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,340
Let go of me.

636
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,460
Don't help him.

637
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,580
Don't take it.

638
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,620
Don't hit him.

639
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,340
Put the arrow down.

640
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,100
Put the arrow down.

641
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,460
What?

642
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,020
Put the arrow down.

643
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,620
Let go of me.

644
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,540
Don't hit him.

645
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,900
Hurry up.

646
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:46,940
You...

647
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,420
Hold it.

648
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:49,980
What are you doing?

649
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,140
Let go of me.

650
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,540
Stop it.

651
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,660
Let go of me.

652
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:55,940
What do you think?

653
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,780
Stop it.

654
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,500
Stop it.

655
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,500
Stop it.

656
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,380
Stop it.

657
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,180
Stop it.

658
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,500
What do you think?

659
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,860
What do you think?

660
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,620
Stop it.

661
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Minister Shang Shi is here.

662
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,300
Stop it.

663
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,140
Hurry up.

664
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,220
It's been an hour.

665
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,340
We've been waiting for a long time.

666
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,180
Let go of me.

667
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,980
I...

668
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:29,860
Guiheng.

669
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,620
What a warm-hearted painting!

670
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,420
What did he say to you ?

671
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,540
What he is playing at?

672
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,820
Don't worry and just send her in.

673
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,900
His Majesty's advice

674
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,860
made you feel offered.

675
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,900
His MajestyAAd

676
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,820
have it.

677
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,820
The old man loves people.

678
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,460
In order to be a ministering official,

679
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,940
a good officer needs to be appointed.

680
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,100
Otherwise,

681
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,900
even if I put the order down,

682
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,980
you wouldn't get THAT.

683
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:13,820
Your Majesty,

684
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,740
I have a good conscience.

685
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,460
Your Majesty.

686
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,420
In terms of your power,

687
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,260
I'm far above you.

688
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,700
I want you to be fair and fair.

689
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,340
Your Majesty.

690
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,660
You may leave.

691
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,020
Your Majesty.

692
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,620
His Majesty just ordered

693
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,300
that Noble Consort Guo's brother Guo Xuan

694
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,060
wants to corrige Lady BВ now to serve the Duke of Yingguo.

695
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,060
Mother Xu Shi Rangers him as Mrs. Taifu.

696
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,060
And,

697
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,460
His Majesty is looking into all the courtiers.

698
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,660
Now,

699
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,060
Supreme Courtine點使令怎麼支援

700
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,740
Silence means excitement,

701
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,340
not too tired,

702
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,620
and what does that mean?

703
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,500
Right.

704
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,740
No, I won't go.

705
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,580
Because he didn't love me.

706
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

707
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,500
We are half Greetings.

708
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:26,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

709
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,380
Meet me at the Empress Vittle.

710
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:33,900
Please飯.

711
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,580
Please get up, Your Majesty.

712
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,220
You know I'm a seducer.

713
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,420
Get one and express your love.

714
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,140
I'll go well soon.

715
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,380
Yu Jing.

716
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,880
You need to bring

717
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,480
a letter to mybooks.

718
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,240
Then, lead some words with me.

719
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,060
There are relations between one and his community

720
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,480
and he deserves it.

721
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,260
With the award he's a son of his�.

722
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,020
Please continue to teach other troops

723
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,220
at their own service

724
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,360
to protect Spieler Guo.

725
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,460
Your Highness,

726
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,700
Your relative brother now passed away.

727
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,260
Have you met His Majesty after he died?

728
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,700
It's because the Empress' family is not far away.

729
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,020
You should be happy.

730
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,700
Why are you so worried?

731
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,300
I'll be unhappy

732
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,940
if I'm happy.

733
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,900
If you can't be at ease,

734
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,620
you'll be unhappy.

735
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,020
Yes.

736
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:32,940
Wait.

737
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,820
This is the Yuchi's

738
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,260
Thousand-year-old Mountain and Thousand-year-old Spirit.

739
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,260
This is the medicine from the imperial hospital.

740
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,060
The elderly are old and weak.

741
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,900
They are weak and sick.

742
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,900
They are afraid of the cold.

743
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,540
This is the imperial doctor's special medicine.

744
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,740
Take it with you.

745
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,500
You should observe

746
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,020
the maid of the grandmother.

747
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,620
If there's anything wrong,

748
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,900
you should get rid of it.

749
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:04,980
Yes.

750
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,780
Be careful on the way.

751
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,060
Okay.

752
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:39,980
Let's go.

753
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,460
You must do something.

754
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,300
Your Highness is back.

755
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,300
Why are you here?

756
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,500
Your Highness was used to

757
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,540
enjoying this poisonous expected.

758
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,100
It's a pity that I broke it.

759
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,940
Now I've found

760
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,500
the silk that matches the relationship between Yuan Qin and me.

761
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,140
I've changed it for you.

762
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,420
Listen.

763
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,620
The sound is as clear as the original.

764
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,900
Why don't I play a song for you

765
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,060
and you can answer the questions?

766
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:28,860
No need.

767
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,700
Someone will sort it out.

768
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,620
If you have any trouble,

769
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,300
can you tell me?

770
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,060
Although I'm a little confused,

771
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,180
I may not be able to solve the problem for you.

772
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,300
But if you say something,

773
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,020
I don't know how to explain it to others.

774
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,140
Your Highness.

775
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,980
Please stay.

776
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,820
Thank you.

777
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,260
Thank you, Fei Xian.

778
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,420
If anything happens to her,

779
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,860
I'll visit you again.

780
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,140
Your Highness.

781
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,540
What's the matter?

782
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,060
The bookshelf is broken.

783
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,500
It's not the place to be kept.

784
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,980
Mother lost her light because of the fear of being scared.

785
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,740
I came to discuss with you

786
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,020
before I left.

787
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,100
I'd better go back and live.

788
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,340
The palace is crowded with people every day.

789
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,860
Compared to here,

790
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,060
it's more like a wild place.

791
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,340
I'll stay here.

792
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,740
I should be there, too.

793
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,540
Since you don't want to move out,

794
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,820
I'll come here often

795
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,340
since tomorrow.

796
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,700
When you're busy,

797
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,140
I'll be strict with the tea.

798
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,540
If you're idle,

799
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,100
I'll talk to you again.

800
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,060
Is that okay?

801
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,500
I've said

802
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,100
you don't need to worry about the situation.

803
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,860
When Mother was a concubine,

804
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,620
the food and drink of the Emperor

805
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,980
would be taken care of.

806
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,420
That's the reason why I'm here.

807
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,580
I've been so generous

808
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,860
because of you.

809
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,620
I've changed my mind.

810
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,300
I said I don't need to.

811
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,340
Yuanqi.

812
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,420
Send the Crown Princess back.

813
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,420
Yes.

814
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,620
Crown Princess, please.

815
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,980
I'll come again tomorrow.

816
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:36,940
No need to send it back.

817
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,180
Take good care of His Highness.

818
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,700
Your Highness.

819
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,220
Did you see it?

820
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,340
How do I feel

821
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,220
that the Crown Princess

822
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,580
is different from the court?

823
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,940
What time is it?

824
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,220
Why hasn't she sent the Crown Princess back?

825
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,540
I've sent her back.

826
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,940
She's sent it back.

827
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,220
Miss Yao has put the food and drink outside.

828
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,180
Isn't the Crown Princess here just now?

829
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,340
She can't send it back.

830
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:18,940
Tell her

831
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,100
I don't like the food today.

832
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,220
Let her sit down.

833
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,460
Okay.

834
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,620
Sit down again?

835
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,180
Yes.

836
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,820
I've been dreaming for a long time

837
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:11,660
that my heart is not broken.

838
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,740
After I recall it,

839
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,380
I thought

840
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,780
I'd leave the firework

841
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,860
in this silence.

842
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,180
I've been dreaming for a long time

843
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,140
that my heart is not broken.

844
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,060
After I recall it,

845
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,220
I thought
