The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The game is a little bit complicated

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's all a dream

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,680
Recognizing the Chu印

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,000

Lu Huossa

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
The power of the temple is 1.8 million.

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,440
It's over 200 kilometers from here.

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,480
The enemy will take you to the right place.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Episode 1

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
If they can't tell us,

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,880
I can take the medicine myself.

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,080
Yes.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,360
I want you to make a witness.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm done.

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,520
Please report to the Empress Dowager.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,640
Your Highness,

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,360
you can't do that.

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,520
How could you,

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,640
because of the evil spirit,

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
hurt your body?

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
If you really want to do that,

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,440
let the doctors

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,680
try it again.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,320
Can they

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,640
try it again?

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,720
The Empress Dowager has been talking about Kunning Palace.

51
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,680
I have nothing to say.

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
But now it's about the people's lives.

53
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,440
I can't withdraw.

54
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,160
Your Highness,

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,200
you should understand.

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
Even if it's true,

57
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
the result won't change.

58
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
Why are you so hardworking?

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,040
I'm not wrong.

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm doing this

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,160
to avoid harm.

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm doing this

63
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,200
to protect myself and my conscience.

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm doing this

65
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,000
to save Noble Consort.

66
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,080
I'm doing this

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,640
not only for Ziping,

68
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,600
but also for the justice of this world.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,960
Noble Consort,

70
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,920
Qianqing Palace suddenly left the Imperial Court

71
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,960
and took the Yin Temple.

72
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
His Majesty wants to kill himself.

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
Yes.

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,360
Yes.

75
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,120
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,720
What's wrong with the Empress?

77
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,800
Didn't His Majesty ask me to come

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
to listen to your interrogation?

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,840
Who said I was going to interrogate her?

80
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,640
The kitchen

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
is the closest place

82
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,080
to the palace.

83
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,760
Its closest place

84
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,360
is not only food,

85
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,400
but also people.

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,360
However, some people

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,240
come to the Imperial Court

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,720
to do their own thing.

89
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,160
I'm going to investigate the rules today

90
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,040
and have a good time.

91
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,720
No matter if it's wronged or wronged,

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I dare to make a mistake

93
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,680
and make a mistake.

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,200
Your Majesty,

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,040
I'm not in a good health.

96
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,040
Please allow me to leave.

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,920
Why are you looking at me like this?

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,560
It's nothing.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,960
You must go out.

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:17,960
Queen.

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
You go out.

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,720
Queen.

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,440
Your three damsel carvings

104
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
were sent to Kuning Palace

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,240
to именноise 306,100 later

106
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,760
already.

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,800
Your Majesty .

108
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
I'm energized.

109
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,240
Be grateful.

110
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,360
Em,

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,240
I don't need those anymore.

112
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,280
Be grateful.

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,400
The Prime Minister should be so bullied

114
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,040
that she's been Brazilian to death.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now that she's been wavered like this

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,920
she's broke her face out into the present.

117
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
Why is she so sad?

118
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,280
I can't forgive myself for that.

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,720
Now that I haven't recovered,

120
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,040
if something goes wrong,

121
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,340
I'd better catch some colds

122
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,040
in the future.

123
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,800
Yet I can't see my clothes today.

124
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,240
High Classansen is planning will take pride in fighting against this.

125
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,600
eyeliner, please give your brother Cinema

126
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,160
only a temporary leave.

127
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,220
I heardoku that your ill.

128
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,920
Account on imagination for being Lord Han- Claudia.

129
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,100
The scores of money-earning and appointment of

130
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:37,900
pandemonium with the people are

131
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,220
highly selected.

132
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,760
I wonder if the expert

133
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,700
did find your appearance

134
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,380
quite right?

135
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,180
Did he tienesin your guidance?

136
00:06:46,240 --> 00:07:02,180
I am

137
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,880
might be hard perspective.

138
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,340
You plug in your lips.

139
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
My poor family'slockout is locked.

140
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,020
Transport the game?

141
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,280
Pay attention to his death.

142
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,200
I believe

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,340
high above should stand

144
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,440
and sorry people Ceil.

145
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,600
Sir, he fainted.

146
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,760
Continue!

147
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,340

Let go of me

Cid's nothing

155
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,940
Your Majesty!

156
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,100
Your Majesty!

157
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,600
requests for you to insulted

Yes.

162
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,740
Your Majesty.

163
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,660
Your Majesty!

164
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,100
Your Majesty, we must take tinplaying!

165
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,780
our Binivat

166
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,320
Your Majesty!

167
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,780
Your Majesty!

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,440
Your Majesty!

169
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,780
Your Highness!

170
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,760
Your Majesty!

171
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,060
Speak of the devil!

172
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,980
Someone has shared the law.

173
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,140
You have the nerve,

174
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,140
You will also die in the wild.

175
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,140
You will be killed without any reason.

176
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
But now,

177
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,140
there is no evidence.

178
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,140
Why do you insist on using your power?

179
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
Is it because of the so-called royal eyes?

180
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,140
Can you just ignore the innocent lives?

181
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,140
Tell me. Why?

182
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,140
Empress,

183
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,140
tell me in person.

184
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Is it because of Ziping

185
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
that you have a witness?

186
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,140
Did he hurt you?

187
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,140
Tell me!

188
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,140
Zijin!

189
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,140
Ziping!

190
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,140
Don't save them!

191
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,140
Don't save them!

192
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Ziping!

193
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Imperial Physician!

194
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
Zijin, call the imperial physician!

195
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,140
You go!

196
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Yes.

197
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,140
Noble Consort, you are here.

198
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140
It's good to see her out.

199
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,140
If you have anything to say,

200
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,140
just tell me.

201
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,140
Ziping.

202
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,140
Zijin.

203
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,140
Ziping.

204
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,140
I was born in Jianming.

205
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,140
I was born in Jianming.

206
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,140
I did many wrong things

207
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
to self-cultivate myself.

208
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,140
But I was born in the imperial palace.

209
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
I want to be rich and rich.

210
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
I want to be my own daughter.

211
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,140
But no one can look down on me.

212
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,140
So I am desperate every day.

213
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Until I meet you.

214
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,140
Ziping.

215
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,140
Don't worry.

216
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,140
It's okay.

217
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,140
He will be here soon.

218
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,140
Zijin.

219
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Until I meet you,

220
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
I can live like a human being.

221
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,140
I am a kind and kind person.

222
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
I live my life that I want.

223
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,140
It's all because of you.

224
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,140
I know.

225
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,140
Of course I know.

226
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,140
But it's not the time to talk about Zijin.

227
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Listen to me.

228
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
God is the best.

229
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,140
I am a helpless and helpless person.

230
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,140
I am the only one who has it.

231
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,140
Only you, my friend,

232
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,140
I promised you to be a good person.

233
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,140
But I...

234
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,140
But I always...

235
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,140
I have a lot of bad thoughts.

236
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,140
I work hard to keep them.

237
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,140
I will never do bad things in my life.

238
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,140
What do you mean by that?

239
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
Don't say that.

240
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,140
I will be a good person in my life.

241
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,140
Your Majesty.

242
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,140
The High Priestess has five people in her house.

243
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
How can she be punished?

244
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
It's the same thing.

245
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,140
She will be punished by the same person.

246
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,140
Your Majesty.

247
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,140
It's all my fault.

248
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,140
It has nothing to do with the High Priestess.

249
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
If you want to punish her,

250
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,140
you can punish me.

251
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Your Highness.

252
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Your Majesty.

253
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Since the eldest sister passed away,

254
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,140
I have been worried about her.

255
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
She is sick.

256
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
The doctors couldn't find the medical doctor.

257
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
They are afraid that Her Highness will be guilty.

258
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,140
That's why they are so suspicious.

259
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,140
They even implicated the High Priestess to punish her.

260
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Please let them go.

261
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Please let them go.

262
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,140
Since the Empress Dowager is suspicious,

263
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,140
why didn't you tell her first?

264
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,140
It's hard to be a doctor.

265
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,140
I have been sick for a long time.

266
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
I am confused.

267
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,140
I will explain to the Empress Dowager.

268
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,140
Please let His Majesty be kind.

269
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,140
Let them go.

270
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,140
In that case,

271
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,140
I think

272
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,140
the High Priestess will be in trouble

273
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,140
in the future.

274
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
His Majesty is so hard-working and careful.

275
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,140
He is self-sufficient and self-sufficient.

276
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,140
He is a good man.

277
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,140
Who dares to make trouble again?

278
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,140
It's just a pity that Yin Sishan is dead.

279
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,140
Yin Sishan,

280
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
your bitter words are not good.

281
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,140
In this life,

282
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,140
no one dares to make trouble again.

283
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Zi Jin.

284
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,140
Help me do one last thing.

285
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
Burn it.

286
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,140
What is the last thing?

287
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
You only did half of it when you were doing it.

288
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
I finished it myself.

289
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
I am so ugly.

290
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
How can I get it out?

291
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Zifeng.

292
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Are you all right?

293
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Zifeng.

294
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,140
Thank you for your kindness.

295
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Thank you for your kindness.

296
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Noble Consort,

297
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,140
I told you before.

298
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,140
You only need to see how the battle is going to be.

299
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,140
If you want to clear it,

300
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,140
even the tofu can be easily killed.

301
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,140
And Yin Sishan.

302
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,140
Your Majesty.

303
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,140
He...

304
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,140
Your Highness.

305
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
I am afraid that he is too afraid.

306
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
He is pregnant.

307
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Zi Jin.

308
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,140
How could he be so unwell?

309
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,140
I am so hurt.

310
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,140
I am really hurt.

311
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Zi Jin.

312
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
Your Highness.

313
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
I am here to see Physician Sheng.

314
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,140
Greetings, Your Majesty.

315
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,140
I have already ordered you to wait outside.

316
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,140
I understand.

317
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
You are here to lie to me.

318
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Zi Jin.

319
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
Zi Jin.

320
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
Zi Jin.

321
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,140
I am really hurt.

322
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,140
Zi Jin.

323
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Your Highness.

324
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,140
Zi Jin.

325
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,140
Zi Jin.

326
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,140
I am so hurt.

327
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Zi Jin.

328
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
Zi Jin.

329
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,140
Your Majesty.

330
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,140
Why are you bullying me?

331
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,140
Your Highness.

332
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
I will help you up.

333
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Your Majesty.

334
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,140
You seem to have offended both of them.

335
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,140
Really?

336
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,140
Really?

337
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,140
Really?

338
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,140
I am sorry for making you so serious.

339
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
I am sorry for making you so stubborn.

340
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,140
I must have scared them.

341
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Even if Your Majesty said that,

342
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,140
I can't apologize to you.

343
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Mr. Meng.

344
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Mr. Meng.

345
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,140
Before Yin Si Shan returns to the kitchen,

346
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,140
all the dishes in the kitchen are the same as before.

347
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
You will handle them.

348
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,140
Yes.

349
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Mr. Meng.

350
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,140
I am afraid that the government's private property

351
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
is very few.

352
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
The Shao Shi Bureau

353
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
can't be controlled by the government.

354
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
It is not possible.

355
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
I am afraid that

356
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
the government will be in danger.

357
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,140
The government will be in danger.

358
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,140
The Shao Shi Bureau

359
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
can't be controlled by the government.

360
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
The government will be in danger.

361
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
The government will be in danger.

362
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
It will be over in a month.

363
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,140
It will be hard to handle.

364
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,140
One month is enough.

365
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,140
After Yin Si Shan recovers,

366
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,140
he will return to the kitchen.

367
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Mr. Meng.

368
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Is Yin Si Shan okay?

369
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
Yes.

370
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
No.

371
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,140
No.

372
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
No.

373
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,140
Your Highness.

374
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,140
What's wrong with you?

375
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
Your Highness.

376
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Your Majesty.

377
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
Your Highness.

378
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,140
Please stay in Yongning Palace.

379
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,140
You can't live long.

380
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Eunuch Yuan.

381
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,140
Your Majesty has taught us to enter the family.

382
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,140
Why?

383
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,140
Your Majesty said

384
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,140
Your Highness, you are wrong.

385
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,140
You should think about it.

386
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,140
If you think about it, you can go out.

387
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
I will take my leave.

388
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,140
Well.

389
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,140
What did Your Highness do?

The End

401
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Your Highness.

402
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
Your Highness.

403
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
What are you looking for?

404
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,140
Your Highness.

405
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
Your Highness, you can't.

406
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Your Highness.

407
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
Your Highness.

408
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Your Highness, your hand.

409
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Your hand.

410
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Your Highness.

411
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Go down.

412
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Your Majesty.

413
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Yes.

414
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,140
Wait.

415
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,140
Your Highness.

416
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,140
You are more and more confused than a beast.

417
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Your Majesty must be laughing at me now.

418
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
Is she a woman who is useless and evil?

419
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,140
After all, you know everything.

420
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Isn't it?

421
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,140
Before your empress,

422
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,140
her hands

423
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,140
could be folded and opened to save people.

424
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
I learned to fight for ten years.

425
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
Grandfather of the foreign clan was the one who made me do it.

426
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,140
I was really hoping

427
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,140
that one day I could become a famous woman like her.

428
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
I was really hoping

429
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,140
that one day I could become a famous woman like her.

430
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,140
I couldn't.

431
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,140
I couldn't have a chance like this.

432
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,140
I had already killed someone.

433
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
I killed a patient.

434
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
And now,

435
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,140
I have to use these hands

436
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,140
to hurt more innocent people.

437
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,140
Your Majesty.

438
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,140
I am really so scared.

439
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
How could I become like this?

440
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,140
A person with a conscience and a bottom line,

441
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
how could he be so ignorant

442
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
because of his mistakes?

443
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
From the beginning to the end,

444
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
your hesitation and struggle

445
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,140
prove that you are good at thinking and being honest.

446
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
It makes me feel very comfortable.

447
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
You and Grandfather didn't choose the wrong person.

448
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,140
I believe that you are just sick.

449
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,140
But you are still my good empress.

450
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,140
Your Majesty.

451
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,140
I am the empress

452
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
or your wife?

453
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,140
Do you really not have any eyes on me?

454
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,140
I thought that after this,

455
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,140
you would never want to see me again.

456
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,140
Greetings to Your Majesty and the empress.

457
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Your Majesty.

458
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Don't think too much.

459
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
Don't think too much.

460
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,140
Take good care of your illness.

461
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
Don't let the empress be worried.

462
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,140
After you came here,

463
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,140
you are not talking.

464
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
Your Majesty.

465
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,140
The empress should be well-behaved.

466
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,140
But what did the Noble Consort do wrong?

467
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Don't say that I don't understand.

468
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
I think even the Noble Consort

469
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,140
doesn't understand herself.

470
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
She will think about it.

471
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,140
If she doesn't understand,

472
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,140
she will be worried.

473
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
I think that

474
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,140
she is not good at thinking.

475
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,140
She shouldn't come out.

476
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,140
A'Jing.

477
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
Your Majesty.

478
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Your Majesty.

479
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
I didn't say anything.

480
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,140
Premier,

481
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,140
what do you want to do?

482
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,140
I'm very upset continuously.

483
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,540
What do you want to do?

484
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,140
There's no new

485
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,740
food that can't be melted.

486
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,180
layout

487
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,020
This sauce is of clear mind

488
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,340
But I gotta keep it pretend

489
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,760
What's this?

490
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,180
It's a crisp, light taste

491
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,860
The fatty part Below and mucic

492
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,140
It could dissolve andэ

493
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,820
To make it more representative,

494
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,220
it is better to

495
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:24,780
select a

496
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,300
can you eat that flash anymore?

497
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,360
That's a strange question.

498
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,240
Eat this,

499
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,820
one can eat as much as you want.

500
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,140
The crispy and tender shiitake mushrooms

501
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,700
and the crispy skin of the sweet potato

502
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,700
are very delicious.

503
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,500
Is it delicious?

504
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,340
The fire is just right.

505
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,340
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

506
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,540
is very delicious.

507
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,020
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

508
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,140
is very delicious.

509
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,580
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

510
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
is very delicious.

511
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,100
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

512
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,260
is very delicious.

513
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,900
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

514
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,060
is very delicious.

515
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,540
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

516
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,820
is very delicious.

517
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,380
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

518
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,780
is very delicious.

519
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,540
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

520
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,940
is very delicious.

521
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,900
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

522
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,380
is very delicious.

523
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,060
The crispy skin of the sweet potato

524
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,380
is very delicious.

525
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,700
But now,

526
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,660
I'm here

527
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,100
to continue to work.

528
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,580
Che境 Muchen and the invulnerability of your kings in tearing their banished lamp kapitviches

529
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,420
of a witch and a patient.

530
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,820
And theanco was hidden

531
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,620
in thisToo-inqu exercicer.

532
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,420
And you asked me about it,

533
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,460
so I'll tell you.

534
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,700
This was used as a present

535
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
for wars,

536
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,420
cheese, joss button mushrooms and Chu Banggui.

537
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,500
I cook it every two hours

538
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,540
and even cook it for three days.

539
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:51,160
So

540
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,760
if you say you don't want to see me cry.

541
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,400
I beg you.

542
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,780
I won't see you ever again.

543
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:18,160
I got something important to

544
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,680
You don't even look at me.

545
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,760
I messed up

546
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,200
all ten fingers

547
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,480
for this hat.

548
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,120
Yes.

549
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,480
I didn't tell you before.

550
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,040
That's because of the accident.

551
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,600
I couldn't make it.

552
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,160
I was too much.

553
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,680
But that's for the Queen.

554
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,560
I didn't expect you to believe me.

555
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
I was so sad.

556
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,760
Don't be angry, will you?

557
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,120
You've been here for two months.

558
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,600
You didn't even tell me before.

559
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,760
Jialin!

560
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,640
As we anticipated,

561
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,920
the Great Protector's Foundation

562
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,120
will open in a few days

563
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,120
for all students here

564
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,600
to attend.

565
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,240
As you've done your best

566
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,360
to pres gezeigt several questions in the archive,

567
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,680
You didn't check the jade stone.

568
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,200
Keep an eye on it.

569
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,320
Your Majesty, don't worry.

570
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,280
I understand.

571
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,360
Your Majesty.

572
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,080
I, the mother,

573
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
have been in a terrible state of blood.

574
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,480
I'm sorry for the lack of your help.

575
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,720
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,440
Please allow me to ask you a question.

577
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,160
Noble Consort,

578
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,840
have you ever mentioned that

579
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,880
the jade stone can be returned to the palace?

580
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,040
I don't know.

581
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,080
Chen Wu,

582
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
ask Shang Yin to go back with Meiyu

583
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,240
and help her mother.

584
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,920
Yes.

585
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,280
I'm grateful

586
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,480
for your help.

587
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,760
The jade stone...

588
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,680
Lord Mei,

589
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,080
please.

590
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

591
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,920
Your Majesty,

592
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,240
I've been watching you

593
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,920
for a long time.

594
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,680
I'm busy with the affairs.

595
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,320
The jade flowers in the palace

596
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,480
are so beautiful.

597
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,080
Do you want to ask Her Highness the Empress

598
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,400
to go to the court together?

599
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,200
Go ahead.

600
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,240
Why not?

601
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,200
Your Majesty,

602
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
do you want me to

603
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,640
give you a few gifts?

604
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,520
Who told you to give them to me?

605
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:54,840
Please don't be angry.

606
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,840
Look at me.

607
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,080
I'm drunk.

608
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
I'm not happy with the hot smoke.

609
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,240
I should hit you.

610
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,000
Get lost.

611
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,080
Wait.

612
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,760
Your Majesty.

613
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,240
How long has it been?

614
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,840
Your Majesty, you've been asking for the jade stone.

615
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,400
It's been two months.

616
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,600
I think Noble Consort

617
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,280
has already been destroyed.

618
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Go to Yongning Palace.

619
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,680
I want to ask her a question.

620
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:32,840
Your Highness,

621
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,040
I'm here to see you.

622
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,360
Your Highness,

623
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,120
Your Majesty,

624
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,640
did you know the wrong person?

625
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,000
Divine Empress Du growth.

626
00:35:46,120 --> 00:36:11,960
This man said

627
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,160
She's not getting up.

628
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,920
She wants to draw.

629
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,600
She's turning around.

630
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,440
She's actually ten thousand years old.

631
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,800
She's always

632
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
thinking about you.

633
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,000
She asked me to ask

634
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,200
if you were any different.

635
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,440
You just have to be a good girl.

636
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,600
Just say something.

637
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,240
No.

638
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,520
Say three words.

639
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,760
You're wrong.

640
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,640
I'll report it to you right away.

641
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,120
You're going out, aren't you?

642
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:39,960
Your Highness.

643
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,480
Your Highness.

644
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,080
Your Highness.

645
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,920
I'll take my leave.

646
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,240
What's going on?

647
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,800
Eunuch Yuan.

648
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,200
I'm afraid that Your Highness will get sick.

649
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,680
Can you please tell His Majesty

650
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,080
that you've already been

651
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,600
completely cured?

652
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,000
Get sick?

653
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,440
You said you didn't believe me.

654
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,440
The imperial doctor comes to treat me every day.

655
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
She's sick.

656
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
You're ten thousand years old.

657
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,160
Am I right?

658
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,280
No.

659
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,320
You're really mad.

660
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,240
Eunuch Yuan.

661
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,840
Eunuch Yuan.

662
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,520
Regarding Prince Li's life,

663
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,600
I have torn down the ainda- ubiquity boxes

664
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,480
that I have bought.

665
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,160
For itsIG,

666
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,480
I've walked outside

667
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,440
while maintaining all the rights to the old humble family.

668
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm willing to accept all the criminal schemes

669
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,400
I've caused likewise to cook and eat for His Majesty.

670
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,480
If I can make that software,

671
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,040
no one can help me at all.

672
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,000
If I can't,

673
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,840
clean the boxes box

674
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,680
and get some money in the future.

675
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,520
I'm afraid that

676
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,920
Uncle Cook can't make a wish

677
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:39,320
to vin

678
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,160
Master, the scum is indeed a bad man.

679
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,500
While Princess Yongning needs the hideous one,

680
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,340
I...

681
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,060
I think you're even more drunk than her.

682
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,060
I...

683
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:49,700
I...

684
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,300
My lord,

685
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,180
what did I say?

686
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,260
My lord, wait for me.

687
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,380
When I was pregnant,

688
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,100
I didn't even touch Lu Ruoguo's neck.

689
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,100
Why didn't you eat

690
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,260
the lake-eye soup you like?

691
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,620
Look at you.

692
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,220
Your highness has lost a lot of weight.

693
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,820
It's your turn.

694
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,660
Your highness,

695
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,020
I've sent you

696
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,860
the Ninth Year's Xiao Han painting.

697
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,700
Eunuch Yuan.

698
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,820
This little man is just here to run.

699
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,340
Eunuch Yuan is the red man

700
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,420
who's been around His Majesty.

701
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,500
How could you come here yourself?

702
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,380
Your highness,

703
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,980
I've never forgotten

704
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,100
your kindness to me.

705
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,860
I'm honored

706
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,740
to have you

707
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,300
ask me

708
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,220
how can I

709
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,740
be so kind to you?

710
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,940
Eunuch Yuan,

711
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,900
you've been

712
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,100
so kind to me for a month.

713
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,460
You haven't finished

714
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,420
the painting of the Ninth Year's Xiao Han.

715
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,100
Miao Xi.

716
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,660
I'm just asking.

717
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:11,940
Bless you.

718
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,420
Yes.

719
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,740
Your hasty

720
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,100
is bold.

721
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,660
He was too honest to listen.

722
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,020
At midday,

723
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,300
I wanted

724
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,800
to have

725
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,140
him

726
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,140
and the other 3 to 4 days.

727
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,980
Then I was pregnant.

728
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,620
What did you do?

729
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,380
That roasted Cinynasty

730
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,820
didn't realize they were wronged.

731
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,700
When the ages of ten were made,

732
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,860
he'd be easily beaten

733
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,220
by His Majesty and his principal.

734
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Now, no one dares to mention this matter.

735
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:44,860
In one day,

736
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,540
Wan Sui will behead her.

737
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,860
It's just a matter of time.

738
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,580
His Majesty has already been caught.

739
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,140
He still refuses to take action.

740
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,060
Your Highness,

741
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,300
what you said

742
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,540
is for Wan Sui to behead anyone.

743
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,100
It's for her.

744
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,820
People around her

745
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,140
are in a bad mood.

746
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,660
This Concubine Sun

747
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,580
is not as pure as Wan Sui.

748
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,980
That's a good temper.

749
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,420
She's a prince.

750
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,580
I think

751
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,100
this Concubine Sun

752
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,940
will never be out.

753
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,700
That's interesting.

754
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,540
Your Highness,

755
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,100
let's have a look.

756
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,220
Where were you just now?

757
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,460
Your Highness,

758
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,340
I'll take my leave.

759
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
Your Majesty, you look at the gauze,

760
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,260
the gauze,

761
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,620
and the old gauze.

762
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,540
It's still the same as the one in the ancient

763
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,340
and the old gauze.

764
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,780
What do you think?

765
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,220
It's not right.

766
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,140
The color is not even.

767
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,020
It's a bit rough

768
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,340
to touch.

769
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,140
It's such a waste

770
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,780
to waste such a good fairy.

771
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,820
I remember

772
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,140
there's a three-striped gauze in Yongning Palace.

773
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,140
It's a military gauze.

774
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,780
It's a gauze.

775
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,860
It's a great gift.

776
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,380
It's a good gift.

777
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,460
I'll

778
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,140
go to the south

779
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,340
to have a look.

780
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,860
It's not a waste of time.

781
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,180
Your Majesty, you'll be tired.

782
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,260
Okay.

783
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:33,820
Raise your hand.

784
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,940
Ye Quan.

785
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,940
What are you looking forward?

786
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,380
I've been waiting for you for three months.

787
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,300
I've� cluttered my book.

788
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,060
Do you believe I can leave the wrong page

789
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,300
if I speak nonchalantly?

790
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,820
I'd never offend you if I don't want to.

791
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,260
Feel sorry to others

792
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,140
and say no less!

793
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,600
I hope I smear your curse

794
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,820
and don't beg for it!

795
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,060
Bullying I am

796
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,260
is my protection for every step.

797
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,340
I take it for an outsider's own according to the truth!

798
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,420
You personally say

799
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,940
that I'm a king

800
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,940
besides Yuzhei.

801
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:52,860
You make it

802
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,740
theaus daughter of seven troops!

803
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,260
I'm in charge of Yuzhei's property anymore.

804
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,140
So you're

805
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,740
fellow servants.

806
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,860
Speak up!

807
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,780
Why don't you talk?

808
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,780
Well!

809
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,980
Are you a moron?

810
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,140
Your Majesty,

811
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,340
