1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Zhu Zhan Ji and the emperor are the world

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The Queen of Zunzhang is the Queen of the Empress

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Li Tai Zi Fei Hu Shi is the Queen

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She is the Emperor of the Ming dynasty

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I didn't prepare to send the Tuo Yan Bingsu over there last year

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What should I do?

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Didn't he send the Tuo Yan Bingsu?

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Your Majesty

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think he is good. He is not a good person

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Your Majesty

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Actually this year

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What are you waiting for?

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Actually this year, besides the Queen Dowager

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I didn't send the Tuo Yan Bingsu

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What?

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I sent the Tuo Yan Bingsu to Wan Sui

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's the rule

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wan Sui is a good person

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He should be rewarded with a reward

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's the rule

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's wrong now?

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't want the rule

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't want it

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
President Yuan

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The Queen didn't send it

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
All the masters dare not to send it

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No matter how bold

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not good to go to the Queen

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you think it's the name?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What about the Queen of Zun?

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She didn't send it

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You also said

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I went for nothing

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The Queen made the Tuo Yan Bingsu herself

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But she ate it herself

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, okay, okay

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I tell you

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Look at it

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Look at it

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Super good

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There is one more thing

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The private bureau is in the capital

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This year you

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You should go to the front of the emperor

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Good, good, good

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's go

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I want to go there

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's okay

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No one is stopping you

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's go and see

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What about the middle of the autumn banquet

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sometimes

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I think

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Sometimes

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I really admire you

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't spend a good time

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have to interfere with the Noble Consort

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
To be a good husband

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is why the Empress Dowager's vibration

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Is in the middle of your position

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sisters

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I dare not to meet the bottom of the Noble Consort

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And be close to you

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You are a very good cook

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Sometimes think about it

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's better to be a cook in the upper room

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Look at you now

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's so pitiful

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
After the Mid-Autumn Festival

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I will ask the emperor to make a bottle of osmanthus wine

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This wine is unique

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Not stupid

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I will definitely be able to make your happiness

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I will not be bothered by the old five moves

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Master

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Your cooking is really good

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I will go to the palace

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I will go to the palace

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I will go to the palace

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will go to the palace

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I will go to the palace

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I will go to the palace

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I will go to the palace

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I will go to the palace

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I will go to the palace

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will go to the palace

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I will go to the palace

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will go to the palace

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I will go to the palace

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I will go to the palace

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will go to the palace

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will go to the palace

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I will go to the palace

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will go to the palace

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will go to the palace

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I will go to the palace

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will go to the palace

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I will go to the palace

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I will go to the palace

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will go to the palace

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will go to the palace

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will go to the palace

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I will go to the palace

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will go to the palace

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I will go to the palace

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will go to the palace

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I will go to the palace

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I will go to the palace

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I will go to the palace

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will go to the palace

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I will go to the palace

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I will go to the palace

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will go to the palace

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I will go to the palace

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I will go to the palace

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I will go to the palace

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I will go to the palace

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I will go to the palace

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I will go to the palace

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I will go to the palace

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will go to the palace

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will go to the palace

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I will go to the palace

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I will go to the palace

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I will go to the palace

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I will go to the palace

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I will go to the palace

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I will go to the palace

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I will go to the palace

150
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I will go to the palace

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I will go to the palace

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will go to the palace

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,280
So will it be

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
within the people's mind?

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good.

156
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:05,480
Put your hand at the inn for me,

157
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,640
Junior Princess!

158
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,400
The grandson's late!

159
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,440
Just,

160
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,800
the emperor is still well dressed.

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,880
The emperor'sOffice..

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
Greetings, Mother.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,720
Come and sit.

164
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,400
Don't mind.

165
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,280
How's Mother?

166
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,600
She's fine.

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,000
You're busy with the business.

168
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:15,200
We find some worms

169
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
during the diving.

170
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
Here I am!

171
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Amazing!

172
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,040
Wow!

173
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,320
T�i.

174
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,640
There is one empty China fish tank here.

175
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,280
Here is a Chinese wr Este.

176
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Lying there's I.

177
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
wear them.

178
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,760
She absorbed theNING

179
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
with honey and liaison

180
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,960
fragrance.

181
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
Her mouth is sore.

182
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,880
It smells alright.

183
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,800
You'd better taste it.

184
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,480
Empress Dowager,

185
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
桐料 is made by

186
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,280
liangqiu and sihha

187
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,360
It has three ingredients,

188
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,040
which are specially made.

189
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,600
That is wind LG.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,660
By the way.

191
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,060
Es洒늘 AH says

192
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,700
the period of the new year

193
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,480
is insufficient.

194
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,880
If you count

195
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,220
3000 Royalקs on imperial step,

196
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,220
Lu Weipu's Pt 5,

197
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,140
How many years

198
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,620
had you been in the Hangshult Commandery?

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,580
Nint ,and now, you know

200
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,700
Princess!

201
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,860
She's still not at all young.

202
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,780
Who is she to call Her Highness?

203
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,900
She has...

204
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,860
My daughter lost her baby home.

205
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,380
Black-색 medicine

206
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,460
it means her right hand is strong.

207
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,340
What does he have to do?

208
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,580
What else?

209
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,860
There's nothing I can do for me.

210
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,620
Starting from today,

211
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
all the imperial brothers of Zijin City

212
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,480
were registered for false

213
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,320
and NO. 3.2-1.

214
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Your Majesty should take the position.

215
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,420
how can he be so fierce?

216
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,620
This is...

217
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,700
Yin Si Shan,

218
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,360
Your Majesty.

219
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,720
Your Majesty.

220
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,540
There is meat and spinach in this pot.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,860
They taste too nut-like.

222
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,260
What's so special?

223
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,540
Your Majesty.

224
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,340
His Majesty first appeared

225
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,900
with His Majesty the Emperor to peutas in the north.

226
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,300
The military has more caprice in massa toplina and他的米

227
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,260
and less flour in jea.

228
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,660
For me to make Instagram Fake

229
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,880
with those puppies & pasta

230
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,620
that can use impossible equipment

231
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,380
is best to be equipped with

232
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,980
salt & sundried resteoted seasoning

233
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,620
and also can store items

234
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,560
that be added

235
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:03,700
everything,

236
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,260
every single unknown fruit of your farm.

237
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,460
I have tried.

238
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,580
It's not bad.

239
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,160
It has been

240
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,300
pretty peaceful in the day.

241
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,200
lavisham Lup instruction aside.

242
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,700
Before, when people metanı a lack of water,

243
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,060
we produced rice with gravy.

244
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,100
It's not rare that you have those wings human army wastes to make.

245
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Those were given to eat cows for這

246
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,240
raw and seasoned Lama Swordsman.

247
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,140
That way, soldiers know that when training,

248
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,860
those who lose will also need toesa lping it.

249
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,700
Travel.

250
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,080
Yes.

251
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,740
Is the Imperial Land Bureau stillPSteing

252
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,880
needs their position?

253
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,460
Yes.

254
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,860
We just have the two of them

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,180
in a uniform.

256
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,580
I'm afraid this position

257
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,780
wouldn't suffocate.

258
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,720
So...

259
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,960
Please hold up your position for a moment

260
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,440
and when whatever you need

261
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,400
I will restore your position.

262
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,080
Yes.

263
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,220
Thank you, Your Empress Dowager!

264
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,080
Take some buqamm!

265
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,700
Your Highness, please say it again.

266
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm sorry for that.

267
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,500
If Princess Rong Le financially exchange for me,

268
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,180
I will borrow His Majesty's somber Cantonese dish

269
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
instead his hands.

270
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,500
I will want to eat Martial ticket.

271
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,460
But if so,

272
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
as long as I can offer you some.

273
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,540
Sharpsiens will avenge you.

274
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,660
If you are envious of me,

275
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,500
I will kill him to feed me at your feet.

276
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,500
Okay, go.

277
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,820
No matter how much you beg,

278
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,820
forget it for a while.

279
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,980
I'm not going to kneel.

280
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,660
Your Majesty is busy with the hunting.

281
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,700
Your face is red.

282
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,940
Look.

283
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,580
Touch it.

284
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Touch it.

285
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,180
By the way.

286
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,780
Your Majesty, you look so pale.

287
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
It's not this.

288
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,980
I'll look for it.

289
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,380
I'm going back to the banquet.

290
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
You can go find it.

291
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,380
Your Majesty!

292
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
Your Majesty!

293
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Master.

294
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
The water is cold.

295
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
You should be careful.

296
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
I'll help you.

297
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,820
This wine is special and very sweet.

298
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I'm sure it will make you happy.

299
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
I'm sure it will make you happy.

300
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
He's trying to fool me.

301
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
He's trying to fool me.

302
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
He's trying to fool me.

303
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
He's trying to fool me.

304
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
Master.

305
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Someone come here.

306
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Someone come here.

307
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
Don't cry.

308
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Still crying?

309
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Did you hear that?

310
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Don't cry.

311
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
Don't cry.

312
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
Don't cry.

313
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
Don't cry.

314
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
If you cry again, I'll hit you.

315
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Master.

316
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
Why are you here?

317
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
I've been looking for you everywhere.

318
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
Huh?

319
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,780
Xiao Chu is here.

320
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,220
I'll find you everywhere.

321
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,860
What are you looking for?

322
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,020
I heard the voice of that person just now.

323
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,940
Yin Si Shan has been looking for you for a long time.

324
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,980
Go back now.

325
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,780
What a pity.

326
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,860
Go now.

327
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,780
Go away without me.

328
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,060
Are you Yi Zhi?

329
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,540
This Is intact.

330
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,660
This is included in the employment

331
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,780
the marinated fish?

332
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:58,860
Yes.

333
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,820
It's the dried lotus leaves

334
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,260
that were preserved after the rest of the harvest.

335
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,380
It was originally frozen in Guihua wine.

336
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,100
But the water was too cold

337
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,700
and it hurt the Empress Dowager's body.

338
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,500
So I got the wine and re-heated it.

339
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:12,980
Is this your idea?

340
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,780
Your Majesty,

341
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,940
this is the purple gold.

342
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,420
This is the one Your Highness

343
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,020
specially made for the Empress Dowager.

344
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,340
It's the lotus leaves you made.

345
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,340
It's...

346
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,980
Yes.

347
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,580
It's the lotus leaves

348
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,820
that we perspired

349
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,380
perched and re-worn

350
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,540
after the rest of the harvest.

351
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,820
It would take 20 minutes

352
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,540
to press and match with the rotin jar,

353
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,580
which is why it's so clever.

354
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,780
This world

355
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,540
has been've rebelled

356
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,060
and somewhat aquelaicted.

357
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,260
I remember the Emperor

358
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,060
liked to bet on the pot.

359
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,820
He said it is famous

360
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
because he followed the Soviets

361
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,580
and sulfinated the wine wine.

362
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:05,780
What?

363
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,500
You're too busy?

364
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,100
You cannot spend the day

365
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,180
with alright people.

366
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,860
I want an taciturn

367
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,060
and will buy it with you at all times.

368
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,700
However,

369
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,300
this rumors

370
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,860
Don't be so mean in the future.

371
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,260
Mother.

372
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,540
I still have some work to do.

373
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,580
I'll take my leave.

374
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,620
Your Majesty, what's wrong?

375
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,380
I don't like to play the piano.

376
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,180
How can the monk be so drunk?

377
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,020
The flowers are blooming,

378
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,180
the monk is in a good mood.

379
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,340
How can he be so drunk?

380
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,220
It's been a long time since I've learned the white snow.

381
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,980
His Majesty hasn't even heard it.

382
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,900
The emperor has left.

383
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,940
We're more free when he leaves.

384
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,980
Keep singing and dancing.

385
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,220
He doesn't like to listen.

386
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,380
I don't want to listen to him.

387
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,500
I don't want to listen to him.

388
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,460
I don't want to listen to him.

389
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
I don't want to listen to him.

390
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,500
I don't want to listen to him.

391
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I don't want to listen to him.

392
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,340
I don't want to listen to him.

393
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,260
I don't want to listen to him.

394
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,780
Didn't I ask you to apologize to the emperor?

395
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,620
Why didn't His Majesty come to see me?

396
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,140
My Lady, His Majesty is busy.

397
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,180
I'm afraid he can't come.

398
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,740
Please come to the funeral with me.

399
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,860
You go.

400
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,660
I can't let others laugh at me.

401
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,060
My Lady.

402
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,620
Maybe...

403
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,740
You've sent Lord Shen you've come around.

404
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,820
Saying he grew up to chain spiders.

405
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,740
Just leaves us lonely.

406
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,740
Don't. Take him away.

407
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,020
Yes.

408
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,700
Stop!

409
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,060
Turn around!

410
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,420
See?

411
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,620
She Igor.

412
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,420
She is過於氣我.

413
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,420
She has a smile on her face.

414
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,020
Wu Jiang Yi.

415
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
You let me see

416
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,740
how empty it is outside.

417
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,020
You're a man

418
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,340
who doesn't accept gifts.

419
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,660
I forgot to tell you.

420
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,380
This bowl of soup

421
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,820
needs to be put on the charcoal fire.

422
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,540
Use charcoal to make it better.

423
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,940
And then use the firewood to make it better.

424
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,900
Don't forget the time.

425
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,300
What's this?

426
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,540
You just had the immortal porridge.

427
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,940
This is the immortal rice.

428
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,020
I made it for you.

429
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,820
And

430
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,340
the Imperial Physician

431
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,700
made it with the liver and phoenix.

432
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,220
You can have it together.

433
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,180
You can refuse to be scolded.

434
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,700
I came to apologize to you.

435
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,660
Don't get angry, okay?

436
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,580
Xiao'e.

437
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,980
Please forgive me.

438
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,780
Is he good?

439
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,580
You're really here to apologize?

440
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,060
You were here as a donor

441
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,220
with a personalại.

442
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,060
You told me to

443
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,000
apologize to you一 everything.

444
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,620
It's Soul Be speeding.

445
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,540
Well said.

446
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,040
Why don't you guysも

447
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,840
speak into it later?

448
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Sure.

449
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,980
What are you talking about?

450
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,980
My daughter?

451
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,060
It's Можно's.

452
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,940
Why don't you have Brother Qiang take your heart?

453
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,180
I'm in a deep sensitive state.

454
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,260
She probably couldn't hold the secret.

455
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,180
I don't know how the other ones

456
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,100
should Century Peace take her side.

457
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,220
I don't believe it.

458
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:15,680
Your Majesty.

459
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,320
I know a delicate way of helping people,

460
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,220
and I can Hoje go for kind love.

461
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,040
I can only do it by flexibility.

462
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,000
It's a way to help Yi.

463
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,540
Maybe you're too kind to this man's heart,

464
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,560
that's why you want him to eyes away

465
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,100
in please and with reverse.

466
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,860
Do you?

467
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,180
H videos don't solidify,

468
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,340
supress,

469
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,640
caution

470
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,920
for the worse.

471
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,800
You just need to see him

472
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,560
from your side.

473
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,120
No.

474
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,320
You don't understand her?

475
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,820
Your Majesty.

476
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,780
All woman is the same.

477
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,480
Such anything as Right Lady Guo,

478
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,680
who ogred the cooking comes from the creamy skin,

479
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,300
cyanide-ventivanous scent,

480
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,760
and cold Heart of the Heavenly Emperor,

481
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,800
are just all love and hello.

482
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,840
A这是 Babish fellow.

483
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,180
Remember your previous explanation that

484
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,320
woman súhu attendack?

485
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

486
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,440
Do not fight with him

487
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,260
because he is the commander who means the Ros amusing CHU.

488
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,780
Watch your胡.

489
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,440
Scout.

490
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,840
My lady,

491
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,360
this is for you.

492
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,920
Yong'er!

493
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,840
Your Majesty!

494
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,320
Her Majesty is most afraid of being fooled.

495
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,820
I think he Northern will.

496
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,440
Alright.

497
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,120
Follow your heart.

498
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,120
It wasn't a coincidence.

499
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,120
Wake up!

500
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,420
You are up!

501
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,620
Get up to fBB up.

502
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Why are you still here?

503
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
You asked Wu Wu to invite you to the medicine room.

504
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
Did you forget?

505
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
You finally know Yan'er is pregnant.

506
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Are you stable?

507
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Last night, His Majesty came to see you.

508
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,320
You fell asleep and he left.

509
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
Why didn't you wake me up?

510
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Why didn't you wake me up?

511
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,320
Aunt Wu.

512
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
I've made you sit tight.

513
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
It's okay. Don't move.

514
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
Let me out.

515
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,320
Let me out, Yao Ziqin.

516
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Don't be a fool.

517
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,320
You're not hurt?

518
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Episode 19

519
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Your Majesty, you said you didn't have enough heart.

520
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
You have a very strong stomach today.

521
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
How did you get it?

522
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
Su Ci Shan.

523
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,320
I cooked all the medicines for the medicine room.

524
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
There are medicines.

525
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,320
I really don't want to miss anything.

526
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
You're still a little bit stubborn.

527
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I...

528
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
Get out of here.

529
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
What are you doing?

530
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
The food in Kunning Palace is so bland.

531
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Shouldn't you teach her?

532
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Su Ci Shan.

533
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
I really did it according to the prescription.

534
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
I dare not have any food.

535
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
You're still a little bit stubborn.

536
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
How can I explain to Her Highness the Empress?

537
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Stop fighting.

538
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
Yin Si Shan.

539
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,320
You're just a temporary head of the business.

540
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I want to teach a little kitchen maid

541
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
to raise her family.

542
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,320
She's going to the various palaces to deliver food.

543
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Let the masters see the scar on her hand.

544
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,320
They'll think Su Ci Shan is deliberately using the medicine.

545
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
How about this?

546
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
From now on,

547
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,320
I'll personally supervise the medicine room in Kunning Palace.

548
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,320
If there's any trouble, I'll be responsible.

549
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Don't worry about it.

550
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Yin Si Shan.

551
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
I didn't.

552
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,320
I really didn't.

553
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,320
Don't be afraid.

554
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I'll personally help you to cure the wound.

555
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
It's a good thing.

556
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Until Her Highness the Empress is satisfied.

557
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
Okay?

558
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
Let's go.

559
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
If we change the money,

560
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Yin Zi Ping will be able to jump up early.

561
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
It's much later than usual.

562
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
You're really lucky.

563
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
She took your position as the head of the business.

564
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
You're not angry?

565
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Empress Dowager.

566
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
The Ministry of Justice said

567
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,320
that the palace's internal affairs

568
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
needs the help of the Sha Luo 9000.

569
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
They want to invite His Majesty

570
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,320
to the Imperial Court to add the construction of the mansion.

571
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
I'll be careful with the investigation.

572
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
The real need is

573
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
not as many as they want.

574
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
The national name is the capital.

575
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
The name is Anzi Guo An.

576
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
The late emperor has been

577
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,320
in the imperial court for many times.

578
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
How long has it been?

579
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
They've been trying to re-do it.

580
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,320
The name of the palace is being taken away.

581
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,320
The 9th City is now in the private house.

582
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
The people hate the Du Chong.

583
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
Empress.

584
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Empress.

585
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
I'm not feeling well.

586
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
I'm feeling unwell.

587
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Please forgive me.

588
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
You can leave.

589
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Yes.

590
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
I understand.

591
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,320
The flag of the palace is very strong.

592
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
But your Qi Feng...

593
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,320
What do you think of my Qi Feng?

594
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
You're always a noble man.

595
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
You don't care about money.

596
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
But you're a noble man.

597
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,320
You're a noble man.

598
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
You're a noble man.

599
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
You're a noble man.

600
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
You're a noble man.

601
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
You're a noble man.

602
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
You're a noble man.

603
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
You're a noble man.

604
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
You're a noble man.

605
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
But today,

606
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
you're a noble man.

607
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
You're a noble man.

608
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
You're a noble man.

609
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
You're a noble man.

610
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,320
Your Majesty has allowed me to be a third-rate.

611
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Now you're allowing me to be a third-rate.

612
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,320
I don't want to lose too soon.

613
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Your Majesty is giving me a hard time.

614
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
I'll go back to the palace and have a look.

615
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
I'll let you look at me.

616
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
It seems that

617
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
you have a good teacher behind you.

618
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,320
Your Majesty.

619
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Your Majesty.

620
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Your Majesty.

621
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Your Majesty, did His Majesty see

622
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
that you invited Her Highness Sun to the funeral?

623
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Your Majesty.

624
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
His Majesty sent the letter of farewell to the King of Han

625
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
to the Great Rain in Mid-Autumn.

626
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
He just sent it to the capital.

627
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Yun Zhou.

628
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
Look at my second uncle.

629
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
He really cares about me.

630
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,320
It seems that I have to give him a letter.

631
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,320
I'm not sure if I can give him a letter.

632
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
I'm afraid that

633
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
he might not be able to give me a letter.

634
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
I'm afraid that

635
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
he might not be able to give me a letter.

636
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
I should give him a letter.

637
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,320
I should thank him.

638
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Your Majesty.

639
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
I'm worried that

640
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
when Han's family comes,

641
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
the oil in the county will be wasted.

642
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
When the royal family and the royal family are around,

643
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,320
the King of Han will come to celebrate every holiday.

644
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Now, he is just a good man.

645
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Besides,

646
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
I've been with my uncle everywhere.

647
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Everyone is watching.

648
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,320
I believe

649
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
he won't let me down.

650
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Yes.

651
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
You may leave.

652
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Who taught you to play the music?

653
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Get out.

654
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
Don't mention it.

655
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Didn't His Majesty

656
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
say something nice just now?

657
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
What I said to you

658
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,320
is not to forget.

659
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
Your Majesty.

660
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
You're not going to be late.

661
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Who told you to come in?

662
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Yuan Guangguo is not that kind of person.

663
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,320
I went to the Empress Dowager's palace to ask for your safety.

664
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
She just gave His Majesty a small stone.

665
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
I even brought it with me.

666
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
If His Majesty doesn't welcome me,

667
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
he will leave.

668
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,320
I know you're tired.

669
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
I won't let you rest.

670
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
I'll be here with you for a while.

671
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Did I do something wrong?

672
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
You don't deserve this scent.

673
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
I'll give you a better one.

674
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
I'll give you a better one.

675
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
I'll give you a better one.

676
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
I know you're the most concerned about me.

677
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Go get a bowl of food.

678
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
Your Majesty.

679
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
I dare not do the main act.

680
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
Your Majesty.

681
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Your Majesty.

682
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
I dare not do it.

683
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Your Majesty.

684
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
Your Majesty.

685
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
I did it for your happiness.

686
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
This is the right thing to do.

687
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
It's good to do.

688
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
You can't do it.

689
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
You're hiding the pot.

690
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
You're angry with the Empress Dowager.

691
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
I won't punish her.

692
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,320
She will punish me too.

693
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,320
I just want her to be calm and calm.

694
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
I don't want to see her lying in front of me.

695
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
But she's just a soul.

696
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
She can do anything.

697
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
She's lying.

698
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
I'm dizzy.

699
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Your Majesty.

700
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
Why don't you take a deep breath

701
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
while you're in the kitchen?

702
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Isn't it over?

703
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Deep breath?

704
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Go.

705
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Go and tell her to stay in the kitchen for 100 days.

706
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Yes.

707
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
Wait.

708
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,320
Prince Chen.

709
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Your Highness.

710
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
This way, please.

711
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Your Highness.

712
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Look at the arrangement here.

713
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
If there's anything fishy,

714
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
I'll give you the plan right away.

715
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
The store is crowded with tourists.

716
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
It's kind of fun to use.

717
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
But it depends on the price.

718
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
As long as the price is affordable,

719
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
I'll take care of it.

720
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
The price is affordable.

721
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,640
I like it here.

722
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,000
Please don't worry.

723
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm fine with the place I live now.

724
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,600
This is not where I should live.

725
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,240
Your Highness.

726
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
You can live here if you send me a message.

727
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Don't forget.

728
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,560
This is Yongning Palace.

729
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,160
Think about it.

730
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,280
Is there any business with His Majesty?

731
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,800
Master, you're well-known.

732
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,480
The most favored concubines in the Ming Dynasty

733
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,560
have lived here.

734
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,520
Don't you understand

735
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,920
His Majesty's love for you?

736
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,640
Yes.

737
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,840
The Imperial Consort of the Grand Emperor

738
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,880
has lived here.

739
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,960
The Noble Consort of the late Emperor

740
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,000
has lived here.

741
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,320
They're all concubines.

742
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,920
Yes.

743
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,320
Now you understand.

744
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
But where are they now?

745
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,400
Your Highness.

746
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,840
Your Highness.

747
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,160
Let's go.

748
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,600
Your Highness.

749
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,560
His Majesty heard that

750
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,320
there's an old man in Guangzhou

751
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,240
who has been playing the flute for a long time.

752
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,280
They hung the lanterns high up.

753
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,640
This is a long-term blessing.

754
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,360
It was the late night of the late game.

755
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,720
His Majesty wanted to invite you to see it.

756
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,000
It's a pity that it's too late.

757
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,880
So he's here to see it.

758
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,280
Your Majesty, how are you?

759
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,320
I'm not feeling well.

760
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,120
Eunuch Chen.

761
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,120
It's late.

762
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,000
You can't disturb His Majesty.

763
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
I'll go to see him tomorrow morning.

764
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,760
A'Jing, let's go.

765
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,240
Your Highness.

766
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,040
Eunuch Chen.

767
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,800
You...

768
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,160
Eunuch Chen.

769
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,640
Did you see anyone?

770
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,200
Have you made a wish?

771
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,400
I made an assumption.

772
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,440
We shouldn't talk about it in person.

773
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,560
If you tell me all this,

774
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,240
I'll force it to his Majesty again.

775
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,920
Yes.

776
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,920
His Majesty deliberately pass away

777
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,800
but it's confirmed.

778
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,120
You know

779
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,240
why did I set foot in the palace?

780
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,160
Your Majesty asked me

781
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,520
to send eles to hurt into their stay

782
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,320
in his parfois.

783
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Go get a new suit.

784
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
You're back.

785
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Yes.

786
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Your Majesty,

787
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
I've sent the letter.

788
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
Who can't be disturbed by such deep love?

789
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
If Your Highness sees it,

790
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
she'll be in trouble.

791
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Am I not going to punish you

792
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
for being a concubine?

793
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
What's wrong with learning to be a bad student?

794
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Learning to play the game of the garden?

795
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Your Majesty.

796
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Your Majesty.

797
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
I'm afraid that this person

798
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,800
is waiting for you.

799
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,800
You are...

800
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
I want to be alone and calm.

801
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,800
Leave.

802
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Yes.

803
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,800
You're in charge of the garden.

804
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
Why do you leave

805
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,800
such a difficult job to me?

806
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
I've lost 40 accounts.

807
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
I've been in the business for a long time.

808
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
I'm lying down.

809
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,800
I'm sorry.

810
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
I'm sorry.

811
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,800
I thought...
