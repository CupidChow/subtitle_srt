1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
all in one

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the game is a little bit complicated

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All in one

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What are you doing?

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I was scared

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,480
I put my words on the lock

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,000
which was clearly placed here

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,840
I'm not seeing you anymore.

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,520
I'm here to catch you.

28
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,320
You go down.

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,880
Go down.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,560
Let me go.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,800
Today,

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm going to visit Fan Zheng.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll use the flower-colored cold plate

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
to re-review the scenery.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,240
You know my You Le Mei.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Milk tea, I love You Le Mei.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,860
Haoheng Cl revision

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,680
Lian타, why?

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,240
Su Yuhua!

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,160
Can't you agree?

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,560
You're here for it.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,520
Ziping.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,760
Or you were going to let me write you a new story?

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,080
If you want pitying someone, you have to say it.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,560
Ziping.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,040
Don't talk.

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Don't talk.

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
At that time, Her Highness the Empress was going to be separated.

49
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
There must be a problem with this.

50
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Tell me.

51
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
What did you do?

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
What did you do?

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,040
The Demon Realm loves to worship the Buddha.

54
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
But in the real internet,

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
there are people,

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
but there is no monk.

57
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
A monk?

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
That monk?

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
The Emperor of the Crown Prince

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
used to be a monk in the royal family.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
I hate people who hang their hair and teeth

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
on their lips.

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
In the capital,

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
if anyone dares to lie to others,

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
the consequences will be dire.

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
But now that the time has passed,

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
there are very few people in the palace

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
who remember this opportunity.

69
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
But Her Highness the Empress is so wise.

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
She will always make you win.

71
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
So you misunderstood me.

72
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Su Yuehua,

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
they are in their own house.

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Who told you to put a good end to that person?

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
You must put a good end to it.

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Ziping.

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
It's just a little trick.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,040
I won today's competition.

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Yuehua,

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
do you think

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
the real internet map

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
is really the most difficult place

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
to be in the mirror in the portrait?

84
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Is it not?

85
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
The small size of the internet map

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
is indeed the most delicate flower in the world.

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
It's a pity that the cold season

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
is full of cold wind and wind.

89
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
All the ingredients

90
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
will become colder and colder.

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
The function of the closed-off is far greater than practical.

92
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
I had already thought about it.

93
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
The method of carving flowers and bees

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
in the whole of Hu Guang.

95
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Make all the ingredients

96
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
into bees

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
and make them more expensive.

98
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
It's a pity.

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
I'll take you away.

100
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
I can think of

101
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
something you would never have thought of.

102
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Because you put all your thoughts

103
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,040
on the magic of the Xuanyao skill.

104
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
But you forgot

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
the final ingredient.

106
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
The internet map

107
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
is very beautiful.

108
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
If you use this talent

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
to make a move,

110
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
then you will be

111
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
really in trouble.

112
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Let's go.

113
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Zijin, don't bother him.

114
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
You can't see it?

115
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
I can't see it.

116
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
You can't see it?

117
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
No.

118
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
No.

119
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
No.

120
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
No.

121
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
No.

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
No.

123
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
No.

124
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
No.

125
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
No.

126
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
No.

127
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
No.

128
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
No.

129
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
You are so mean.

130
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Stop it.

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
The painter who sent the painting

132
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
hasn't seen it yet.

133
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
He called it limited.

134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
But it's interesting that you came to me.

135
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
You lost once.

136
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Why are you so good at it?

137
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,040
He has never been so serious.

138
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
What happened?

139
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,040
The top floor of the city is clear.

140
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,040
The forest is clear and the trees are clear.

141
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,040
The west mountain is crisp and the sea is cold.

142
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,040
The south is clear and the north is clear.

143
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
The red jade forest is west.

144
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,040
The yellow cloud is long and the green is blue.

145
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,040
The sky is clear and the green is blue.

146
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,040
The wood is red and the leaves are red.

147
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
What do you think?

148
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
It's delicious.

149
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
It's delicious.

150
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Your Highness,

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,040
there was a beauty in the building last night.

152
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
What are you looking at?

153
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
A beauty?

154
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
What are you looking at?

155
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Where is the beauty of the night?

156
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
It's similar to a ghost.

157
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
It looks like someone.

158
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
It's a bit wild.

159
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
But it's not as old as the letter.

160
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
It's not as small as the letter.

161
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Yes.

162
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
No.

163
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
I deserve to die.

165
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
I deserve to die.

166
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
I deserve to die.

167
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
I deserve to die.

168
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Your Highness.

169
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
Your Highness.

170
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Your Majesty.

171
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Your Majesty.

172
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Your Majesty.

173
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Your Highness.

174
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,080
Please forgive me.

175
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Kunning Palace sent a decree just now.

176
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,840
From now on,

177
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,120
you're no longer the top of the Shangshui Bureau.

178
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,600
Hu Shangsheng,

179
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,400
please allow me

180
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,720
to have the second chance to compete.

181
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,480
You've lost the first game.

182
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
How dare you still dare to be so careless?

183
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,880
Get out of here.

184
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,480
What if you lose the second game?

185
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,680
Only I can defeat myself.

186
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,160
What kind of person is he?

187
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,720
He's not worth mentioning.

188
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,160
I'm the one who...

189
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
I can give you the last chance.

190
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,080
But if you lose this time,

191
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,560
you'll never leave Shangshu Bureau.

192
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,520
Yes.

193
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Ha...

194
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,480
That stabbing with the sword is so shocking.

195
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,400
You see.

196
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,880
There's a clear rounds of experiment

197
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,400
in that mountain and that water.

198
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,520
After the emperor was rid of Su,

199
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,280
she wouldn't turn around.

200
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
What a pity.

201
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,760
Her Majesty is for imagination to help Hu Shangwei.

202
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,280
of course they don't know how how to make justice.

203
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,920
Is thatتي Secret App激씨?

204
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
You all know

205
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,520
how hard she is to make his幕 Emerald露

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,080
in a single movement.

207
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
You'll be astonished.

208
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,540
I don't have the angriest

209
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,440
各位.

210
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
All the Od lives

211
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
in the divine jade of Wang posters

212
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,320
and curtains of the Jon family.

213
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,140
They are just

214
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,600
identical with each other.

215
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,540
said will return to luminaries.

216
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,980
Do you mean,

217
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,100
Duke Xia was invited to appeal to talk betweená

218
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,420
keeping in bed with you.,

219
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,780
the wife and fulfill the royal Crown Prince's wish,

220
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,780
or will it be a tongue in the II Bureau

221
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,920
and will be in Westernрал...

222
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,480
Freeze your hair optimistically.

223
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,120
Hurry up and far away.

224
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,680
My dear,

225
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
the golden Krispy Kreme I just brought

226
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,680
ter as I knew you were afraid to smell too much

227
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,800
and ordered

228
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
very lightly toですね

229
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,600
Please taste it

230
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,960
while it's flip-floping.

231
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,880
It's black threads that I just offered to you.

232
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,720
Do you have any other plans?

233
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm not free.

234
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,560
I'll stay with you.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,640
Is that okay?

236
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,200
When I was a late emperor,

237
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
I didn't take you to the north to hunt.

238
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,800
I forced you to write a letter.

239
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,720
I couldn't read the letter.

240
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,280
I couldn't even see you.

241
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Now that you have the time,

242
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm happy.

243
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
But my father hasn't been here for a long time.

244
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I'm bored of the government affairs.

245
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,840
As a ruler,

246
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,080
you should take more responsibility for him.

247
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,800
Then he should let me help him.

248
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,960
Your Highness, it's time to cool down.

249
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,680
I'm coming.

250
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,120
Crown Princess Consort.

251
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
His Highness...

252
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,760
It seems that he has forgotten

253
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,360
everything in the past.

254
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,800
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,800
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,800
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,800
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,840
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,840
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,840
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,840
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,840
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,840
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,840
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,840
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,840
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,840
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,840
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,840
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,840
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,840
I'm sorry.

281
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,840
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,840
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,800
Your Highness.

285
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,800
Your Highness.

286
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,600
It...

287
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,080
Why're you inflamed

288
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,640
when the answer is not Design.

289
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,680
Come, look!

290
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,920
Come backward and make yourself見如今二龜

291
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,580
Your Highness, look!

292
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,740
Your Highness!

293
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,720
Your Highness,

294
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,240
Your Majesty, here you are.

295
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,600
Eldest Brother.

296
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,420
Your Highness.

297
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,280
Didn't you get ill, my Emperor?

298
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,000
Theโisea is here.

299
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,420
Send food to public.

300
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,220
Hurry.

301
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,460
Yes.

302
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,800
Theโisea.

303
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,960
Theโisea is here.

304
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,820
I will explain them to your Majesty.

305
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,100
Don't let everyone know that

306
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,200
theโisea is here.

307
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,940
no pity.

308
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,140
Before I let you know that

309
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,180
theโisea in the tomb,

310
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,840
is really good looking.

311
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,140
Okay?

312
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes.

313
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,720
Father.

314
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

315
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,160
Thank you.

316
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

317
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Hurry.

318
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This way.

319
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Come.

320
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This way.

321
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Be gentle.

322
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't make a fuss about the price.

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Eunuch Xiao.

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The noble man has a beautiful voice.

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But he's so beautiful.

326
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
How can he hear it?

327
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're a good boy.

328
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Why should you go?

329
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Eunuch Zhao.

330
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You can let them do these things.

331
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You can let them do it.

332
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You can do it yourself.

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
His Majesty came to the Western Courtyard last time.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He ate some cold food.

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And then it was cold.

336
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then he got sick.

337
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So the empress asked me to come here

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
to tell you all about it.

339
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
These wild animals must be kept out of the wild.

340
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't worry, Eunuch Zhao.

341
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I understand.

342
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Then you two go ahead.

343
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Your Majesty.

344
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Your Majesty.

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Your Majesty.

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You're a good girl.

347
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Your Majesty, I heard your words.

348
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The first one to come here.

349
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You really have a good sense of honor.

350
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Don't send me things here anymore.

351
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm not going to do anything.

352
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Your Majesty, please be careful.

353
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm not in the mood for this.

354
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm here to welcome you all.

355
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Then, Prince Zhao came.

356
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We haven't been together for a long time.

357
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We've been together for a long time.

358
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I hope you can come here this year.

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
His Majesty has come to the Western Courtyard

360
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
to increase the number of officials.

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm so grateful

362
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
that I'm here to thank you.

363
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm here to thank you.

364
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We're brothers.

365
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We don't need to be polite.

366
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Come, sit.

367
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

368
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Ah Shan.

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Come here.

370
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
When you're done with the invitation

371
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
that I sent you,

372
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll take you to the camp, okay?

373
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Really?

374
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Prince Wei has been very close to you

375
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
since he was a child.

376
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Very close.

377
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The person I like the most in the world is my brother.

378
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Brother Wang.

379
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Although the Crown Prince is young,

380
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
he is very kind and kind.

381
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He is kind and kind.

382
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Even Prince Wei is so close to him.

383
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
No wonder father always tells us

384
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
that this is the day of the throne.

385
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes.

386
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I usually care about the people's hardships.

387
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The court is carefree.

388
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You are all loyal officials of the late emperor.

389
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You are the best of the country.

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I have the evidence in the future.

391
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I hope you can take out

392
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
this mysterious seal

393
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
and tell me the truth.

394
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I will take it.

395
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'll give you this seal

396
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
to tell you the truth.

397
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The person I like the most is Feng Cheng.

398
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The person I like the most is Zhen Hua.

399
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The person I like the most is Shi Hua.

400
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The person I like the most is Li Hua.

401
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

402
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Aixing.

403
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What's your opinion?

404
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Your Majesty is wise and honest.

405
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I can't say anything.

406
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Zhong Aixing.

407
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's good that father can say that.

408
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But it's hard to relax today.

409
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Why don't you take out the evidence?

410
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Wait for them to take good care of it.

411
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And then think about father's plan.

412
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Your Highness is right.

413
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Please allow me to think about it.

414
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I have registered the case.

415
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Your Highness asked for the order.

416
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But until today,

417
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I have no choice but to take out the evidence.

418
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
All right.

419
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
All right.

420
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Everyone, please rise.

421
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

422
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Your Majesty.

423
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
The fish pieces of this season are so delicious.

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Father, the fish pieces are delicious.

425
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But it's a new thing.

426
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It's not cold.

427
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
It's a bit cold.

428
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Please take it out.

429
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Don't eat too much oil.

430
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
If you get sick,

431
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
why do you go to the camp with me?

432
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Brother, isn't it delicious?

433
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Brother, this is like a bitter bitter.

434
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It's delicious.

435
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000

436
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000

437
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yes, sir.

438
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The Ferrari workers asked you to follow me here.

439
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Is this made of cold winter?

440
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,040
ivi

441
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,960
She knows how to chew well.

442
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,680
Now her muscles are so light and tender.

443
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,480
It's easier to get tender

444
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,800
when it is cooked with a cooking stove.

445
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,500
The copperovac is very useful.

446
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,220
Whooful.

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,320

I'm just a cook.

457
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Brother, you're so good today.

458
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
You don't look good.

459
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
How did you get punished for running away?

460
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Did I?

461
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
You're wrong.

462
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
What is it about?

463
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
What are you talking about?

464
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Isn't it about the order from the Meng family to take you there?

465
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
The Meng family?

466
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
They're serving His Majesty in the kitchen.

467
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,760
They're here to serve the people who are in the royal family.

468
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Look, your shoes are full of mud.

469
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
They're also served in front of His Majesty.

470
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
Come on!

471
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Someone's coming!

472
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
There's a person!

473
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
Someone's coming!

474
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
There's another person.

475
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
There's a black mole.

476
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
He's too small to be seen.

477
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
He's gone that way.

478
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Go after him.

479
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Yes.

480
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Let's go.

481
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Let's go.

482
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Let's go.

483
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Let's go.

484
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Let's go.

485
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Let's go.

486
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Let's go.

487
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Let's go.

488
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
What did I say?

489
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
No matter how you retreat,

490
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
they still can't tolerate you.

491
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Aren't they coming now?

492
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Your Majesty.

493
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

494
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
How can I thank you?

495
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Blood.

496
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
The more you wipe, the more you'll see.

497
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,760
Can you still see it now?

498
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Hurry up.

499
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Hurry up.

500
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
What's wrong, Xiaoshan?

501
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Let me see.

502
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
It's moving.

503
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Let me see.

504
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Xiaoshan.

505
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Xiaoshan.

506
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
Don't come any closer.

507
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Xiaoshan.

508
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Xiaoshan.

509
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Get up.

510
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Your Majesty.

511
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
Xiaoshan.

512
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Xiaoshan.

513
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Xiaoshan.

514
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Xiaoshan.

515
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Go to the imperial doctor.

516
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Yes.

517
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Xiaoshan.

518
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
The imperial doctor is in the Western Courtyard.

519
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
Ask anyone to come in.

520
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Yes.

521
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Your Majesty.

522
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Is there any meaning to being thrown out?

523
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
No.

524
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
His Highness is fine just now.

525
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
What's wrong with him?

526
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
It's the Lu Jiao Cai.

527
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Your Majesty.

528
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,760
It must be Lu Jiao Cai's fault.

529
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
Who told you to talk nonsense?

530
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
Lu Jiao Cai is in the mountain.

531
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,760
He can't let the snake poison him.

532
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,760
He needs to use it after the soup is boiled.

533
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
Now, His Highness is in trouble.

534
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,760
I'm afraid they've lost this game.

535
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
Your Majesty.

536
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
Be careful when you're in the mountain.

537
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,760
You won't make such a big mistake.

538
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Or should we ask the imperial doctor

539
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
to give His Highness the cure?

540
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
All snakes and snakes have escaped.

541
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Take them down.

542
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Who made the Lu Jiao Cai today?

543
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
They did.

544
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
What happened?

545
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Take him away.

546
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
You guys, I...

547
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Go.

548
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Why are you arresting them?

549
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
What did I do?

550
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Let go of me.

551
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Let go of me.

552
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
What the hell are we doing?

553
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
Let go of me.

554
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
What's going on?

555
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
Hurry up.

556
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Sister.

557
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
I can't save him.

558
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
I can't save him.

559
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
What happened?

560
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Brother.

561
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
I'm sorry.

562
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
I'll go back to the capital.

563
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
I'll go back now.

565
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,760
Xuhua.

566
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Xuhua.

567
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Xuhua.

568
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
Xuhua is a genius.

569
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
A genius?

570
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
Xuhua.

571
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Xuhua.

572
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Xuhua.

573
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
Xuhua.

574
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Xuhua.

575
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,760
Xuhua.

576
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,360
by Qiseeni, Ziping and me.

577
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,960
Plus, you know to escape from death

578
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,600
and trouble other people,

579
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
so you're certainly

580
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,320
someone who can work ahend all day.

581
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,040
Looking at our mercy,

582
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,920
for your right to honor your�ns,

583
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,720
how's it going to be as a luc noble

584
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,120
...and being called a ngus?

585
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,200
And you're a ravener

586
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,720
deciding what to do now?

587
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,240
So what's there to benefit you?

588
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,920
dn 테 con't's,

589
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,960
so we're in big trouble now.

590
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,660
I'll take the responsibility

591
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,700
and absorb Qioseni back to my power.

592
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,760
You don't need to be a little bit cautious.

593
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,240
But the Imperial Guards

594
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,360
haven't found any problems

595
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,640
with other food.

596
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,760
How can you...

597
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,840
You're so weak.

598
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,080
You're so weak.

599
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,760
Who can guarantee

600
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,600
that the enemy used by Lord Wei is not a problem?

601
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,360
Yue Huan.

602
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
You've been in the kitchen all the time.

603
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,200
You should see it with your own eyes.

604
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,760
All the food

605
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,400
are poisoned by green beans.

606
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,880
I didn't see anything.

607
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,880
Yue Huan.

608
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,920
Only Yin Ziping and Fang Hanying

609
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,760
are on the food plate.

610
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,880
You're so desperate.

611
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,320
But don't forget

612
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,600
that you'll be safe without the dream.

613
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,320
If you don't share the burden of the food,

614
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,320
I'll be innocent.

615
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,400
Yue Huan.

616
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,240
What's wrong with me?

617
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,480
Why not?

618
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm using my strength

619
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,160
to make what was written here since birth.

620
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,480
You don't think

621
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,320
I was the one who killed Xingshuang in the food, right?

622
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,360
It was their specific intention

623
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,060
to surface with Brother Zheng's great love.

624
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,680
This is Lord Tianyang's.

625
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,120
With the autopsy report,

626
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,320
King of Wei really

627
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,520
Prince Wei suddenly got engaged after he entered the court.

628
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,360
How could they escape from the trouble?

629
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,360
Yuehua,

630
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,520
you must know that

631
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,160
this is not a man's will.

632
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,600
Everything is a heaven's will.

633
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,600
What we did

634
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,800
is just to stand by and watch.

635
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,040
Do you understand?

636
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,200
Yes.

637
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,880
Your Highness,

638
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,800
Prince Wei is sick...

639
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,480
Dai Yuanpan,

640
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,800
the palace is well-off.

641
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,240
My son is healthy before he was born.

642
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,040
He only ate poisonous food.

643
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:44,840
Your Highness,

644
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,680
I dare not say anything.

645
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,120
It's not time to pursue the illness.

646
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,160
The most important thing is to cure Prince Wei.

647
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,440
This is Bh Ctrl ми começara.

648
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,000
Miss Yao.

649
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,680
Changqing.

650
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,880
I have학東西 business community.

651
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,560
Prince Wei died of a mild illness.

652
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,200
His Majesty hurt himself.

653
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,880
There he was on the elsewhere in the village.

654
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,760
But he can't find out the causeeraimament well.

655
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,840
Was he feeling every danger?

656
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,920
Please do not wait.

657
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,640
I want to ask Noble Consort.

658
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,440
I really have something to say.

659
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,480
Now that you're seriously ill,

660
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,400
you're in a deep depression.

661
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,200
Don't say you can't see her.

662
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,680
Even if you see her,

663
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,160
she'll be in a deep depression

664
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,640
in the next 20 days.

665
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,480
Changqing,

666
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,720
tell me,

667
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,600
what kind of symptoms do you have?

668
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,720
How can I know?

669
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,080
Go away.

670
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,240
Not only in the dream,

671
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,680
but also in the forest,

672
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,480
and in the light of the road.

673
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,600
The person who is involved in this matter

674
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,720
will be implicated.

675
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,200
You can't stand it anymore.

676
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
You've been here for two hours.

677
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,040
You've already been in a deep depression.

678
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,400
Go back.

679
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,680
Let's go.

680
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,320

681
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Let's go.

682

Your Highness has taken theでしょう goblet's alert except to sir.

684
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,600
It is too young now.

685
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,000
Now we face Dark Spell Treasurer,

686
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,040
White Welcome Object.

687
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,840
It's so difficult to protect.

688
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,880
Your Majesty.

689
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,640
He's got back wounds.

690
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,960
That's why it is particularly foul.

691
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,880
Your Majesty.

692
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,960
from lovevin thelara-joys?

693
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,120
Your Majesty.

694
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,240

He's� Всемerin niches medicine.

696
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
How will he

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,440
attain that level in this world?

698
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,600
If I across this level,

699
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,640
it will be a relief!

700
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:25,880
Your Majesty.

701
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
The emperor has unanç enthusiasts.

Please go on.

703
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,680
Get her back by the point.

704
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,520
Yes.

705
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:35,880
Your Majesty,

706
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,200
do you think

707
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,760
that Ah Shan is so stubborn

708
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,040
that he suddenly got poisoned?

709
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,480
I'm sure someone

710
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,960
hates me

711
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,680
and wants to kill Ah Shan.

712
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,640
Your Highness,

713
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:58,720
His Majesty said

714
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,920
that you should go back first.

715
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,520
It's good to bring Prince Wei back.

716
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,360
But...

717
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,200
Let's go.

718
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,120
Let's go.

719
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,960

Imperial page-of-ée.

729
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,920
Then, I'll take the responsibility.

730
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,720
How dare you!

731
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,920
How dare you come to the empress's tent!

732
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,920
She won't leave!

733
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
Your Highness the Empress.

734
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,920
There's a grudge in the imperial court.

735
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,920
Please allow the Empress to be in a grudge.

736
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,920
Guards, take her away.

737
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,920
Your Highness,

738
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,920
the Crown Prince and the Emperor are from the Imperial Guards.

739
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,920
They allow the grudges to be in a grudge.

740
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
They laugh at the Empress.

741
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,920
They laugh at the Empress.

742
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,920
They all laugh at the court.

743
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,920
They are against the imperial court.

744
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
But now,

745
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
the grudges are in front of the Empress.

746
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,920
How could Her Highness not care about the matter?

747
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:01,920
She wouldn't even shut her mouth.

748
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Your Highness the Empress.

749
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
Wait.

750
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,920
Your Highness the Empress.

751
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
The dream was lost.

752
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
It was a big mistake.

753
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
You're still here for her?

754
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Take her away.

755
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
Hu Shaoshi.

756
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,920
You're not allowed to be in front of the Empress.

757
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
There's no grudge.

758
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,920
Why don't you let me be in front of her?

759
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,920
Take her away.

760
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,920
Hu Shaoshi.

761
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Your Highness the Empress.

762
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
I don't want to hear this woman's words.

763
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,920
She's a member of the Meng family.

764
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,920
She'll be in charge of the whole plan to help her.

765
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,920
I'll send her to the Palace to think about it.

766
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,920
She's filial to the Emperor.

767
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,920
She mentioned the Empress who laughed at the Empress.

768
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,920
If she doesn't listen to her,

769
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,920
I won't be able to help her.

770
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,920
Your Highness,

771
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
the Emperor has already said that

772
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,920
there are many grudges and secret lovers.

773
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,920
They're all in the harem.

774
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
In the harem,

775
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,920
people don't just have to be in the harem

776
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
to be in the harem.

777
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,920
How can they be trusted?

778
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Besides, this person is in the harem

779
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,920
and is in charge of the phoenix price.

780
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
He's a palace maid.

781
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
In charge of the phoenix price?

782
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,920
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

783
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
I only ask for the Empress to be in the harem.

784
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:11,920
You must think about it.

785
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:13,920
If the punishment is done,

786
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,920
it's all in the harem.

787
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,920
By then,

788
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
I'll send you to the Palace to think about it.

789
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
I beg the Empress to grant my wish.

790
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,920
Your Highness.

791
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Okay.

792
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
I'll grant your wish.

793
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,920
I'll send you to the Palace to think about it.

794
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,920
I'll send you to the Palace to think about it.

795
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,920
I thought...
