Episode 19

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is the crab king from Huangyu Geng.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I can't eat crabs since I was a child, but I have a lot of them.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The last time I asked Noble Consort Gui about this reason,

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I thought I would never be able to eat it after I got married and couldn't eat crabs.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who said you would stay and eat them?

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Go back now. Don't even think about eating it.

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm the one who can do it.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm the one who can do it.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Free-Faith.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The King of the Clouds

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My lord, Noble Consort Gui is here.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm looking at it.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The color of the Yuan is not right.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You have to be careful.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Although the emperor is a threat, he is not a threat to the cold.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,100
He is期生食繁資,

24
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:57,520
Traitor

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Your majesty.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,640
I wanted to ask you something.

27
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,600
Please go back with Your Majesty.

28
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,560
He Jianshundeeshe was from Shandong.

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,000
What about the important national error?

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:13,960
Is that so?

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,440
Your Majesty,

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,840
he was born with no fever and died from guqin for seven months.

33
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,920
The fallfall period is the worst.

34
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
It has not been the time for him.

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
Although He Jianshundeeshe Richard had형icels,

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,560
you are likely to lose it.

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,480
He had handed over the capital,

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,400
so he mastered the Spring Palace system.

39
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,680
He was said to have been under the任 of the emperor.

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,280
He was 조实习创國的人.

41
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,800
Therefore, he is now experienced for the company

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:57,620
All the

43
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,460
Is it true?

44
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,860
Ieted my words.

45
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,660
Remett to your opinion.

46
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,340
He had remains in evenples and looks out for people.

47
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,700
There was hate even instead.

48
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,260
Thehone and coins

49
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,460
has been sold alms

50
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,620
to many edicts in the court.

51
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,180
Many clashes have been messing up.

52
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,660
We clean up the town and have no place

53
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,260
to hide yourself.

54
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,260
Shen Yu was around at that time.

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,200
Sing it to me.

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,100
Pass it to me.

57
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,260
Sing it to您.

58
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,360
Very well.

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,440
Go teach her a lesson yet.

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,280
Come home.

61
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,260
It is much drag out of the eye.

62
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,260
Come and play hit first.

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,120
literature play

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,920
!!!

65
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,680
Just wait.

66
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,860
What is it?

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Lesson three.

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,220
A...

69
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,100
A..

70
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,420
Enlarge

71
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,860
Judging by the fire 11 evolve,

72
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,020
he has only one way to lose.

73
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,060
Where are the pendants?

74
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,180
They look far better than hong disperse.

75
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,180
He wanted

76
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,300
all of them to make up instead of him.

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,580
None of them

78
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,500
survived.

79
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,140
We have to

80
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,660
tell them to give through the Ministry 느낌이

81
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,060

82
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,420
LD chief.

83
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,820
I'll go to the hospital.

84
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,020
I'll go to the hospital.

85
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,220
I'll go to the hospital.

86
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,620
I'll go to the hospital.

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,220
I'll go to the hospital.

95
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,620
I'll go to the hospital.

96
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,220
I'll go to the hospital.

97
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,820
I'll go to the hospital.

98
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,420
I'll go to the hospital.

99
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,820
I'll go to the hospital.

100
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,220
I'll go to the hospital.

101
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,020

102
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
I'll go to the hospital.

103
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,020
I'll go to the hospital.

104
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,420
I'll go to the hospital.

105
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,820
I'll go to the hospital.

106
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,420
I'll go to the hospital.

107
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,220
I'll go to the hospital.

108
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,620
I'll go to the hospital.

109
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,020
I'll go to the hospital.

110
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,620
Your Highness,

111
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,420
I treated you as your concubine.

112
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,420
But now, we have passed the timing.

113
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,420
We needn't worry so much.

114
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,620
Just need to say goodbye to me in front of His Majesty.

115
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,940
Lord Liu

116
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,620
did I disappoint you

117
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,860
or

118
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,740
were you very拜導 to Your Majesty?

119
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,480
Theuciones Yong Yang

120
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,340
Chen Yang

121
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,540
presumably

122
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,600
commented on the title

123
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,180
Emperor's하기

124
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,820
was perseverated

125
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,780
and hard to speak

126
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,940
But now

127
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,060
he didn't proliferate

128
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,660
Minister Li pours flowing

129
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,300
has no forgiveness

130
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,060
and is harder to handle

131
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,460
I'm just a part of Fengming's business.

132
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,460
I'm just a part of Fengming's business.

133
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,460
What's wrong with that?

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
Lord You, please be quiet.

135
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,860
The words you just said

136
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,460
make the others listen.

137
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
I thought you were

138
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
taking the position of the Emperor of the Taizong.

139
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
What did you hear?

140
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,660
As we heard,

141
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
you just said that

142
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,660
the Emperor of the Taizong

143
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
was just determined and independent.

144
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,260
His Majesty is now a weak and weak person.

145
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,660
He's never been a weak person.

146
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,260
He's always been a weak and weak person.

147
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,060
As the Emperor of the Taizong,

148
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,860
His Majesty will trust me.

149
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,260
As for Noble Consort,

150
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,260
you should return to your Yongning Palace

151
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,460
and take care of your Yan.

152
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,260
Lord You, please remember what I said today.

153
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
Remember,

154
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,860
what His Majesty needs

155
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,260
is to understand your suffering.

156
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,060
Let's go.

157
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,460
This Noble Consort

158
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,860
is deliberately making things difficult for you.

159
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,260
Fu Jiang.

160
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,860
Yes?

161
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,920
Mr. Jin,

162
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,660
help me please.

163
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,660
Thanks, your Highness.

164
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,060
What are you doing?

165
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Since last July, the rain has been falling.

166
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,060
The wheat in the field has already been crying.

167
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,060
The people are hungry and their stomachs are not full.

168
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,060
Why did the Ministry of Justice send people to buy the salt?

169
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,060
What salt needs to be so urgent?

170
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,060
Shaoyuan, do you know about this?

171
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,060
Your Majesty, the salt that the Ministry of Justice sent people to buy

172
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,060
is to repair the spiritual power of the ancestors.

173
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Spiritual power?

174
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
Listen to them and make excuses.

175
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,060
The people of Shandong are not the people of the ancestors.

176
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
Seeing them live so hard,

177
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,060
the ancestors thought they would be too worried.

178
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Chuan Zhi, stop all the buying.

179
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,060
If you dare to disturb the people again,

180
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,060
I'll kill them first.

181
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
Yes, Your Majesty.

182
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,060
Do you still have many places to do this?

183
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,060
You didn't tell me before you came.

184
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,060
You didn't tell me before.

185
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Your Majesty.

186
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,060
Forget it.

187
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,060
Send the Ministry of Justice to the palace immediately.

188
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Yes.

189
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,060
Greetings, Your Majesty and Noble Consort.

190
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,060
Yin Si Shan, not Shan.

191
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Yes.

192
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,060
Your Majesty, please have some food.

193
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,060
Didn't Your Majesty smell any fragrance?

194
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,060
It's better not to smell it.

195
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
Good.

196
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,060
It's good to have a good mind and calm down.

197
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,060
Yin Si Shan,

198
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,060
prepare tea for His Majesty tomorrow.

199
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Add some honey.

200
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,060
It's not easy to get angry when His Majesty drinks it.

201
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
Yes.

202
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,060
The fragrance is really good for your health.

203
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
But this is my fault for being so envious.

204
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Otherwise, I can also give it back to His Majesty.

205
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,060
When did you decide to give it back?

206
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,060
It was the eldest daughter of the minister of justice,

207
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
and I was able to decide last year.

208
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
It's the auspicious day of June this year.

209
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,060
This dish seems to be very familiar.

210
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,060
This is the crab king of the Yellow Fish House.

211
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
I can't eat crab since I was a child, but I'm very greedy.

212
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,060
The last time I asked Noble Consort, it was this.

213
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,060
After I went back, I couldn't smell the crab scent.

214
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
I thought I couldn't eat it anymore.

215
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,060
My Lord, this dish's secret ingredient is not the chicken yolk,

216
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,060
but the salt and the salt of the rice soup.

217
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
The salt and the salt are the same.

218
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,060
Who said you'd stay and eat it?

219
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,060
Go back now.

220
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Don't even want to eat it.

221
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:26,060
Consort Shu

222
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,060
this soup is for Your Highness massacred you.

223
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,020
Her Highness's hair and hair are all in the air.

224
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,500
But this illness

225
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,180
has completely affected Her Highness's appetite.

226
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,780
The food she loved the most

227
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,700
was not enough to touch it.

228
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,260
He Shu!

229
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,460
Lady Yin,

230
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,420
Her Highness the Empress asked me to

231
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,500
prepare the food for you.

232
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,340
We're just worried about your health.

233
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,500
If you need my help,

234
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,660
you can just tell me.

235
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,060
Lady Yin,

236
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,780
you really want to investigate this matter?

237
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,580
I'm not trying to interfere.

238
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,100
It's just...

239
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,660
No need.

240
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,460
I'll change all the blankets.

241
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,340
Follow me.

242
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,060
Thisattering is a serious crisis.

243
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,020
The Imperial H several courthouse

244
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,220
is going to inform the Empress Dowager.

245
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,340
With the imperial regents's instructions,

246
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,940
it's not a moment when

247
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
anyone can reveal

248
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,100
my relationship with Her Highness?

249
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,980
But Her Highness the annual autumn festival

250
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,000
is not through anything

251
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,440
and there are slight Pacemex adventure

252
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,540
that'll humility the Emperor염

253
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,740
and finish the sl propagatingwide had.

254
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
After all, the first steps

255
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,860
have survived on the entire folktales.

256
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,500
No need for your relief.

257
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,420
But Her Highness her Highness

258
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,860
Her Majesty will set out to visit the palace soon.

259
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,460
Since we've been together,

260
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,060
how long will it take to hide it?

261
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,140
It's my fault.

262
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,700
Her Highness doesn't have a appetite.

263
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,020
It's not good enough to eat.

264
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,580
I'll keep changing.

265
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,700
I'm sure Her Highness will eat well.

266
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,460
Your Majesty.

267
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,260
This is the wet fish from Nanjing.

268
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,420
It's just arrived.

269
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,420
His Majesty asked me to bring it to you.

270
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,380
Where's His Majesty?

271
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,060
His Majesty invited Lord Yang

272
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,220
to make a poem at the Cultural Hall.

273
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,260
When the banquet is over,

274
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,220
he'll be here soon.

275
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,940
Have you read it?

276
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,060
Your Highness, sit down and talk.

277
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,500
I've sent you back to Venerable ZhengFl witnessed out they have done

278
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
for the New!</or!

279
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,140
So long!

280
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,660
I'll help you bear with Lord Yang.

281
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,660
Your Highness,

282
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,060
I stopped hertable

283
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,220
withfikong for her present record.

284
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,180
Minister Meng left 160 copies in total.

285
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,820
They all used half of the list for the steamhead.

286
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,540
Can she make all grandpa's and grandpa's cards in future?

287
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,260
wow is rich in goods but does not cost hundreds times more than profound when in-laws

288
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,980
It's all talked about

289
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,220
Empress

290
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,580
It's often recommended for....

291
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,520
However,the emperor of crown prince knows it

292
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,460
Inたon attack tiyun messages

293
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,120

294
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,380
tion must send men to take可能

295
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,900
If the e meu complementary the nightmare

296
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,340
Opening the door will kill,he will beType

297
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,440
At that time,those who sneaking in

298
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,140
the men are going to do it

299
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,180
Fan Yu's determination must be strong.

300
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,140
Aren't you afraid?

301
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,900
You're joking, Your Majesty.

302
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,340
Who would dare to

303
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,300
act in the royal court?

304
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,740
Your Majesty,

305
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,980
if there's nothing else,

306
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,180
I'll take my leave.

307
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,740
Go ahead.

308
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,860
electron gravitates to classroom.

309
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,460
Just sit

310
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:31,860
Sit first.

311
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,820
After today,

312
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,300
I will keep you safe.

313
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,220
While I read this téléphone,

314
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,820
I dare notμαι

315
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,260
using a funnyquez key.

316
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,100
To express my condolences,

317
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,740
let's squeeze the battery

318
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,740
absolutely into this time.

319
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,260
When Concubine Sun was talking,

320
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,220
she heard all the crap.

321
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,780
In fact,

322
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,840
Her Lineha,

323
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,580
was just a cousin.

324
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,740
Could theショnes of nanог뼈

325
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,900
have been removed?

326
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,540
When the aussi of until dayd night

327
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,000
came,

328
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,740
old cav pretty slacked head

329
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
could kill such a girl.

330
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,500
Other than fromispiel of vice is more ac차.

331
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,720
Your Highness the Queen is right.

332
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:47,180
it was against all the rules

333
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,140
that made him come here

334
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,100
I see

335
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,020
It's just an excuse

336
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,900
Ten thousand dollars

337
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,260
Are you here for this?

338
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,220
Yes

339
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,260
I don't know how the air outside the palace is so low.

340
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,540
I hate it. What should I do?

341
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,740
The words I just said

342
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,300
is about Yuan Qi.

343
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,380
Yuan Qi is the most important happiness in front of His Majesty.

344
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,500
If he knows how to make a promise

345
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,940
and manages the official affairs in private,

346
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,380
if he doesn't know how to accept it and becomes a family member,

347
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,020
then he'll be a stranger.

348
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,740
I'm doing this not only for Yuan Qi,

349
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,740
but also to avoid His Majesty's sorrow.

350
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,900
The Empress is innocent.

351
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,860
She's been very thin lately.

352
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,420
I think

353
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,580
she won't go this time.

354
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,620
It's a big event in the middle of the night.

355
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,340
How can I be wrong?

356
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,740
Don't worry, Mother.

357
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,420
The imperial physician has said

358
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
that I'm already fully recovered.

359
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,620
I can go out as you wish.

360
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,300
Come and eat fish.

361
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,740
Thank you, Mother.

362
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,340
You can eat too.

363
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,340
Yes.

364
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,460
Mother.

365
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,900
I heard that Yong Cheng is going to build a tower.

366
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,260
His Majesty's attitude towards you

367
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,940
is also a blessing for the people.

368
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,260
It's a good thing.

369
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,460
You're so anxious to be a guest for them.

370
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,980
Do you want to take the glory?

371
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,700
The Emperor is here.

372
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,820
Mother.

373
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,140
Do you know that

374
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,500
Yong Cheng is going to

375
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,060
demolish the 2,000 people's residence for the construction of this tower?

376
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,220
Your Majesty.

377
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,700
The construction of the tower

378
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,940
was originally for the country's assistant.

379
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,620
It was also for the Empress Dowager,

380
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,220
His Majesty and the people's blessing.

381
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,940
Yong Cheng didn't wear the clothes

382
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,820
so he wanted to demolish the people's residence

383
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,780
when he was in the rural area.

384
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,460
I think

385
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,780
the people's welfare is free.

386
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,780
I don't need this kind of blessing

387
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,620
that can make the people come.

388
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,580
Who asked you to tell him

389
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,300
to be my guest?

390
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,820
I can't think of anything.

391
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,260
Please don't be angry.

392
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,100
Please don't be angry.

393
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,580
All right.

394
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,660
It's just a small matter.

395
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,780
Sit down and have a meal.

396
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,980
Your Majesty.

397
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,500
Let's eat.

398
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,380
Have a fish.

399
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:47,980
Your Majesty.

400
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
This fish is a lot.

401
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,980
Your Majesty.

402
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,420
Can I help you?

403
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,340
No need.

404
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,580
I'll do it myself.

405
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,700
Your Majesty?

406
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,820
Your Majesty.

407
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,620
how could the emperor deceive you?

408
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
You're right.

409
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,040
I have the animal's Bayonet Filec.

410
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,180
Didn't you know

411
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,660
when she came over,

412
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,980
she just had to serve me.

413
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,300
Your Highness.

414
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,240
I'll go with you today.

415
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
Since you came,

416
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,800
why don't you go and see him?

417
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,060
Yeah, just go.

418
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,740
So I've decided in the morning

419
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,260
to apply for the imperial edict

420
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,900
to avenge you.

421
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,140
Your lady,

422
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,140
please sit over there.

423
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,980
I remember you used to tell me

424
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,540
to be kind to people.

425
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,700
But now that you did evil,

426
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,380
you managed to save our people.

427
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,180
Don't see those wailed officials as customize thriving.

428
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,520
But they pretend to be fun

429
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,140
to let go of every corner of the palace.

430
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,740
I'll give you the wrong opportunity.

431
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,620
What big trouble?

432
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,620
Like the sweet seeing awak light.

433
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,300
After I cut one tea, there's only one more sound.

434
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,580
There are rallying in Enjoying the郫上鷵路,

435
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,180
and not especially you.

436
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,260
Whether it's those innocentロ I fond is also regretт as closest exp framing.

437
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,100
I'll leave it there later.

438
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,140
Will the room not be a chamber just because they are2?

439
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,020
Zhu Noblood could so neither I could get there,

440
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,580
just in case you wonder why everything could not be done in front of you.

441
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,540
As long as you're looking for me,

442
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,020
mother.

443
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,020
I heard that Her Highness Royal Mother

444
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,860
You wanted to be a royal minister before.

445
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,220
You wanted to be a person.

446
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,820
Since that's the case,

447
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,180
you should have taken care of the royal family

448
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,780
and the Empress Dowager's food.

449
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,060
Why did you ask about the matter of Kunlun Palace?

450
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,140
Because I'm the head of the royal family.

451
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,020
The Empress Dowager gave the food in Qingling Palace.

452
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,700
But the Empress Dowagerツ is having a hard time way down She Qun'erding.

453
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,020
I suspect she's still having a inspections

454
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,540
to make her experience the focus of life better and worse.

455
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,140
Ji

456
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,060
went weird.

457
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,220
Even if he gives me another命,

458
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,060
it won't be helper of the grace.

459
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,940
Since The Empress Dowager heg моя

460
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,700
to be the bud brill тем

461
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,700
let's give it a try,

462
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,940
Siping,

463
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,420
you've grown up.

464
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,540
You know how to bear responsibility

465
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,700
and care for others.

466
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,420
I was born to be a good person.

467
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,940
Being a good person is only a day to wait.

468
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,500
Okay.

469
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,100
Then wait for you to

470
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,260
tell me the good news about Her Highness the Empress.

471
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,900
Being a good person.

472
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,900
The title is so nice.

473
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,140
Call me again to hear it.

474
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,460
Yin Ziping.

475
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,660
I have different interests.

476
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,540
I took the responsibility of

477
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,260
being a good person today.

478
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,060
But you're still an若下.

479
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,740
White on Native narrative.

480
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,780
And the method to be a good person

481
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,780
is very typical to another country.

482
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,780
It's already passed 60,000 years already.

483
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,320
If you're dead to

484
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,840
Long live the emperor!

485
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,040
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

486
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,240
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

487
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,840
Your Majesty said that he would personally drink for you.

488
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:33,360
Long live the emperor!

489
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,680
Long live the emperor!

490
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,640
Your Majesty,

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,040
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

509

I'm sorry.

510
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
I'm sorry.

511
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
I'm sorry.

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I'm sorry.

513
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
I'm sorry.

514
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
I'm sorry.

515
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
I'm sorry.

516
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
I'm sorry.

517
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,720
I'm sorry.

519
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Your Majesty,

520
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,880
we're hanging out here係

521
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720

522
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Come over here.

523
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,040
Okay.

524
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,800
You should try it.

525
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,320
Here.

526
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,360
Try the soup made from our village.

527
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,000
Have a seat.

528
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,040
My lady.

529
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,640
How is the harvest this year?

530
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,520
It's great

531
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,480
to take the Empress Dowager's blessing.

532
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,880
Everything is good.

533
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,360
Good.

534
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,280
Princess Consort Xian.

535
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,920
I have to go first.

536
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,040
Bye.

537
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,400
Bye.

538
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,040
I will go then.

539
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,540
My Lord.

540
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,000
Is Empress Dowager Sister alive?

541
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,880
I'm weeding already.

542
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,440
Yes.

543
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,400
The cake sought for opportunity,

544
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,680
but it was made by Wenorlds that are families of shades.

545
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,600
Thekedine Thai,

546
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,000
you have really helped the villagers

547
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,800
survive their diarrhea.

548
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,920
Your Majesty.

549
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,040
This is tasty.

550
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,600
So soft.

551
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,240
The r kidneys from the recovering are alsoytished.

552
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,480
The sweet and spoken out of

553
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,920
the children's Mé Sephardls.

554
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,840
Your Majesty,

555
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,600
we don't need Pomelo.

556
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,860
Our son's second brother

557
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,760
is asispersive as

558
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,640
stubborn nurse.

559
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,280
Your Majesty,

560
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,280
it's not what I think.

561
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:25,940

00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,000
The queen consort Berry wants to join you.

00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,560
What brought you here?

621
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,040
Where's His Highness going?

622
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
Where will I go then?

623
00:32:59,440 --> 00:32:59,800
Nonsense.

624
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,720
Somebody.

00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,600

I'll address Qiche.

633
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,360
When we were 14 years old,

634
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,580
when we were

635
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,520
hunting with our father,

636
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,340
we put in twoaros no words to describe them.

637
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,340
However,

638
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,980
it took us eight years to go into the palace

639
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,260
and we got confused by Qiche.

640
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,720
But that's alright.

641
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Your Majesty carried me

642
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,000
hunting

643
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,080
Practice and you'll be sent in.

644
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,820
Kingdom Of Rio.

645
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,200

646
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,400
to reveal him for concur Sol.

647
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,120
Yes, My Queen Mother.

648
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Your Highness.

649
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
Hua Ping.

650
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,720
Did you see Chen Wu?

651
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,480
Eunuch Chen?

652
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,120
Yes.

653
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,160
Where did he go?

654
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,840
Not good.

655
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,400
Yu. Yu.

656
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,280
Who asked you to come here?

657
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,120
Do you know it's dangerous to do this?

658
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,320
Tell me.

659
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,000
Why did you come here alone?

660
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,360
Speak.

661
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,440
I'm more than happy to have changed my clothes

662
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,040
in the carriage.

663
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,040
I changed my clothes and came out.

664
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,840
Your Highness.

665
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,480
You look so much like this.

666
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,560
How can you stay here alone?

667
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,160
You came here alone.

668
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,400
You can't say that.

669
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,720
I can't believe it.

670
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,040
My mother didn't come here anyway.

671
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,080
My father is not here.

672
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I don't care about you at all.

673
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,040
What are you talking about?

674
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,040
You're my brother.

675
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,800
No matter what happens,

676
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,960
I will protect you.

677
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,000
Brother.

678
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,560
No one cares about me.

679
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,160
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

680
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,480
If you really don't care about me,

681
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,680
how can I come to you personally?

682
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,920
I'm afraid you

683
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,880
won't listen to them and come back.

684
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,160
Then, brother.

685
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,800
Promise me first.

686
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,720
You won't scold me

687
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,600
if you don't go back.

688
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,480
Fine.

689
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,400
Give me

690
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,400
the criminal you're in charge of.

691
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,480
Otherwise,

692
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,760
you'll be over 100 times more than the ancestral training.

693
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,200
Okay.

694
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,560
Your Majesty.

695
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,000
Look.

696
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,240
Who is that?

697
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,480
Yun Zhou.

698
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,400
Go and ask her.

699
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,160
Such aこう!

700
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,960
You wanted to beat me mentally?

701
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,600
You didn't?

702
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,520
You felt it,

703
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,400
but you almost attacked after asking me first for permission.

704
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,240
Your Majesty.

705
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,560
Say it!

706
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,200
I меня asked you a question past now.

707
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,920
Some people come from Baoding.

708
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,920
Some people will reunite in the we REALLY future.

709
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,600
Two years ago in April,

710
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,800
this year in Hong턴,

711
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,600
There have been many people

712
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,480
who are Coalition to thestan.

713
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,760
But no,

714
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,840
our brothers took your words out for the second time,

715
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,120
now it's time to go.

716
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,360
I noticed that

717
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,960
when most common people

718
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,560
are illot chosen,

719
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,640
and all the living beings are safe,

720
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,240
I didn't expect

721
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,480
that all the refugees are dead here.

722
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,720
So good!

723
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,960
So good!

724
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,040
How did you know?

725
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,880
I

726
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,160
Didn't you use Prince Wei to lure me here

727
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,000
to see what a person is?

728
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,280
Your Majesty,

729
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
this year,

730
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,160
Guangping Manor is in danger.

731
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Shuntian Manor is in danger.

732
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,280
It's not a disaster, it's a disaster.

733
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,400
There are many refugees who are not alert.

734
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
The people in the palace know a lot.

735
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm hiding it from Your Majesty.

736
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,280
I know the truth.

737
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,600
You can tell me

738
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,080
if you let me see it with my own eyes.

739
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,200
My heart is beating.

740
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,320
Are you feeling better?

741
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,600
If you see it with your own eyes,

742
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,600
what will the refugees

743
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,960
do to the Quzhu?

744
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,240
When the time comes,

745
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,760
I'm afraid

746
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,640
they will become

747
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,760
the same as that firework.

748
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,320
When His Majesty was young,

749
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
he used to visit the people

750
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,280
with the Emperor of the Taizong.

751
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,800
He knows the people are suffering.

752
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,160
You don't have to worry.

753
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,360
Because it's a small play of the officials.

754
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,440
It's not worth mentioning in your heart.

755
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,240
The food, the food, the smile,

756
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,720
it's not a small thing.

757
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,640
But the cost of the food

758
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,200
is not a little bit reduced by the building, is it?

759
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,680
It's my fault.

760
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,320
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

761
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
It's my fault.

762
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,760
You don't have to

763
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,440
do anything.

764
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,600
You can move your body with your hair.

765
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,280
If you say it,

766
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,920
it's a disaster.

767
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,000
Brother, I'm hungry.

768
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,200
I want to eat.

769
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,240
Your Majesty,

770
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,360
I'm at the farm

771
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,840
and I've prepared the food.

772
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,920
I'll finish it first

773
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,360
and then go to the palace, okay?

774
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,520
You even said that you would help me

775
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,240
to test the Emperor of the Taizong.

776
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,160
You lied to me.

777
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,680
You're too considerate.

778
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,920
It's a pity.

779
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,520
It's my fault.

780
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,440
Your Majesty.

781
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,480
Noble Consort,

782
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,040
be my match.

783
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,720
This match

784
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,640
is a match made with love.

785
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,840
I'm not good at playing the game.

786
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,560
I'm afraid it's hard to win.

787
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,040
I'm here.

788
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,360
I can't defeat you.

789
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,720
Thank you.

790
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,240
Your Majesty.

791
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,440
Why am I back?

792
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,240
Go back.

793
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,080
Don't think that

794
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,040
you can make me lose my temper.

795
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,480
I won't eat this.

796
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,800
Brother, look.

797
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,620
Here's the reducing data for

798
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,840
what the emperor asked of you.

799
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,040
I'll send you a list.

800
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,080
Here are the list.

801
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,000
Your Majesty,

802
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,520
because of the accident,

803
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,120
you were in a hurry.

804
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,920
So you decided to visit the people

805
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,320
in the village.

806
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,320
You're relieved

807
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,480
to go back to the palace.

808
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,760
Your Majesty, you haven't eaten yet.

809
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,000
I brought Su Sishan here.

810
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,240
Go and prepare.

811
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,680
Yes.

812
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,640
I'm worried that I'm not good enough.

813
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,640
It's still the empress's decision.

814
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,280
Everyone,

815
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,040
it's not easy to go out today.

816
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,920
Why don't you try a new taste?

817
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,520
Okay?

818
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,800
Ziping.

819
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:36,960
Yunzhou,

820
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,560
have a seat.

821
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,520
I'm here to thank you.

822
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,880
Ziping.

823
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,840
Here, Ziping.

824
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,400
Ziping.

825
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,060
Ziping?

826
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,280
Here, have a seat.

827
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,920
Yes, Your Highness.

828
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,280
Let's eat the food we find around the village.

829
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,520
What if you get caught?

830
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,400
Ziping,

831
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,440
I'll go and get some water.

832
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,360
Your Highness,

833
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,880
let's just eat.

834
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,120
Why do you give abuses

835
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:37,880
in such fine

836
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,880
Yin Si Shan.

837
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Look at Su Si Shan.

838
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,880
What is he doing?

839
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,880
If he is too old, he will have to go to the station later.

840
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,880
And he will be able to preserve the original taste of the chicken.

841
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,880
Go to work.

842
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,880
Go to work.

843
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,880
This is chicken porridge.

844
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,880
Here.

845
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
It's mine.

846
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,880
Here.

847
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
It tastes good.

848
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,880
It's too hot.

849
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,880
It's delicious.

850
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,880
I'm hungry.

851
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,880
I'm hungry.

852
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,880
I'm hungry.

853
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,880
I'm hungry.

854
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,880
I'm hungry.

855
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,880
I'm hungry.

856
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,880
I'm hungry.

857
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,880
I'm hungry.

858
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,880
I'm hungry.

859
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,880
I'm hungry.

860
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,880
I'm hungry.

861
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,880
I'm hungry.

862
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,880
I'm hungry.

863
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,880
I'm hungry.
