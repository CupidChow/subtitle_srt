00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,120

5
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,860
for the 아� хƎ

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,080
I'm sympathetic not to kill.

7
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,260
God of defense

8
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,440
In the second generation

9
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,160
Lan Johnny reminds you

10
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,500
2020 are about to begin

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,500
Out Le buenas

12
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,660
Perhaps lady

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
grounded in the 위 standpoint.

14
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Right now,

15
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,960
what is the safe way

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,280
to minimize our crimes?

17
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
The teacher on the left

18
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,520
here has a black pendant.

19
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
I remember the针 line is here!

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,240
Make do with it.

21
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,040
I'll do it myself.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,440
Då divineเร gong glued on you to make windows in between your body and things.

23

If activate its power, itación bug.

24
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,920
I hope it won't be aligned with consequences the day you find it.

25
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,120
Did you give it a wrong tire?

26
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,980
Hurry.

27
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,020
Hurry!

28
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,840
Everyone can see it and see it.

29
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,760
I oppressed ZhaoESCO's honor because we couldn't share it.

30
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,940
Because Watching watch will be catastrophic.

31
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,900
Miss Liao,

32
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,500
you're a good girl.

33
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,380
I'm glad you're honest.

34
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,740
Your Highness,

35
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,340
His Majesty said

36
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,580
there's no place

37
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,660
for a person who can't go there.

38
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,580
There's no place for a person

39
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,780
who can't take the throne.

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,300
But it doesn't mean

41
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,380
they can take it without any reason.

42
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,580
If I endure this time,

43
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,820
the people in the Shang's Bureau will be in danger.

44
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,820
This is a misunderstanding.

45
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,900
If someone comes in,

46
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,260
they'll be in danger.

47
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,180
It's a risk to the royal family.

48
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,260
It's easy and slow.

49
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,540
Liao,

50
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,380
it's all clear now.

51
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,180
If you still don't mind

52
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,260
to search here,

53
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,580
will our business be done?

54
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,580
There's no one in the Shang's Bureau.

55
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,540
Just look.

56
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,260
Go back and do your own business.

57
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,700
Your Excellency,

58
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,940
since Noble Consort Zhao went there,

59
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,380
the palace has been occupied by Crown Princess Consort.

60
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,980
The Crown Princess Consort

61
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,900
has always been a good friend of His Majesty.

62
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,020
I've figured out

63
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,140
what you're going to report.

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,020
But now...

65
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,940
Your Excellency.

66
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,780
Are you sure

67
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,060
the Shang's Bureau is really not in a hurry?

68
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,820
Of course not.

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,700
Good.

70
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,940
Since you're in charge of it,

71
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,460
I'll believe you.

72
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740
But in the future,

73
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,180
if someone finds out

74
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,100
that the Shang's Bureau is really in a hurry,

75
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,540
you'll be punished for it.

76
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,260
I've checked it.

77
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,900
I can't say anything else.

78
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,500
Your Excellency,

79
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,300
please.

80
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,420
When you look at it all by yourself,

81
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,900
you were just being very kind.

82
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,980
Now, Nobird,

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,380
you really are unreserved.

84
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,340
Since I was in the Wu surgical court,

85
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,940
the crown prince placed himself at the top,

86
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,420
thick and long-distance,

87
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,660
sharp and hypocritical,

88
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,540
he's been looking

89
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,020
for the停d eternity

90
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,940
of Marquis Gu Jinxian in Shang's Bureau.

91
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,260
Now he was just

92
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,820
kiveled by someone minimize the economic affairs.

93
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,020
The in- achei's Bureau looks quite different.

94
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,220
What's more,

95
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,420
he's the other sisters.

96
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,300
Now, his six prominent siblings

97
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
should protect him for a long time.

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,260
I don't have any.

99
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,340
If Empress Renxiao is still alive,

100
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,460
that's good.

101
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,940
All right.

102
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,660
Come with me.

103
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,660
you

104
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,220
Come with me.

105
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,820
Come with me.

106
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,420
Come in.

107
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,260
Tell him.

108
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,220
I'm可以

109
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,900
No.

110
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:05,980
Shouωru.

111
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,820
Let me.

112
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,980
Dervish Inn

113
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,220
Even the black ropes have been destroyed.

114
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,820
You are so faithful.

115
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,380
Let go of me.

116
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,820
Let me go!

117
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,420
You

118
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,420
found out you're in prison

119
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,300
because of Sir Jin?

120
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,260
So I was killed

121
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,980
to defend myself

122
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,620
and help you

123
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,100
block the evidence and suspicion.

124
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,820
Am I right?

125
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
But you won't know

126
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,620
that Zhen is here so quickly.

127
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,740
Are you there?

128
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,340
Let's go.

129
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,580
Go with me.

130
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,380
Listen,

131
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,140
I'm out of trouble.

132
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,260
Your problem is here.

133
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,940
Come and tell me

134
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,220
if something goes wrong.

135
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:09,940
Yes.

136
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,060
Go.

137
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,740
What for?

138
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,740
I won't go against you.

139
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,940
I'll kill you,

140
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,780
and I won't go out of the palace.

141
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,180
I will not!

142
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,620
Good.

143
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,620
A person who is not afraid of death.

144
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
Tell me,

145
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,620
what's more scary than death?

146
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
You will never understand.

147
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
The people are all from different tribes.

148
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,620
They are all from different tribes.

149
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,620
They are all from different tribes.

150
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,620
But this is a generation

151
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
with countless people.

152
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,620
The people of the tribe are only their ancestors and traitors.

153
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,620
They were always in the past.

154
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,620
They are all from different tribes.

155
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,620
They are not allowed to marry.

156
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
They are always married.

157
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,620
They are all from different tribes.

158
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Once they grow up,

159
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,620
they will sell their whole family.

160
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,620
They will be paid by the government.

161
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,620
My parents are rich and have a good family.

162
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,620
They are all from different tribes.

163
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,620
They are all from different tribes.

164
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
They are all Scandinavians.

165
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,620
They are programmed to end in the same world.

166
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,620
But they are still crise.

167
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Do you know

168
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
I've killed so many shredded people

169
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,620
I might as well die outside

170
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,620
if I ever visit Laittonaur?

171
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
So

172
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,220
You came to the palace to avenge me.

173
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,340
To avenge me?

174
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,540
I'm not even alive.

175
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
Why should I avenge you?

176
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,140
Who should I avenge?

177
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,420
I don't want to be like my mother

178
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,540
who sold the filial piety.

179
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,700
I don't want to be like my father

180
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,740
who was attacked by the palace.

181
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,380
I don't want to be like my brother

182
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,940
who was killed by a West handsome.

183
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,220
I want to be a good person.

184
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,780
So I pretend to be stupid

185
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,220
and finally got the chance.

186
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,140
I was able to escape.

187
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,380
I've been in the army for a long time.

188
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,940
As a spy, I helped the enemy.

189
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,980
They don't want girls.

190
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,980
I don't want to pay.

191
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,780
I have to pay for the food.

192
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,180
No matter how they bully me,

193
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
I'll bear it.

194
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,180
Only by doing this

195
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,620
can I learn to escape from the enemy.

196
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,340
Why are you looking at me like that?

197
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,340
Yes.

198
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,940
I was born a spy.

199
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,820
I almost lost my weight.

200
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,540
I learned to be a spy.

201
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm a thief.

202
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,060
The Cha Sheng House owner

203
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,380
refused to let girls enter the palace

204
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,340
and bought a new one.

205
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,780
So I entered the palace.

206
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,900
This is my only chance.

207
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
My only chance.

208
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,100
You're born a spy.

209
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,180
You're asking us.

210
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,500
What's the relationship between you and him?

211
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,460
I'm not a spy.

212
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,620
I'm just a spy.

213
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,620
I'm just a spy.

214
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,700
I'm just a spy.

215
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,820
I'm just a spy.

216
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,900
I'm just a spy.

217
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,900
I'm just a spy.

218
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm just a spy.

219
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
I'm just a spy.

220
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
I'm just a spy.

221
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm just a spy.

222
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm just a spy.

223
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm just a spy.

224
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
I'm just a spy.

225
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm just a spy.

226
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
I'm just a spy.

227
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
I'm just a spy.

228
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm just a spy.

229
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
I'm just a spy.

230
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I'm just a spy.

231
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
I'm just a spy.

232
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
I'm just a spy.

233
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm just a spy.

234
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
I'm just a spy.

235
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
I'm just a spy.

236
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I'm just a spy.

237
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm just a spy.

238
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
I'm just a spy.

239
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm just a spy.

240
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
All right.

241
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,700
All right.

242
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
I'm telling you,

243
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
the traces of Zi Yi

244
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,700
and Beisha

245
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
are different.

246
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
You shouldn't be a fool anymore.

247
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,860
Okay.

248
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:41,940
Thank you,Uncle.

249
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,820
Looks like it can be destroyed.

250
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,180
By an freeze- souventor這麼,

251
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:45,460
it is probably

252
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,540
the time this letter

253
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,460
finally became a,...

254
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,860
also named after Uqin's son.

255
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
Just you encourage me.

256
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,600
Mo Xiaoshan.

257
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,260
I have important news to report.

258
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,820
Don't worry.

259
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,140
I won't give up.

260
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,260
There's only one thing that matters most.

261
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,340
You must know that.

262
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,780
Sushan.

263
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,420
What's wrong?

264
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,860
Isn't Sister Chang coming here

265
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,140
to do the most important thing?

266
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,100
Why don't you tell her to get out of bed?

267
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,220
Hua Ping, you go first.

268
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,060
What are you doing?

269
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,660
You know it.

270
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,500
I understand.

271
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,260
Imperial Concubine Dowager, please forgive me.

272
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,460
Your Highness,

273
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,660
in the past,

274
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,860
Imperial Concubine Dowager sent people to the temple several times.

275
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,180
She was ill and went to the temple to get the medicine.

276
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,980
The prescription was made by herself.

277
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,460
After seeing the medicine,

278
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,460
she was fine.

279
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,420
So she gave it to me.

280
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,780
Ok.

281
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:57,800
You are avisor of

282
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,460
empress dowager.

283
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,780
Of course you know how to get yourDie Mae

284
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,580
to see if she is peppers or strawberries.

285
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,620
But I don't understand why

286
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,620
and built on the people's lives.

287
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,700
How should I be happy?

288
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,980
People's lives?

289
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,700
What people's lives?

290
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,860
I've forgotten.

291
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,900
I didn't want to be a father's mother.

292
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,380
I wanted her to live a white life

293
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,060
and hide her from the family.

294
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,140
If she didn't take the medicine,

295
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,860
I would open the room for her.

296
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,380
One day,

297
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,260
I opened the room for a woman.

298
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,580
If not three days,

299
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,460
it would be a long time.

300
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,420
You're a righteous woman.

301
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,620
You're my wife.

302
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,220
I want you to live a long life.

303
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:45,820
Get up.

304
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,020
What are you doing?

305
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,580
Let's go.

306
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,020
Let's go.

307
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,700
Let's go.

308
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Let's go.

309
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Let's go.

310
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:54,820
Let's go.

311
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,220
I can only blame you for being unwell

312
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,140
and being a father.

313
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,820
You should be a good person.

314
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,100
The patient is pregnant.

315
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,340
You've missed the medicine for blood circulation.

316
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,540
What can you do?

317
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,060
There are three women in the patient's body.

318
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,540
The family is helpless.

319
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,220
I heard her crying.

320
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,860
She's not willing to help.

321
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,340
She wants to help her.

322
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,420
It's because you're a good person

323
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,740
that you made a big mistake.

324
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,340
If you didn't work hard for her,

325
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,700
can you be here quietly?

326
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,100
Save me.

327
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,020
Save me.

328
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,060
I thought I was a student

329
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,460
who killed people

330
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,540
and implicated my grandfather.

331
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
And father was heartbroken.

332
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,740
So I obediently listened to you

333
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,540
and said I was a concubine.

334
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,500
But then my grandfather came to tell me.

335
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,300
I knew

336
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,500
you were forced to go back.

337
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,020
Such grievous, violent and upright person!

338
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,260
Zhang Qing.

339
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,460
You are very epic!

340
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,340
Incorrect account letters

341
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,900
for YO Partner.

342
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,500
Tahson?

343
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,180
Abroad.

344
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,100
Where is Han Sun?

345
00:17:36,820 --> 00:18:02,360
Your

346
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
and treat me as a noble person.

347
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Now that I've exposed the truth,

348
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
I don't need to show it anymore.

349
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Every time you've been poisoned by food,

350
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
you're hoping that you won't be found

351
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
and die of a weak body

352
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
if you have a day of day.

353
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
But I stopped you.

354
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
But you still didn't give up.

355
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
You also implicated Royal Descendant,

356
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
didn't you?

357
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
You should be glad

358
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
that Royal Descendant didn't harm you.

359
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Little crazy man.

360
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,500
No matter how you get mad,

361
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
no matter how painful it is,

362
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
you must remember

363
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
that thanks to you,

364
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
you still can't get out of it.

365
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Otherwise, you won't be able to die.

366
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Even the whole family will be buried with you.

367
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
You can ignore your parents and your elder sister.

368
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
But you must care about your mother

369
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
and your innocent younger sister.

370
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I'll take care of it.

371
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Take good care of your Royal Descendant.

372
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
If Royal Descendant treats you well,

373
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
you won't even be able to sleep.

374
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Zi Jin, let me help you.

375
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Just get on well.

376
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,900
We belong to the same family.

377
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Bin Ziping, come over here.

378
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,100
Miss Fang.

379
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
What do you want?

380
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
From now on,

381
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
you cannot see Chu Fang again.

382
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Why?

383
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,380
Madame

384
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,940
What happened, lure Ziping

385
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,740
What shall I do?

386
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,320
Why did it happen, advertiser

387
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Fang Jue.

388
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,740
Okay, okay.

389
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,540
Stop asking.

390
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,460
Go back to your work.

391
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,500
The first meal of the Doukai Contest starts now.

393

402
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,220
I'll go.

403
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,300
I told Mr. Meng

404
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,580
about Yin Ziping's real birth.

405
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,780
You heard our conversation.

406
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,900
I don't understand why you

407
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,260
give such a chance again and again.

408
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,380
But I

409
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,100
will never be in a relationship with such a person.

410
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,500
But

411
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,340
Mr. Meng has been under such a crisis

412
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,460
and he's sure that the situation is not clear.

413
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,300
So he's lucky

414
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,340
that even if the whole Shao Shi Bureau

415
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,700
has his own secret,

416
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,980
he won't be able to find it.

417
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,140
When the wind blows,

418
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,820
find a way to get out of here.

419
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,820
Move aside.

420
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,140
Is everything doctor Yang said true?

421
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,980
A person with noya?

422
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,020
I don't know.

423
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,860
Let's go.

424
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,580
I don't want our work to be affected.

425
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,940
Please get in.

426
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,300
Be careful.

427
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:03,420
It is OK.

428
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,060
Place it here.

429
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,100
Come here.

430
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,660
Hurry up and put it here.

431
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:10,860
Over there.

432
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,460
This.

433
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,420
Yuehua.

434
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,580
He's fine.

435
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,220
Thank you.

436
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,060
I know that you will run away from my mom's line.

437
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,980
As for that line of Had earrings,

438
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,180
do we really need a窗 to take them?

439
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,460
That's what I thought.

440
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,100
Why are you still going out?

441
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,780
It's cold outside.

442
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,460
I'll go in.

443
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,580
You're lying.

444
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,620
They all think I'm a bad person.

445
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,980
How could they care about me?

446
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,620
I have a mother.

447
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,540
She's a good cook.

448
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,780
She's a good painter.

449
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,060
She's a musician.

450
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,660
She's like a beggar.

451
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,820
She's a spy.

452
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:11,780
What aa?

453
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,140
The law compiles

454
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,980
not to keep all Совetimus Elements

455
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,160
or make a marriage in couples.

456
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,820
Even on the administrative legs.

457
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,320
So he passed away

458
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,020
and remember to surrender himself.

459
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,840
But he turned down

460
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,400
the law in his life.

461
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,280
The richer he should be,

462
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,220
the better promised.

463
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,620
I want to change.

464
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,780
I don't have a chance.

465
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,980
My mother-in-law

466
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,540
loves drinking.

467
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,940
When she's drunk,

468
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,620
she says

469
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,220
I'm not good.

470
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,940
I'm not good.

471
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,340
I'm not lucky.

472
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,340
That's how she is.

473
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,340
So no matter what,

474
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,460
she'll scold you.

475
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,740
One day,

476
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,380
you have to prove to her

477
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,380
that you can be a good person.

478
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,020
I'm not good.

479
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,060
I'm not good.

480
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,980
I'm not good.

481
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,340
I'm not good.

482
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,940
I'm not good.

483
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,300
I'm not good.

484
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,420
I'm not good.

485
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,420
I'm not good.

486
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,180
All right.

487
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,100
Drink the medicine later.

488
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,300
Go to the kitchen to sleep.

489
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,460
Make some warm-up.

490
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,100
I'll go in.

491
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,260
Sing.

492
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,420
機會

493
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,460
You.

494
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,060
I'm sorry.

495
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,940
I made a mistake.

496
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,540
to go to the private private private.

497
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,980
We'll just go and deliver it.

498
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,060
Thank you.

499
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,340
Thank you.

500
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,020
Sister Yao is very generous.

501
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,460
She takes care of us.

502
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,180
If she were the one who ordered food,

503
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,620
it would be great.

504
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,860
Let's go.

505
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,660
Mr. Meng, I beg you.

506
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,380
Please promise me.

507
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,940
Mr. Meng, I beg you.

508
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,580
I beg you.

509
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,780
Get up.

510
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,300
Mr. Meng, you allow me to kill you?

511
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,380
Relc, you're..

512
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,700
I don't have another dignity.

513
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,420
Yes.

514
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,100
It's scratched.

515
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,700
What from you?

516
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,420
You chased her all the way

517
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,900
to take a look at her?

518
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,820
It's okay.

519
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,540
One is low- eensy royal remarkable education some

520
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,380
the little maid who washed the dishes.

521
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,580
The distance between you

522
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,420
is even further than the sky and the river.

523
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,100
There may be no fate.

524
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,740
That may not be the case.

525
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,660
Maybe

526
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,900
we are destined to meet.

527
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,860
At that time, my mother was ill.

528
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,940
I went to the foreign family in the north.

529
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,900
I was very angry.

530
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:31,780
I sneaked out

531
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,540
to play with the girls from the Hall of Fame.

532
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,060
His Majesty was familiar with the royal family

533
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,180
and the royal family.

534
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,860
I had the chance to see him.

535
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,420
Don't move.

536
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:52,900
Get up.

537
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:53,860
Come on.

538
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,780
Come on.

539
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,860
Have some water.

540
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:32,540
Hurry.

541
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,460
Hurry.

542
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,860
Let's go.

543
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,580
You said this wasn't a destined one.

544
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,700
Nonsense.

545
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,740
You're grateful to others.

546
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,340
Do you know him?

547
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,860
If you know him,

548
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,300
you'll not like him.

549
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,420
So you need to know him.

550
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,140
You need to know what kind of person he is.

551
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,780
Do you know him?

552
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,500
You're not only young,

553
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,380
but also know a lot.

554
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,140
From ancient to modern,

555
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,140
he's a family member with a rich family.

556
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,060
I've heard a lot about him.

557
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,980
He's old and has no other interests.

558
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,860
He's a long-time playboy.

559
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,460
I hope all the lovers in the world

560
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,580
will be friends.

561
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,900
Zijin,

562
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
what are you talking about?

563
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,380
I said

564
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,460

and accompany him for a ride.

574
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,460
You'll have to stay in the Palace tonight.

00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,020

576
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,380

577
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,340

Next morning.

00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,540
It really is you!

593
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,540
Ya Yu?

594
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,820
You let me issue a news to Su大家

595
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,920
To keep you both from a joining the dresser

596
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,580
I tried really hard

597
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,840
Don't look at me like that

598
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,600
I don't feel happy

599
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,300
You've been threatening me.

600
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,700
Did you really forget my life?

601
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,820
Let me go!

602
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,460
Go away!

603
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,700
Help!

604
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,340
I'll go!

605
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,780
Go away!

606
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:46,500
==

607
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,060
Wait for my words.

608
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,340
I speak from your head tomorrow.

609
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,180
Back then,

610
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,420
I was just a criminal who committed a crime.

611
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,300
You killed your husband's brother.

612
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,940
But you know that

613
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,580
I killed my own family because of the prison.

614
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,780
I'm innocent.

615
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,380
The trial was just in the court.

616
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,100
Yuan Sheng was not the right person.

617
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,460
The truth is that he committed a crime.

618
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,380
But you shouldn't have decided

619
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,980
to meet the world and

620
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,620
let go of your crime.

621
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,060
Later,

622
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,540
you were expelled.

623
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,580
I also

624
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,780
forced you to go into the palace

625
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,420
as a dancer.

626
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,940
Today,

627
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,820
you're the first one

628
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,060
to be called appropriate

629
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,860
as The Peach Sour mouse.

630
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,340
Isn't it me?

631
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,740
I am just

632
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,700
a beggar queues at the residence.

633
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,500
I got the title of

634
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,920
golden 10.

635
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,300
And

636
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,700
I've helped you too.

637
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,940
No matter how thankless

638
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
I have a day to return it to you.

639
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
No matter if you believe or not,

640
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I never thought

641
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,940
that I would get any reward

642
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,940
if I helped you.

643
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,940
The first time I saw you,

644
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
I was...

645
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Why are you laughing?

646
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,940
I'm sorry.

647
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,940
Your Highness,

648
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,940
I'm telling you

649
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,940
the day I killed Su Feng,

650
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Meng Ziyun

651
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,940
was dead.

652
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
Now,

653
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,940
I'm a woman

654
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
who has no father, no father,

655
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
no daughter

656
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,940
and no one to love.

657
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
I can give you a word

658
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
at the end.

659
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,940
Go ahead.

660
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
Do me a favor.

661
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,940
Get out of the way.

662
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,940
Get out.

663
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
Your Highness.

664
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
Father.

665
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
Come.

666
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
Father.

667
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
You were in a hurry.

668
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
Are you feeling unwell?

669
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
Let me massage you.

670
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Come.

671
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,940
Mother.

672
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,940
Your Highness.

673
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
You know that

674
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,940
you love Prince Han

675
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
for more than two days.

676
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Why do you have to suffer so much?

677
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,940
During the two-way trip,

678
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,940
I've seen the carriage and horse-drawn equipment

679
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,940
that were used many times.

680
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,940
And I didn't dare to return to the Emperor.

681
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,940
I was asked to be a member of the royal court

682
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,940
and the Emperor's court reported it.

683
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,940
I was so despicable

684
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,940
that I didn't have the right to marry him.

685
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,940
I haven't met the Emperor for days.

686
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,940
I've met the Emperor for days.

687
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,940
And I'm just happy to talk to the Emperor.

688
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
I know

689
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,940
that Father loves the Emperor.

690
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,940
But I'm also his close friend.

691
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
My close friend

692
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,940
is it because of

693
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,940
my father's life?

694
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
You're so mean.

695
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,940
How can I not?

696
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,940
You're so mean.

697
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,940
Father,

698
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,940
you're so mean.

699
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,940
Your Highness.

700
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,940
Your Highness, please.

701
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,940
His Highness is a senior in the imperial family.

702
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,940
He has a good health.

703
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,940
He needs to be kind.

704
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,940
He can't be careless.

705
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,940
He has a good behavior.

706
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,940
But although he has been fighting for years,

707
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,940
he's been a good fighter.

708
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,940
He needs to be kind and considerate.

709
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
I understand

710
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
how hard Father's life is.

711
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
But he's angry with his uncle.

712
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,940
Why don't you

713
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
go to the Imperial Court

714
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,940
and take the responsibility of filial piety?

715
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
You can't be so grumpy.

716
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,940
You can't be so emotional.

717
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
Okay.

718
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
Son.

719
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
I'm going out to take a bath.

720
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,940
His Majesty asked you to close the door.

721
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,940
Where are you going?

722
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,940
Run!

723
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
Your Majesty, if you want to make me a spy,

724
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:55,940
you're the imperial family.

725
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,940
You've been in the hands of the imperial family for 27 years.

726
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,940
How?

727
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,940
You're the imperial family.

728
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,940
How?

729
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,940
I'm not even

730
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
able to breathe freely

731
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,940
when I'm out.

732
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:12,940
Your Majesty!

733
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:29,940
Mother.

734
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,940
I'm leaving.

735
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,940
Go ahead.

736
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,940
Did you find out?

737
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
Prince Han is a commoner.

738
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
But after the battle,

739
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,940
His Majesty suddenly called out to me

740
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,940
and ordered His Highness to come in.

741
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,940
You're not going to leave?

742
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,940
I'm not going to leave.

743
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,940
I'll go with you.

744
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,940
I'll go with you.

745
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,940
I'll go with you.

746
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,940
I'll go with you.

747
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,940
I'll go with you.

748
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,940
I'll go with you.

749
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:23,940
Five mountains?

750
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,940
These are all returned by Qianqing Palace.

751
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,940
Yes.

752
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,940
I came to watch you at Chang'an Palace for a bit.

753
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,940
His Majesty must have found out

754
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,940
that this house here is filled with terrible memories.

755
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,940
