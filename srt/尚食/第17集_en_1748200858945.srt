1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,640
Well, that's it!

2
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:47,540
Hello, welcome to Ke Ru

3
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,080
Is very busy

4
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Today, we have invited eight fans of Mango TV,

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,080
who are especially on the line to serve a new year's dish.

6
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,080
That is the traditional Chinese food,

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
the food of the pastime.

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,080
Finally, we have invited our two main actors,

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Xu Kai and Wu Jingyan.

10
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Everyone will be very, very happy to be part of this special feast,

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,080
to come with you all to the feast.

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,080
We are very happy to be part of this special feast,

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,080
and we are very happy to be part of this special feast,

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,080
to come with you all to the feast.

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,080
In addition, in today's live broadcast,

16
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,080
I want to tell you that there will be a lot of service during the live broadcast,

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
to be given to everyone.

18
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
What is it like?

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Everyone, listen carefully.

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
In the live broadcast,

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,080
as long as our two main actors,

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080

00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,080
speak out the key words of the setting,

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,080
the live broadcast room will immediately be hit with a drum,

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,080

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
and the membership card of Mango TV.

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,080
The key words have actually been quietly expressed

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,080
in our screen.

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,080
The information that is important will also be shared in the screen.

00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,080

And I also want to tell you that these key words,

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Xu Kai and Wu Jingyan,

38
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
don't know.

39
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
When will it start?

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Everyone, let's look forward to it.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,080
In addition, today's feast,

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
we will directly invite Huang Taicun,

43
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Zhu Zhanjin, to invite us to the stage.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Then let's welcome Xu Kai together.

45
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Welcome.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Hello, fans of Mango TV.

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Hello, I'm Xu Kai.

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,080
Yes, welcome Xu Kai to our live broadcast room.

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,080
How do you feel about our stage?

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Very warm heart, very happy atmosphere.

51
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
And warm heart, happy.

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
Because today our theme is

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Zhu Zhanjin and Yao Zijin's family feast.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,080
We can't miss anything.

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
We will give you a candy.

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
So I also want to tell you

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,080
that you can use this connection.

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,080
We invited Yao Zijin today to our live broadcast room.

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
And Huang Taicun,

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,080
to talk with you about some things.

61
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
I believe that at this moment,

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
everyone's chats have been brushed up.

63
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
Right?

64
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Where is Jingyan?

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
OK, then let's talk more.

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Please welcome Jingyan.

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Welcome Jingyan.

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Welcome you.

69
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Hello.

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Hello, live broadcast room.

71
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Hello, we are Jingyan.

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,080
Hello, Kai Kai.

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Hello, hello.

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
You are so happy.

75
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm watching you.

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
So happy.

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,080
I feel lonely.

78
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
But no, we have a lot of fans

79
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
who are with Jingyan, OK?

80
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Absolutely.

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
I don't want you to be lonely.

82
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
It will be very warm hearted.

83
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
OK, everyone,

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
because today our Jingyan

85
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
is in a very bad situation.

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
But through this

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
cloud live broadcast,

88
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,080
it is actually a home-made cloud

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,080
that we can meet with you in a different way.

90
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
I believe that everyone can feel

91
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
that Wu Jingyan and our Xu Kai

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
are the hot people here.

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
I believe that people are already here.

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
Actually,

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
we have prepared some snacks here.

96
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
I don't know.

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Do Jingyan have food there?

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,080
I think they have prepared

99
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
snacks that are not snacks.

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
It's snacks that are small.

101
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
Yes, we have prepared some snacks, right?

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
Yes.

103
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
We have prepared snacks

104
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
on the spot.

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
And we have prepared tea.

106
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
At the beginning,

107
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
we will have tea first, OK?

108
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
OK.

109
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
Let's have a toast

110
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
with our audience first.

111
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Welcome everyone.

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Thank you for watching our live broadcast.

113
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
Remember our Jingyan.

114
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Next,

115
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,080
we can start eating and chatting.

116
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Everyone can see that

117
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
people are already here.

118
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
The family business is about to start.

119
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Because of the last live broadcast,

120
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
everyone has been looking forward to it for a long time.

121
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
What she said is that

122
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,080
the young girl Yao Zijian

123
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,080
has grown up in the palace.

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
And she taught us

125
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Chinese food,

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,080
and she has learned the story of the pig's trotter.

127
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
Right?

128
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Today,

129
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
we have prepared some

130
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
major high-performance videos.

131
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
I don't know

132
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
whether it was before

133
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,080
Xu Kai and Wu Jingyan

134
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
have watched the video.

135
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
No.

136
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
No.

137
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
So it's our first time watching it, right?

138
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Yes.

139
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
OK, let's follow Jingyan

140
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
and Xu Kai

141
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
to watch it together.

142
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Cheng Wu.

143
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
It's on the table.

144
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Your Highness.

145
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Don't look at it.

146
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
This painting...

147
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Maybe...

148
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
someone will see it.

149
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Is it the mouse that

150
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
is hiding its head?

151
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
The moon is in the right color tonight.

152
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Let's go to the hospital.

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
I'm alive for you.

154
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
It seems to be the only thing

155
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
in my life.

156
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
I'm telling you.

157
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
I won't let you go.

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
It's all over.

159
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Just now,

160
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Jingyan said that

161
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
it's all over.

162
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Yes.

163
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
It's all over in a minute.

164
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Anyway, it's all over.

165
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
I think

166
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
you and Jingyan

167
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
have the same thought.

168
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
It's like you're always on the stage.

169
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
You feel very, very sweet.

170
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
So,

171
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
please introduce

172
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
your role

173
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
in the drama

174
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
with Xu Kai and Jingyan.

175
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Jingyan.

176
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Jingyan.

177
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
I'm in the top ten.

178
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Jingyan is Yao Jingjing.

179
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
And the top ten is

180
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
a princess's food drama.

181
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
It's really good.

182
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,080
There are probably more than

183
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
one thousand of this drama.

184
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
Let's dance.

185
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Hello.

186
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Congratulations.

187
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
I don't know if you've heard

188
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
our voice.

189
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Actually,

190
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
it's a hidden welfare part

191
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
in our live broadcast room.

192
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
During the live broadcast,

193
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
as long as you two

194
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
speak of our welfare key words,

195
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
it will trigger our welfare mechanism.

196
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
So congratulations to the two members

197
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
of this round of welfare.

198
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
So, the most important news

199
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
has been shown on our screen.

200
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Congratulations.

201
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
And this drama is very beautiful.

202
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
And the girl is also

203
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
very beautiful.

204
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
And the costume

205
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
has reached more than three thousand.

206
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
It's beautiful and

207
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
a very good drama.

208
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,080
At the same time,

209
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
there is also

210
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,080
the love between Zhu Zhanzhi and Yao Jingjing.

211
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
I played in it.

212
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Yao Jingjing is a

213
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
very good cook.

214
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
She eats well.

215
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
And the thing I admire about her

216
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
is that

217
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
at that time,

218
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
she had a lot of courage

219
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
and super-precious ideas.

220
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I admire her courage.

221
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
She is a kind of

222
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
independent girl

223
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
with a big character.

224
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
She is independent.

225
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
So this drama

226
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
should be very beautiful.

227
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
And there are

228
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
many sweet scenes in the drama.

229
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,080
We just

230
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,080
just watched a little bit.

231
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
It's already sweetened to the heart.

232
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
I don't know, Xu Kai.

233
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
You can introduce

234
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
the role you played in it, okay?

235
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I played Huang Taicun.

236
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Zhu Zhanzhi.

237
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
And she is a

238
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
very talented

239
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
in both martial arts and martial arts.

240
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
You call yourself a genius?

241
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Zhu Zhanzhi is very talented.

242
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
Right?

243
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
She has such a beautiful Yao Jingjing.

244
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
Look,

245
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
she is on the scene.

246
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
She is.

247
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
She is very...

248
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Yes, I think

249
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
she has no flaws.

250
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
A man

251
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
who is perfect.

252
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
A genius.

253
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
Can you

254
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
introduce more to everyone?

255
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Actually,

256
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Jingjing has already said some things.

257
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Do you think

258
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
there are

259
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
some different

260
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
characteristics

261
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
compared to the roles

262
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
you played in the past?

263
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I think the biggest difference

264
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
is that

265
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
she has a

266
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
excessive process.

267
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Her character

268
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
has changed very quickly.

269
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
For example, I am Huang Taicun.

270
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
And then

271
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
I became the Crown Prince

272
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
and then I became the Emperor.

273
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
So I often

274
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
would talk to the director

275
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
and say,

276
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Director,

277
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
I was obviously happy just now.

278
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Why did I suddenly

279
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,080
become unhappy

280
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
in this drama?

281
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
He said, are you the Emperor?

282
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
You are angry and happy.

283
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
You will definitely not be caught by anyone.

284
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I said,

285
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,080
what should I do?

286
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
He said,

287
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
you are the one who is now everything.

288
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
You are the one who is now everything.

289
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
So I think this is very difficult.

290
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
It is not angry,

291
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
self-righteousness,

292
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
and everything

293
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
that is different from what you see in life.

294
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
So I think

295
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,080
I am still learning this.

296
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
Because after all,

297
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
the emperor's temperament

298
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
and his difficulty are too great.

299
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I think I have been

300
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
learning it.

301
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
I can't use

302
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
all the things that I see

303
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
to bring people.

304
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
I really can't bring them to the emperor.

305
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
You told me,

306
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
it's like this.

307
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
Actually it's very difficult.

308
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
For example,

309
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
I will have a little bit of

310
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
old drama.

311
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
I also cried and said,

312
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,080
Teacher,

313
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,080
just now it's okay.

314
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
I won't be too much.

315
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
So this is a very difficult point.

316
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
A very different point.

317
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Actually it's also a journey.

318
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Yes.

319
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
Including, you see,

320
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
when you are shooting,

321
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
it's not actually a journey

322
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
with this plot.

323
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Maybe you played

324
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
Huang Taicun in the last second.

325
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
You will play the emperor next.

326
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
So the difficulty of this change

327
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
is also here.

328
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Yes.

329
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Yes.

330
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
What about Jingyan?

331
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
I just heard from Kai.

332
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
I said,

333
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,080
the director told him

334
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
that everything is yours.

335
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
It's all his feelings.

336
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
I just want him to

337
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
be able to do it when he is shooting.

338
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
No wonder

339
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
everything is taken by him.

340
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Take you.

341
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
Yes.

342
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
This place is also mine.

343
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
It's all his.

344
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
I can understand

345
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
that it was not easy

346
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
but he did a great job.

347
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Yes.

348
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,080
I think this film

349
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
is the second time

350
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
we have worked together.

351
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
It's different.

352
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Yes.

353
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
I always think

354
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
I am still a maid.

355
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
I started from the beginning.

356
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
But when I saw Kai,

357
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
he said,

358
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
Huang Taicun.

359
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,080
It's not

360
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
the stage

361
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,080
where we grew up together.

362
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
The relationship

363
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
between the characters

364
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
has changed.

365
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
It makes people feel familiar

366
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
and unfamiliar.

367
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
It's a challenge.

368
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
But because of the familiarness,

369
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
it's good for the people.

370
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Yes.

371
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
We have to go to different places

372
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
where we have different relationships.

373
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
At the same time,

374
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
we are familiar.

375
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
It's a difficult place.

376
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
And

377
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
I think

378
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
the relationship between Yao Yijun and Zhu Yanji

379
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
makes me feel a little bit anxious.

380
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,080
It also makes the audience anxious.

381
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
It's because

382
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
they have met each other

383
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
for a long time.

384
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
They have been together for a long time.

385
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
They only met each other.

386
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
I think this is a special point.

387
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I don't know if the audience

388
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,080
can make it.

389
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
When I read the script,

390
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
I thought,

391
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
why is it still not seen?

392
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
Anyway, it's still not seen.

393
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
If it's finally seen,

394
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
everyone will think,

395
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
it's okay.

396
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Finally, we have waited.

397
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,080
It's a very touching feeling.

398
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
So,

399
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
as long as you chase after it,

400
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
you will chase after it all the time.

401
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Because it's really

402
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
hard to get it.

403
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
And then it's sweet.

404
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
Maybe there's a place

405
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
where it's still very dull.

406
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Right?

407
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
So it's a place

408
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
where you have a lot of faith.

409
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
I also see that

410
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
the fans have already

411
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
put two people

412
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
in the role.

413
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
One is Zhu Zhanji.

414
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
The other is Yao Zijing.

415
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
They have all taken a CP name.

416
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
Have you heard of it?

417
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
I'll announce it, okay?

418
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
It's called

419
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Golden Palm Flower.

420
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
I saw it.

421
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
I saw it.

422
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
His expression is different.

423
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Maybe you don't know it.

424
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
I know.

425
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
I just think this

426
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
this character is like

427
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
the dish in our history.

428
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
It's like a food.

429
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Golden Palm Flower

430
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
can also be made of food.

431
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
How do you

432
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
look at the CP name?

433
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
I think it's cute.

434
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
And Golden Palm Flower

435
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
is meant to be

436
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
accompanied and pure.

437
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
So I think it's very suitable.

438
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
It's just right for

439
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
the contrast between

440
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
the two of us

441
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
who are accompanied and found

442
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,080
by Zijing and me.

443
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Right?

444
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Golden Palm Flower is a very romantic person.

445
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Because if you know

446
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
that boys can

447
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
know more about

448
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Golden Palm Flower,

449
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
I think he is a very

450
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
thoughtful and thoughtful person.

451
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Zijing, do you agree?

452
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,080
I think many people

453
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,080
don't know about

454
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Golden Palm Flower.

455
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
I'm also particularly interested in tea.

456
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,080
So he is very important

457
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,080
to your CP name.

458
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Zijing,

459
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
how do you see the CP name?

460
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
I heard that

461
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
it's very suitable for the drama of the past.

462
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
Especially the drama of the past

463
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
which was made by Xiaobiao

464
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
for Zhu Shanqi.

465
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
It's a

466
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
little bit of a detail

467
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
in the food.

468
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Right?

469
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
And then he has

470
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
that kind of

471
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
positive effect.

472
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Right? When you see

473
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,080
the CP,

474
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
you will feel

475
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
very magical.

476
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
You will feel

477
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
very normal.

478
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
It's a little bit

479
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
of a real talk.

480
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
That's great.

481
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Speaking of this,

482
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
because we just saw

483
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
the high-performance film,

484
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
because you are also

485
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
the first time to watch it.

486
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Now let's

487
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
recall it again, OK?

488
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
When the two of us

489
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
were filming the film,

490
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
which one of the films

491
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
you think is the sweetest

492
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
or the most impressive?

493
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
I think

494
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
we can recall it.

495
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
The sweetest one

496
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
must be

497
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
the kiss between us.

498
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
And the most impressive one is

499
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
actually

500
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
when we first started,

501
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
we were very strict.

502
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Do you remember?

503
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
When we first started,

504
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
we were filming

505
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
the film

506
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
in the bookshelf.

507
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Right, I put you here.

508
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Right.

509
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Fortunately, we met before.

510
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
OK?

511
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
How did you feel?

512
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
It was embarrassing.

513
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Is it like this?

514
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
When we were filming,

515
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
I asked the director,

516
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
is it like this?

517
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
I just rolled it over

518
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
and put it so close.

519
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
I said, right?

520
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
The director said,

521
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
almost, almost.

522
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
I said, OK.

523
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
We already

524
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
don't need

525
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
to go to the point

526
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
where it's embarrassing.

527
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
Right.

528
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
I think this is

529
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
the impression

530
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
of the film

531
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,080
that we just started.

532
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Yes.

533
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Actually, the two of us

534
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
are quite familiar with it.

535
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
So when we were filming

536
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
the film,

537
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
we just received this kiss.

538
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
Do you remember

539
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
the kiss

540
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
that we just had?

541
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Do you have

542
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
the ending

543
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
or something like that?

544
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Do you have it?

545
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
No.

546
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
No.

547
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
No.

548
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
The one and only

549
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
of Kai's

550
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
is almost the same.

551
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Almost.

552
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
The scene of Kai's

553
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
scene was the one and only

554
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
of Kai's.

555
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
But this one and only

556
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
is the kiss.

557
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,080
The one and only.

558
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
Yes.

559
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Because the two of us

560
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,080
are very involved in the atmosphere.

561
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
Actually,

562
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
we can feel it.

563
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,080
It's great.

564
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
It's a good one.

565
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
What about the next few years?

566
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
What do you think is the sweetest

567
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,080
scene

568
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
that you have ever seen?

569
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
I like it more

570
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
than the one and only.

571
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Because it's a little space for everyone.

572
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
The one and only

573
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
of Kai's

574
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,080
is actually

575
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
the one and only of Kai's.

576
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
It's the first time

577
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
I've seen Kai's

578
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
scene

579
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
in the film.

580
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I've seen it

581
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
from a distance.

582
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
I know that Kai's

583
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
is so handsome.

584
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
It's a scene in the public road.

585
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
I think

586
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
it's the feeling

587
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
that I've been waiting for a long time

588
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,080
to see this person.

589
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
And then I saw it.

590
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
And then I saw it on the face of this girl.

591
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
It's the first time

592
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
it's the kind of

593
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,080
very sweet smile.

594
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
I think it's very deep.

595
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
I like it.

596
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
I believe that

597
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
when you're chasing,

598
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
because everyone just said

599
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
that you might have to wait

600
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
until the next few episodes

601
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
to see

602
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
the smile

603
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
you really see in his standing.

604
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
So this drama

605
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
you must follow Kai

606
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
and then

607
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
when you just said it,

608
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
I think

609
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
the feeling of our picture

610
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,080
is getting stronger.

611
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
I believe that

612
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
the fans of Mango TV

613
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
are more looking forward to it.

614
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
So this drama

615
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
you must remember

616
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
is the one and only, okay?

617
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Let's look forward to it together.

618
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
What I just said is the family business.

619
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
We can't miss

620
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
some delicious food.

621
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Then next,

622
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
we will open

623
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
the delicious banquet

624
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
with the baby in the live broadcast room.

625
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
First,

626
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
let's ask Jingyan, okay?

627
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Because in the drama,

628
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
we are a top female official

629
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
of Yao Zijing.

630
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
I believe that

631
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
there must be some

632
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
some of your own understanding.

633
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
What do you think

634
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
what kind of

635
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
dish is

636
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,080
in your heart?

637
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
After I finished this drama,

638
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I really put my heart into

639
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
the way I treat the food.

640
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
It's too difficult.

641
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
The door is too high.

642
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
I think including Yao Zijing

643
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
cooked for Zhu Zan Ji,

644
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
whether it's

645
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,080
from the season of the ingredients,

646
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
whether it's from the cold temperature,

647
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
or

648
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
to be honest,

649
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
the food is different

650
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
from the night

651
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
and the food is different.

652
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
Including the ingredients,

653
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
the medicine,

654
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
or the food is different

655
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
from the heat,

656
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
the season,

657
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
the food is very, very

658
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
there is love.

659
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
The food

660
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
with love

661
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
may be

662
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
a standard of Yao Zijing.

663
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
For me,

664
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
I can just

665
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
taste it.

666
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
There is a big difference.

667
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,080
It's the way I brush my heart.

668
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,080
With love,

669
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
the taste

670
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,080
is really warm.

671
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
It's heart.

672
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Yes, it's very heart-warming.

673
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
Because of Ji Yan's answer,

674
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
we have prepared a small

675
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
interaction with Ji Yan on the spot.

676
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
Of course, Xu Kai will also

677
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
complete it together.

678
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
Before our table,

679
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
we have to prepare

680
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
three dishes in the drama,

681
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
let's invite our director team

682
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
to come and serve the dishes.

683
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
OK.

684
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Ji Yan, can you see

685
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
the three dishes on the table?

686
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
It's very far.

687
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Very far.

688
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
I can probably see

689
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
what it is.

690
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
At least I can see

691
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
three sticks, right?

692
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Can you see the three sticks

693
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,080
and three white things?

694
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
First of all, we need

695
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Ji Yan to have three dishes.

696
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Anyway, the first one,

697
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,080
this is the second one.

698
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
This is the third dish.

699
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Come and pick one, OK?

700
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Which dish do you choose?

701
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
I'll sell a jar first.

702
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
Come and pick one, OK?

703
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
OK.

704
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
It feels like a rice with rice.

705
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
In my opinion,

706
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
the one in the middle,

707
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
the one in the back,

708
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
what is it?

709
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
OK. The third dish.

710
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Yes.

711
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Xu Kai, come and open it, OK?

712
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Yes.

713
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Let's see what it is.

714
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
OK. Maybe Ji Yan can't see it very clearly.

715
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Let me show you.

716
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
What is this?

717
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,080
This should be

718
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
a dish.

719
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
A dish?

720
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Oh.

721
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Did you have it in the drama?

722
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Yes.

723
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
Yes.

724
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Yes.

725
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Since it already has it,

726
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
it seems that it has some knowledge.

727
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Then, let's take a look at Ji Yan.

728
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
It's the feature

729
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
of the dish.

730
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Let's take a look at Zhu Zhan Ji.

731
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
The feature of the dish?

732
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
This person

733
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
not only has a appearance

734
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
that people like,

735
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
but also

736
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
has a deep inner shout.

737
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,080
He can do anything.

738
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,080
He can do eight-fifth, five-fifth,

739
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
five-fifth, two-fifth, two-fifth.

740
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
He can sing, he can dance,

741
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
he can write,

742
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
he can write, he can play the piano,

743
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
he can also

744
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
practice love.

745
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Yes.

746
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,080
Just like Zhu Zhan Ji.

747
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Very good.

748
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
I think the point is

749
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
that I can understand.

750
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
I can understand

751
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
what Ji Yan said.

752
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
He just said that the appearance is a dish.

753
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
The dish is a whole.

754
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,080
It's my skin.

755
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
And then my talent

756
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,080
represents every rice.

757
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
So it's a dish.

758
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Right?

759
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Yes.

760
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
That's what I mean.

761
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
You just said that

762
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
I have all kinds of talents.

763
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Every rice is my talent.

764
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
That's too much.

765
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
Really?

766
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
This person

767
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
is too much.

768
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
This person

769
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
has a very bright appearance.

770
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
He suddenly has a special

771
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,080
that makes people think

772
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
that the more you eat, the more fragrant,

773
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
the more you taste, the more you are more mature.

774
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Such a taste.

775
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Taste.

776
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
Taste.

777
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
I agree.

778
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
Really.

779
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
I just said that the last one is a little bit more.

780
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
He is still caring.

781
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Let's look at the other two dishes,

782
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
okay?

783
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
The two dishes you chose.

784
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
One is the early one.

785
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
The early one.

786
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
There is also a series.

787
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
This is my...

788
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
The one with the pork trotter.

789
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Right.

790
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
The key ingredient.

791
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Right.

792
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
The early one.

793
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
The other one is actually the instant noodles.

794
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
So I found that

795
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
these three dishes

796
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
are actually quite difficult.

797
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,080
But after I just passed

798
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
the performance of Jingyan,

799
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,080
I think

800
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
if Xu Kai

801
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
comes to evaluate

802
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,080
or to give a score,

803
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
if you give a score of ten,

804
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
how many points do you give?

805
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
It's all thanks to me.

806
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
It must be full.

807
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Right?

808
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,080
The performance is full, okay?

809
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
You can see that

810
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Jingyan really

811
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
praised

812
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
our heart of the pig stand.

813
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Just now,

814
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
our superior female official,

815
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
our Zijin,

816
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
is probably too professional.

817
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Just now,

818
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
we can use this word

819
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
to praise people in the kitchen.

820
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
So,

821
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
you can remember

822
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
what Jingyan just said

823
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
and put the small books.

824
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
When you are pursuing,

825
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
we will also brush the wood, okay?

826
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Next,

827
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
we will ask our Huang Taisun.

828
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
Because you must have

829
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
tried many delicious dishes.

830
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Just now, Jingyan just passed

831
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
over a thousand kinds, right?

832
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Yes, all of them.

833
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
If you want to use a dish

834
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
to evaluate

835
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Zijin,

836
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
what kind of dish

837
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
do you think Zijin is?

838
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
I think

839
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Jingyan has already

840
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
heard it.

841
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
I think Zijin

842
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
in the pig stand,

843
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
no matter what dish it is,

844
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
it's delicious.

845
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Xu Kai's answer.

846
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
Jingyan,

847
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
how do you feel about

848
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
his skin?

849
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
I'm used to it.

850
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
Xu Kai's answer

851
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
is always perfect.

852
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
Just now, Zhu Shanqi said

853
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
that

854
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
it's actually a medium-sized chicken, right?

855
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
So,

856
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
what you do

857
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
is perfect in his heart.

858
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
The same.

859
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
How can Zhu Shanqi

860
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
use a dish to describe it?

861
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Nothing is perfect

862
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,080
in his heart.

863
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
He is a talent.

864
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
He is also a genius.

865
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
He is a genius.

866
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
He is a genius.

867
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
Yes.

868
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
We have already

869
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
used the dish to describe it.

870
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
So,

871
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,080
next,

872
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,080
because of the presence of

873
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Huang Taicun,

874
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
we will also

875
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
do a five-digit

876
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
challenge

877
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
to describe

878
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
our Zijin.

879
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
The rule of this

880
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,080
interaction is

881
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Zhu Shanqi

882
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
will describe

883
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
Zijin in the sentence

884
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
which is the most sour,

885
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
sweet,

886
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
bitter,

887
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
spicy,

888
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
and salty.

889
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
We will do a

890
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
five-digit

891
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
challenge.

892
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
I think it's quite difficult.

893
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Now,

894
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Xu Kai becomes

895
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
a feeling of Zhu Shanqi.

896
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Then,

897
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
let's praise

898
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
our Zijin.

899
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
There are five flavors.

900
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
I feel that

901
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Xu Kai is sweating a little.

902
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
If you are ready,

903
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
I will start.

904
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
I am sweating.

905
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Come on, describe it.

906
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,080
It's very difficult.

907
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
The sourest,

908
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
the sweetest,

909
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
the bitter,

910
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
the salty, right?

911
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
The sourest is

912
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
when I was

913
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
in the study room,

914
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
when we were in the study room,

915
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
the team,

916
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
the sweetest,

917
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
the sweetest,

918
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
when we were in the study room,

919
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,080
I was forced to bite Zijin.

920
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,080
The sweetest place.

921
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
The bitterest is

922
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
the audience's expectation.

923
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
Let's look forward to it.

924
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
This is not the end.

925
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
The most spicy,

926
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
the most spicy is

927
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Zijin is also in the study room.

928
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Zijin is a,

929
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
yes,

930
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
but Zijin is a

931
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
career-oriented woman.

932
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
She is a career-oriented woman.

933
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
She is very strong,

934
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
strong,

935
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
very independent.

936
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Yes.

937
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
The most salty is

938
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
the saltiness, right?

939
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
She is also

940
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
refusing me.

941
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
The second refusal.

942
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Very cool.

943
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
She rejected you,

944
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
and you are not saying that it's cool,

945
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
but bitter.

946
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
I think she is very strict.

947
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
She is very handsome,

948
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
isn't she?

949
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
She is very sweet and strict.

950
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
She is very handsome.

951
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Huang Zai Sun.

952
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
I am such a

953
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
excellent person.

954
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
You actually rejected me.

955
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
I am also

956
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
confessing to you

957
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
in the study room.

958
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Yes.

959
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
In the study room.

960
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
You rejected me in the front.

961
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
This is a study room

962
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
with a five-star story.

963
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Yes.

964
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Whatever story happens in it.

965
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
So,

966
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
the sour, sweet, bitter, spicy,

967
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
salty are all in the study room,

968
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
right?

969
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Yes.

970
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,080
You can say that

971
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
you feel that

972
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
you are sweet in the drama.

973
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
But

974
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
how sweet is it?

975
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
You still have to chase after it.

976
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Huang Zai Sun just praised

977
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
the script so much.

978
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
I want to ask our script.

979
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
In your eyes,

980
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
what is the biggest advantage

981
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
of a pig's trotter?

982
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
I really can't say it.

983
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
But in this live broadcast,

984
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
I can't even turn off the live for a long time.

985
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
I think the trotter

986
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,080
is a very perfect person in my heart.

987
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Very perfect.

988
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Any girl

989
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
will think that

990
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
she is really

991
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
the person in my heart.

992
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
She has no flaws.

993
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
No flaws.

994
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
You are too official.

995
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
I want to ask you something.

996
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
I want to ask you something.

997
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
She wants to let go.

998
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
She wants to let go of herself.

999
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
She loves you very much.

1000
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
She wants to let go of herself.

1001
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
This is your style, right?

1002
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
This is a professional style.

1003
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
The more so, the more I can't walk.

1004
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Are you in a hurry?

1005
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
This is a man's style.

1006
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,080
It's not a pig's trotter's style.

1007
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
How to say?

1008
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Anyway, I think

1009
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
the trotter and the mouse

1010
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,080
are all perfect in each other's heart.

1011
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
If you hear it now,

1012
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,080
if you can take away

1013
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
a pig's trotter

1014
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
with a skill,

1015
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
what do you want to take away the most?

1016
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
A skill.

1017
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
It's not a life.

1018
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
I don't want your life.

1019
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
You have so many talents.

1020
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
Why do you want your life?

1021
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
I want to use your talents

1022
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
to my body.

1023
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
I want to keep you

1024
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
as a person.

1025
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
I'm scared.

1026
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
You want my life.

1027
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
I'll take it.

1028
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
So you want to take away

1029
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
his talent, right?

1030
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Then I'm not a person.

1031
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
You can't take it.

1032
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
I'm only rich now.

1033
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
Pig's trotter.

1034
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
It's good to have a person like you.

1035
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
You can have talent.

1036
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
You can have talent.

1037
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
I have a lot of talent, too.

1038
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm tired.

1039
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
It's perfect.

1040
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Boss,

1041
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
how can you have such a perfect pig's trotter?

1042
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Right?

1043
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,080
How can you have such a great pig's trotter?

1044
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
In the drama,

1045
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
the characteristic of pig's trotter

1046
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
is that it's a person

1047
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
who is different from others

1048
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,080
and will do different things.

1049
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
What should you do

1050
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
about pig's trotter?

1051
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
What do you think

1052
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
can you use

1053
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,080
to make a pig's trotter?

1054
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Pig's trotter,

1055
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
do you want to answer?

1056
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
I think it's hard.

1057
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
It's very hard.

1058
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
The process is very hard.

1059
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,080
Pig's trotter is very hard.

1060
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,080
You have to use your strength to make a pig's trotter.

1061
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Pig's trotter is so smart.

1062
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
He's a prince.

1063
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
He has everything.

1064
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
He's such a genius.

1065
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
He's a genius who is smart,

1066
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
talented,

1067
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
and handsome.

1068
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
What should I do?

1069
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
I'm so ashamed.

1070
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
What should I do?

1071
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Since this is the case,

1072
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,080
let's start with the position of a man.

1073
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Let's start with your own foundation.

1074
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
You have to move his position first.

1075
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Then the steps will be very strong.

1076
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Then he will tell you

1077
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
that he likes you.

1078
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
You have to express your love for him.

1079
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
The next step is more important.

1080
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,080
You have to say goodbye.

1081
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
I'm leaving.

1082
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Pig's trotter is easy to learn.

1083
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Just use a few words

1084
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
to get his position.

1085
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
It's easy to get Pig's trotter.

1086
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
It's the earliest.

1087
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,080
The earliest.

1088
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
He made a lot of food.

1089
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,080
He made a lot of food.

1090
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
And he also showed his talent.

1091
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
He gave him some words.

1092
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,080
He also drew a painting.

1093
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,080
He also played piano.

1094
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,080
He also showed his talent.

1095
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
He also showed his talent.

1096
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
But the most important thing is

1097
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
to hold his position.

1098
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Then he will hold his heart.

1099
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
For him,

1100
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
the most important thing is

1101
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,080
to do your job well.

1102
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
Then let this man

1103
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
pay attention to you.

1104
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,080
Then don't spend too much time on him.

1105
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
Just leave.

1106
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
I should not listen to this part first.

1107
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
You are so stubborn.

1108
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
I told you.

1109
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
So this is the case.

1110
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
Isn't that the same?

1111
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
You told me the same thing.

1112
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
It's okay.

1113
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
You can do what you want to do.

1114
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
I will let you go.

1115
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
It's the same.

1116
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
They are the same.

1117
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Actually, I think

1118
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
what Jinyan just said

1119
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
we can use to remember the little girls.

1120
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,080
When facing such a perfect person,

1121
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
actually, the way to use it,

1122
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
I think this trick

1123
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
can be used in reality.

1124
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
What do you think, Jinyan?

1125
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
You can buy a few more at the earliest.

1126
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
You can ask Kai.

1127
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
Do you think this trick is too much?

1128
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
I was in the drama.

1129
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
I asked him

1130
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,080
how he likes to eat the earliest.

1131
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
He said the earliest

1132
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
and my reaction was like this.

1133
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
You are such a talented person.

1134
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080
You like to eat the earliest.

1135
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
So the earliest in reality

1136
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
is not easy to control, right?

1137
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Do you think in reality

1138
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
a quick-drying dish

1139
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
can make you move a person?

1140
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
No.

1141
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
If it's Xu Kai,

1142
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
I think it's okay

1143
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
to use a kitchen knife.

1144
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Yes.

1145
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Do you know why a kitchen knife is okay?

1146
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
Because it's a person.

1147
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Because the person who makes this

1148
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
is Yao Zijing.

1149
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Yes.

1150
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Yes.

1151
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
I'm the one who is kind to Zijing.

1152
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
I can never leave Yao Zijing.

1153
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
Okay.

1154
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
Just now,

1155
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
Yao Zijing was on the way to the level of being a monster.

1156
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
He picked up a foodie.

1157
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
So is Royal Descendant a foodie?

1158
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
I think

1159
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
he is actually

1160
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
my father is a foodie.

1161
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
I think Royal Descendant

1162
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
is more interested in

1163
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
making a pig's trotter.

1164
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,080
It's not like

1165
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,080
he's not going to cook for him.

1166
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
He wants to

1167
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
use this excuse

1168
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
to meet Yao Zijing.

1169
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,080
So he has to

1170
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
make trouble for him every day

1171
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
to make him a foodie.

1172
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
Actually, it's to meet him.

1173
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
I think more important is

1174
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
not to eat

1175
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,080
but to think about him.

1176
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Because you know how to cook,

1177
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
so I just want to meet you.

1178
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,080
Then I'll say,

1179
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
you cook for me.

1180
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
Then I can meet you.

1181
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
Right?

1182
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Yes.

1183
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
Then ask Zijing yourself.

1184
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
Did you say

1185
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,080
that you want to hold a person's heart?

1186
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
First, you want to hold his stomach.

1187
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,080
You think you can accept this statement, right?

1188
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
I don't have this ability.

1189
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
I don't know how to cook.

1190
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,080
I don't have this kind of understanding.

1191
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
But for Yao Zijing,

1192
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
he is a natural human being.

1193
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
He works in the kitchen every day.

1194
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Why don't I use this food

1195
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
to enter this man first?

1196
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
Right?

1197
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,080
Just give him this kind of environment.

1198
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Just grab this opportunity.

1199
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
Just use it.

1200
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
So use your own

1201
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
self-adapt to grab

1202
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
the heart of the pig.

1203
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
Right.

1204
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
Use your own strength

1205
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,080
and your position to do these things.

1206
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
So in Love Bishagi,

1207
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
we learned today

1208
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,080
that we should use our own strength

1209
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
to show the other person.

1210
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
So I think

1211
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,080
all the fans who watch our live broadcast

1212
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
are lucky today.

1213
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Because when we are pursuing a drama,

1214
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
we actually talked about

1215
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
something that many people can learn.

1216
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Actually,

1217
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,080
from the moment Yao Zijing entered the office,

1218
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
it seems that the first-time fighter

1219
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
has already paid attention to her.

1220
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Right?

1221
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,080
This drama has already been like this.

1222
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
It can be said that

1223
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
Yao Zijing has been with Zhu Zanji all the way.

1224
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,080
From a palace maid to a female poet,

1225
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
she has grown up to be a good-looking,

1226
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
good-looking,

1227
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
and a good-looking person.

1228
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
She has witnessed her change.

1229
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,080
So I want to ask

1230
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
Xu Kai.

1231
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,080
In Zhu Zanji's role,

1232
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
or

1233
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,080
what was his favorite time

1234
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,080
for Zijing?

1235
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
What do you think?

1236
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
I think that

1237
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
every time he is with me,

1238
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
it doesn't matter.

1239
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Because no matter what his career is,

1240
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
he doesn't have my position.

1241
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
So I think that

1242
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
as long as he is with me,

1243
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
he is the person I want.

1244
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
So what he does,

1245
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
he is the one I like the most.

1246
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Right?

1247
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Because he can't be higher than me,

1248
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
so I don't care about his position.

1249
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
I just want to see

1250
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
what he is like

1251
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
in front of me.

1252
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
So what Zijing means is that

1253
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
no matter if you are a cook,

1254
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
he actually likes you.

1255
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
Because you don't care about him.

1256
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Then why did I

1257
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
spend so much time

1258
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
cooking?

1259
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
How many times have I cooked?

1260
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
How many times have I cooked?

1261
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
So I don't care about him.

1262
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
I care about you cooking for me,

1263
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,080
but I don't care about your position.

1264
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,080
Okay, the school's elder sister

1265
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
will be more and more excited.

1266
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
We must remind everyone here

1267
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
because we, Zijing and Xu Kai,

1268
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
have come to our Yunzhi broadcast room.

1269
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,080
So we have brought

1270
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
great benefits for everyone.

1271
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
Today, not only is there a Mango TV,

1272
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
but also a super discount

1273
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,080
for the online female discount

1274
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
and a special discount for the online

1275
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
online online live broadcast.

1276
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
So we will bring the online

1277
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,080
online discount for the online

1278
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
online live broadcast.

1279
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,080
We will also provide a series of

1280
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
super discounted sea bags.

1281
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
Including the lucky baby,

1282
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
we will receive

1283
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
the new and famous sea bags

1284
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
from Kai Kai and Zijing.

1285
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
So what you have to do

1286
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
is to hurry up

1287
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
and take the interactive page

1288
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
of our screen to participate in us.

1289
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,080
Okay, that's it.

1290
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,080
We just talked about

1291
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
some of the delicious things.

1292
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Today, we will

1293
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
show you our family.

1294
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
We have a family.

1295
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,080
We can't cook on the spot.

1296
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
But we can

1297
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
use another form

1298
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,080
to serve you a dish.

1299
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
Just now,

1300
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,080
I want to ask Xu Kai

1301
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,080
what is the dish you are cooking?

1302
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
I guess it must be

1303
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,080
a very fragrant dish

1304
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
and I'm very hungry.

1305
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Yes, but

1306
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
we can't cook this dish on the spot.

1307
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,080
So we have to

1308
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
use a small

1309
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
interactive way

1310
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,080
to show you the dish.

1311
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,080
Because everyone knows

1312
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
that Zijing

1313
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
is very surprised

1314
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,080
in the drama.

1315
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
First, we have to ask

1316
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
Jingyan to make a set of actions.

1317
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Xu Kai needs to

1318
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
take the steps

1319
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
to do the street simulation.

1320
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
He has to do all the

1321
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
simulation positions

1322
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
to succeed in the challenge.

1323
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,080
If you succeed in the challenge,

1324
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
Jingyan,

1325
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
you will be punished.

1326
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
But the challenge is failed.

1327
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,080
Xu Kai needs to

1328
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
do the challenge.

1329
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
I don't know if you are ready.

1330
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
I will start

1331
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
to give

1332
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Jingyan

1333
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
the street performance first.

1334
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
Jingyan.

1335
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
OK, the action.

1336
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
OK, it's easy.

1337
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,080
Watch carefully.

1338
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
Watch carefully.

1339
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Like this.

1340
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
OK.

1341
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
OK, I'm done.

1342
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Challenge failed.

1343
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
Is it easy?

1344
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
No.

1345
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
You have to

1346
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
do the street simulation.

1347
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
You failed.

1348
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
I believe

1349
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
you must have

1350
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
remembered several small actions.

1351
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,080
For example, the body,

1352
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
for example, the waist.

1353
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Yes, the first action.

1354
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
The second action.

1355
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,080
The third one.

1356
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,080
Four,

1357
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
five,

1358
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
six,

1359
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
seven,

1360
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
eight.

1361
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
You are wrong.

1362
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
You really can't save you.

1363
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
You can't save you.

1364
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Did you make a mistake?

1365
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
He didn't make a right.

1366
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
I did this first.

1367
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
I did this first.

1368
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
You are wrong.

1369
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
You failed.

1370
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
You failed.

1371
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
OK.

1372
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Jingyan, do you think

1373
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
he succeeded?

1374
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Of course not.

1375
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Xu...

1376
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
We didn't

1377
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
follow the order.

1378
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Yes, we should have failed at the beginning.

1379
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
We have to lose after doing it.

1380
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
OK, come on.

1381
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Let's take a look.

1382
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Let's see

1383
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
what kind of fan

1384
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
do you like the most.

1385
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,080
Let's go to the props, OK?

1386
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
OK.

1387
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Come on.

1388
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Xu Kai,

1389
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
you have to continue the punishment.

1390
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,080
You have to shake it, OK?

1391
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
This is our fan.

1392
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
OK, I'll tell Jingyan

1393
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
what you have, OK?

1394
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
You can shake it.

1395
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
OK.

1396
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
Good night.

1397
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Good night.

1398
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Who said this?

1399
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
The fans said it, OK?

1400
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
The fans said it.

1401
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
The fans said it.

1402
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
It's normal.

1403
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
It's normal.

1404
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
It's normal.

1405
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
It's normal.

1406
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
It's normal.

1407
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
OK.

1408
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
You have to have every version.

1409
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Good night.

1410
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
What else do you have?

1411
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
What version?

1412
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Tell me what version you have.

1413
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
It's...

1414
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
You said it very well.

1415
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,080
You have a lot of confidence.

1416
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
But for example,

1417
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
if you are going to sleep,

1418
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
for example,

1419
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
babies,

1420
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
babies, are you going to sleep?

1421
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
Babies.

1422
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
Babies.

1423
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Well,

1424
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
babies.

1425
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
For example,

1426
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
for example,

1427
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
yes,

1428
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
say more,

1429
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
it's more like

1430
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,080
a kind of sleep-dream, OK?

1431
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Because there must be a lot of people

1432
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
who will make a night sleep.

1433
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,080
We can't always

1434
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
sleep,

1435
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
OK?

1436
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,080
Add a little bit of feeling.

1437
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,080
Good night.

1438
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
Sleep tight.

1439
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
This is OK.

1440
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
This is OK.

1441
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
OK.

1442
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
OK.

1443
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
OK.

1444
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Look at the baby on the live broadcast,

1445
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
he is still energetic.

1446
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Hurry up and put him down.

1447
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
Then,

1448
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,080
make our night rain.

1449
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
OK?

1450
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
We will sleep more deliciously

1451
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
on the day of the first day.

1452
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
OK.

1453
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Then, please

1454
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
give us the second set of actions, OK?

1455
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
I remember my death this time.

1456
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Let's do it.

1457
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
It's a little bit easier, OK?

1458
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Come on.

1459
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
Let's start.

1460
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Sit down.

1461
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Sit down.

1462
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Then,

1463
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
are you done?

1464
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Yes, I'm done.

1465
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
It's very simple.

1466
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Xu Kai must be able to hold it.

1467
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
Yu Xin.

1468
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
But Jing Yan,

1469
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
do you know that

1470
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
he just did everything for you?

1471
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Let's see

1472
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
if he can do it

1473
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
for our fans, OK?

1474
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080
Cute.

1475
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
It feels like a electric power, OK?

1476
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
OK.

1477
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Xu Kai

1478
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
has done everything for you.

1479
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
And he has a very cute expression.

1480
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
This round,

1481
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
we will challenge Xu Kai.

1482
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Then,

1483
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,080
Jing Yan will be punished.

1484
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Xu Kai needs to do it.

1485
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
OK?

1486
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Let's do it.

1487
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
I'll choose one for you.

1488
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
OK.

1489
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I'll choose one for you.

1490
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Choose one.

1491
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
One,

1492
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
two,

1493
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
three.

1494
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
It's your turn.

1495
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
What did you say about the night rain?

1496
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,080
You said it to the boys.

1497
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,080
They are so noisy.

1498
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Boys.

1499
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Because they are so noisy.

1500
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
They are so noisy.

1501
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
They are so noisy.

1502
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
They can't sleep well.

1503
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Why are they so noisy?

1504
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
I just couldn't sleep well.

1505
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
You are really...

1506
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
You are so noisy.

1507
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Boys can't sleep well.

1508
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,080
I can also tell the girls.

1509
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
Right?

1510
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
There are many girls

1511
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,080
in the live room.

1512
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,080
Very good.

1513
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Come on.

1514
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Recently,

1515
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
good friends who are chasing after the top 10,

1516
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
you should pay attention to your body.

1517
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
Don't sleep too late.

1518
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
You should sleep at night.

1519
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
OK?

1520
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
Go to bed.

1521
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,080
Good night.

1522
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,080
You said it well.

1523
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Don't say it again.

1524
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
It's so official.

1525
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,080
I just changed it.

1526
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
The second version.

1527
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Come on.

1528
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
OK. Don't watch the top 10.

1529
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Watch it again.

1530
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Good night.

1531
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
OK.

1532
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Both of you have a wonderful performance.

1533
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Because they tell you

1534
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
that the top 10 is very beautiful.

1535
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
But don't be too noisy.

1536
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
OK?

1537
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,080
You should pay attention to your rest.

1538
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
OK.

1539
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Tell you that

1540
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
the top 10 is actually

1541
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
many good friends.

1542
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Actually, they also sent some blessings.

1543
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
Their heart also came to the scene.

1544
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
Let's give some blessings.

1545
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Let's have a look at them.

1546
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Let's see which of the friends

1547
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
sent the blessings.

1548
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
I am actor Wang Yizhe.

1549
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Hello, everyone.

1550
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
I am He Rui Xian.

1551
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Hello, everyone.

1552
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Hello, everyone.

1553
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,080
I am actor He Feng Tian.

1554
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,080
I am a actor who is acting in the top 10.

1555
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I am a model and a model

1556
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
who plays a role in the top 10.

1557
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
In the top 10,

1558
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,080
we will see the role of Yuan Qi.

1559
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,080
Yufan is a very good actor.

1560
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,080
He and Zhu Zhanji

1561
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
are not just a military relationship.

1562
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,560
He has a kind of

1563
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,080
heart-to-heart relationship.

1564
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Let me see how Feng Tian introduced.

1565
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
He and Yao Zijun

1566
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,080
should be

1567
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
a white moon in Yufan's heart.

1568
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
I want to keep it secretly.

1569
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
It's very similar to Zijun.

1570
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,080
We have a lot of opponents.

1571
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,080
We have been together

1572
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
from love to murder.

1573
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
We have been together for a long time.

1574
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
We become good friends.

1575
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
I am in the drama

1576
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,080
and Zhu Zhanji's relationship

1577
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,080
is actually

1578
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
the main character.

1579
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,080
I am actually

1580
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
a model and a model.

1581
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
I am actually a model and a model.

1582
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
I am actually a model and a model.

1583
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,080
He is hiding something.

1584
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
He is hiding something.

1585
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
I am a bit of a

1586
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
wild man.

1587
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Yes, yes, yes.

1588
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
I love Wu Jiwu.

1589
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,080
I want to keep Zhu Zhanji.

1590
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,080
Although I think

1591
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Zhu Zhanji is very close

1592
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
to the world and the moon,

1593
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,080
Zhu Zhanji is very close to the world and the moon,

1594
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
but Zhu Zhanji is very

1595
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
understanding of Yufan.

1596
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
So I think when Yufan

1597
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
does something bad,

1598
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
it doesn't make sense.

1599
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I want to make a complaint

1600
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
about Yao Zijun.

1601
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
Yao Zijun is too bad to Yufan.

1602
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
What is he going to make a complaint about?

1603
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
No matter how Yufan

1604
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,080
helps him or treats him,

1605
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Yao Zijun is still

1606
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,080
the only one in my heart.

1607
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
He is the one who is the best.

1608
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
Of course.

1609
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Of course.

1610
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
I will make a complaint about you.

1611
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,080
I will be polite.

1612
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
I will ask you the simplest question.

1613
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,080
If your bottle

1614
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
and Zhu Zhanji fall into the water at the same time,

1615
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
who will you save?

1616
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,080
You don't know that

1617
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,080
in the film,

1618
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
when Yin Ziping

1619
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
went to upgrade

1620
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
his dream

1621
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
and beat the monster,

1622
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
his son-in-law was

1623
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
asking for his love

1624
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
without a limit.

1625
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,080
So in front of love,

1626
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
there is love.

1627
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
It's not worth mentioning.

1628
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,080
What Xu said

1629
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
is something I have to

1630
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
do.

1631
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Xu is a famous

1632
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
school teacher.

1633
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
He is the head of the school.

1634
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
I heard that

1635
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Mr. Xu

1636
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,080
is a more magical school teacher.

1637
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I couldn't help it.

1638
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,080
I will laugh with him.

1639
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
Including Mr. Wu,

1640
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,080
Mr. Wu's hair

1641
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
was too heavy.

1642
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,080
So he

1643
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
always falls into the water

1644
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
every time he runs.

1645
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
Every time he runs,

1646
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
he falls into the water.

1647
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
So at this time,

1648
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
Mr. Xu on the stage

1649
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
will laugh at him.

1650
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
I couldn't help it.

1651
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,080
I will also laugh with him.

1652
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,080
I saw that you have good friends.

1653
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
You are actually

1654
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
in a good mood.

1655
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
You are happy.

1656
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
But you have

1657
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
some small troubles.

1658
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
As the

1659
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,080
teacher,

1660
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
do you want to

1661
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
respond to it?

1662
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Because we were talking about the drama.

1663
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,080
Only Feng Tian said

1664
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,080
I was a school teacher.

1665
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
A magic school teacher.

1666
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,080
You are too magical.

1667
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Because there are a few scenes.

1668
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,080
I am usually very serious.

1669
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
But there are a few scenes

1670
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
that are really funny.

1671
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
So I will laugh.

1672
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,080
There is a scene

1673
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
that

1674
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,080
a maid

1675
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
wants to

1676
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
defeat us.

1677
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
But

1678
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
everyone has a long dress.

1679
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,080
So when she gets up,

1680
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,080
she takes off her dress.

1681
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,080
And she runs like this

1682
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
with her dress.

1683
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
Then I can't help it.

1684
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,080
That kind of magic school student

1685
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,080
is very self-reliant.

1686
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,080
If you are on the stage,

1687
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,080
you can't show

1688
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
the school student.

1689
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,080
Yes.

1690
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,080
I can't show the performance on the stage.

1691
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
Naturally.

1692
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Naturally.

1693
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,080
Then ask Zijing.

1694
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Ask Jingyan.

1695
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
Just now,

1696
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Pingping said that if Pingping

1697
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
and Zhu Zanji

1698
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
fell into the water at the same time,

1699
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,080
who would you save?

1700
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
Do you want to respond to it?

1701
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,080
Love and love.

1702
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,080
Of course, I will save Pingping first.

1703
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,080
Of course, I will save Pingping first.

1704
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Pingping

1705
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,080
is a little...

1706
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,080
I need my wine.

1707
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,080
Zhu Zanji,

1708
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,080
he will do anything.

1709
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
He will fly you.

1710
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,080
He won't.

1711
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,080
I believe

1712
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
you will...

1713
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
You forgot

1714
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,080
that you will fly.

1715
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
I have seen it.

1716
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
When you were on the stage,

1717
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,080
right?

1718
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,080
There was a scene.

1719
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,080
He would dance.

1720
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,080
He would play

1721
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
these plays.

1722
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,080
Literature is full of talent.

1723
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,080
Literature is full of talent.

1724
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,080
Yes.

1725
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
He is a genius,

1726
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,080
okay?

1727
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,080
So your answer is

1728
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,080
to save Pingping.

1729
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,080
To save Pingping.

1730
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
Yes.

1731
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,080
Take Pingping up.

1732
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
He...

1733
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
He can't do it himself.

1734
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
He needs me.

1735
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
So actually,

1736
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Zijing

1737
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,080
is very considerate.

1738
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
Because I believe

1739
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,080
if Zijing

1740
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
has any problems,

1741
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,080
Zhu Zanji will go to save him.

1742
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
So this is the emotional line of the drama.

1743
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,080
Okay?

1744
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
Let's follow it together.

1745
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,080
Thank you for your blessings.

1746
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,080
I believe

1747
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,080
Jingyan and Xu Kai

1748
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,080
have all been accepted.

1749
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,080
Next,

1750
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
we have prepared

1751
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,080
the dishes.

1752
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Let's start

1753
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,080
to have a cup of wine

1754
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,080
while we eat.

1755
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,080
Okay?

1756
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,080
What are you eating?

1757
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
I will taste this.

1758
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
This is good.

1759
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,080
Okay.

1760
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
Then I will ask Zijing

1761
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,080
and Zhu Zanji.

1762
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,080
Okay?

1763
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,080
In this kind of role,

1764
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,080
think about

1765
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,080
the two of you

1766
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,080
in the parallel space.

1767
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,080
What kind of life

1768
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,080
do you think

1769
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,080
the big drama will be?

1770
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,080
Has anyone thought about it?

1771
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,080
Wait a minute.

1772
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,080
I will have a taste.

1773
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Jingyan.

1774
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,080
What are you eating?

1775
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,080
It feels good.

1776
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
They...

1777
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,080
They are very shallow.

1778
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,080
I think

1779
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,080
they will be happy.

1780
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,080
Very happy.

1781
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,080
And then

1782
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Zicun is full of sugar.

1783
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,080
And then in the palace,

1784
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,080
I cook for you.

1785
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,080
You give me a cloth.

1786
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,080
You sing the kind of

1787
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,080
beautiful

1788
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,080
fairy-tale life

1789
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,080
that I play.

1790
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,080
The kind of life

1791
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,080
that makes people envy

1792
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,080
the kind of life after marriage.

1793
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,080
That's it.

1794
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,080
After marriage?

1795
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,080
Oh, you know it again, right?

1796
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,080
No, no, no.

1797
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,080
This is the big drama

1798
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
that you created.

1799
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,080
It's okay.

1800
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
Okay.

1801
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,080
So it's

1802
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,080
the big drama

1803
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
that you imagined, right?

1804
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,080
It's very, very happy.

1805
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,080
What kind of man and woman?

1806
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,080
What kind of cooking?

1807
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,080
I'll make a cloth.

1808
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,080
You pick the cloth, I pick the water.

1809
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,080
That's not going to happen.

1810
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,080
Then

1811
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,080
Zhu Lanji

1812
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,080
is very...

1813
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
Very difficult.

1814
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,080
Very difficult.

1815
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,080
Yes, yes, yes.

1816
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,080
There's a group of people

1817
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,080
behind you

1818
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,080
to pick the cloth for you, right?

1819
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,080
I think it's

1820
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,080
in the book.

1821
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,080
I read the book, you draw,

1822
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,080
and I play the piano, you play the violin,

1823
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,080
and I can always eat

1824
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,080
what you cook.

1825
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,080
And I take you to the sea of ​​the clouds.

1826
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,080
You...

1827
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,080
Yes, you're like me.

1828
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,080
A series.

1829
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,080
Yes.

1830
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,080
A series.

1831
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,080
That's because

1832
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,080
the relationship between the two

1833
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,080
in the drama.

1834
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,080
So the big drama

1835
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,080
is usually like this.

1836
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,080
It's usually like this.

1837
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,080
It's like this.

1838
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,080
It's all more sweet, right?

1839
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,080
But what's the big drama like?

1840
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
We can only know

1841
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,080
when we chase after it.

1842
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,080
I hope there's a big ending like this.

1843
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,080
Okay.

1844
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,080
That's the second question.

1845
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,080
It's also what the fans want to know.

1846
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,080
If you can spend a day

1847
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
with the other person

1848
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
in real life,

1849
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,080
what do you think

1850
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,080
will happen?

1851
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,080
Is it in Xu Kai's life

1852
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,080
or in Zhu Lanji's life?

1853
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,080
Zhu Lanji appeared

1854
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,080
in your life.

1855
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,080
In the 21st century of China.

1856
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,080
Oh, like this?

1857
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,080
You lost 21.

1858
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,080
In 2022.

1859
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,080
Really.

1860
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,080
It's clear.

1861
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,080
It's clear.

1862
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,080
You're dancing.

1863
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,080
Hello.

1864
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:37,080
Congratulations.

1865
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,080
I don't know if you've heard

1866
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,080
our voice.

1867
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,080
Actually,

1868
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,080
it's a hidden welfare part

1869
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,080
in our live broadcast room.

1870
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,080
During the live broadcast,

1871
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,080
as long as the two of you

1872
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,080
receive our welfare key words,

1873
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,080
we will trigger our welfare mechanism.

1874
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,080
So congratulations to

1875
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
the two members of this round

1876
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,080
or welfare.

1877
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,080
So, the most important thing is that

1878
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,080
we've shown you

1879
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,080
our screen below.

1880
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,080
Congratulations.

1881
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
Oh.

1882
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,080
It's fun.

1883
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,080
It's so fun.

1884
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,080
It's so fun.

1885
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,080
I'm very happy

1886
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,080
to be in Zhu Lanji.

1887
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,080
It should be

1888
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,080
like opening your eyes.

1889
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,080
And then...

1890
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,080
How did you spend the day with her?

1891
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,080
With her.

1892
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,080
With her to play.

1893
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,080
With her to eat.

1894
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,080
With her to eat.

1895
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,080
We're eating now.

1896
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,080
And then...

1897
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,080
We're going shopping.

1898
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,080
You're going shopping with her, right?

1899
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,080
No.

1900
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,080
I'll take you to make a hairstyle.

1901
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,080
Take your hair down.

1902
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,080
But your hair...

1903
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,080
Yes.

1904
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,080
It's very important.

1905
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,080
Take your hair down.

1906
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,080
Yes.

1907
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,080
Take your hair down.

1908
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,080
Take your hair down.

1909
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,080
Take your hair down.

1910
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,080
And then make a hairstyle.

1911
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,080
I think...

1912
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,080
Zhu Lanji is so happy.

1913
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,080
It should be the happiest day of his life.

1914
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,080
Because...

1915
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,080
It's not like...

1916
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,080
when you're a prince,

1917
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,080
you'll be very tired.

1918
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,080
But when you're in the present,

1919
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,080
your hair will be very fresh.

1920
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,080
Xu Kai, you think...

1921
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,080
I was killed by my grandpa.

1922
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,080
Maybe you don't want to go back.

1923
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,080
I...

1924
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,080
I'll definitely bring...

1925
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,080
Zijing...

1926
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,080
to visit the wedding hall.

1927
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,080
To visit the wedding hall.

1928
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,080
Let me show her.

1929
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,080
She was living in Zhu Lanji's place.

1930
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,080
She came to the wedding hall.

1931
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,080
This is also my place.

1932
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,080
It's also my same place.

1933
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,080
Let me feel it for you.

1934
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,080
She's not a demon.

1935
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,080
It's okay.

1936
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,080
But she's different from the past.

1937
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,080
Different from the past.

1938
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,080
Yes.

1939
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,080
It's like we're back home.

1940
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,080
But...

1941
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,080
You're not in Zhu Lanji's team.

1942
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,080
You're in Xu Kai's team.

1943
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,080
I found that Xu Kai is more powerful...

1944
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,080
in the present.

1945
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,080
You can feel that he's got everything.

1946
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,080
You can go to the famous court.

1947
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,080
You can go to Song Dynasty.

1948
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,080
You can see the ceremony...

1949
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,080
He's got a lot of things to do in the wedding hall.

1950
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,080
What?

1951
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,080
I'm starting to lie.

1952
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,080
What kind of ceremony?

1953
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,080
What kind of ceremony?

1954
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,080
What kind of celebrity?

1955
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,080
I'll take you to a car.

1956
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,080
I'll go to the wedding hall.

1957
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,080
To the wedding hall.

1958
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,080
It's really a great story.

1959
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,080
I'll take you to the wedding hall.

1960
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,080
You'll be a fan of the wedding hall.

1961
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,080
I'll take you to a wedding hall.

1962
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,080
Okay.

1963
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,080
I'll show you a commercial.

1964
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,080
I'll take you to a car.

1965
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,080
Thank you, Xu Kai.

1966
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,080
I'm very supportive of you.

1967
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,080
I'm very supportive.

1968
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,080
I'm so touched.

1969
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,080
I was very happy to talk about it.

1970
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,080
We just received a message.

1971
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,080
The fans have named the drama...

1972
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,080
called Golden Flower.

1973
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,080
It's a rich story.

1974
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,080
What do you think is the difference...

1975
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:34,080
between a CP and other dramas?

1976
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,080
Or what do you think...

1977
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,080
is the way you two are...

1978
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,080
in the relationship?

1979
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,080
I think they are...

1980
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,080
the high-quality love CP.

1981
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,080
They are very good.

1982
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,080
They are the kind of...

1983
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,080
who pull the high-level high-level high-level...

1984
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,080
and play the big ones.

1985
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,080
They are the CP of the fight between...

1986
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,080
each other.

1987
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,080
It's the feeling of the high-level high-level team.

1988
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,080
So they look good.

1989
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,080
What about Xu Kai?

1990
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,080
Yes, actually, like Jingyan said,

1991
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,080
it's like...

1992
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,080
a man and a woman.

1993
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,080
They are good together.

1994
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,080
They are good together.

1995
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,080
They are good together.

1996
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,080
They grow together.

1997
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,080
I think the way of love...

1998
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,080
if you want to stay together for a long time,

1999
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,080
you should be like this.

2000
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,080
The feeling of the opponent.

2001
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,080
Yes, exactly.

2002
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,080
So the more you get over it,

2003
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,080
the more you feel it.

2004
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,080
Right?

2005
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,080
Okay.

2006
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
I want to ask Jingyan...

2007
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,080
a lot of fans...

2008
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,080
at this time.

2009
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,080
This drama is...

2010
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,080
for professional food production...

2011
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,080
and shooting.

2012
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,080
Is there any way...

2013
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,080
to control your body...

2014
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,080
in the process of shooting?

2015
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,080
Actually, when I was in the show,

2016
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,080
I was the thinnest one...

2017
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,080
during the shooting.

2018
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,080
Because before the shooting,

2019
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,080
I cut down...

2020
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,080
about 5-6 jin.

2021
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:46,080
I was even thinner than before.

2022
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,080
I think...

2023
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,080
the reason why Yao Zijin is so thin...

2024
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,080
is that she shouldn't be too round.

2025
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,080
Not only on the body,

2026
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,080
but also on the makeup.

2027
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,080
It's the same as Mr. Zhao Xing's.

2028
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,080
The whole eye and lipstick...

2029
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,080
are very red.

2030
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,080
But it's almost like...

2031
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,080
the front of the makeup.

2032
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,080
The part of the upper body.

2033
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,080
Actually, she is a...

2034
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,080
a maid.

2035
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,080
She cooks in the kitchen.

2036
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,080
She has a good position.

2037
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,080
She has a good body.

2038
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,080
This person seems to be...

2039
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,080
a little bit more brazen and filial.

2040
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,080
She's the one who picked the right one.

2041
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,080
I also add a little bit to this question.

2042
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,080
I also want to play a role.

2043
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,080
Because Zhu Zhanji...

2044
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,080
can't be too filial.

2045
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,080
Because of his body and environment.

2046
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
So I...

2047
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,080
I really...

2048
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,080
I really have a good body.

2049
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,080
Just to be more round.

2050
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,080
Okay.

2051
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,080
Then the stage was a bit heavy.

2052
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,080
Okay.

2053
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,080
What was the heaviest thing...

2054
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,080
you had?

2055
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,080
How many kilos?

2056
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,080
You said the heaviest thing.

2057
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,080
I usually have 95 kilos.

2058
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,080
When I first started the show,

2059
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,080
I picked up 8...

2060
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,080
No, I was wrong.

2061
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,080
We usually don't have that many.

2062
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,080
We usually have 90 kilos.

2063
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,080
When I started the show,

2064
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,080
I picked up 8, 25 kilos.

2065
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,080
I picked up 5, 6.

2066
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,080
I picked up 5 kilos.

2067
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,080
Then I didn't hold it in place.

2068
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Because it was too cold.

2069
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
I ate it.

2070
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,080
Then my body was also fine.

2071
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,080
Then I started to train.

2072
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,080
I started to train slowly.

2073
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,080
I started to train slowly.

2074
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,080
Because it was a bit heavy.

2075
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,080
This show is actually a bit hard work.

2076
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,080
Right?

2077
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,080
Then I just received it.

2078
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,080
Because there are many delicious food inside.

2079
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,080
The props inside...

2080
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,080
should be very attractive.

2081
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,080
Who is the props to answer the questions?

2082
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,080
The two of you.

2083
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,080
Of course it's him.

2084
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,080
I didn't eat it.

2085
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,080
I made it for him.

2086
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,080
I saw him eating it.

2087
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,080
I saw him eating it.

2088
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Is it delicious?

2089
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,080
I always eat hot pot.

2090
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:28,080
I let them cook for me.

2091
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,080
I haven't started filming yet.

2092
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,080
I really eat it.

2093
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,080
Really.

2094
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,080
I really eat it.

2095
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,080
I really eat it.

2096
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,080
I really eat it.

2097
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,080
Will hot pot...

2098
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,080
be a bit swollen after eating it?

2099
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,080
It's a combination of character and character.

2100
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,080
It's a combination of character and character.

2101
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,080
It's a combination of character and character.

2102
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,080
Right.

2103
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:48,080
It's like the sun.

2104
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,080
Then it's like the emperor.

2105
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,080
It's also...

2106
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,080
You did a lot of hard work.

2107
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,080
Yes.

2108
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,080
You did a lot of work.

2109
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,080
You did a lot of work for Lei.

2110
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,080
Yes.

2111
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,080
Then ask Zijing.

2112
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,080
In the drama,

2113
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,080
Zhu Zhanji and You Yifan.

2114
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
Who is better at acting?

2115
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,080
Kai, I can't say anything here.

2116
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,080
Of course, Zhu Zhanji.

2117
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,080
The first man to act in the world.

2118
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,080
The first excellent man.

2119
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,080
Every woman loves that kind of man.

2120
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,080
No one else.

2121
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,080
What do you think

2122
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,080
is the most attractive thing about him?

2123
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,080
What is the appearance?

2124
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,080
The most attractive thing about Zhu Zhanji

2125
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,080
is Xu Kaiyan.

2126
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,080
No, you're the most.

2127
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,080
The most attractive.

2128
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,080
Right?

2129
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,080
He's very sweet.

2130
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,080
He's very happy.

2131
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,080
He's very sweet.

2132
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,080
He's very sweet.

2133
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,080
If you encounter

2134
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,080
these two types of men in reality,

2135
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,080
who do you think

2136
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,080
will be more welcomed

2137
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,080
in real life?

2138
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Of course, Zhu Zhanji.

2139
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,080
In the drama,

2140
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,080
Yao Zijing has no idea

2141
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,080
about You Yifan.

2142
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,080
She has a half point

2143
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,080
about You Yifan.

2144
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
She's thinking about

2145
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,080
how to do it.

2146
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,080
She's never been there.

2147
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,080
She has a heart.

2148
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,080
Of course.

2149
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,080
And she has a heart.

2150
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,080
Who do you choose?

2151
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,080
Of course, I choose...

2152
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,080
Right.

2153
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,080
Zhu Zhanji.

2154
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,080
You Yifan is a treasure.

2155
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,080
Which one do you choose?

2156
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,080
Because some girls

2157
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,080
lack sense of security.

2158
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,080
They think

2159
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,080
some people

2160
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,080
can protect them.

2161
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,080
Because they're perfect.

2162
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,080
They think they don't deserve it.

2163
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,080
They can only protect you.

2164
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,080
It's just that

2165
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,080
many girls

2166
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,080
don't deserve it.

2167
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,080
Let me ask Yao Zijing.

2168
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,080
Through this skill

2169
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,080
she can go to the top

2170
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,080
step by step.

2171
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,080
Can you tell us

2172
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,080
how Yao Zijing

2173
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,080
has encountered

2174
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,080
some difficulties

2175
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,080
on the way to the top?

2176
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
How did she

2177
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,080
solve your workplace crisis?

2178
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,080
There are many people

2179
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,080
who think

2180
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,080
they don't want Yao Zijing to be good.

2181
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,080
There will be.

2182
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,080
That's the case.

2183
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,080
She's very sensitive.

2184
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,080
Her workplace experience.

2185
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,080
Anyway, after she entered the palace,

2186
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
she doesn't like

2187
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
her eyes.

2188
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,080
She doesn't say

2189
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,080
who to rely on

2190
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,080
or who doesn't rely on.

2191
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,080
She's only fighting alone.

2192
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,080
The most important thing is

2193
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
her ability.

2194
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,080
Her job as a cook.

2195
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,080
She's done this.

2196
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,080
She'll have a chance later.

2197
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,080
Someone will appreciate her.

2198
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,080
It's also because of this skill

2199
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,080
that she's in the kitchen.

2200
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,080
She's done her work.

2201
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,080
It's important.

2202
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,080
She's done it on her own.

2203
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,080
She's done it on her own.

2204
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,080
She's done it in a hurry.

2205
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,080
She'll be appreciated

2206
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,080
and found out.

2207
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
Yes. She's done it on her own.

2208
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,080
She's done it on her own.

2209
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,080
She's done it on her own.

2210
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,080
She's done it on her own.

2211
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,080
It's like the original.

2212
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,080
Okay?

2213
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,080
I think this is the reason

2214
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,080
that you can

2215
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,080
have such a good reason.

2216
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,080
Then, Xu Kai,

2217
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,080
which one of your roles

2218
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,080
is the most suitable for marriage?

2219
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,080
I think everyone is suitable for marriage.

2220
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,080
I think this should be asked to the audience

2221
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:50,080
which one is more suitable for marriage.

2222
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,080
Right?

2223
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:53,080
Let's give it a try.

2224
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,080
Okay?

2225
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,080
Our fans,

2226
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,080
which one is the most suitable for marriage?

2227
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,080
If you ask me,

2228
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,080
we'll definitely think

2229
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,080
Zhu Zhanji is the most suitable for marriage.

2230
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,080
Do you agree?

2231
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,080
She's good at acting.

2232
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,080
I think it's...

2233
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
She has her own characteristics

2234
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,080
in every single one of her roles.

2235
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,080
She's so good at acting.

2236
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,080
They're perfect.

2237
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,080
Perfect.

2238
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,080
They're the ones that people will like.

2239
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,080
Zhu Zhanji and Yao Zijin

2240
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,080
are often

2241
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,080
exchanged through drawing.

2242
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,080
There are many such scenes, right?

2243
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,080
You can draw

2244
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,080
two new characters on the spot,

2245
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,080
okay?

2246
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,080
You can also be a blessing

2247
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
for your fans.

2248
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Let's see what it is.

2249
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,080
It's soul drawing.

2250
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,080
Let's take a look at the props.

2251
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,080
Okay?

2252
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,080
Let's get ready.

2253
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
Thank you.

2254
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,080
You don't need to draw.

2255
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,080
I won't draw either.

2256
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,080
You draw.

2257
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
I won't, right?

2258
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,080
You can do this.

2259
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,080
Because

2260
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,080
Xu Kai needs to draw

2261
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,080
with Jingyan now.

2262
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,080
He needs to draw

2263
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,080
a few lines.

2264
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,080
I think you can give him

2265
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,080
some tips

2266
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,080
or...

2267
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,080
Because he's drawing

2268
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,080
Zijin's feelings.

2269
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,080
So I think

2270
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,080
you can give him some tips.

2271
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,080
No.

2272
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,080
My tips

2273
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,080
are completely

2274
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,080
unimaginable.

2275
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,080
I'm very sorry.

2276
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,080
He's so stupid.

2277
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,080
What am I?

2278
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,080
I can't

2279
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,080
interfere with him.

2280
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,080
Right.

2281
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,080
It's like this.

2282
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,080
You draw by hand.

2283
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,080
You're born like this.

2284
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,080
You don't draw?

2285
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,080
I don't.

2286
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,080
I'll wait for you to draw.

2287
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,080
He should draw

2288
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,080
a mouth or a head.

2289
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,080
Otherwise,

2290
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,080
I'll draw a head

2291
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,080
that's very high.

2292
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,080
And then wear a skirt.

2293
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
I think

2294
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,080
you can imagine it.

2295
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,080
You imagined too much.

2296
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,080
This is not...

2297
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,080
I can't draw.

2298
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,080
What else?

2299
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,080
I'll see.

2300
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,080
Did you draw

2301
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,080
both of them?

2302
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,080
Or did you draw only one?

2303
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,080
He and I...

2304
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,080
I drew by hand.

2305
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
I can only say

2306
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,080
it's a genius.

2307
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,080
A genius painter.

2308
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,080
I can only say...

2309
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,080
It's just a exhibition.

2310
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,080
I can't see.

2311
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,080
Can't see?

2312
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,080
I can't see.

2313
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,080
Look.

2314
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,080
We'll try to promote it.

2315
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,080
This is Zijin.

2316
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,080
No, this is me.

2317
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,080
This is me.

2318
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,080
How do you say

2319
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,080
you can give him a big punch?

2320
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,080
You can see it clearly.

2321
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,080
You can see it clearly.

2322
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,080
This is a house, right?

2323
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Yes.

2324
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
There are many holes in his head.

2325
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,080
There are various holes in his head.

2326
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,080
Yes.

2327
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,080
So this is Zijin.

2328
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,080
I...

2329
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,080
This hat is not well drawn.

2330
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,080
It's just that...

2331
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,080
a guanmou.

2332
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,080
So you drew his gold.

2333
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,080
So this is a hat.

2334
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,080
Head.

2335
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,080
Yes.

2336
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,080
I won't draw anything else.

2337
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,080
Other things are like

2338
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,080
eyes, nose,

2339
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,080
including the hands and feet.

2340
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,080
Actually, they are all the same.

2341
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,080
Because they belong to the high-end.

2342
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,080
Yes.

2343
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,080
This is really high.

2344
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:54,080
Okay.

2345
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,080
Since this is our live drawing,

2346
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,080
can you sign your name?

2347
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,080
Okay.

2348
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,080
It's also a blessing

2349
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,080
for our fans.

2350
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,080
Because we just said

2351
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,080
that there will be many blessings

2352
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,080
for everyone today.

2353
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,080
Okay.

2354
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
Okay, a soul drawing.

2355
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,080
Okay.

2356
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,080
A soul drawing.

2357
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,080
A soul drawing.

2358
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,080
Not bad.

2359
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,080
Okay.

2360
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,080
Thank you, thank you, Xu Kai.

2361
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,080
Okay, thank you.

2362
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,080
Thank you.

2363
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,080
That's really

2364
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,080
18.5 billion.

2365
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,080
Okay.

2366
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,080
Please burn it later.

2367
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,080
No, no, no.

2368
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,080
We won't hide it.

2369
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,080
It's too ugly.

2370
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:26,080
We will definitely hide it.

2371
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,080
Then, let's ask our fans,

2372
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,080
baby,

2373
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,080
Xu Kai,

2374
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,080
when did you post your VLOG?

2375
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,080
But your answer is

2376
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,080
these two days.

2377
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,080
Then, please ask,

2378
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:37,080
which day is these two days?

2379
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,080
I just wanted to say these two days.

2380
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,080
Okay.

2381
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,080
Then,

2382
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,080
two days later,

2383
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,080
two days later, it will be very fast.

2384
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,080
Yes.

2385
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,080
It will be very fast.

2386
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,080
It's already prepared.

2387
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,080
It will be released in two days.

2388
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,080
Please look forward to it.

2389
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,080
It's like a ten-minute long one.

2390
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,080
Let me tell you.

2391
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,080
It looks very useful.

2392
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,080
Ten-minute short-circuit.

2393
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,080
If you all come together

2394
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,080
to monitor Xu Kai, okay?

2395
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,080
If you look at

2396
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,080
our live broadcast,

2397
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,080
you must go to see

2398
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,080
if there is any VLOG.

2399
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,080
I hope that

2400
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,080
Xu Kai can do more business, okay?

2401
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,080
I hope that he can bring more fans

2402
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,080
and more support.

2403
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
Okay.

2404
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,080
Okay, thank you for your sharing.

2405
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,080
Since the beginning of the live broadcast,

2406
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,080
many fans and fans have been interested and loved.

2407
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,080
Today,

2408
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,080
they have participated in

2409
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,080
our Yunbing class

2410
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,080
to see our live broadcast.

2411
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,080
Then, at this time,

2412
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,080
let's continue

2413
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,080
to watch our live broadcast

2414
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,080
with all of us.

2415
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,080
Let's drink together.

2416
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,080
Let's drink.

2417
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,080
Let's drink.

2418
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,080
Let's drink.

2419
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,080
Let's drink.

2420
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,080
Let's drink.

2421
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,080
Let's drink.

2422
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,080
I hope that you can

2423
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,080
enjoy the food more, okay?

2424
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,080
I hope that you can

2425
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,080
chase after it.

2426
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,080
I hope that you can chase after it.

2427
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,080
Next,

2428
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,080
it's time for

2429
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,080
our very sweet time.

2430
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,080
It's called

2431
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,080
the dessert time for the banquet.

2432
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,080
We just drank water.

2433
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,080
We must

2434
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,080
want to eat something.

2435
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,080
We will enter

2436
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,080
an interesting part.

2437
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
We will taste

2438
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,080
five kinds of sweets

2439
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,080
once a year.

2440
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,080
What Xu Kai

2441
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,080
needs to do is

2442
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,080
to guess

2443
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,080
what kind of taste

2444
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,080
he eats.

2445
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,080
Let's show you

2446
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,080
which kind of sweets.

2447
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,080
Our five sweets

2448
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,080
have been

2449
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,080
placed in...

2450
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,080
What's wrong, Xu Kai?

2451
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,080
Xu Kai,

2452
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,080
you want to give the reaction, right?

2453
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,080
No, no, no.

2454
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,080
I'm going to be late.

2455
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,080
Our props

2456
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,080
have been placed in.

2457
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,080
We just said

2458
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,080
five kinds of sweets.

2459
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,080
Among them,

2460
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,080
there are lemon candy,

2461
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,080
durian candy,

2462
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,080
跳跳 candy,

2463
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,080
air candy,

2464
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,080
and a lotus candy.

2465
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,080
Air candy

2466
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,080
actually

2467
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,080
doesn't have anything inside.

2468
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,080
It's going to be a food show.

2469
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,080
So,

2470
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:33,080
we have a little bit of

2471
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,080
test

2472
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,080
for Jingyan.

2473
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,080
Jingyan needs to

2474
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,080
use your acting skills, okay?

2475
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,080
It's too difficult.

2476
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:39,080
If Xu Kai

2477
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,080
guesses any of them,

2478
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,080
Jingyan can

2479
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:44,080
choose a candy for him.

2480
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,080
Let him eat it right away.

2481
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,080
Okay.

2482
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,080
Okay, if Jingyan

2483
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,080
is ready,

2484
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,080
let's start.

2485
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,080
Okay.

2486
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,080
One more.

2487
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,080
One by one.

2488
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,080
Then, at this time,

2489
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,080
he needs to close his eyes.

2490
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,080
No, no, no.

2491
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,080
Two.

2492
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,080
Two.

2493
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,080
Okay.

2494
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,080
I'll close my eyes first.

2495
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,080
Close your eyes.

2496
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,080
Okay.

2497
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,080
I'll try to close my eyes.

2498
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,080
Okay, I'll finally eat something.

2499
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,080
Okay.

2500
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,080
All of our audience

2501
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,080
knows about it.

2502
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,080
It looks so delicious.

2503
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,080
Two.

2504
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,080
Okay, let's start.

2505
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:26,080
Okay, Xu Kai, please open your eyes.

2506
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,080
What expression?

2507
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,080
Why can't I?

2508
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,080
Pili Pala.

2509
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,080
You want to lie to me?

2510
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,080
Pili Pala said it all.

2511
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,080
You want me to say it out loud?

2512
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,080
I'm very good at this.

2513
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,080
Close your eyes.

2514
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,080
Close your eyes.

2515
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,080
It must be...

2516
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,080
What's the name of the candy?

2517
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,080
It's sweet.

2518
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,080
Sweet.

2519
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,080
Cotton candy, right?

2520
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,080
Okay, the last answer you give is

2521
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,080
three, two, one.

2522
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,080
Cotton candy.

2523
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,080
You are...

2524
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:00,080
I'm so nervous.

2525
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,080
Jingyan.

2526
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,080
The last answer Xu Kai gave is

2527
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,080
cotton candy.

2528
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,080
Don't you believe me?

2529
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,080
Do you believe me?

2530
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,080
I thought you were lying to me.

2531
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,080
Are you really a candy?

2532
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:15,080
Look, the real one is...

2533
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,080
You swear that you are a candy?

2534
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,080
I'm telling you, I'm not a candy.

2535
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,080
I'm saying it's a cotton candy.

2536
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,080
You don't believe me.

2537
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:26,080
Jingyan, you are so sincere.

2538
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,080
Why do you think Xu Kai is a cotton candy?

2539
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,080
Why?

2540
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,080
I'm so sincere.

2541
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,080
I'm crying.

2542
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,080
So, the first one is a challenge.

2543
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:39,080
Okay, Jingyan,

2544
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:41,080
you can pick a candy

2545
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,080
and let Xu Kai eat it.

2546
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,080
You can pick a candy, too.

2547
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,080
I'll pick a candy, too.

2548
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,080
Yes, pick a candy.

2549
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,080
Here, okay?

2550
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,080
You can feel it, too.

2551
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,080
We used to love this candy the most.

2552
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,080
I haven't had it for a long time.

2553
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,080
It's delicious.

2554
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,080
Really?

2555
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,080
Yes, it should be delicious.

2556
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,080
This is a punishment.

2557
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,080
It's not a punishment.

2558
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,080
I think so, too.

2559
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,080
But there's no way to

2560
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,080
pick a candy at Jingyan's scene.

2561
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,080
Look, he doesn't believe me.

2562
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,080
He doesn't believe this candy.

2563
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:18,080
It's a candy for Xu Kai.

2564
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,080
It feels like a musical.

2565
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,080
It's so cute.

2566
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:21,080
It's so cute.

2567
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,080
It's so cute.

2568
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,080
It's so cute.

2569
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,080
I can hear the sound.

2570
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,080
I can smell the food.

2571
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,080
What's the smell?

2572
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,080
It's not a smell.

2573
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,080
It's not a strawberry smell.

2574
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,080
But it's like a fart.

2575
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,080
It's very farty.

2576
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,080
I think it's bigger.

2577
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,080
It's much bigger than you.

2578
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:38,080
Bro, you...

2579
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,080
You only ate a piece.

2580
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,080
It's half a liter.

2581
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,080
I ate half a bag of fart.

2582
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,080
You just don't believe me.

2583
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,080
There's no way.

2584
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,080
It's useless to eat more.

2585
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,080
I don't know if Xu Kai

2586
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,080
will take the second challenge.

2587
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,080
Let's see if you believe Jingyan.

2588
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,080
Okay?

2589
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,080
Okay.

2590
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,080
Close your eyes.

2591
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,080
Please close your eyes.

2592
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,080
I'm sure you'll believe me this time.

2593
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,080
Come on.

2594
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,080
Don't trust me.

2595
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,080
Jingyan is sincere for the first time.

2596
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,080
Let's see what the second time

2597
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,080
will be like.

2598
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,080
I'm a person who doesn't deserve to believe me.

2599
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,080
I'm sure you'll believe me this time.

2600
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,080
Come on.

2601
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,080
How can you play this?

2602
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:20,080
This thing.

2603
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,080
This is very difficult.

2604
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,080
This is my punishment.

2605
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,080
You're a director.

2606
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,080
You're a director.

2607
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,080
Really?

2608
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,080
Let's see what Jingyan will say.

2609
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,080
Let's see what she'll say.

2610
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,080
Okay?

2611
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:33,080
Let's see what she'll say.

2612
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,080
Xu Kai.

2613
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,080
I'm thinking.

2614
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,080
Don't move.

2615
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,080
I'll find something.

2616
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,080
Okay.

2617
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,080
Think about it.

2618
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,080
Give me one.

2619
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:45,080
Okay, I got it.

2620
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,080
Yes, give me one.

2621
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,080
I found something that can help me.

2622
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,080
Open your eyes.

2623
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,080
Okay.

2624
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,080
Xu Kai, please open your eyes.

2625
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,080
Open your eyes.

2626
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,080
You want to lie to me again?

2627
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,080
You...

2628
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,080
You said it.

2629
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,080
This thing.

2630
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,080
The thing that's in it.

2631
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,080
This is the candy.

2632
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,080
I was thinking about saying cotton candy.

2633
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,080
Do you believe it?

2634
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,080
Do you believe it?

2635
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,080
Really?

2636
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,080
It's been a long time since I've thought about it.

2637
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,080
I'm so confident.

2638
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,080
I think you don't believe me.

2639
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,080
You don't believe me?

2640
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,080
No, I don't.

2641
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,080
I'm just concerned about you.

2642
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,080
You need to confirm it.

2643
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,080
Cotton candy.

2644
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,080
Do you really believe it?

2645
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,080
I do.

2646
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,080
You really believe me?

2647
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,080
You're thinking about it.

2648
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,080
I don't believe you.

2649
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:34,080
Cotton candy.

2650
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,080
The answer you're giving is...

2651
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,080
Cotton candy.

2652
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,080
Cotton candy.

2653
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,080
It's a brother.

2654
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,080
It's a brother.

2655
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,080
It's a brother.

2656
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,080
It's a friend.

2657
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,080
You're really good at it, Xu Kai.

2658
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:52,080
Okay, the first time...

2659
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,080
The second time,

2660
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,080
the first time I didn't guess right.

2661
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,080
The second time, I guessed right.

2662
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,080
Jingyan,

2663
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,080
Xu Kai guessed right.

2664
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,080
The third time,

2665
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,080
the real one,

2666
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,080
the real one,

2667
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,080
the one with the eye,

2668
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:04,080
okay?

2669
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,080
Don't give any hint.

2670
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,080
How is it?

2671
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,080
Okay, take my props away.

2672
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:10,080
Take my straw.

2673
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,080
Come on.

2674
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,080
The third one.

2675
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,080
Okay, the third one.

2676
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,080
I really don't want to eat this.

2677
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,080
I'm a little scared of this taste.

2678
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,080
It's really my punishment.

2679
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,080
Oh my god.

2680
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,080
You'll have a round later.

2681
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,080
This taste.

2682
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,080
You eat it first.

2683
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,080
You eat it first.

2684
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,080
This is...

2685
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,080
Cotton candy.

2686
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,080
I hate this taste the most.

2687
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,080
I really don't like this taste.

2688
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:33,080
I can't.

2689
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,080
I give up.

2690
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,080
It's my punishment.

2691
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,080
Because cotton candy is like stinky tofu.

2692
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,080
Some people like it.

2693
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,080
They don't like it.

2694
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,080
This taste is bigger than fruit.

2695
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,080
The cotton candy inside is too strong.

2696
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,080
Okay, let's do this.

2697
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,080
Xu Kai,

2698
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,080
how about you

2699
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,080
perform a performance

2700
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,080
for Jingyan?

2701
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,080
Okay.

2702
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,080
Okay, close your eyes.

2703
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:53,080
Okay.

2704
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,080
It's the same.

2705
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,080
Okay?

2706
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,080
Come on.

2707
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,080
Look at how you treat Xu Kai.

2708
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,080
How do you treat Jingyan?

2709
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,080
Let's take a look.

2710
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,080
I'm eating.

2711
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,080
What?

2712
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,080
What are you eating?

2713
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,080
I'm eating.

2714
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,080
I'm eating.

2715
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,080
I'm eating.

2716
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,080
I don't believe you.

2717
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,080
I don't believe him.

2718
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,080
He ate it.

2719
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,080
Tiao Tiao Tang.

2720
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,080
Cotton candy.

2721
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,080
Okay, the last one

2722
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,080
we give Jingyan is

2723
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:38,080
3, 2, 1.

2724
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,080
Cotton candy.

2725
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,080
Congratulations, Jingyan.

2726
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,080
You can eat a cotton candy.

2727
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:44,080
Is it sour?

2728
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,080
No, it's cotton candy.

2729
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,080
You're wrong.

2730
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,080
You can eat a cotton candy.

2731
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,080
He is the first one

2732
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,080
I believe in.

2733
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,080
I don't think he ate it.

2734
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,080
It's cotton candy.

2735
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,080
You should try the cotton candy.

2736
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,080
You know?

2737
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:58,080
I'll try the cotton candy.

2738
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,080
Really?

2739
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,080
I'll eat it with you.

2740
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,080
It's sweet.

2741
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:02,080
I'll eat a cotton candy too.

2742
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,080
It's so sweet.

2743
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,080
It's too sweet.

2744
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,080
Do you think it's sweet?

2745
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,080
Cotton candy.

2746
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,080
It's too sweet.

2747
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,080
It's sweet.

2748
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,080
A candy that was the sweetest in 2002.

2749
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,080
A candy that was the sweetest in 2002.

2750
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,080
You're so funny.

2751
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,080
Congratulations.

2752
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,080
I don't know if you've heard

2753
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,080
our voice.

2754
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,080
It's actually

2755
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,080
a hidden welfare part

2756
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,080
in our live broadcast room.

2757
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,080
During the live broadcast,

2758
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,080
as long as you two

2759
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,080
speak up for our welfare key words,

2760
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,080
you will be punished

2761
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,080
by our welfare mechanism.

2762
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,080
So congratulations

2763
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,080
to the two members of the welfare team

2764
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,080
who won this round.

2765
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,080
You will get a card

2766
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,080
and a signature photo of the five-year-old.

2767
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,080
So the award goes to

2768
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,080
our live broadcast station

2769
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,080
for the award.

2770
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,080
Congratulations.

2771
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,080
Thank you, Jinyan.

2772
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,080
Thank you, Xu Kai.

2773
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,080
It's been so long.

2774
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,080
You've said the key words, right?

2775
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,080
Yes, I have.

2776
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,080
But you don't know

2777
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,080
what the key words are.

2778
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,080
We'll give you

2779
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,080
a welfare benefit at any time.

2780
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,080
Okay.

2781
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,080
We've seen

2782
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,080
the two of you

2783
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,080
with a clear understanding.

2784
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,080
I think Jinyan

2785
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,080
is very reliable

2786
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,080
and sincere.

2787
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,080
Including her acting.

2788
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,080
She's very good.

2789
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,080
Xu Kai

2790
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,080
just

2791
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,080
showed

2792
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,080
a feeling

2793
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:10,080
of showing all the candies.

2794
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,080
So you can see

2795
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,080
the performance.

2796
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,080
The candies

2797
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,080
were

2798
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,080
both of you

2799
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:16,080
enjoying the fruits.

2800
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,080
Next,

2801
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,080
we have a surprise

2802
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,080
for the live broadcast station.

2803
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,080
It's

2804
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:22,080
our wonderful

2805
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,080
flower show.

2806
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,080
I think

2807
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,080
you can't wait.

2808
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,080
Let's take a look

2809
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,080
at the two main actors.

2810
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,080
Flower show.

2811
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,080
The mountain flows.

2812
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,080
The voice is hard to hide.

2813
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2814
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,080
What's the key word?

2815
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,080
I'll give you two more.

2816
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,080
Okay?

2817
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,080
Give me two more.

2818
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,080
Give me two more.

2819
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,080
Give me two more.

2820
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,080
Give me two more.

2821
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,080
Give me two more.

2822
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,080
Go.

2823
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,080
I can't keep playing.

2824
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2825
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2826
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,080
Because

2827
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,080
you see,

2828
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,080
the face

2829
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,080
is not good.

2830
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,080
Okay.

2831
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,080
I'll give you two more.

2832
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2833
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2834
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2835
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2836
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,080
So funny.

2837
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,080
What's this?

2838
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,080
What's this?

2839
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,080
This is for you.

2840
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:36,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2841
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,080
I'm so embarrassed.

2842
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,080
Zhang Wu.

2843
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,080
He's here.

2844
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,080
Your Highness.

2845
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,080
Don't be so serious.

2846
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,080
This word

2847
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,080
may be

2848
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,080
used by someone.

2849
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,080
Are you scolding me

2850
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,080
for hiding the money?

2851
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,080
The moon is in the right color tonight.

2852
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,080
Let's go.

2853
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,080
Go to the moon.

2854
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,080
I'm alive for you.

2855
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,080
It seems to be the only thing

2856
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,080
in my life.

2857
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,080
If you don't die,

2858
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,080
I won't be heartbroken.

2859
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,080
I'm telling you.

2860
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
I won't let you go.

2861
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,080
I'm not willing to be your concubine,

2862
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,080
nor do I want to live for you.

2863
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,080
I'm not willing to be

2864
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,080
a puppet of others.

2865
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,080
Your enemy is not good.

2866
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:07,080
I'm afraid you may be

2867
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,080
lost by Zhan Wenjiao and Bien Xian.

2868
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,080
You have no right

2869
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,080
to follow others' orders.

2870
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,080
Why don't you ask?

2871
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,080
It's not easy for the emperor.

2872
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,080
It's not easy for the emperor.

2873
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,080
I just want to be a rich man

2874
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,080
and get on the stage.

2875
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,080
I can do anything.

2876
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,080
I won't allow

2877
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,080
this dirty business

2878
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,080
to happen to me.

2879
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,080
I won't let them

2880
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,080
touch me again.

2881
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,080
Let me go.

2882
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,080
Let me go.

2883
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:33,080
No.

2884
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:34,080
There is a assassin.

2885
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,080
Protect your highness.

2886
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,080
Your highness.

2887
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,080
As for the royal family,

2888
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,080
I don't want to be the emperor.

2889
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,080
It's so fun.

2890
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,080
Because I was

2891
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
running water on the mountain.

2892
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,080
I was playing the piano.

2893
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,080
I was playing the flute.

2894
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,080
But it seems

2895
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,080
Xu Kai is going to turn it over.

2896
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,080
Right?

2897
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,080
Yes, because his hair is very similar.

2898
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,080
I took a few pictures.

2899
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,080
The director said

2900
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,080
there was someone at the scene

2901
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,080
saying

2902
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Kai.

2903
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,080
You turned it over.

2904
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,080
I said

2905
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,080
why didn't you tell me

2906
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,080
half an hour ago?

2907
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,080
I was blowing it

2908
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,080
in a place where I turned it over.

2909
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:06,080
It's the same as the one you were talking about.

2910
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,080
I know.

2911
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,080
So in the process of taking pictures,

2912
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,080
there are still many fun places.

2913
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,080
Can the two of you

2914
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,080
be at this time?

2915
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,080
Because everyone is always chasing after you.

2916
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,080
Could you please

2917
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,080
give us more information?

2918
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,080
I'm very warm.

2919
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,080
I'm very romantic.

2920
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,080
I'm romantic.

2921
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,080
I'm romantic.

2922
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,080
Oh, no.

2923
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,080
I'm romantic.

2924
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,080
I'm not romantic.

2925
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,080
I'm not romantic.

2926
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:33,080
What other official words do you have?

2927
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:34,080
Let me think about it.

2928
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,080
A kind of plot.

2929
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,080
It's your turn, Jingyan.

2930
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,080
I've already said a few key words.

2931
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,080
Okay, key words.

2932
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,080
Very official key words.

2933
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,080
I'll say one.

2934
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,080
Anyway, I've already said a lot of things.

2935
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,080
Really.

2936
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,080
I think it's really

2937
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,080
the biggest thing

2938
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,080
in our play.

2939
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,080
It's the same thing.

2940
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,080
It's the same thing.

2941
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,080
The same thing.

2942
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,080
Okay, I've already said a few words.

2943
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,080
How did this happen?

2944
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,080
Everyone, please follow me.

2945
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:07,080
The plot behind is more wonderful.

2946
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,080
And Jingyan also revealed it a little bit.

2947
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,080
I think it's a very big blessing.

2948
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,080
So don't make a mistake, okay?

2949
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,080
Why is the food so good?

2950
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,080
The food must be so good.

2951
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,080
It's warm and warm.

2952
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,080
And it's emotional.

2953
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:26,080
I've spent every moment with you.

2954
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,080
I hope you can't stop

2955
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:31,080
our plot.

2956
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:33,080
Don't forget to leave a comment.

2957
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,080
And I hope you can...

2958
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,080
It's gone.

2959
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,080
I'm so sad.

2960
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,080
Come on.

2961
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,080
There's food and sweet love.

2962
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,080
And...

2963
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,080
Sweet emotions.

2964
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,080
There's no more word.

2965
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,080
Sweet emotions.

2966
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:51,080
And...

2967
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,080
There's some small things.

2968
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,080
And some small emotions.

2969
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,080
The main thing is to eat and relax.

2970
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:59,080
I hope you can support us.

2971
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:01,080
I wish you all a happy 2022.

2972
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,080
Congratulations.

2973
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,080
I don't know if you've heard our voices.

2974
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:09,080
Actually, it's a hidden welfare part of our live broadcast.

2975
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,080
During the live broadcast,

2976
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,080
as long as you receive our welfare key words,

2977
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,080
you will be punished by our welfare mechanism.

2978
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,080
So congratulations to the two members of the welfare committee.

2979
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:20,080
You will get a card and a signature photo of the five-year-old.

2980
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,080
And a card with the member of Mango TV.

2981
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,080
The most important news is

2982
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,080
posted on our screen.

2983
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,080
Congratulations.

2984
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,080
Of course,

2985
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,080
there's also...

2986
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,080
This is our little cat.

2987
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,080
He's the main actor for the two of our top ten.

2988
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,080
One is the pig's eye chicken.

2989
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,080
The other is the mouse.

2990
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,080
The character is made of the character.

2991
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,080
Okay?

2992
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,080
It's the same.

2993
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,080
It's for you.

2994
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,080
Thank you.

2995
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,080
Thank you for coming to our top ten.

2996
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,080
The Yun live broadcast room.

2997
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,080
With all the wonderful moments with us,

2998
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,080
I hope you will support the top ten.

2999
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,080
I'm sorry.

3000
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,080
Support Xu Kai.

3001
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,080
Support Ji Yan.

3002
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,080
Thank you again.

3003
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,080
Thank you Ji Yan.

3004
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,080
Thank you.

3005
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,080
Thank you Xu Kai.

3006
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,080
Remember,

3007
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,080
after watching the live broadcast,

3008
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,080
let's go to the top ten right away.

3009
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,080
Bye.

3010
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,080
Bye.

3011
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,080
Bye.

3012
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:15,080
Please.
