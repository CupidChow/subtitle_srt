00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
咦呀咦呀咦呀咦呀

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
再成對夢裡

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 19

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Chen Wu, don't disturb me.

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
黃氏像生丸

6
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
蕭中指頭,立言開音,黃氏像生丸

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
頂配保護強健天生

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
第二代美藏陳蘭真提醒您精彩即將開始

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
無邊無際小福星

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
為可衛生金帶您進入正篇內容

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
有人魚肉相比齊鴉百姓

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
百官路上便會抹去一個名字

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
柴世上便會高高掛起他的頭顱

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
占中用這些人是想讓每一個圍觀者

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
日夜玄心時刻記住

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
清廉圍觀善待百姓

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
黃爺爺,行法自然可以震懾官員

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
但那些都是弱智女流亡

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
展記啊

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
朕幾位多少年來招前稀替時時自行

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
只盼著終有一日反我欲下百姓

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
皆能安居樂業共享太平

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
朕要的

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
是一個真正的盛世

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
他們是朕的眼睛朕的耳朵

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
替朕巡視四方監察天下

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
朝政如此,後宮易燃

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
朕的後宮不只有多少

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
他人的耳目又有多少別國的奸細

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
朕的弱智女流,朕可養不起

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
黃爺爺,孫兒擔心的是您呢

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
此次受審者共二十六人

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
並有好事者風傳

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
說您言行逼供,牽扯兩千與人

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
更有人說您親自監展,血染此進城

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
孫兒不願意聽到有任何人,電無您的名譽

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
更不願意聽到有任何人,說您辦點不是

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
朕是天下之王萬民之父

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
登基二十年,遭朝晚朝從不懈待

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
所思所想無非是百姓的冷暖饑寒

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
曲曲宮中所事,還親自監展

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
朕有那麼賢呆嗎

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
傳謠之人真乃數目之光,餘不可及

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
雖說是傳謠,但再讓御氏,攀咬下去的話

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
只怕會牽連更多無辜的人

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
黃爺爺,能否看在孫兒的份上

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
重成守惡,釋放其他人呢

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
那麼,又如何區分誰是守惡

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
誰是從犯

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
朕既回去好好讀你的書當你的差

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
將來得城夜舊

52
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
才不辜負朕對你的後望

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
這點小事不該你管,回去吧

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
是,孫兒告退

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Your Majesty, he's here

56
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Who is it?

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's... the Crown Prince

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How dare you slander the Crown Prince

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's the Crown Prince, I just killed His Majesty

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The Queen Mother is the Crown Prince

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Keep her safe, I'll go to the palace right away

62
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes, Your Majesty

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Consort Zhuang

64
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Consort Zhuang, Your Highness

65
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Your Highness

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Help me, help me

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wait

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Here

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is water

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And

71
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
This is rice

72
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is rice

73
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Your Highness

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Rice is not bad, it's not bad

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Put the rest on your body

76
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't let anyone find out

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hurry

79
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You took my High Princess Consort

80
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You asked her to tell His Majesty

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I was innocent

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't want to kill you

83
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Your Highness

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you usually meet with the beauty in the imperial jade palace?

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Didn't you find anything unusual?

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I always treat her well

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know why she wants to see me

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I just want to be with her for two months

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I want to be with her like a person

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't know

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't understand

92
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know

93
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ziqi, go

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Go, go

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't go

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait

97
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't leave me, don't go

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Your Highness, we will come again

99
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hurry

100
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Go

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Log logically

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Good

103
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Where did you go?

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
My family Seung altitude Celine

105
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Miss Yao,

106
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I'm still going to trouble you this time.

107
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,880
Your Highness, you can't persuade her.

108
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,160
I know.

109
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,920
The more grandpa values me,

110
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,320
the more he doesn't want to make me talk.

111
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,480
If I persuade her,

112
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,960
I'm afraid I'll be implicated.

113
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
Your Highness.

114
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,560
Master,

115
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,800
let her sit down!

116
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,040
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,240
Wait a minute.

118
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,400
You're all done sitting down.

119
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,200
Meow the word How big the hood is!

120
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,720
Your Highness,

121
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,880
you want to summon her?

122
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,160
Go now?

123
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,120
Yes, sir.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

135
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm going to make a hole in the water.

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've put on the net.

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I bought a little...)

141
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
S讨论

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
XiSi,

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
you're not human anymore.

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,160
Her effort isn't too bad.

145
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,080
She's not so skinny

146
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,620
and she doesn't eat a lot.

147
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,200
She'll have a brash period.

148
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,080
Miss Yao!

149
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,340
You…

150
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,780
Why do you still���awia this dress?

151
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,920
Hurry up. Change clothes!

152
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,340
You're pregnant?

153
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,240
His Highness want you inside.

154
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
Go quickly!

155
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,280
Go quickly!

156
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,360
Jinping!

157
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,100
Well…

158
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,640
Why are you standing there?

159
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,660
Hurry up!

160
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,580
Hurry up.

161
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,740
Your Highness,

162
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,900
something happened in the Eastern Palace.

163
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,660
Miss, be careful.

164
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,500
Do you feel heavy?

165
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,220
I'll hold it for you.

166
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,340
Be careful.

167
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,180
I'll hold it for you.

168
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,460
Miss, please wait a moment.

169
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,180
Your Highness.

170
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,820
Your Highness.

171
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,380
Someone's here.

172
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,180
Someone's here.

173
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,060
Your Highness, you're in a hurry.

174
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,700
Let's talk later.

175
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,380
What's going on?

176
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,460
What's going on?

177
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:31,900
Come on.

178
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,060
You guys,

179
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,140
go and get a cover.

180
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,100
Hurry up.

181
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,380
Miss,

182
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,020
why don't you wait here?

183
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,260
I think Your Highness has something to do.

184
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,460
Wait a minute.

185
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,300
Yes, Eunuch Yuan.

186
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,860
Follow me.

187
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,420
Tell me.

188
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,180
Hurry up.

189
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,140
Cover me.

190
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,780
Hurry up.

191
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:55,860
Commander.

192
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,140
Yes.

193
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,980
Get it off.

194
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,100
Well,

195
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,060
you'll give my daughter

196
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,940
her products

197
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,340
if I paint her finish on her body.

198
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,140
You should help me step in.

199
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,900
Yes.

200
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,420
I'll put it away.

201
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,380
Run.

202
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,700
If you have any problem, I'll tear you to death.

203
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,260
Get out.

204
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,100
Your Highness.

205
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,620
Your Highness.

206
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,340
Search.

207
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,740
Your Highness.

208
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,860
Your Highness.

209
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,740
Your Highness.

210
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,340
Your Highness.

211
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:34,940
It's here.

212
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,100
Your Highness.

213
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,300
Your Highness.

214
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,620
Step back.

215
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,780
Backward.

216
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,860
Step back.

217
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,340
Step back.

218
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,620
Your Highness.

219
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,620
What are you doing?

220
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,740
It's good that you're here.

221
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,260
I've got a few words to say about,

222
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,140
after more than twenty years,

223
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,260
I've only seen the conductor in Beizheng.

224
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,820
You have a long way to go.

225
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,340
You don't dare to easily Screen Skill On.

226
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,220
But G Vous,

227
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,460
yoului,

228
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,660
is good at faces,

229
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,820
hands,

230
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,700
and I am great in battle

231
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,060
with such fun.

232
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,620
Now,

233
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,780
Father, you're so clear-headed and you're so jealous of me.

234
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,500
I...

235
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,860
I...

236
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,220
I'm so unreasonable.

237
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,420
People often say that

238
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,740
I'm not strict with my father.

239
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,100
I've been a father for more than 20 years.

240
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,220
Today,

241
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,540
I must say this.

242
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,620
I know that father

243
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,780
loves his second brother.

244
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,500
He wants to be the crown prince.

245
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,460
I can accept it.

246
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,100
I can even let him do it.

247
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,540
But what happened today

248
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,100
must be said somehow.

249
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,260
Put me down.

250
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,260
I shall enter the royal court

251
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,300
as your한

252
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,100
and I shall do as your sympafriend rulesマ으.

253
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,980
But father

254
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,540
set a good balance

255
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,740
for your package.

256
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,580
I think

257
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,780
the currentでは

258
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,700
will have

259
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,340
will be a great success.

260
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,300
This is very wrong.

261
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,340
Help me up.

262
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,380
Don't move.

263
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,260
Your Highness.

264
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,860
Today...

265
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,420
Your Highness.

266
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,540
Your Highness.

267
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,540
Your Highness.

268
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,700
What are you doing?

269
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,660
You stay back.

270
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,020
If you dare to step forward,

271
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,420
I'll kill you.

272
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,060
Your Highness.

273
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,040
See off the camera.

274
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,760
Sini,

275
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,020
are you still...

276
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,900
Can you just leave me alone now?

277
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,780
First,

278
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,660
make abreak.

279
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,700
First.

280
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,940
Make a break.

281
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,760
Human beings

282
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,280
No.

283
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't think she can find a corner.

284
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:48,920
I feel bad.

285
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,000
Give me the match Roman.

286
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,720
I...

287
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,440
Let me clean the other room,

288
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
and read it.

289
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,120
Go back and take a look.

290
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,040
I'll take care of it eventually.

291
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,200
I won't leave you.

292
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,440
I have something to do.

293
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,640
You need my back or his mouth?

294
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,560
Gu's mouth.

295
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
and then you sent the message to Grandpa Huang.

296
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
You...

297
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
You...

298
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
You've been here for so long,

299
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
yet you still come to bully me?

300
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,560
I'm just following my father's instructions.

301
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
How could I bully you?

302
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
He...

303
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,560
He...

304
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
He's just bullying me.

305
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
He's just sincere.

306
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
He's just doing it on purpose.

307
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Who are you to make my father bully you?

308
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
You...

309
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
You kid.

310
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Why are you making fun of your father?

311
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,560
You're so old.

312
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
You're still like a kid.

313
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Father,

314
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
do you have anything to say?

315
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Father,

316
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
I don't want to.

317
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Get off.

318
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
I don't want to!

319
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
I...

320
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm not going up.

321
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
I want to talk to you.

322
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Your Highness!

323
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
One.

324
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
Your Highness!

325
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Your Highness!

326
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Your Highness!

327
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
Your Highness!

328
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
Are you all right?

329
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Are you all right?

330
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
I'm so tired.

331
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
I'm scared.

332
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
I'm sleepy.

333
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Father, you're fine.

334
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,560
I'm going back.

335
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
My dear.

336
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
Your Highness.

337
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Since you're fine,

338
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,560
I'll take my leave.

339
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
You should rest early.

340
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
Your Highness,

341
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
you scared me to death.

342
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
You...

343
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Why did you just stop crying?

344
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
I'm so cold.

345
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Can you hear me?

346
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Your Highness,

347
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,560
you just heard a big sound.

348
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Help me up.

349
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
Help me up.

350
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,560
I just want His Majesty to hear it.

351
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
I just want His Majesty to hear it.

352
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
I'm so wronged.

353
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Tell them

354
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
to prepare the dishes.

355
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
I'm hungry.

356
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Yes.

357
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,560
Your Highness,

358
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
what's going on?

359
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
I'm confused.

360
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Your Highness!

361
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Go.

362
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Go and check on the imperial kitchen.

363
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Yes.

364
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Yuanqi.

365
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Yuanqi.

366
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Your Highness.

367
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Your Highness.

368
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
I'm lost.

369
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I didn't stay.

370
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
You should have taken the door off.

371
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
The officials

372
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
are also in the same situation.

373
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Yes.

374
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Lord You,

375
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,560
are you here to collect the mausoleum?

376
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
The imperial court has admitted

377
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
that the Crown Prince ordered

378
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
to poison His Majesty's food.

379
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
The Imperial Court has sent thousands of people

380
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
to the Imperial Court.

381
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

382
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,560
As a law,

383
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
officials must be punished

384
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
for the official interrogation.

385
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Please accept the punishment.

386
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,560
The imperial court has

387
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,560
investigated the palace's official affairs.

388
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,560
I'm the official of the imperial court.

389
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Even if I have to interrogate the imperial court,

390
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I should be punished for the official interrogation.

391
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I'm not the official.

392
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Why bother to do this?

393
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
This case is not about the official interrogation.

394
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
It's about the crime of being in the imperial court.

395
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Take her away.

396
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Wait.

397
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Are you accusing me

398
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
of being alone

399
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
or the whole imperial court?

400
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,560
If you want to murder me,

401
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
you won't be able to get in.

402
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Good.

403
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Since you're accusing me of being alone,

404
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
you can interrogate me.

405
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Yes, Your Highness.

406
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Lord.

407
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
The imperial court

408
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
has been fighting with Guo Ce

409
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
in the Flower Festival.

410
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
It's been a long time since I've been pregnant.

411
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
I don't want to frame the Crown Prince.

412
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm sorry for the whole imperial court.

413
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Lord You, please accept the punishment.

414
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
When did you say that?

415
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Lord You,

416
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
the imperial court's official is the most important person

417
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
in the imperial court.

418
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
If you want to be in the imperial court,

419
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
why don't you go to me?

420
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
Let the imperial court go first.

421
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm just being responsible.

422
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
I dare not let you go.

423
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
I have to go to the three of you.

424
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,560
Take her away.

425
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
Don't worry.

426
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
You have no real evidence.

427
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
How can you take her away?

428
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,560
It's just because of the crime.

429
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
From now on,

430
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
the imperial court will have to

431
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
carefully investigate the funeral of the noble.

432
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
If there is any trouble,

433
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
you will be punished

434
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
by the imperial court.

435
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
I'm not the one to blame.

436
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Trust me.

437
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
You won't know

438
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
what kind of place it is.

439
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Ziqi,

440
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,560
what should we do?

441
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,560
I'm sorry.

442
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm sorry.

443
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
I've been giving the items to the imperial concubines

444
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
for three days.

445
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
They are so conservative.

446
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,560
We can't get out of here.

447
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
We still have to think of other ways.

448
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Don't be rash.

449
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Hurry.

450
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Hurry.

451
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Hurry.

452
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Hurry.

453
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
Hurry.

454
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Hurry.

455
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Hurry.

456
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
Hurry.

457
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Hurry.

458
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Hurry.

459
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Hurry.

460
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Hurry.

461
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
Take these.

462
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
Here.

463
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Even if you want to take it,

464
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
you can't keep it in the water all day, right?

465
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Please.

466
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Come here.

467
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Let's go.

468
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Let's go.

469
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,820
We just got to it.

470
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,980
Wait up your gentlemen.

471
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,600
I'm so thirsty.

472
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,560
ih

473
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,440
Concubine Zhuang

474
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,740
Concubine Zhuang

475
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,280
Take it.

476
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,000
Take it.

477
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,520
Why do I have to say the same thing

478
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,480
every time I see you?

479
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,920
Take it away.

480
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,080
Go.

481
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,160
My Lord

482
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,000
just a little dancers

483
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,560
to hold out on aels,

484
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,960
Take him to the prison to walk around.

485
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,640
The company tomorrow

486
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,120
will be closed.

487
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,400
Is that so?

488
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,480
If you want him to say something,

489
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,320
he can say something.

490
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,240
He can't keep his word.

491
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
The Imperial Court of Judicial Review

492
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Episode 1

493
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,480
Your Majesty.

494
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,680
The Imperial Court of Judicial Review has admitted it.

495
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,040
After the incident,

496
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,880
Zhuangfei was imprisoned.

497
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,680
The Imperial Court of Judicial Review

498
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,200
ordered to send the imperial court to the court.

499
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,600
But the Imperial Court of Judicial Review

500
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,360
and Zhuangfei

501
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,760
did collude with the Imperial Court.

502
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,120
Just like what you said to me,

503
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
the Imperial Court of Judicial Review

504
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,240
never said anything

505
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
about the time and place.

506
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,520
Lord Yuan.

507
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Don't use the big shape to me.

508
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,640
Lord, please let me say something.

509
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,840
I'll do anything to you.

510
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,480
Father.

511
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,160
You've heard it, right?

512
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,440
Only because you use the big shape

513
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
to force me to do nothing,

514
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,920
I'm really wronged.

515
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,400
This is the jade seal.

516
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,440
How dare you talk nonsense?

517
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,640
But...

518
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,600
Be honest.

519
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,980
Were you

520
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
sure?

521
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,640
You said we intended to poison you secretly.

522
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:47,940
We memory

523
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,900
nothing.

524
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
I didn't say anything about your illness.

525
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
I really didn't say anything.

526
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,340
Your Highness, I...

527
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,940
I didn't say anything.

528
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,020
Your Majesty,

529
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,260
Yuchi is obviously a liar.

530
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,220
What's the point of being a concubine

531
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,700
in the Imperial Court?

532
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,220
How could you know about this?

533
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,020
I...

534
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,700
I...

535
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,060
What are you talking about?

536
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,180
Tell me clearly.

537
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,620
I will have you decide.

538
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,660
Yes.

539
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,500
Yes.

540
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,220
I want to...

541
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,820
Today...

542
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,860
Your Highness,

543
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,820
she has a big illness.

544
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,180
She often has a job.

545
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,900
She has been given a secret edict.

546
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,740
The servants have discussed it privately.

547
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,260
They said that

548
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,940
Her Highness is ill.

549
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,260
Your Majesty,

550
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,420
I just got into the palace for a long time.

551
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,420
I don't even know the way to the palace.

552
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,060
Lord You wants to catch me.

553
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,380
He doesn't want to ask me anything.

554
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,340
I don't know anything.

555
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,460
Your Majesty, please spare me.

556
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,780
Please spare me.

557
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,220
Father,

558
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,860
I really wish to die.

559
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,860
Your Majesty,

560
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,340
I ask the imperial doctor to

561
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,820
treat the illness for me.

562
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,660
Hate- removing protectors in the palace.

563
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,260
Pay respect to the empress.

564
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,220
The rest...

565
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,140
This is useless...

566
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,580
What am I to tell you?

567
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,380
The crown prince wants to kill His Majesty.

568
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,660
Because he is a troublesome child.

569
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,460
He全部想要当皇帝了.

570
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,460
I...

571
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,340
Be enthroned

572
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,620
and the heath connects our foundation.

573
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,140
I have already become once.

574
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,860
So...

575
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,980
Your Majesty rarely saw you,

576
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,220
but considering you were Theatre scriptwriter,

577
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,100
you haven't appreciated him considerately.

578
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,460
The truce in your Frost Dragon

579
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,340
screwed us up like you don't even have a loveforce.

580
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,180
Your Highness,

581
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,140
do you think the Majesty really stands by you?

582
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,600
Let them say

583
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,140
we're not only princes,

584
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,300
but Huang Ying too

585
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,140
was caught up in the way the emperor had performed.

586
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,840
But we

587
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,440
are still only capable of

588
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,320
taking an easy On theズan.

589
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,100
Your Majesty.

590
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,940
Your Majesty.

591
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,380
You've made a terrible point

592
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,280
and made me be Picturesque.

593
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,680
Your Majesty!

594
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,560
Outrageous!

595
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,720
Your Majesty,

596
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,200
теб were met.

597
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,840
Medical Dar Nobel,

598
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,720
first your caution please.

599
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

600
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,400
Gosh är area.

601
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,960
What are you mammals do?

602
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,880
Is this stupid?

603
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,740
Go!

604
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
You go first.

605
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,580
Yes.

606
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,280
Go none!

607
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,220
Everyday I seehu.

608
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,180
gowan,

609
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,620
You go first.

610
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,680
Go!

611
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:24,980
Go!

612
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,860
Go!

613
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,840
Okay.

614
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,000
Please go.

615
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,380
Where are you going?

616
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,280
I gotta go.

617
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,000
I've been in the prison for three years.

618
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,640
Now, I'm going to be in the prison for ten days.

619
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,520
As for the secret sword,

620
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,560
it must be a bitter fruit.

621
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,360
Your Majesty.

622
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,920
Please kill me.

623
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,760
Your Majesty.

624
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,680
Please kill me.

625
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,440
Your Majesty.

626
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,400
Your Majesty, you've heard it.

627
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
The Goddess has already thought it over

628
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,480
and kept the same feelings with everyone.

629
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,920
I was wronged.

630
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,040
She has made the fool of himself?

631
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:06,800
Your Majesty.

632
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,440
Your Majesty.

633
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,280
It's Mobileение?

634
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,280
Later,

635
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,180
Her Highness Vol Junior

636
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,280
will take me for a fool when her life is in danger.

637
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,560
Father.

638
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,720
It's so sad

639
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,120
that she gets in trouble due to herowl.

640
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,640
I have no say about this.

641
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,720
You...

642
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,600
Who dares to frame Crown Prince?

643
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,360
Tell me!

644
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,400
You can't be buried for me.

645
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
What a pity.

646
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Crown Prince,

647
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,920
don't blame me.

648
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,240
If you want to blame me,

649
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,480
blame your good side.

650
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,000
You're so polite.

651
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,800
I'm so pitiful.

652
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,840
I can only come to you.

653
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,800
As long as you're back in the Eastern Palace,

654
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,520
I can't avenge you.

655
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,720
The more people who come to me, the better.

656
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,840
Yuchi,

657
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,120
you still don't want to tell the truth?

658
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,640
Grandpa Huang,

659
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,360
a few days ago,

660
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,760
someone sent a gold-tongue to Yuchi's family.

661
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,200
He promised to take care of his parents.

662
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,600
Yuchi knew that he wouldn't die long ago,

663
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,920
so he agreed to send the fire to thank Crown Prince.

664
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,480
Now, the public is in a state of emergency.

665
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,240
The officials who are sending the news

666
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,400
are waiting outside the palace.

667
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,440
Who is the mastermind?

668
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,440
Yuchi,

669
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,400
what do you think?

670
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,640
Zhu Zhenji,

671
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,440
what's the point of this?

672
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,240
Grandpa Huang,

673
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,640
after the investigation,

674
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,760
someone recognized

675
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,240
the gold-tongue

676
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,960
that was the long-distance trace of the Han's Mansion.

677
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,920
Thank you!

678
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,960
This is my credit card.

679
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,680
Father,

680
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,000
I've never seen this woman

681
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,800
sending gold to Yuchi's family.

682
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,840
Father, believe me.

683
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,520
If I want to thank Crown Prince,

684
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,320
I'll do it with my own hands.

685
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,680
How can I ask people

686
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,200
to call themselves the Han's Mansion?

687
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,160
They're waiting for the gold-tongue.

688
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,280
Someone must have seen

689
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,320
that the Crown Prince is not sincere.

690
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
He wants to understand the love between the royal family and the flesh.

691
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,520
Father, I'm sorry.

692
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,160
Don't worry, Second Uncle.

693
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,720
Just tell me the truth.

694
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Can't I be worried?

695
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,280
Who can be worried if I'm not?

696
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:35,760
I...

697
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,520
I'm really wronged.

698
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,080
Father, you're wise.

699
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,800
Second Uncle,

700
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,200
don't be greedy.

701
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,280
Zhenji,

702
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,680
you believe me, right?

703
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,920
Tell Grandpa Huang

704
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,400
that I'm wronged.

705
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,360
I'm wronged.

706
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,360
Enough.

707
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,000
Send the imperial concubines back to the palace.

708
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,520
Take them to the prison.

709
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,200
We'll interrogate them one day.

710
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,400
Yes.

711
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,880
Your Majesty,

712
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,680
the Imperial Court is innocent.

713
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
Release them.

714
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,840
Father!

715
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,680
Father!

716
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,160
You believe me, right?

717
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,080
Brother!

718
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,560
Third Uncle.

719
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,280
Third Uncle.

720
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,480
Lord You, please wait.

721
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,720
What can I do for you?

722
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,360
Lord You,

723
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,840
do you think

724
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,560
this is a strange thing?

725
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,280
It's not a conspiracy.

726
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,120
The imperial family is innocent.

727
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,240
They hate the Eastern Palace for being rude.

728
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,760
They want to be punished for their crimes.

729
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,080
That's why they're so jealous of you.

730
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,160
They're so innocent.

731
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,240
As for how to deal with Lord Han,

732
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,040
since His Majesty didn't give him a name,

733
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,720
he can't find a way to find a way.

734
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Please forgive me.

735
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
How do I think

736
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,920
that the human and the witness

737
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
are waiting for me?

738
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,000
As long as the truth is out,

739
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,440
it's good for the Crown Prince to be safe.

740
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,240
Your Highness,

741
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,560
I'll take my leave.

742
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,800
Your Highness.

743
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Watch your step.

744
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,160
Thank you.

745
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm so pantsed.

746
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,880
Let's go.

747
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,760
Your Highness.

748
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,480
I'll go.

749
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Why are you still following me?

750
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,600
Get out!

751
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,040
Get out!

752
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,560
What's the use of being so angry?

753
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,880
You're so fast.

754
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,760
Look at you.

755
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,640
You seem to have been wronged.

756
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,160
What?

757
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,320
You think it's a mistake to buy the royal family

758
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
to frame the crown prince?

759
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,440
Is it not?

760
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,880
To frame a woman who is ill

761
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
and is jealous of her father,

762
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
to frame the crown prince,

763
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,000
and to leave a witness to the crime?

764
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,480
In your heart,

765
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,480
am I that stupid?

766
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,600
So you're saying

767
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,880
someone is trying to make a point?

768
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,640
It's not Zhu Gaochu.

769
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,640
It's not Zhu Zhenji.

770
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,680
Why?

771
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,240
My brother is reading the holy book.

772
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,880
The letter is about the emperor's book.

773
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,280
He can't do it.

774
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,600
As for Zhu Zhenji,

775
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,720
he's more mature than you.

776
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,000
How could he frame me

777
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,720
to frame his father?

778
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,720
Someone

779
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,920
purposely led him to investigate.

780
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,600
Who is he?

781
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,560
Could he be Standard educational pleaser?

782
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,000
Stand here.

783
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,440
You son.

784
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,760
How dare you?

785
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,160
Pregnant in so many times,

786
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,480
I don't know your real son.

787
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,320
I can't figure out anything.

788
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,600
Look at you carefully.

789
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,040
You're not even as good as me.

790
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,120
You're even more like that bitch.

791
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,840
Your Highness,

792
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,000
Your Highness, please calm down.

793
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,680
Your Highness.

794
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,360
Go.

795
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,960
Your Highness.

796
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
Mother.

797
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,800
After your mother died,

798
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,520
you secretly escaped from the mansion.

799
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,480
I sent people to look for the dead.

800
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
It's been so many years.

801
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,280
Your appearance has changed a lot.

802
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,240
I saw you for the first time.

803
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,360
I still suspect it.

804
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,320
It seems that seven years ago,

805
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,840
the corpse of Ji Nan's executioner,

806
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,920
who was crying for you,

807
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,320
was also a spy of your aunt.

808
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,920
His Majesty was in the war.

809
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,160
You saved him.

810
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,360
You've been in the capital for a long time.

811
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,240
You've been in the capital for a long time.

812
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,600
But what's the point of choosing for the throne?

813
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,000
Has His Majesty been a son of a man?

814
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,960
He never got the chance to see the emperor's grandfather.

815
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,840
Who would know who I am?

816
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,400
You shouldn't have

817
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,880
set up a trap for a woman who is a woman of the five-star family.

818
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,080
You should have killed your own father.

819
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,560
Now you know the words of the wronged people.

820
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,600
My mother was innocent and wronged.

821
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,560
She was selfish.

822
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,800
She didn't even have a chance to live.

823
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,280
She's more dangerous than you.

824
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,720
You've been in pain for a long time.

825
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,000
Bastard!

826
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,800
You can really ignore your father.

827
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,680
Don't forget.

828
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,720
The blood you have

829
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
is mine.

830
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,360
Is that so?

831
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,200
Didn't you listen to Yao Yan

832
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,840
and make sure my mother and Yu Yan were dead?

833
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:54,760
Maybe

834
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,600
I'm also a spy.

835
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,520
I also regretted

836
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,360
the death of my father.

837
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,640
I was too young back then.

838
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,800
I sent someone to look for you everywhere

839
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,480
and went to the south of the Great Jiang.

840
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,640
You hate me.

841
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,360
I don't blame you.

842
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,480
You've been a good person since you were a kid.

843
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,440
You've always been my father's favorite child.

844
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,240
If you hadn't loved Li Fan,

845
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,440
you would have been my prince in the Han Dynasty.

846
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,520
Go.

847
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,120
Zhanli,

848
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,760
if you didn't want to go with me,

849
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,480
I wouldn't agree..

850
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,960
I hope you can call me a father one day.

851
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,560
Go.

852
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,560
I have something to do.

853
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,840
Read my script.

854
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
I've put myself in your shoes.

855
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,840
Move your hand to me.

856
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,400
Your門胴子

857
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:57,960
was stolen by Imperial Mother.

858
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,480
Our manλι army

859
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,920
will keep you safe

860
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,160
As for the man and woman

861
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,880
who are heartless,

862
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,960
I'm relieved.

863
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,880
I don't understand

864
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,120
what happened before.

865
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,280
Say it.

866
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,520
You used me

867
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,400
to make me happy.

868
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,240
What's the point of it?

869
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,040
Of course,

870
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,480
I'm back to my beloved father.

871
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,480
We are together and can never say goodbye.

872
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:47,360
Hello,

873
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,520
My man.

874
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,400
Where is the trouble that happened before?

875
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,400
You and your원.

876
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,680
Ok.

877
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,520
오빱

878
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,240
You will be by my side

879
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
I want to be right in your eyes

880
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
And walk with the moon and the moon

881
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,240
And spend time together

882
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,240
Waiting for this

883
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,240
The loneliness leaves the fire

884
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
And dreams are a meeting

885
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,240
The heart of the dream is not broken

886
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,240
There will be a future

887
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,240
I think

888
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,240
Waiting for this

889
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,240
The loneliness leaves the fire

890
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,240
And dreams are a meeting

891
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,240
The heart of the dream is not broken

892
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,240
There will be a future

893
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
I think

894
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,240
The heart of the dream is not broken

895
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,240
There will be a future

896
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,240
I think

897
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
Waiting for this

898
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,240
The loneliness leaves the fire

899
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,240
And dreams are a meeting

900
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,240
The heart of the dream is not broken

901
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,240
There will be a future

902
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,240
I think

903
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,240
Waiting for this

904
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,240
The loneliness leaves the fire

905
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:55,240
And dreams are a meeting

906
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,240
The heart of the dream is not broken
