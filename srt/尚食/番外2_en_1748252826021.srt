1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
BASIC

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,560
BASIC

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,000
OK, to see the second question

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,840
Let's see the clip first, OK?

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,400
That time

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,200
I say you that hope

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
maybe even

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,840
she would twist me

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,080
Private

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,360
Part external

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,760
Congresswoman

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,460
it is because

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't want to be your concubine

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,960
I don't want to be living for you

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,680
I don't want to become a fear

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,200
Why?

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,320
Come back

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,000
Here you are

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
espacio

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,440
The story is too much.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,440
Look, wait for her answer.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,040
Stay with me.

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,400
This woman is interesting.

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,920
She's gone.

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200
Why did she continue?

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,120
I really want to see it.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,640
Don't stop.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,520
Let me ask Jingyan.

29
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,640
Why did Yao Zijing

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,640
keep refusing Zhu Zanji?

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,160
Actually,

32
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,240
Yao Zijing

33
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,400
is a chef

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,240
in the city.

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,840
She wants to catch the market and love.

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,320
She can't catch the market

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,040
like Huang Taicun.

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,240
But I still have to

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,840
think about which side I want.

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
I want to let go of the love for a while.

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,600
I'll be there soon.

42
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,840
I'll be back sooner or later.

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,160
I'll do my job first.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
I can't be promoted in the fashion room.

45
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,440
Qi just wants to trick me.

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,120
When I saw it,

47
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,880
when you were watching,

48
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,560
you kept saying,

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,080
don't.

50
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,200
Don't reject.

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,520
I was anxious.

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,960
If Zhu Zanji really gave up,

53
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,560
I wouldn't.

54
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
You've already gone on a diet.

55
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,640
You rejected me.

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,760
You must do it.

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,520
It's like this, Zhu Zanji.

58
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,080
You've successfully gained my attention.

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,720
You rejected me.

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,800
I want to get you.

61
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,640
That's how it feels, right?

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,240
Yes.

63
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,960
At this time,

64
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,120
there's a topic.

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,720
What is the role of career and love?

66
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm a family member.

67
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,400
In career.

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,600
In my friends' mood,

69
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,960
what is the role of brotherhood?

70
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Love is thicker.

71
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,600
Love is the first thing.

72
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,920
I think

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,640
family business is more important.

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,920
Work hard first.

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,520
Work hard first.

76
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,640
Work hard first.

77
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,720
Do your best.

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,520
But actually, this is not what I said.

79
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
For example, it's not good to be behind the stage.

80
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,120
Yes.

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,920
But what you're facing now

82
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,880
and the weight of your life

83
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,280
are currently with you.

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,800
Yes.

85
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,480
It's a stage.

86
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,120
If I take Love Playlist 3,

87
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,440
I won't say that I met someone.

88
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
I'll be together.

89
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,040
You're the fourth generation.

90
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,280
No such meaning.

91
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,960
It's just a serious problem.

92
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Yes.

93
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,520
You see,

94
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,200
you're facing a situation now.

95
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,840
At present,

96
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,160
I just want to make the career better.

97
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,200
And I just want to stay with my family.

98
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,440
What's the point of a girl?

99
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,640
I think I've grown up.

100
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,800
Yes.

101
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,800
I'm the biggest.

102
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
You don't have to know yourself.

103
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
I suddenly feel that.

104
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,160
I really do.

105
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,920
I know myself.

106
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,560
Yes.

107
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,040
I know myself the biggest.

108
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,600
And then,

109
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,120
I suddenly grow up.

110
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,800
I feel like

111
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,240
I still want to stick to it.

112
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,640
I don't have a good relationship now.

113
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,080
At this moment,

114
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,880
I have something to do.

115
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,400
I just want to do what I can.

116
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,080
It's OK.

117
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,520
Last year, I didn't have a shoot.

118
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
I went home to take care of some family members.

119
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,040
I've been shooting.

120
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
I don't have time to take care of things.

121
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,400
I think I'm very satisfied.

122
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,760
You're another rich man.

123
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,480
Yes.

124
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,640
These are the things that people need.

125
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,160
I think it's great to be able to stick to it.

126
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,920
I think girls

127
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,600
might cherish it more.

128
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,240
Yes, cherish it.

129
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,200
OK.

130
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
Let's take a look at the third one.

131
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,040
OK?

132
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,600
It's also a question that the audience wants to know.

133
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,360
This question is asked by Wang Churan.

134
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,440
Does it hurt?

135
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Look.

136
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,040
Tong Zhiran asked me to draw for you.

137
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,520
Come here.

138
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Be gentle.

139
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
It hurts.

140
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,120
Don't draw.

141
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,880
I suddenly remembered something.

142
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,840
I have something to do.

143
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,320
I'm leaving.

144
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,680
It's so late.

145
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,320
What are you going to do?

146
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,880
I...

147
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,440
I'm going to get the food box.

148
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
Send the medicine in.

149
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,760
What is Su Yuehua and Yao Zijin's relationship?

150
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,720
Big confusion.

151
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm so cute.

152
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So, ask Chu Ran.

153
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,600
What do you think of Su Yuehua and Yao Zijin's relationship?

154
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,000
I think she's a domestic and a foreign person.

155
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
Because I'm actually more interested in Zijin.

156
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,560
A person who hurts himself.

157
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,280
Why do you want to keep him by your side?

158
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,240
So, I think

159
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm not very familiar with Zijin's values.

160
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,280
So,

161
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
how do you think

162
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,360
the friendship between the three of you

163
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,120
should be maintained?

164
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,080
I think, first of all,

165
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,240
don't think so.

166
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,000
You should believe that you're the best.

167
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,080
And you won't

168
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,480
get cold because of others.

169
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,760
You should have this confidence.

170
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,480
And I think

171
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,800
try to balance

172
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,320
the relationship between the three of you.

173
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,560
Find some other people who are not suitable for you.

174
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,680
Take care of your feelings.

175
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,360
I think it's easy for girls

176
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,200
to be happy and buy things together.

177
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,840
And discuss

178
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,640
what to wear.

179
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,600
I think it's easy for three or four people to talk at night.

180
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,800
I don't know if the relationship between girls

181
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,480
and boys is easy.

182
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
I think it's straightforward.

183
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,600
I think boys are very straightforward.

184
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,480
Whether it's good or not,

185
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,840
or if there's a misunderstanding,

186
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,880
we can solve it very quickly.

187
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
I think boys have their own way of thinking.

188
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,640
If we play together,

189
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,720
we won't be forced.

190
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,880
If we can't play together,

191
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,160
then it's fine.

192
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,440
It's natural.

193
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,240
If we love each other, we play together.

194
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,680
And the character of the two of us

195
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,960
who are not suitable for each other

196
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
will be like this.

197
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
But we will never mention

198
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,480
the two sides.

199
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

200
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,560
And the three or five group of boys

201
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,400
are quite normal and comfortable, right?

202
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,360
Yes, they are.

203
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
Girls are also dependent on the word.

204
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,920
Yes, they are.

205
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Actually, if you have a girlfriend,

206
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,120
you can tell her who you like.

207
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,240
The word is also a word.

208
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
What is the magic of

209
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,280
being friendly between girls?

210
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
It's easy to talk to three or four people.

211
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,920
There won't be any pressure on good relationships.

212
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,560
Just say it.

213
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
Just say it.

214
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,920
Just say it.

215
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,440
Okay, let's see what Wang Yizhe's

216
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,360
question is.

217
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,240
What is his question?

218
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,840
See how you are rejected.

219
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,160
You are good at rejecting two people.

220
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,760
What do I mean?

221
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,600
No matter how you reject her,

222
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,640
she still can't tolerate you.

223
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,520
Now you are here.

224
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,480
Why is she so fierce?

225
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,720
You seduced me.

226
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,240
Really stubborn.

227
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,560
A stubborn girl.

228
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,880
Now you only have to be clean.

229
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,120
You rejected me.

230
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,520
Thank you, Mr. You.

231
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,680
How to thank?

232
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,440
How to thank?

233
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,880
What do you want?

234
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,800
Blood.

235
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,880
Don't be cold-hearted.

236
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,400
Really.

237
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,560
Can you ask why the You Yi Fan likes

238
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,480
Yao Zijin?

239
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,000
And why are you so stubborn?

240
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,240
Because they have a history.

241
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,920
The Internet world.

242
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,760
And then maybe I think

243
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,560
Yao Zijin is a very good person

244
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,280
in You Yi Fan.

245
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,880
So I want to protect her more.

246
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,200
I know.

247
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,720
Because I think You Yi Fan is very clear.

248
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,360
She is a person who loves and doesn't get.

249
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,880
She has no choice.

250
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,760
Her identity is not able to

251
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,160
really get Yao Zijin.

252
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,240
So she actually didn't say

253
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,960
that she has to force her to be with her.

254
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,560
Or what?

255
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,080
It's just a way to protect her.

256
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,600
I think.

257
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,000
She hasn't forced her.

258
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,640
That's all.

259
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,600
But you are very stubborn.

260
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,120
Have you ever had

261
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,400
You Yi Fan's vinegar?

262
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,600
I don't think so.

263
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,040
I have a good one.

264
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,800
You also trust her.

265
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,800
But I haven't seen

266
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,120
her two times.

267
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
She's always behind the kitchen.

268
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,200
She's always in the box

269
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
when she's peeing.

270
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,200
She doesn't know.

271
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,880
She doesn't know.

272
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,280
I don't know.

273
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,920
You only know.

274
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,640
You can see it, right?

275
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,440
It's nothing.

276
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,560
You can eat the whole day.

277
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,280
Okay.

278
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,160
Let's take a look at the next part.

279
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,280
It's about Rui Xian.

280
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,040
Let's take a look at Wei Xia.

281
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,080
It's called the assassin.

282
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,640
Ziping, the assassin Yao Zijin.

283
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,240
After the top, I'll tell you.

284
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,480
Is it that important?

285
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,720
The assassin.

286
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,120
It's important.

287
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,880
It's very important, right?

288
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,880
Very important.

289
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
He scared her.

290
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,160
Bye.

291
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,760
Bye.

292
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,880
See you in his crew.

293
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,320
What happened?

294
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,800
These fruits.

295
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,400
cómo di las placed?

296
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,360
She's very cold.

297
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,280
This fruit.

298
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,280
If you want to kill me, why are you so nice to me?

299
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
If you want to blame me, blame yourself.

300
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
You're a killer.

301
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
You're a killer.

302
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
You shouldn't be so kind.

303
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm just a fool.

304
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Kind.

305
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
You can't be without a bottom line.

306
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
You can't be a bad person.

307
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,280
You can't be a good person.

308
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
You can't be a good person.

309
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
You can't be a good person.

310
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
You're a killer.

311
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Kind.

312
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
You can't be without a bottom line.

313
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
Let's ask Ruixian.

314
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
What was the mood of killing Yao Zijun?

315
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
Actually, this part

316
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
is a challenge for her.

317
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
She can't be sure about her ending.

318
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
After that,

319
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
her ending

320
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
is actually a very clear direction.

321
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
The most urgent point is here.

322
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
Maybe she can't understand

323
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,280
her growing environment.

324
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,280
She's been under pressure

325
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,280
and she's been working on her only mission,

326
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
which is survival.

327
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Maybe she'll think about something else

328
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
for others.

329
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
It's a survival problem for her.

330
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Maybe Zijun thought

331
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
I was trying to kill her

332
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
because I was on the top.

333
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
But she was so famous

334
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
that she was kicked into the palace.

335
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
She was found out

336
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
that if she were to die,

337
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,280
her family would probably die.

338
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
So, it's a very difficult decision for her.

339
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
It's a very important point.

340
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Yes, a very important point.

341
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Because Zijun and I

342
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,280
had some feelings at that time.

343
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
She knew Zijun was very good to her.

344
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
So, it was very difficult for her

345
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
to make this decision at that time.

346
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
I can see that

347
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
this part

348
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
is considered a heavy-headed drama for a woman.

349
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
The internal conflicts and various

350
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
things were revealed.

351
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
How did Yao Zijun

352
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
treat this friendship at that time?

353
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
At that time,

354
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
when she was shooting me,

355
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,280
I thought, Zijun, what's wrong with you?

356
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Did you drink it?

357
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
I can't believe it.

358
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
You just have to move it.

359
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
What's wrong with me?

360
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
I'm drunk.

361
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Then, when I was lying down,

362
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I felt that it was true.

363
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
I just couldn't believe it.

364
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
You really want to kill yourself?

365
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Because I don't know her.

366
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
I don't know what's wrong with her.

367
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
I just can't understand her behavior.

368
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
But at that time, I didn't tell you anything.

369
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
I didn't tell you to confess.

370
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
I didn't protect my life.

371
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
I want to live on.

372
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
I want to live on.

373
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I want to live on.

374
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Ask her about the other thing.

375
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Yes.

376
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Kindness must be at the bottom line.

377
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Yes.

378
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
This is very cool.

379
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Is there really a friendship between the competitors?

380
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
I think so.

381
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
There is a friendship between competitors.

382
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
I think it's the same.

383
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,280
It can be saved together.

384
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
Yes.

385
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
OK.

386
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Actually, we want to dig it.

387
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,280
We're afraid that we'll dig out the plot behind it.

388
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
OK.

389
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
In this part, I'll answer it next.

390
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
Everyone is

391
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
very interested in knowing some tricks.

392
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Including the questions that

393
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
many people have asked just now.

394
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Everyone wants to know some questions.

395
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
First of all, thank you for answering.

396
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
We are looking forward to

397
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
the characters of the plot.

398
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
We are also looking forward to

399
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
more wonderful plots.

400
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
I want to tell you here.

401
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
I want to know the members of the membership.

402
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
To use the public forum.

403
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
To meet the offline meeting.

404
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,280
To have more members' full-time activities.

405
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Everyone must lock down

406
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Mango TV's membership channel.

407
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Mango TV's membership open day.

408
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Live activities.

409
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Come and follow us.

410
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Next, we have a question.

411
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
We want to test

412
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
each other's understanding of each other.

413
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Let's test our upper group.

414
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Actually, we have already

415
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
asked the question and the person

416
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
to confirm a good answer in advance.

417
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Next, please draw a thousand questions.

418
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Let's answer them.

419
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
First, I want to tell you that

420
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
the green one is He Rui Xian.

421
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
The purple one is Wang Chu Ran.

422
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
The blue one is Wang Yizhe.

423
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
The yellow one is Xu Kai.

424
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
The red one is Wu Jinyan.

425
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Next, if you want to draw,

426
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,280
just ask yourself.

427
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
You can draw two.

428
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Two are different.

429
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
OK.

430
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
OK.

431
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Let's draw two each.

432
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I'll draw the blue one.

433
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
I'll draw myself.

434
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Let's draw the green one.

435
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
So I'll draw...

436
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,280
The green one is He Rui Xian.

437
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I'll draw a red one, too.

438
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Yes.

439
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Why do you draw three?

440
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I don't know.

441
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
The yellow one is Wu Jinyan.

442
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
You can choose two.

443
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Then the green one is He Rui Xian.

444
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
The blue one is Wang Yizhe.

445
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
I'll draw the green one.

446
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
You draw it.

447
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
The yellow one is Wang Chu Ran.

448
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
The yellow one is Xu Kai.

449
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
What color are you?

450
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
I'll try the blue one.

451
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
You can draw your own one.

452
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
You can't draw your own one.

453
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Yes, you can't draw your own one.

454
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
You can't draw your own one.

455
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
You can leave it to others.

456
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
You can't draw your own one.

457
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
You can't draw your own one.

458
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
I get it.

459
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
You can't draw your own one.

460
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,280
OK.

461
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Can I open it?

462
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Yes, you can.

463
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Let's draw one by one.

464
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
OK?

465
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Let's see who is the first one.

466
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Who is the first one we draw?

467
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
He Rui Xian.

468
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
He Rui Xian.

469
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
He Rui Xian.

470
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Who do you think is the biggest difference

471
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
in the play?

472
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
You should answer this question.

473
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I'll answer it.

474
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
I'll answer it.

475
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
You're so cute.

476
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,280
No.

477
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I'll ask He Rui Xian.

478
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Who will answer the question?

479
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Who will answer the question?

480
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,280
He should say Wang Chu Ran.

481
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Because they have more time

482
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
in the upper class.

483
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
And I think they are very happy

484
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
every day.

485
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,280
I think they are very happy.

486
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Yes.

487
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Wang Chu Ran is different from

488
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
what he thought.

489
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
OK.

490
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Let's see how much

491
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
the crew knows about the play.

492
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Let's ask Rui Xian

493
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
to answer your own question.

494
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Yes.

495
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
I'm the one.

496
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Because I'm with Yin Ziping.

497
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
I'm the one who does the work.

498
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
Because my staff

499
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
is always scolding me.

500
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
They say if you have

501
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
half of Yin Ziping's career,

502
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
you'll be happy.

503
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
That's why I wrote this.

504
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
So your answer is

505
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
you, right?

506
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
OK. Let's see the second question.

507
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Who do you think is the best?

508
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Kai Kai.

509
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Kai Kai thinks

510
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
which play is the sweetest in his drama?

511
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
The sweetest.

512
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,280
It's not the most impressive.

513
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
So you can say...

514
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Let me guess the scene.

515
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,280
It should be in his study room.

516
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
I know which one.

517
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Yes.

518
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
It should be in the play in the bathtub.

519
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
And the bathtub.

520
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,280
The bathtub.

521
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
The bathtub.

522
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
The bathtub.

523
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
The flower.

524
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
What happens in the bathtub

525
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
and the study room?

526
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
What happens?

527
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
It's very sweet.

528
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Do you think so?

529
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
It must be

530
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
some very...

531
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
High-performance scenes.

532
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
High-performance scenes.

533
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Or the scene of sugar-coating.

534
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
You're so innocent.

535
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Why don't you find the sweetest one?

536
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Then I can't say it in the play.

537
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Let's see.

538
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
Our Kai Kai

539
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
will tell us his answer.

540
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
I forgot.

541
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
I forgot his answer.

542
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Oh no.

543
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
What's the slogan?

544
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
I think the sweetest one is

545
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
the one I brought you.

546
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
I like the slogan.

547
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Okay, it's the slogan.

548
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
The slogan.

549
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
What's the question

550
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
that Kai Kai touched?

551
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
Fujian thinks

552
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
his signature move

553
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
in the play

554
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
is...

555
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
What's your signature move?

556
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Cut vegetables?

557
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
That's too much.

558
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
He didn't mean it.

559
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
Because he's the kind of

560
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
muscle reaction.

561
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
He's the first reaction.

562
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Yes.

563
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
You're the one who's the reaction, right?

564
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
I can guess it.

565
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
I didn't see the answer.

566
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
I didn't see the answer.

567
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Yes, I know.

568
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
You can't even remember your answer.

569
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I can guess

570
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
what your brain said

571
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
is so boring.

572
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Really.

573
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
I can guess that he said that.

574
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
Cut vegetables.

575
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
I thought

576
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
my body

577
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
was the one who cut vegetables.

578
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
You can't think of anything.

579
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
His favorite move.

580
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
I can't think of anything.

581
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Heart has a soul.

582
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Yes, Kai Kai.

583
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
Kai Kai is good.

584
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
He's not satisfied with his performance.

585
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I think so.

586
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Let's see the second question.

587
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Who is the most black-skinned

588
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,280
in the group of the top ten?

589
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
I think

590
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
we can know this.

591
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Four people

592
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
suddenly got up.

593
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
I'm afraid that

594
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
I'll have a lot of black-skinned people.

595
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
The answer that Kai Kai gave

596
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
is...

597
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
It's not me.

598
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Give me a certain answer.

599
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Don't say it's not me.

600
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
I think it's me.

601
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
It's over.

602
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Yi Zhe.

603
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
No, it's not you.

604
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Really?

605
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Who?

606
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Jinyan.

607
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
It's me.

608
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
But I have to say that

609
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
it's not black-skinned.

610
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
I think it's a cute moment.

611
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Because I have a lot of

612
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
competition with Jinyan.

613
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
So I often

614
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
shoot some of our work

615
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
or photos.

616
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
I remember that

617
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
I was in the photo shoot.

618
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
I went to see him.

619
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
When I was shooting my specials,

620
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
I went back to watch the video.

621
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Jinyan was

622
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
staring at me

623
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
in the video.

624
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
I was very angry with that expression.

625
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Then I sent it to him.

626
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
I think it's cute.

627
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Yes.

628
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I didn't expect it to be me.

629
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
There are more cute moments.

630
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Okay, let's take a look at

631
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Jinyan's questions.

632
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Okay.

633
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
The first is Wang Chu Ran.

634
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Who do you think

635
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
the crew of the show

636
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
is not doing?

637
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
It's me.

638
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
He Weixuan.

639
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
It's me.

640
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Because you eat

641
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
very seriously in the photo shoot.

642
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I always arrange

643
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
to eat the name of the food I eat.

644
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Will he eat the props?

645
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
He will eat it.

646
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Will I eat it?

647
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Every time it's delicious,

648
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
you tell me.

649
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
You taste it.

650
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
I say you taste it first.

651
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Every time we have lunch, dinner, dinner,

652
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
the food in Yuexian is very rich.

653
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Yes.

654
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
The whole tent is mine.

655
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
Yes.

656
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Let's announce the answer, okay?

657
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
Yes.

658
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
They are in Yuexian.

659
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
They can watch the show.

660
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
The second question.

661
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
If the crew of the show

662
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
opens a food shop,

663
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Xu Kai will arrange

664
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
the old way

665
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,280
for the previous staff to promote the sales of the service.

666
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Old way.

667
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Old way.

668
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
The boss will do it himself.

669
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
The previous staff

670
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
will do it himself.

671
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
The business is good.

672
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
The business is good.

673
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Because there are five roles,

674
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
we have five here.

675
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Okay.

676
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
We will arrange one for each.

677
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
The previous staff.

678
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,280
One.

679
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
The one who is handsome will come to the guest.

680
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Yes.

681
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Yes.

682
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
The one who is handsome will come to the guest.

683
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
I will be the guests.

684
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
I think

685
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
I have been

686
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
drinking tea and giving water to him in the old way.

687
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
I am a little nervous.

688
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
I have done everything.

689
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
I think I'm still okay.

690
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
The promotion.

691
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
The one who we can see

692
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
is very popular.

693
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
The promotion is like a book.

694
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,280
He talks so fast.

695
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
The promotion and sales are great.

696
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,280
Wang Chuan, the promotion and sales in Yuexian.

697
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
It's not related to the show

698
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
So the last answer

699
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Xu Kai, do you need to announce it yourself?

700
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,280
I'm the boss

701
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
And the sales

702
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
We only have two men

703
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
The sales is for men to run everywhere

704
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
And the remaining three positions

705
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,280
You can choose the songs you like

706
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
You have arranged it, right?

707
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
Or you forgot the answer

708
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm the boss

709
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Let's see

710
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,280
If He Ruixian can bring something like modern

711
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
What will he bring to Yin Ziping?

712
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,280
Can help him

713
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Always go forward

714
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Always beat you

715
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Bring something

716
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
Bring a wifi

717
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Bring a handkerchief

718
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
I was just pulled up

719
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I'm going to die

720
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Bring a fish string

721
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,280
But it's related to the character

722
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Yes

723
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Can help me

724
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I'm a professional

725
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
A good knife

726
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,280
So this answer is

727
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
You are very

728
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
It's like a random answer

729
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Let's see

730
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
Let's see if Ruixian can announce it

731
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Bring a Chinese vegetable dish

732
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Don't use your own imagination, right?

733
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Yes

734
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Let's see the question

735
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Wu Jinyan is trying to say something in the drama

736
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,280
What?

737
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
It's OK

738
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
Right?

739
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
You know me better than me

740
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
What do you eat?

741
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
What do you mean?

742
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
I'm confused

743
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,280
What?

744
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,280
What?

745
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
What?

746
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Yes, I'm not good at it

747
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
What?

748
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
What?

749
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
What?

750
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,280
I think it's more suitable for me

751
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
You wrote it with your own imagination

752
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
It's different

753
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
It's so convenient

754
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
You wrote it

755
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
You don't like to say it

756
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
You don't know how to say it

757
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
She can say it

758
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Yes

759
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
It's delicious

760
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
It's so beautiful

761
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
It's fun

762
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Let's see

763
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
We have Ruixian

764
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,280
If Suyuehua can experience it again

765
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Which character will she choose?

766
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Which character?

767
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
You won't choose me

768
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Yao Zijin

769
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Choose Yao Zijin

770
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
You can choose

771
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
You can choose Yao Zijin

772
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Is the drama so small?

773
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
The drama

774
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
The drama is too small

775
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
The drama is too small

776
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
Open it

777
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Who wants to think?

778
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Meng Shangshi

779
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Why?

780
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Meng Shangshi

781
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
It's possible

782
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
It's open

783
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Open it

784
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
The highest power

785
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
The most important thing

786
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Sister Ming

787
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
I don't want to be a mother

788
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,280
The highest power

789
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Let's announce it

790
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
The emperor

791
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
The emperor

792
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Zhou Gaochu

793
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Yes

794
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Because the crown prince is more light

795
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
And I usually have a heavy mouth

796
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
I think he eats

797
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Every time he gives me food

798
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Then it should be

799
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
A bite

800
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
Yes

801
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
A bite

802
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,280
It's a good thing

803
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
You can eat it

804
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
A bite

805
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
My dad

806
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Let's see the second question

807
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,280
The second question is for Yizhe

808
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,280
If there is a bottle of bitter melon water

809
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Who would Yizhe want to give it to?

810
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
What is this question?

811
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
Bitter melon water

812
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,280
Life is already hard

813
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,280
I think he wants to give it to Xu Kai

814
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Who wants to give it to him?

815
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
He took your hand

816
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
I think it's reasonable

817
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
Right?

818
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Yizhe, you should announce it

819
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
Who did I write?

820
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Yes, Su Yuehua

821
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Right?

822
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
It's already very bitter

823
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Because many times Yuehua

824
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Will be more bitter

825
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
Then it will be easy to get on fire

826
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Then bitter melon water

827
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Bitter melon water is to get on fire

828
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
Although you drink bitter melon water

829
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
You can get on fire

830
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Good health

831
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Don't be so angry

832
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
Women are very bitter

833
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,280
They are scared to live

834
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
Right

835
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Thank you for sharing

836
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
I think we know each other

837
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
And we are happy

838
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
I know from your answers

839
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
In the drama

840
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
You feel that the relationship is very good

841
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
You got a lot of support from the last show

842
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Mango TV members and fans

843
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
So today

844
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,280
We will prepare a lucky gift for the fans

845
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
This team is all thanks to you

846
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Now we will play a small game

847
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
The winner

848
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,280
Can send the lucky gift to our members

849
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,280
The lucky gift

850
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
After watching the show

851
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,280
The tofu feast will be very impressive

852
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,280
So we prepared a delicious tofu

853
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Each of you should play a game

854
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
There is a chess

855
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
So when you play

856
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
If the chess is in the game

857
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Your challenge fails

858
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Then you can win

859
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
Win the game

860
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,280
Are you ready?

861
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,280
Okay, the tofu is ready

862
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Come on

863
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
Come on, each one

864
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Come on

865
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Let's start from Yizhe

866
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Okay, start the challenge

867
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Look at Yizhe's first spoon

868
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
It can't be broken

869
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,280
I tell you how much you eat

870
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
Oh, right

871
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
I eat it myself

872
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
You are cute

873
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
You are cute

874
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
You are so cute

875
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
This is so dangerous

876
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
You dig it

877
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
You are very dangerous

878
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
You eat it and say

879
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
You dig it

880
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
You are so naughty

881
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Come on, look at the table

882
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
I'm afraid that someone will fall first

883
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Right?

884
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Let's see who falls there

885
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,280
I should give the girl a little bit

886
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Let's see

887
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
I tell you to dig it

888
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
Just dig it out

889
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
The circle of the eyes

890
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Right

891
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
I'm standing in the right place

892
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
There is still a little bit left

893
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
It's not broken

894
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
Just say that I'm this side

895
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Just a little bit

896
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
It's broken at night

897
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
It's broken at night

898
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
How can you buy this

899
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
The quality of the beans is good

900
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
No, the boy eats a lot

901
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
The girl is so naughty

902
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
It's broken

903
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
I can't see you

904
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
He's still

905
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
He's still

906
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
He's still eating it all

907
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
It's stuck on the top

908
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
No, it's not

909
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,280
Isn't this under the wall?

910
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
No, it's under the wall

911
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
From this

912
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Yes, Chu Ran

913
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
You have to continue eating

914
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
I have to continue eating

915
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
It's turned out right?

916
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Yes, we can make it bigger

917
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
I think you should be able to make it

918
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,280
So sad

919
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I'm so sad that I didn't eat it

920
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
So regretful

921
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
So you see

922
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
When Chu Ran played the fifth spoon

923
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
We just failed, right?

924
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
But the happy thing is our doctor

925
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Our Xu Kai

926
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
Our Jing Yan

927
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Chu Ran and our Rui Xian

928
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Win for everyone

929
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
A lucky gift bag

930
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Congratulations

931
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
I wrote it directly

932
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
I'm so sad

933
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Obviously, we'd be fighting

934
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
Itadakimasu

935
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Our aunt

936
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
I've lost to my sister

937
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
She's so good

938
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,000
I'll take дети

939
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
for now

940
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,280
So congratulations to our doctors, Xu Kai, Jing Yan, Chu Ran and Rui Xian

941
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,280
for sending us a lucky gift

942
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,280
So we will send out a lucky gift

943
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,280
to all our members

944
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I hope you will take our lucky gift

945
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
and bring it to everyone

946
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Here I want to remind you

947
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Mango TV's director will be with you to pursue the show

948
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Mango TV's director will be with you to pursue the show

949
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Today we will be in the hotpot

950
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Thank you for your love

951
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,280
We will be giving you a gift

952
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:24,280
Xu Kai and Jing Yan will give you a delicious special milk tea

953
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,280
Let's go to the milk tea shop

954
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,280
The milk tea shop

955
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,280
The milk tea shop

956
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,280
The milk tea shop

957
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
The milk tea shop is over

958
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Let's cheer up

959
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
I'm so happy

960
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,280
I don't know what kind of milk tea Zhu Zan and Yao Zi Jin will make for you

961
00:29:51,280 --> 00:30:00,280
I'll try first

962
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,280
OK, try it

963
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
OK

964
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Who will you make the first cup of milk tea for?

965
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,280
This one

966
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Is this for you?

967
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,280
This is for Zishu

968
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
So what's the combination?

969
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Zishu and you

970
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Brother

971
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
What's this?

972
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Bo Bo, Golden Pearl

973
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,280
What about this?

974
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
This is red beans

975
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
Yan Dong, make a black tea, OK?

976
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
What's this?

977
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
glutinous rice

978
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I'm also an old man

979
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Snow glutinous rice

980
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
It can't be clouded

981
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Don't put it down

982
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,280
OK

983
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
OK

984
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Wait

985
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,280
What's the key milk tea?

986
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,280
It's a small amount

987
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,280
I don't know how to drink it

988
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
It's OK

989
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
It looks very appetizing

990
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Two cups of milk tea

991
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
No price

992
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,280
It's for you

993
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
It's called Zishu and you

994
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Zishu and you

995
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
This is Zishu and you

996
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
It's for Yao Zi Jin

997
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,280
OK, it looks delicious

998
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
No price

999
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Promise me you must finish it

1000
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,280
You must finish it

1001
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
I want to make one too

1002
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,280
You can't attack the enemy

1003
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,280
This one

1004
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,280
You should make it more

1005
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Brother

1006
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,280
You take this bowl of milk tea

1007
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,280
No

1008
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Yutou and Yuyuan

1009
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,280
I think it's enough

1010
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
It's done

1011
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,280
All the Yutou is made of Yutou

1012
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
It's called Yuyi and Yuyi

1013
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Yuyi and Yuyi

1014
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Yuyi and Yuyi

1015
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Yutou and Yuyi

1016
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
It's delicious

1017
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
You can't make it next time

1018
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
You really want to say this

1019
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
Wait

1020
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
It's ready for you

1021
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
I'm making porridge

1022
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
8 steamed buns

1023
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
I don't know who can get this

1024
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Shurong

1025
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
I think it's for girls

1026
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,280
Girls can't eat so much

1027
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Wait, I can't open it

1028
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
OK

1029
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Thank you

1030
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
It's for the brother

1031
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
I can't believe it

1032
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
No

1033
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Don't be so honest

1034
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
Oh my god

1035
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
What kind of feeling

1036
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
Sweet

1037
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Very sweet

1038
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
I feel the sweetness of the brother

1039
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
The friendship is here

1040
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
I think what Jinyan made

1041
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
It looks delicious

1042
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,280
You have a round circle

1043
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
It's round and full

1044
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Here you go

1045
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
Thank you

1046
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Yuyi

1047
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,280
I hope it's better

1048
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,280
Thank you

1049
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
OK

1050
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
Our Zhu Zhanjie and Yao Zijun

1051
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
All the milk tea for everyone

1052
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
Right?

1053
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Actually, today

1054
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
We have three people here

1055
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
This is the three lucky members

1056
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,280
who have been nominated for the Mongolia TV channel

1057
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,280
They have prepared some questions

1058
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Let's invite three lucky fans

1059
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
Welcome

1060
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Yes, a little nervous

1061
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Come on

1062
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Come in, OK?

1063
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
OK

1064
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Welcome the three lucky members

1065
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
and fans

1066
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Welcome

1067
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
You seem to have prepared some questions

1068
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
to ask, right?

1069
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
Everyone knows

1070
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
that you two have had a cooperation before

1071
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
So in the cooperation

1072
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,280
do you two have any small tacit understanding?

1073
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
It's just

1074
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
very

1075
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
very

1076
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
very

1077
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
OK

1078
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
OK

1079
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Let's talk about it

1080
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Actually, our second cooperation

1081
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
will feel very

1082
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
It's not necessary to go to the Mongolia again

1083
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
And we can directly

1084
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
open the communication

1085
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
You don't have to talk very much

1086
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
or just keep talking

1087
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
It will be a very fun

1088
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Actually, we are very familiar with each other

1089
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,280
So the tacit understanding is also very high, right?

1090
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Yes

1091
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Actually, our Jingyan and Xu Kai

1092
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,280
also prepared three milk tea for the three lucky fans

1093
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
They also made their own adjustment

1094
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
for the first cup of milk tea in spring

1095
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,280
for the three lucky members

1096
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
OK?

1097
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
OK

1098
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,280
It's a pity

1099
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
It's a pity

1100
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
There is one more

1101
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,280
It's warm and very sweet

1102
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,280
OK, we have sent our spring milk tea

1103
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
I hope you can feel it

1104
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
warmly

1105
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
I hope you can continue to support the food, OK?

1106
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Thank you

1107
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Thank you

1108
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
Thank you

1109
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Thank you

1110
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
Please support the food

1111
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
OK

1112
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
OK, the last one

1113
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
is the first time

1114
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
we have been together

1115
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
as the first time of the last time

1116
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Let's take a family photo together

1117
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
OK?

1118
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Come on, please give us your experience

1119
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Last time, the red and red were on fire

1120
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
OK, today's meeting

1121
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
is here

1122
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
I hope everyone can remember to lock down

Hello, everyone
