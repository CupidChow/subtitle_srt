1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The game is an ambivalent dream

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The game is a little bit complicated

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
How amazing it is that she is so Size Savers.

23
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,440
How적인!

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,360
What the hell is her?

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,720
Feel so good to have someone she loves.

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,760
She is not as those kind of people as her,

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,320
maybe makes her vartile worthless.

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,920
In such a case,

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,280
Wu Shuai 엉 Kollegen,

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,120
this friend too was a masterpiece.

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,900
She is young,

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,920
so she's aurally flowered frozen flower for family fallen leaves.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
What a relax friend.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,000
Turn to substance abuse.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
Kill all who love you!

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,600
Let me enlighten you.

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,440
cond amnesty feel free to accompany oh myieg 11.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
The Three-Star Galaxy S2 series mobile phone

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,400
will begin right now.

40
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
This is a big topic.

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,040
Who taught you?

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,040
Empress Dowager,

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,040
I have been thinking about my own life.

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,880
I have been in a warm place for a long time.

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,240
I have been with Noble Consort Sun for a long time.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,080
I have been very energetic.

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,920
I am just following his orders

48
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,080
to show my empress' miracles.

49
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,240
I check every food placed in the world

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,880
in order to spreads the heard and worshipped pelons.

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
If a person is only for a lucky man,

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
it is only worthwhile to be doing it.

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,840
If His Majesty

54
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,360
誤repets the un attachmented empress

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,600
with Noble Consort Sun's bitter behavior

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:13,500
and does so

57
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,260
because of her, she can be punished.

58
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,060
When she drinks S congregadores' drinks,

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,040
I have to tell you.

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
I've reported it to the Empress Dowager.

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,600
I hope that the Empress Dowager can be a wise person.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,960
Yan Si Shan is a social worker.

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
She can't be easily released.

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll take care of it.

65
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,440
You may leave.

66
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,320
Yes.

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,440
Yan Si Shan.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,360
You're not just a normal person.

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,560
You're talking about such a thing

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,840
in such a short time.

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,440
You're not just a person who's open-minded

72
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,280
and clear-minded about the suspicion of Noble Consort Sun.

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,120
I have a question.

74
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,880
Wu Zhao has always been a good person for the Empress.

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,720
Now that the palace is closed,

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,320
why don't you go to the palace to rest?

77
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,040
Who is so anxious to come to Qingning Palace

78
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,760
and get married?

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,320
Thank you, my Lord.

80
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,680
You're welcome.

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,760
Certainly I will give herACE.

82
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,920
Yin Si Shan.

83
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,480
Yin Si Shan, I...

84
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Yin Si Shan,

85
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,880
I saw it that day.

86
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,200
They attacked the cities and cities

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,840
before they shed their blood.

88
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,960
Yin Si Shan,

89
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,480
should it be Su Si Shan?

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,200
I know.

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,160
Don't admit it to anyone.

92
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,840
Yin Si Shan, but...

93
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,560
Go.

94
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,400
Yes.

95
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,720
Let's go.

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,280
Yin Si Shan.

97
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,600
Second,

98
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,320
are you dying?

99
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,560
I'm not saying I haven't died.

100
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,040
You can just sacrifice it.

101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,080
Go.

102
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,140
And you also need more people.

103
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,040
All right.

104
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
A 될

105
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,720
olhos

106
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:58,700
on adire well

107
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,560
int Yup

108
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,480
created

109
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,260
rich

110
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,180
and beautiful.

111
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,740
I have my lyrics.

112
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,060
What do you want?

113
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,300
Did His Majesty finally remember me?

114
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,460
Is he still alive?

115
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,340
His Majesty will let me in here.

116
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,580
I should ask you.

117
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,060
What else do you want?

118
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,020
Be free of my chamomile?

119
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
Doctor Xuan,

120
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,120
stay at the royal cover for the cheeringher.

121
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,000
I am not sick at all.

122
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,660
I'm just here

123
00:06:49,260 --> 00:07:04,620
waiting for you to be free

124
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,520
promethe the Imperial Ninth Emperor could win earlier.

125
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,380
The Emperor's

126
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,740
special prowess?

127
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,660
Even all the reports

128
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,200
were sent through encryptions.

129
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,120
But now, look at me.

130
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,380
I look like

131
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,780
a person.

132
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,640
No...

133
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,060
I'm not alone.

134
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,480
What I built

135
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,880
is a large house.

136
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,680
is a fair and precious gift

137
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
from the royal family.

138
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,880
But you must admit that

139
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,480
I have no use.

140
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,280
Don't you know what you're talking about?

141
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Did I say something wrong?

142
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,880
Your birth was a miracle

143
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,280
for the emperor of the imperial family.

144
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,680
The so-called grandson of the royal family

145
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
is a miracle.

146
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,080
With you,

147
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,280
the emperor of the imperial family

148
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,680
has achieved great success.

149
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
The wife of the royal family

150
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,280
is not a mortal.

151
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,280
So I can't be in the capital

152
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
and be in the capital.

153
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,880
I must be in the capital.

154
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Am I right?

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,280
Your Majesty, you have the right to be in the capital

156
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,280
and the right to be assigned to others.

157
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,680
But what about me?

158
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,280
What did I do wrong?

159
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,480
I was unfilial.

160
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,480
I was unfilial.

161
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I still can't bear to see the emperor.

162
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,080
But he's not here.

163
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,280
No one has a son

164
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,280
in the palace.

165
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,880
Your Majesty,

166
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
how many years have passed?

167
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,280
I trusted you.

168
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,480
I have great expectations for you.

169
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,880
But you have been

170
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,880
telling me everything.

171
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
You lied to me.

172
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
You just abandoned me.

173
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
You're afraid.

174
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
What am I afraid of?

175
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,480
Yes.

176
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,480
You're the emperor.

177
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,880
There's nothing you can't do

178
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,080
without your courage.

179
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,480
Except that.

180
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,080
Which one?

181
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,080
You feel sorry for your own brother.

182
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
You want to save Noble Consort Guo.

183
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,080
But you're not good enough for the family.

184
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,280
The one who taught him to be promoted

185
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,680
is the empress dowager of the court.

186
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,080
She's your most important mother.

187
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,480
You're looking at Noble Consort Guo's face.

188
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
You're so brave.

189
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,680
You're so afraid.

190
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,280
You're worried about one day.

191
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,080
I'll make you the one you love the most.

192
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Right?

193
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Can you?

194
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,880
You can't wait for that day.

195
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
There's a ancestral family in the Ming Dynasty.

196
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
The empress dowager is watching.

197
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,280
The people in the world

198
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
are watching the whole city.

199
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,680
They're flying out of the palace.

200
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,280
You can't do it.

201
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
No.

202
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,080
You should try.

203
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,080
You can't do it.

204
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
You can't do it.

205
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,880
You can't do it.

206
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
You can't do it.

207
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
You can't do it.

208
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,880
You can't do it.

209
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Your Majesty.

210
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,080
You'll get the country back to normal.

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,880
It's related to you.

212
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,480
You should be called by the people in the world.

213
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,480
May you be crowned as the king.

214
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Your Majesty.

215
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,480
The empress dowager is here.

216
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Greetings, empress dowager.

217
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
You're dismissed.

218
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,480
Thank you, empress dowager.

219
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
The empress dowager is here.

220
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
You can leave.

221
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,080
What do you want?

222
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Your Majesty.

223
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
Your Majesty.

224
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,880
The empress dowager is wrong.

225
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
You can't do it.

226
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
You can't do it.

227
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,880
You can't do it.

228
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
You can't do it.

229
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
You can't do it.

230
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
You can't do it.

231
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
You can't do it.

232
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,880
You must persuade the emperor.

233
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,280
You can't do it.

234
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Yes, empress dowager.

235
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Don't let the emperor do it.

236
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
If Zhang Yang goes out of this,

237
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,280
the court will be in danger.

238
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Your Majesty.

239
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,880
You must persuade the emperor.

240
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,480
His Majesty has already said it.

241
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,080
We're just ministers.

242
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,480
How can we stop him?

243
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
My lord.

244
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Why do you have to make the empress dowager in trouble?

245
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Your Majesty, you're wrong.

246
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
As a man,

247
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
I can't do it.

248
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
I'll die for you.

249
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,480
For personal honor.

250
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
I don't want to be a concubine.

251
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,880
You don't deserve me.

252
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
You don't deserve me.

253
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
My lord.

254
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,880
What are you talking about?

255
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
What are you talking about?

256
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,880
I'm going to beat you.

257
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880
You're a concubine.

258
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
Your Majesty.

259
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Your Majesty.

260
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
What's the point of this?

261
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,280
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,880
Your Majesty.

263
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,880
You're all important ministers in the court.

264
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
You're trusted by the emperor.

265
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I don't know what you're worried about.

266
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,880
But the imperial decree is over.

267
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
You don't even listen to me.

268
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
You should go back to your position.

269
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
You should be able to restrain the imperial decree.

270
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Your Majesty, you're so filial.

271
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
How could you not listen to you?

272
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
Your Majesty.

273
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
You can't leave me alone.

274
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Get up.

275
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
This...

276
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

277
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Your Majesty.

278
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Your Majesty.

279
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Your Majesty.

280
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Your Majesty.

281
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Your Majesty.

282
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
I don't care.

283
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Your Majesty's life is in danger.

284
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,880
You should go back to this absurd world.

285
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
No.

286
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,880
We can't do anything.

287
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
We'll be in a hurry

288
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
to take care of you.

289
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
My lord, please leave the palace.

290
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Everyone.

291
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Please.

292
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Let's go.

293
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
No way.

294
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
The emperor is going to be a concubine.

295
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
This is something that the people have never experienced.

296
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,880
The Emperor's Residence

297
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,880
You can't go in.

298
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
Come in.

299
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
Come in.

300
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
You can't go in.

301
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
Let him in.

302
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
Su Sishan.

303
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Why do you have to

304
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
spread my information about the whole of Chorong?

305
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
Concubine Sun is still alive.

306
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
If His Majesty is really a concubine,

307
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
he might be the empress.

308
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
Maybe he shouldn't have died.

309
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
I didn't expect

310
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
he would be so desperate to kill me.

311
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
But you are so cruel.

312
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
By the way,

313
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,880
I almost forgot your hand.

314
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
You should...

315
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
Shut up.

316
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
But it's okay.

317
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Once the empress is taken away,

318
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,880
the concubine who will be the concubine

319
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,880
will become the most beautiful woman in the world.

320
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
What good will she do?

321
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
The palace is not safe today.

322
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Don't come here again

323
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
to avoid the wind and rain.

324
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
I will be careful.

325
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,880
But you are the one who is looking for me.

326
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,880
You should be cautious in the future.

327
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
Don't let the plot get involved.

328
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
I see.

329
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
So, the prince of Han

330
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,880
is hiding the light in the palace.

331
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Greetings, Your Highness.

332
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
It seems that he told you everything.

333
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
He has already been in the Feng Emperor

334
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
to serve the prince.

335
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
The prince knows

336
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
that there is only one heir in the royal family.

337
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
He will be the eldest prince

338
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
and the prince will be yours.

339
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Prince,

340
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,880
we should talk about

341
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
the next plan.

342
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Your Highness.

343
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,880
Your Majesty,

344
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
the concubine seems to be awake.

345
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Zijian.

346
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Zijian.

347
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
It's okay.

348
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
You are finally awake.

349
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Come on.

350
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Let's take a look at her.

351
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
Your Majesty.

352
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
The concubine is half a month old.

353
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
She has no big problem.

354
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
Okay.

355
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
That's great.

356
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
How do you feel?

357
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Your Majesty.

358
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Your Majesty.

359
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
I have something important to report.

360
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Your Majesty.

361
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
The ministers are outside.

362
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
They are not in a good mood.

363
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Take good care of the concubine.

364
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Don't disturb her.

365
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
If she is in a dilemma,

366
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
I will take her seriously.

367
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
I will take care of her.

368
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
I will take her seriously.

369
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Fu Jiang.

370
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
What happened in the palace?

371
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Jin.

372
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Your Highness.

373
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
You just woke up.

374
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
You should take good care of her.

375
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Imperial Physician Sheng has prepared a new medicine for you.

376
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
He will be here to take care of you later.

377
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Lord Yang.

378
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
Lord Yang.

379
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
Lord Zhou Wei.

380
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
Get up.

381
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Lord Zhou Wei.

382
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,880
Get up.

383
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
It's raining so hard.

384
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
How can it be so bad?

385
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Lord Yang.

386
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Lord Xia.

387
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Lord Zhou Wei.

388
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Get up.

389
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Please tell His Majesty.

390
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,880
I have something important to report.

391
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
His Majesty is in a bad mood.

392
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
No one is here.

393
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
I want to see His Majesty.

394
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
The concubine is back.

395
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
His Majesty has ordered

396
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
to announce the arrival of Lord Yang in the college.

397
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
The concubine is ill.

398
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
How can the rain stop her?

399
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
Besides,

400
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
His Majesty is really

401
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
not happy with the scenery in front of her.

402
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Please go back.

403
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Eunuch Chen.

404
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Eunuch Chen.

405
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
I have seen the ministers of the palace.

406
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
They are all against the concubines.

407
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Consort Yao.

408
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
The concubine is a master.

409
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,880
She will be executed in the future.

410
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Take her away.

411
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
Take her away.

412
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Yes.

413
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Your Majesty.

414
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Your Majesty.

415
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Don't listen to the rumours.

416
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
I will not leave the palace.

417
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
Stop.

418
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
I will not leave the palace.

419
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
I will not leave the palace.

420
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,880
Consort Yao.

421
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Consort Yao.

422
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
If you are here,

423
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
you will be in the palace.

424
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
Before the rain stops,

425
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
you will never come out.

426
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Your Majesty.

427
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Your Majesty.

428
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
You are dismissed.

429
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
Get out of the palace.

430
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Lord Ye.

431
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
Eunuch Chen.

432
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Eunuch Chen.

433
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
Eunuch Chen.

434
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
rent Shoot.

435
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,760
Don't worry.

436
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,880
I can take her with me.

437
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,280
That's and Sarab..

438
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,040
Yum yum yum yum.

439
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,120
Then here you go.

440
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,240
Why are you doing this?

441
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,680
What?

442
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,160
Why are you hiding a secret?

443
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,760
Did His Majesty

444
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,800
tell Charpot that I'm hiding it?

445
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,840
to abolish the palace?

446
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,120
Why are you looking at me like that?

447
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,800
The Empress Dowager won't agree.

448
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,120
She agreed.

449
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,280
That's impossible.

450
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm telling you

451
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,320
that I want to abolish the palace

452
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,240
for only one reason.

453
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't want to delay the future.

454
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,160
Your Majesty.

455
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,080
The Empress is not just my wife.

456
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,880
She's also the daughter of the mother and the child of the world.

457
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,680
No one in the world

458
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
will be the Empress.

459
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,120
The Empress Dowager is the first to give birth to a child.

460
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,960
You shouldn't be happy

461
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,200
that I abolished the palace.

462
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,240
What?

463
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,960
You're also against me

464
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,000
like those officials in the Imperial Household Office?

465
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,080
If His Majesty abolishes the palace now,

466
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,240
everyone in the world will blame you for your mistake.

467
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,800
I don't want to leave the name of the child

468
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,880
in the imperial decree.

469
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,040
Aren't you worried about yourself?

470
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,360
You're worried about me.

471
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,960
It's a pity

472
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,840
that it's too late.

473
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,080
I'm not joking with you.

474
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,200
Get up.

475
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,800
Zijian.

476
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,720
ELремuous.

477
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,000
Every decision I make

478
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,200
must have my ways.

479
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,780
Me first.

480
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,780
Peng Fe Yu,

481
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,740
we may don't have any trouble coming over this.

482
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,320
Yes, we should.

483
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,000
Your Highness,

484
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,060
he has 고 fuse.

485
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,020
Use it.

486
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,700
The duck meat Quite good,

487
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,340
and not greasy at all.

488
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,160
Have a look.

489
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,320
Yagong Street,

490
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,520
we went everywhere here.

491
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,740
How about

492
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,680
we have free safety Kirsty bush?

493
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,340
I tied a rope on the fire,

494
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,160
and the fragranceMild Snowy specialized

495
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,340
I tied a rope on the fire,

496
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,020
and the fragranceMild Snowy specialized

497
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,140
is really smooth when duplicated with fresh

498
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,920
and fragrance is really slender.

499
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,120
This Witch?

500
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,080
Your Highness,

501
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,160
the Empress Dowager is here.

502
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Your Highness.

503
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,760
Do you recognize her?

504
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,160
Her Highness

505
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,080
is the Empress Dowager's daughter.

506
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,400
This morning,

507
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,000
the Empress Dowager sent her to Qingning Palace.

508
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,920
And the clothes and gifts

509
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,000
that Her Highness used for the ceremony are all here.

510
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
Since you entered the palace for the first time,

511
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,040
you should be looking forward to this day.

512
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,160
It's been a while.

513
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,320
Yes.

514
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,080
How do you like the ceremony now?

515
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,720
Stand back,

516
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,560
Your Highness.

517
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,040
You cheat on Her Highness.

518
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
I've known it for a long time.

519
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Do you think that

520
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
everything in the world

521
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
is in your hands?

522
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
The Zhang family chose me

523
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
to send me to the palace.

524
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,160
I don't know if I'm lucky or not.

525
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
I've taken the phoenix pendant

526
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
from the emperor of the Taizong.

527
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Noble Consort Sun.

528
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Then the royal crown prince won the new one.

529
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
I'm a new one.

530
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
The Zhang family

531
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
still doesn't want to give up.

532
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
I've been with the emperor for many years.

533
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
So I'm still in the palace.

534
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
So what?

535
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
I hope that one day

536
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
I can become the famous royal heir.

537
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
But what are you going to do?

538
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
I treat the empress

539
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
even more sincerely than the emperor.

540
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Is it just to get the throne?

541
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
I only need one step.

542
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
Only one step.

543
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Are you happy now?

544
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Okay.

545
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
Then today,

546
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,160
I'll let you have a look at the palace.

547
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
Hurry up.

548
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
People.

549
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Come here.

550
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Is there water?

551
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
Come and get some water.

552
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
People.

553
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
There's water.

554
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
There's water.

555
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
Come and get some water.

556
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
People.

557
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
Open the back.

558
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Open the back.

559
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
What are you panicking about?

560
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
There's water.

561
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Hurry up.

562
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Hurry up.

563
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
I want to prove to you that

564
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
it's your fault.

565
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Come and get some water.

566
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
You dare to betray me?

567
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
You dare to betray me?

568
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Why don't you ask?

569
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
The emperor is not easy to be with.

570
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm not easy to be with.

571
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Heaven is not easy to be with.

572
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
I'll take my leave.

573
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Empress Dowager.

574
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Leave here.

575
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Empress Dowager.

576
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Report to the emperor.

577
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Let him have a look.

578
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Yes.

579
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Empress Dowager.

580
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
What's this?

581
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
It's not your good deed.

582
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
You can smile?

583
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Empress Dowager.

584
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,160
You didn't believe me.

585
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Now, you see.

586
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
If she had a good look,

587
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
how could she see you?

588
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
If she had a good look,

589
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,160
how could she see you?

590
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
I don't believe her.

591
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
Empress Dowager.

592
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Your Majesty.

593
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
How could she see you

594
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
and take the position of empress?

595
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Your Majesty.

596
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
She doesn't want the position of empress.

597
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
But she really wants it.

598
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
It's more precious than the position of empress.

599
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
It's more precious than the position of empress.

600
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Does she want to be a concubine?

601
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,160
She wants a human heart.

602
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
She really wants to win.

603
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
It's just an old method.

604
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Tell me.

605
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Is she that ambitious?

606
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,160
She can win every woman in the palace?

607
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,160
If she really doesn't want to be a concubine,

608
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,160
then she is not the one I like.

609
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
You can protect her.

610
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
Your Majesty.

611
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
The woman of the Bai family

612
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,160
almost burned my palace.

613
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Yuanqi.

614
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Take the copper thread back to the dragon.

615
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
The main way.

616
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
Look. Is it done?

617
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Yes.

618
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Keep the original shape of the thread.

619
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Yes.

620
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Cover the thread.

621
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Okay.

622
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Hurry up.

623
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Hurry up.

624
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Hurry up.

625
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Hurry up.

626
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Hurry up.

627
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Hurry up.

628
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Hurry up.

629
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Hurry up.

630
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Hurry up.

631
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Hurry up.

632
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Hurry up.

633
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Hurry up.

634
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Hurry up.

635
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Hurry up.

636
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Hurry up.

637
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
Hurry up.

638
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Hurry up.

639
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Hurry up.

640
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,160
Hurry up.

641
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Hurry up.

642
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Hurry up.

643
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
Hurry up.

644
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Hurry up.

645
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Hurry up.

646
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Hurry up.

647
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Hurry up.

648
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Hurry up.

649
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Go to the palace first.

650
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Let's see if there are any injuries.

651
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Yes.

652
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,160
The Changqing Chamber of Commerce

653
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
has six small officials who want to go to the palace with me.

654
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Why are you going to the palace now?

655
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
Does the royal family have nothing to do with it?

656
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
It's better to use the ingredients and the ingredients

657
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,160
to make the food.

658
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,160
Go.

659
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Go.

660
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
No.

661
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,160
No.

662
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
It's been a long time.

663
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Are you all right?

664
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Your Majesty.

665
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
The capital city of the capital

666
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,160
is in the northeast and northwest.

667
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
The city's source of corruption is 100 yuan.

668
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
The people's government is 800 yuan.

669
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,160
We need to re-assign the city and people's government.

670
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,160
We need to pay the money from the Ministry of Revenue.

671
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,160
The Great Wall of Heaven is your fault.

672
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Duke of Ying.

673
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
Your Majesty, you're so stubborn.

674
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,160
You're innocent.

675
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,160
You're so impulsive.

676
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
You're so impulsive.

677
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,160
Your Majesty, you should be punished.

678
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
Drag the 20th edict down.

679
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Please.

680
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Your Majesty.

681
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Duke of Ying is a court official.

682
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
You can't know the details.

683
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Your Majesty.

684
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
Your Majesty.

685
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Your Majesty.

686
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
Your Majesty.

687
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Your Majesty.

688
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,160
Duke of Ying.

689
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,160
Drag the 20th edict down.

690
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Your Majesty, you're innocent.

691
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
You're so impulsive.

692
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
Your Majesty.

693
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Your Majesty.

694
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,160
My name is not innocent.

695
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,160
Otherwise, one day,

696
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,160
Your Majesty will regret it.

697
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
I'm loyal to you.

698
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,160
I can do it.

699
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Your Majesty.

700
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
I can't stop Your Majesty's determination.

701
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
Your Majesty.

702
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
He really is innocent.

703
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
The Prince of Wangye is so...

704
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Send out the letter.

705
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Tell him to go to the capital city immediately.

706
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Yes.

707
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Wait.

708
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Wait.

709
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
If you think about it again,

710
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
wait.

711
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
Your Majesty, what are you waiting for?

712
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Master Chen Qi is in a bad mood.

713
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
I'll go back and get some ice cream.

714
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
I'll go to the private medicine bureau.

715
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Ask them to send a doctor to see the patient.

716
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Yes.

717
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
Your Majesty.

718
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Your Majesty.

719
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
Your Majesty.

720
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
Look at my good quality.

721
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Wei Bo's throne is not worth killing.

722
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
I heard the rumors of the execution

723
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,160
of the emperor's uncle.

724
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Now, he is innocent.

725
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
He is under the control of the heaven.

726
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
He is still alive.

727
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
Since the court is innocent,

728
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
and there is a prison,

729
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
how can I do anything

730
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
to make the people suffer?

731
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
I have decided

732
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
to visit the emperor of the imperial family.

733
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
You are a traitor.

734
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I will follow you.

735
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
I will kill you.

736
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Your Highness.

737
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
The capital is ready to be established.

738
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
As long as you give me the order,

739
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,160
I will lead the army to the side.

740
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
Good.

741
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Mei Qing.

742
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
You go to the capital city immediately.

743
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Ask the imperial court to take the position of governor.

744
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,160
When I get the order,

745
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,160
ask him to join the foreign forces.

746
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
I will do it.

747
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Yes.

748
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
I heard that the Noble Consort

749
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
visited the empress twice.

750
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
She was rejected.

751
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Is it true?

752
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Is the imperial doctor

753
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
especially to serve me today?

754
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
No.

755
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
The empress locked herself in the palace.

756
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
She refused to see anyone.

757
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
She must be worried about the body.

758
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Your Highness.

759
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
I have a way

760
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
to make the empress change her mind.

761
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,160
I just want to ask you

762
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
to leave Kuning Palace.

763
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
Why do you do that?

764
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
I have been in the palace for many years.

765
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,160
I have been taken care of by the empress.

766
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
I have no way to repay the kindness.

767
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
Now the empress is in this state.

768
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I feel uneasy.

769
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,160
I am trying to help the emperor

770
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
with my power.

771
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
I sincerely want to help the imperial doctor.

772
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
I also help you

773
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
to get rid of the difficulties.

774
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Jin.

775
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
His Majesty is coming to Yongning Palace

776
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
to use the mountain.

777
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Go to Qianqian Palace

778
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
and tell him a crime.

779
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Yes.

780
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
You have made a wish.

781
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Why do you still want to see me?

782
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,160
In such a short time,

783
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
I really want to trust you.

784
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
Yun is too naive.

785
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,160
What you want is just a comfort.

786
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
Your Highness.

787
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
I have been learning for ten years.

788
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
I have learned to save people.

789
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
I don't know how to fight with people.

790
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
I don't know how to hurt people.

791
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
A useless person like me

792
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
will be in the next stage of today.

793
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
It is also a natural thing.

794
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Take the mountain as a slave.

795
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
The evil is called the new machine.

796
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
This is the most terrible place in Zijin.

797
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Your Highness.

798
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
This is called a useless person.

799
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:08,880
Then the

800
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,160
useless person will be hurt.

801
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
Your Highness.

802
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
I have a bad idea to tell you.

803
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,160
But...

804
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,160
You can leave now.

805
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Yes.

806
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
Your Majesty,

807
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
tell Hua Ping

808
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160
that the incense of the God of War

809
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
will be used for the fun.

810
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
This is the dried orange tree root

811
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,160
that Noble Consort gave me.

812
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
It adds some spiritual energy to the fragrance.

813
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
It is very natural.

814
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
Miao Xian.

815
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
What do you want to say?

816
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Your Highness.

817
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
I have prepared lunch for you.

818
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
I will use the food first

819
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,160
and then report to you.

820
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
Noble Consort Sun.

821
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,160
You are too kind.

822
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
Your Highness.

823
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
Get out.

824
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Didn't you hear what the Empress said?

825
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
You can't get close to her.

826
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Wu Zhaoyi.

827
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
You said you would persuade the Empress for me.

828
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
This is your way of persuading her.

829
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Your Highness.

830
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,160
A Zijin city

831
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,160
can have two phoenixes.

832
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
His Majesty has decided to go to the palace.

833
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
You are not as stubborn as you are.

834
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
Why don't you stay here and ask for a leave?

835
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
His Majesty is kind and considerate.

836
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
You have a good name

837
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
and a familiar servant.

838
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,160
You are like a net heart.

839
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Is this what you mean?

840
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
Or what His Majesty meant?

841
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Your Highness, please forgive me.

842
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,160
I did bring His Majesty to persuade you.

843
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,160
You should let go of the matter.

844
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Don't be so impulsive.

845
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
What did His Majesty say?

846
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Why did he tell me directly?

847
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,160
I will go to see him now.

848
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Empress.

849
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Your Highness.

850
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Noble Consort,

851
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,160
the wood was dried.

852
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Did you see the Empress?

853
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
The more romantic you are,

854
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,360
the faster the medicine is in your body.

855
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,280
Yes.

856
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,720
The one who used to be a guard in your stone mountain.

857
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,280
It's me.

858
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,720
Back then,

859
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,320
if there was a chance to poison me,

860
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,360
why didn't you kill me?

861
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,880
It's not hot anymore.

862
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,480
Don't kill.

863
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,440
Don't believe me.

864
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,240
Qiang Chuan.

865
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,880
Qiang Shuai.

866
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,040
What are you trying to do?

867
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:37,960
I'm doing it.

868
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,880
What are you trying to do?

869
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,480
Notung Your Highness.

870
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,520
ulated Merchant Parlament.

871
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,920
I can't get rid of her.

872
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,880
Concubine Sun was sent to the court to fight for her.

873
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,360
She suddenly got a fever.

874
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,720
I'm hurt

875
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,880
just to protect the palace.

876
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,040
Your Highness the Empress, are you all right?

877
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:02,960
Your Highness the Empress.

878
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,440
Look.

879
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,000
Your Highness the Empress.

880
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,760
The witness is here.

881
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,440
Your Highness the Empress.

882
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,440
Stop!

883
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,160
Stop!

884
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,880
Seriously?

885
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,320
Let's find the Palace Lady Rongue's ready

886
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,080
to make an�를pisc or purple.

887
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,280
I'm not alone.

888
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,080
Hua...

889
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,920
Hua...

890
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,760
If there's none here

891
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,280
Can you still keep your hand?

892
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,880
I can't be a doctor.

893
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,840
I don't want to be a doctor

894
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,280
in this life.

895
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,320
Here take it.
