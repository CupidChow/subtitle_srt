1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
Close the eyes

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,780
cover the face

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,200
It doesn't go with my stretch

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,820
I hope the body can spread out

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,040
Welcome to the show

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,000
which invites

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,460
Director T 5

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,540
to use cheer scene

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,500
I'm the host, Feng Jing.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,300
Today, we have a special

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,780
show organized by the hotpot

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,420
because of the enthusiastic and enthusiastic audience.

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,020
So we've arranged it today.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,940
Of course, today is our

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,500
exciting and full-time event.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,540
First of all, thank you.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,420
We also invite the main actors

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,420
to celebrate together.

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,100
Next, please say hello to the main actors.

20
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,740
Hello, everyone.

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,300
I'm Xu Kai.

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,940
I'm the host of the show,

23
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,700
Xu Kai.

24
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,260
Hello, everyone.

25
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,940
I'm Xu Kai.

26
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,820
I'm Yao Zijing,

27
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,620
the host of the show.

28
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,180
Hello, everyone.

29
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,020
I'm Wang Chuanran.

30
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,340
I'm Su Yuhua, the host of the show.

31
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:00,980
Hello, everyone.

32
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,580
I'm Wang Yizhe,

33
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,460
the host of the show.

34
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,340
Hello, everyone.

35
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,140
I'm He Ruixian,

36
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,140
the host of the show, Yin Ziping.

37
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,860
Yes.

38
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,340
Welcome.

39
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,220
Because we've just said

40
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,860
that the main actors are

41
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,740
the active and enthusiastic audience.

42
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,820
The other main actors

43
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,380
are all prepared

44
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,940
to prepare a lot of surprises and gifts

45
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,820
for our active and enthusiastic audience.

46
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,700
I don't know where they are.

47
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,860
So what should we do to surprise them?

48
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,700
I'll go first.

49
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,740
OK. Yizhe, go first.

50
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,420
I prepared a gift for Zijing and Zhang Ji.

51
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,700
Yes.

52
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,020
Then I'll give it to Zijing first.

53
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,660
OK.

54
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,780
I always feel...

55
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,580
What are you doing?

56
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,780
It's too loud when you're scared.

57
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,860
Do you know what song it is?

58
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,260
It's so familiar.

59
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,300
You don't know this song?

60
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,140
Brother Zha.

61
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:58,460
Brother Zha.

62
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,540
You can sing it on the set.

63
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,420
You can sing it.

64
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:00,780
What?

65
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,700
Jiabi.

66
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,700
You know it?

67
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,740
Yes, Jiabi.

68
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,340
Because...

69
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,420
He wants to thank you

70
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,380
for inviting me to witness your love.

71
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,180
It's a word

72
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,020
that I've already said to you.

73
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,140
Thank you for inviting me

74
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,220
to witness your love.

75
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,260
OK. It's too loud.

76
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,060
It's OK.

77
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,020
Teacher.

78
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,540
I prepared a gift for Zhang Ji.

79
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,420
OK.

80
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,940
I prepared something to eat.

81
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,260
Yes.

82
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,060
It's a plate of pork belly.

83
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,540
Why is it a pork belly?

84
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,660
Because it's not cooked.

85
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,260
It's like a blood-sucking.

86
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,820
But...

87
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,780
Because in the drama,

88
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,660
it's like a love-hate relationship

89
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,460
between Zhang Ji and Zhang Ji.

90
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,620
Yes.

91
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,140
But he's good at it.

92
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,020
He's good at it.

93
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,740
He means that if you put it in the pot,

94
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,740
we'll be cooked.

95
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,260
I thought it was a food.

96
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,620
Let's put half of it.

97
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,940
I know. I'll put it in for you.

98
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,260
OK.

99
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,340
Now it's ready.

100
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,780
OK.

101
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,740
It's cooked.

102
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,660
Thank you.

103
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,180
Thank you for the gift

104
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,860
that Yi Zhe gave to our Ji Jin.

105
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,660
We've prepared a gift for you.

106
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,700
Yes.

107
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,380
I'll give it to Zijing first.

108
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,900
Is it a surprise?

109
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,100
It's a surprise.

110
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,940
Zijing.

111
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,060
What are you doing?

112
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,700
This is the automatic stir-fry pot.

113
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,860
I hope Zijing

114
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,700
can release his hands.

115
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,060
And he can use this every day.

116
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,940
Continue cooking, right?

117
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,260
Yes.

118
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,620
And then...

119
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,580
I must be very expensive.

120
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,940
This is a piece of cake.

121
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,340
A piece of cake.

122
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,180
And this is...

123
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,620
I hope you can take care of Zijing

124
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,900
and take care of him.

125
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,500
OK. Thank you.

126
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,460
I wish you good friends.

127
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:49,860
Yes.

128
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,900
Come on. Let's have a try.

129
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,420
OK?

130
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,940
Let's have a try.

131
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,140
Let's share the candy.

132
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,780
Let's have a try.

133
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,420
Then I'll give it to Rui Xian.

134
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,140
Who gave it to you?

135
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,060
I'll give it to...

136
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,220
I'll give it to Nan Shi.

137
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,020
OK.

138
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,380
Here.

139
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,780
I'll give you two vinegar.

140
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,980
Vinegar.

141
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,580
Why?

142
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,100
Why?

143
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,060
You and Zijing are together.

144
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,300
Don't eat vinegar.

145
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,340
Don't be so stingy.

146
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,580
The shellfish will be big.

147
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,100
Open the shellfish.

148
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,220
Open the shellfish.

149
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,580
Thank you.

150
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,940
You love vinegar in the show.

151
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,380
This is the snack

152
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,380
for you.

153
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,020
Thank you.

154
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,700
Brother Zin Suchu.

155
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,420
Because it's rice with vinegar,

156
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,220
I feel like it's not popular anyways.

157
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,660
Let's ask him if he likes vinegar

158
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,180
and Zijun's dish.

159
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,620
Did you discuss it with Yizhe?

160
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,100
And I hope Zijun

161
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,340
will have a happy 100 years

162
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,980
and have a good morning.

163
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,740
Thank you.

164
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,300
This is a blessing from you.

165
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Because you really have

166
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,660
such a blessing

167
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:20,980
for your parents.

168
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,740
You will have a good morning.

169
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,420
Yes.

170
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,540
Okay.

171
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,700
Thank you, three of you.

172
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,620
We have a surprise for you.

173
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,100
You are all very thoughtful.

174
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,140
Next, let's start the hot pot show.

175
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,500
Let's see how you eat while eating.

176
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,540
What do you think

177
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,340
is the biggest soul of hot pot?

178
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,940
The best soul.

179
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,820
Yes.

180
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,020
The biggest soul of hot pot

181
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,460
is the sauce.

182
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,340
I believe everyone

183
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,020
should have their own unique recipe.

184
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,620
Yes.

185
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,860
I'm thinking

186
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,020
if we should

187
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,620
make a bowl of each of us

188
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,260
and share it with everyone, okay?

189
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,540
I want to tell you

190
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,220
that I want to know

191
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,300
if you can

192
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,740
use the app

193
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,580
to watch the show

194
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,460
and to have more

195
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,620
members' full-time activities.

196
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,540
You must lock in

197
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,980
Mango TV's membership channel

198
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,940
The Manga TV's membership open day

199
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,740
to pay attention to the activities.

200
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,340
First, let's invite the first group.

201
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,180
Xu Kai and Jing Yan.

202
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,700
Okay?

203
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,860
I choose the one.

204
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,940
I choose the one I usually eat.

205
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,980
I choose the one I like.

206
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,860
You are more thoughtful, right?

207
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,100
I'll take your bowl.

208
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,420
Yes.

209
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:24,900
I think Jing Yan

210
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,860
will pick the one with the butter.

211
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,660
Because he is Sichuanese.

212
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,260
Sichuanese.

213
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,060
He might put a lot of spices.

214
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,820
He is making money.

215
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,900
He is making money.

216
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,060
Don't tell me.

217
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,660
I'll tell you.

218
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,020
Don't tell me.

219
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,060
Who will teach you?

220
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,500
Is it sesame oil?

221
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,020
Is it sesame oil?

222
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,060
Yes.

223
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,540
It's sesame oil.

224
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,060
I think the seasoning is very good.

225
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,220
I don't think it's good.

226
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,100
It's spicy.

227
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,020
I think I'll pick the one I like.

228
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,900
You are just giving me vegetables, right?

229
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,700
Yes.

230
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,780
I'll take a plate of vegetables.

231
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,260
It's too spicy.

232
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,540
But Jing Yan is spicy.

233
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,220
They don't...

234
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,260
Which one is vinegar?

235
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,300
The one with vinegar.

236
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,260
Is it vinegar?

237
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,820
I dare not hit him.

238
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
I'll hit him with vinegar.

239
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,780
I think there's vinegar.

240
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,100
Leave it to him.

241
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,700
The one we don't like the most is vinegar.

242
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,340
Let's mix it up.

243
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,460
I'll show you.

244
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,700
Next group is

245
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,780
Yizhe, Churen and Ruixian.

246
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,580
What do you want?

247
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,500
Where's the sesame sauce?

248
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,260
I want sesame sauce.

249
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,900
I want spicy.

250
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,820
Sesame oil.

251
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,420
Sesame oil.

252
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,060
The garlic is very strong.

253
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,460
Yes, I put a lot of garlic.

254
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,140
Hot pot must eat garlic.

255
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,660
Do you eat it?

256
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,380
Do you usually eat it?

257
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,100
Yes.

258
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,060
This is your sesame sauce.

259
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,660
Yizhe, this is actually sweet.

260
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,940
You can drink it directly.

261
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,380
We see that

262
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,500
Xu Jia and Jing Yan

263
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,340
have made the seasoning for each person.

264
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,540
Why don't you share with us

265
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,900
which of your unique recipe

266
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,820
has some of them?

267
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,700
This is a little bit...

268
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
He doesn't have any expectations of this.

269
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,620
I wanted to dance.

270
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,700
I wanted to dance to the four-stage seasoning.

271
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,340
But he doesn't like spicy food.

272
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,420
So how do you feel, Xu Jia?

273
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,260
Very good.

274
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,540
Next time, you can dance.

275
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,300
I'll try yours.

276
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,540
It's okay.

277
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,500
I'm good.

278
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,420
What are you?

279
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,940
It's sour, spicy and sweet.

280
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,820
Do you want to share with us

281
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,700
which of your recipe has some of them?

282
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,580
My recipe is all kinds of dishes.

283
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,620
And...

284
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,220
I see that you put almost all of them in.

285
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,500
I put all of them in

286
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,700
and put the soup in.

287
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,060
It's a perfect seasoning.

288
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,420
I think it's not too spicy.

289
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,860
It should be all mixed together.

290
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,380
It should be quite suitable for

291
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,540
the taste of the big crowd.

292
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,620
Yes, the taste of the South and North.

293
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,540
It's the seasoning you like the most.

294
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,860
Yes, it's been a long time.

295
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,740
It's the taste of the century.

296
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,980
So, Xu Kai, you think the seasoning

297
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,300
is the less the sauce,

298
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,260
the better the soul.

299
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,580
How do you usually season it?

300
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,620
Actually, in Guangdong,

301
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,420
we eat beef.

302
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,900
For example, stir-fried beef hotpot.

303
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,580
They don't need to

304
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,900
dip it in the sauce.

305
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,660
They just put it in the beef

306
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,540
and put it in the soup.

307
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,380
Then it's done.

308
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,340
It's the original taste.

309
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,740
Yes.

310
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,460
Or the fresh one.

311
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,500
Or the Sacha sauce.

312
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,740
Sacha XO sauce.

313
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,780
Yes.

314
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,660
I found that the seasonings

315
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,260
are quite simple.

316
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,620
Because I was shooting a drama in Chongqing.

317
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,660
The locals in Chongqing

318
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,980
only use sesame oil and garlic

319
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,780
for the seasoning.

320
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,620
They think that

321
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,300
if the hotpot

322
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,220
tastes good,

323
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
they don't need too much sauce.

324
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,060
They really need to say that.

325
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,860
Yes.

326
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,900
They say that if you eat hotpot

327
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,620
with good seasoning,

328
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,100
you will eat the seasoning later.

329
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,460
Yes.

330
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,420
If it's cooked well,

331
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,380
it's delicious.

332
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,660
Don't you say that the seasoning is the soul?

333
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,860
The seasoning is very important.

334
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
You can't be too picky.

335
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,500
You know,

336
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,580
how to make it?

337
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,220
How to make it?

338
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,500
Then you can give the other two girls

339
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,140
a little bit of seasoning.

340
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,860
It's just the opposite.

341
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,020
How to say?

342
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,180
It's not too much.

343
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,940
You'd better use the soup.

344
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,100
The soup is a little bit too much.

345
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,340
It will be better.

346
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,620
But you can still see that

347
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,780
it's very warm.

348
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,220
Right?

349
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,900
For our girls,

350
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,980
it should be

351
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,140
the taste of different areas.

352
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,220
We just talked about it.

353
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,180
So it tastes different.

354
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,020
Anyway, we are like this.

355
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,060
After we make it,

356
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,220
if you want to make it,

357
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,380
you can make it yourself.

358
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,020
It's also okay.

359
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,980
Okay?

360
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,700
Because the hotpot

361
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,820
is also very happy.

362
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,620
Okay, today, everyone,

363
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,740
we have prepared a lot of

364
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,420
special food for you.

365
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,980
Let's invite you all.

366
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,180
What do you think

367
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,060
of the special food for you?

368
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,860
The crayfish.

369
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,940
The tofu.

370
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,700
The pepper.

371
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,660
The beef.

372
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,540
The fried eggs.

373
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,700
The beef.

374
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,020
Right.

375
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,780
So the special food for you

376
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,660
should be the ones

377
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,180
you know better.

378
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,140
Then today,

379
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,460
we will make

380
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,900
the taste of each of you.

381
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,060
We need something.

382
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,540
We need a little challenge.

383
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,100
So we can taste it.

384
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,780
While we are eating,

385
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,860
let's take a little challenge.

386
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,780
How about it?

387
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,100
Let's tell you first.

388
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,180
Which of our family's food

389
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,940
is better?

390
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,100
Let's go up first.

391
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,300
Because I want to give you a taste of it.

392
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
I believe that

393
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,460
the combat power you have

394
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,180
will be more powerful.

395
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,860
Really?

396
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,340
Yes.

397
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,820
Because you all guessed right.

398
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,660
There are people who say

399
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,740
the spicy crayfish,

400
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,700
stinky tofu,

401
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,820
long sand rice noodles,

402
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,340
and we also have

403
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,260
sweet and sour beef,

404
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,540
a little fried beef,

405
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,940
my pepper, fried meat,

406
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,100
the peanut butter, and soy sauce.

407
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,180
OK.

408
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,660
The game of the horse is very simple.

409
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,580
Next, I will ask a question.

410
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,940
OK?

411
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,820
Please take part in it.

412
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,740
Everyone, answer one question.

413
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,620
We will serve one dish.

414
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,420
OK.

415
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,700
OK.

416
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,300
Come on.

417
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,820
Actually, the question is related to

418
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,540
the plot of the food in the last ten.

419
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,780
Let's look at the first question.

420
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,140
On the day of the wedding,

421
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,140
which hand

422
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,340
did the pig's hairpin

423
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,940
reach out to the pig?

424
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,820
Left hand.

425
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,060
Left hand.

426
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,220
There is no female left hand.

427
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,020
I am right hand.

428
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,180
I will hold your hand.

429
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,580
Let's agree on the answer, OK?

430
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,780
The male is right hand,

431
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,740
the female is left hand.

432
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,460
The left hand holds the right hand.

433
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,220
I can't hold it.

434
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,980
Now the light in the mirror

435
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,820
is light.

436
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,980
Huang Zitao, you stole my answer.

437
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,980
So let's confirm

438
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,140
the final answer is

439
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,020
the female left hand,

440
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,620
the male right hand.

441
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,220
OK.

442
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,340
That's the left hand.

443
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,900
Yes.

444
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,140
OK.

445
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,500
Let's take a look at the correct answer, OK?

446
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,420
As a couple,

447
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,340
whether life or death,

448
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,020
the husband and wife have a life or death,

449
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,220
the picture is so beautiful.

450
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,340
The left hand.

451
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,940
It's the right hand.

452
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,260
It's true.

453
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,300
Do you think I am a hero?

454
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,900
It's true.

455
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,220
Congratulations.

456
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,300
The first round of the opening ceremony

457
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,660
is right.

458
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,580
The first round is right.

459
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,340
Thank you for your invitation.

460
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,420
Thank you for your invitation.

461
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,220
To witness your love.

462
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,180
OK.

463
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,540
Because we have said all the correct answers

464
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,860
we can add the horse.

465
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,300
OK?

466
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,780
Let's see which dish we want to eat.

467
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,420
Ziyan and Kai Kai.

468
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,020
You choose.

469
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,940
The one that Zhang Xiao Ni likes.

470
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,420
The one with the small fat.

471
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,220
The one with the small fat.

472
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:24,540
OK.

473
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,700
The one with the small fat.

474
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:25,860
OK.

475
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,660
It's so important.

476
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,940
Yes.

477
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,460
Come on, Kai Kai.

478
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,180
Try it.

479
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,100
Is it right?

480
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,900
Come on, try it.

481
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,660
It's good to eat while eating, OK?

482
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,540
This is the horse dish

483
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,980
that we got from the correct answer.

484
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,860
But I usually eat this dish

485
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,580
with my hands and mouth.

486
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,300
I can't eat it with rice.

487
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,700
We can eat it with rice.

488
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,460
We don't feel it when we eat it with rice.

489
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,620
We feel it when we eat it with rice.

490
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,620
OK.

491
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,580
Come on, rice.

492
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,340
No.

493
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,420
The manager is staring at us.

494
00:13:59,180 --> 00:13:59,580
OK.

495
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,660
Come on, the one who eats while we eat.

496
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,460
Let's see the second question, OK?

497
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,900
Come on, please listen to the question.

498
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,540
After the hand roll of Yao Zijing

499
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,180
was blown away by the wind

500
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,740
which part of the body

501
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,220
of the pig's trotter

502
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,980
A, the left hand of B, C, the right hand.

503
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,460
Right hand.

504
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,180
Right hand.

505
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,820
You don't read the answer.

506
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,220
No.

507
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,620
The scene of the classic

508
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,900
in our theme song

509
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,220
in the MV.

510
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,660
The hand roll was blown away by it.

511
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,460
Right hand.

512
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:24,660
OK.

513
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,180
The answer is the right hand.

514
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,420
Let's see the correct answer.

515
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,500
Who's the rule?

516
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,260
The rule is

517
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,180
when you think of the god, the god is the hell.

518
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm afraid that I'll be lost.

519
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,980
Here we go.

520
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,340
You're playing the violin in front of me.

521
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,660
The stone is all fake.

522
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
Correct answer.

523
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
Because this is a classic.

524
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Actually, when the hand roll

525
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,660
was blown away by the right hand

526
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
in the MV,

527
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,660
what was your mind thinking?

528
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
Because I think you just

529
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
got it wrong.

530
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Who's the trouble?

531
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
What's that?

532
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,660
OK. Let's go back to the drama.

533
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,660
In the drama?

534
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,660
In the drama.

535
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
Whose hand roll is this?

536
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,660
It's the hand roll of Yao Zijing.

537
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,660
Of course you know.

538
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
Of course I know.

539
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Of course you know.

540
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Actually, I was chased by a handkerchief.

541
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
OK.

542
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
The next question is

543
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
what do you want to eat after watching the drama?

544
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
Do you want to eat stinky tofu?

545
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
OK.

546
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
OK.

547
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
OK. Stinky tofu.

548
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
Here comes the long sand.

549
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
Stinky tofu is very flat.

550
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
The long sand is very hard.

551
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Try the stinky tofu.

552
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,660
But it tastes good.

553
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
It's good.

554
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,660
Let's look at the third question.

555
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,660
While eating, while watching, while sharing.

556
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
Come on.

557
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,660
What is the reason for Yao Zijing

558
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
to enter the palace?

559
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,660
You guess.

560
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,660
You guess.

561
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,660
Zijing should know it too much.

562
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
I'm going to marry him.

563
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,660
You're going to marry him.

564
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,660
I guessed wrongly.

565
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,660
I guessed wrongly.

566
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
But I thought

567
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
you don't want to marry him.

568
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
So you come to the palace.

569
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,660
Let's see the correct answer.

570
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,660
I said I didn't enter the palace.

571
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,660
My father

572
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
forced me to marry him.

573
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
So

574
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
I have a reason for not entering the palace.

575
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
OK.

576
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,660
This question is quite simple.

577
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
You can answer the correct answer in a second.

578
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Let's see what you want to eat next.

579
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,660
Xu Kai, you really love to laugh.

580
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,660
Xu Kai, what do you want to eat?

581
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,660
What?

582
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,660
What do you want to eat?

583
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,660
I want to eat the small pork.

584
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,660
Or...

585
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
Do you want to eat the small pork or...

586
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
What else?

587
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Because my father is a shrimp with a taste.

588
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,660
And the long sand of the pumpkin.

589
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,660
And the long sand rice flour.

590
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,660
And the chili.

591
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,660
Small pork and long sand.

592
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,660
OK.

593
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,660
This is good.

594
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,660
Like when we are done with the cooking

595
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
we can eat the pork with the long sand rice flour.

596
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,660
It's like this.

597
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Small Long sand.

598
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
I said there was a small Long sand.

599
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,660
Small Long sand.

600
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,660
OK.

601
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
This is good.

602
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,660
Let's add one of them at a time.

603
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,660
Yes.

604
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,660
OK. Thank you.

605
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,660
Thank you.

606
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
I'm so happy.

607
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,660
This is the long sand rice flour.

608
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
This is the long sand rice flour.

609
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Right?

610
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
The one in the baguette rice.

611
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Right.

612
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
It's like the one in Guangdong.

613
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
So you can accept the taste.

614
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
It's delicious.

615
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,660
OK. Let's see the fourth question.

616
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
For the whole Master Mei

617
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,660
what did Yin Ziping add in the fresh meat?

618
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
It should be...

619
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,660
chili.

620
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,660
Three.

621
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:59,020
And the

622
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,020
What else did you add?

623
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,660
I don't know. I have something else.

624
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
The crab.

625
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Really?

626
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
You asked me that.

627
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
What else did you add?

628
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,660
Let me try.

629
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,660
The bamboo worm.

630
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
What is bamboo worm?

631
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,660
The bamboo worm?

632
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,660
The bamboo worm.

633
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,660
The bamboo worm.

634
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Yes.

635
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,660
The bamboo worm.

636
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,660
The bamboo worm.

637
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
So the bamboo worm,

638
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,660
the eel,

639
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
and the crab.

640
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,660
Yes.

641
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
Let's see.

642
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,660
Say it again.

643
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
The fresh meat in the original box.

644
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,660
I used bamboo worm,

645
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
the eel,

646
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,660
and the crab.

647
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,660
It's OK.

648
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
It seems delicious.

649
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Yes.

650
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,660
It's nutritious.

651
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
The protein is high.

652
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,660
Yes.

653
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,660
OK.

654
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,660
After the answer is clear,

655
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,660
let's see what you want to eat next.

656
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,660
The crayfish.

657
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
The dish is here.

658
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
The crayfish.

659
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
It looks fresh.

660
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,660
Let's try the eel.

661
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
Do you want to try?

662
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
The dish is so big.

663
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
I know there are many kinds of crayfish in Changsha.

664
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
Yes.

665
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Very tender.

666
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
The fat.

667
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
The fat.

668
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
The flavor.

669
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
Some kind of garlic.

670
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
Some kind of garlic.

671
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Yes.

672
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
We also have crab and crab yellow.

673
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,660
There are many flavors.

674
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,660
OK.

675
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
Let's ask another question.

676
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
Which of the two key points

677
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
do you want to know more?

678
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
A is the spot for the spot.

679
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
B is the spot for the spot.

680
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,660
C is the spot for the spot.

681
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
D is the spot for the spot.

682
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,660
Choose more.

683
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,660
Choose two.

684
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,660
Choose more.

685
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,660
Choose more.

686
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
Why do you want to choose a white one?

687
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Wang Shi Si Shan

688
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,380
is Zhao Bai

689
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,980
Then Zhao, this person has no height

690
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,100
He is AD

691
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,020
You should be BC Wang

692
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,220
No, Wang Shi Si Shan

693
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,700
Are you sure?

694
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,820
What if Wang is?

695
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,500
I will

696
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,420
Drink the soup

697
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,180
I remember Wang Dian Shan

698
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,140
Wang Shi Si Shan

699
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,620
is Wang Dian Shan

700
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,500
I saw Liu Dian Shan and

701
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,220
Bai Dian Shan

702
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,420
Where is Liu Dian Shan?

703
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,340
Where is Liu Dian Shan?

704
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Where is Shi Xi?

705
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,780
Let's see our side

706
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,540
The one we like to drink the most is

707
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,700
AD

708
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,620
So your answer is

709
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,300
AD

710
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,140
It's AD

711
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,940
Let's see if it's AD

712
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,940
Zhao Dian Shan and Bai Dian Shan

713
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,580
have been separated

714
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,580
There are two control areas for Dian Shan

715
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,660
Peaceful competition

716
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,300
You got it right

717
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,180
Come on, let's continue to choose, OK?

718
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,660
What do you want?

719
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,740
He wants to

720
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,220
Dad

721
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,820
It should be

722
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,580
There is a sauce

723
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,740
There is no sauce

724
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,940
There is a dad

725
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,820
Add one over there

726
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,500
It's delicious

727
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,060
It's like glutinous rice

728
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,220
All taken

729
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,060
Come on

730
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,460
This

731
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,460
OK, let's see the sixth question

732
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,100
What method does the

733
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,500
Yau Zijin make

734
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,420
to eat the long-sleeved noodles?

735
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,460
What method?

736
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,300
WeChat

737
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,300
No, it's not WeChat

738
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,900
It's Zao Yao

739
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,420
Zao Yao

740
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,220
Zao Yao

741
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,820
No, it should be

742
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,500
Lai

743
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,460
It's because

744
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,700
Don't say it's so cute

745
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,620
It's WeChat

746
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,300
It's really cute

747
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,860
It's just

748
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,900
He doesn't sit for me

749
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,060
Then I said I won't go

750
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,660
Yes

751
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,220
Yes

752
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,260
I use this method

753
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:46,900
to

754
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,700
know

755
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
He made the long-sleeved noodles

756
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,220
Yes, and then he gave me an egg

757
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,820
But what kind of reason

758
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,580
does WeChat always have?

759
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,540
For example

760
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:56,980
Just

761
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,580
What kind of reason

762
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,580
to threaten him?

763
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,060
Because I told him

764
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,020
it's my birthday

765
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,620
Yes

766
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,580
I don't think it's good

767
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,260
to reject a reason

768
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,620
I think

769
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,380
If you don't do it

770
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,580
you are not a good person

771
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:10,900
Yes

772
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,100
Who says you do it?

773
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,220
I did it on my birthday

774
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,020
No one did it

775
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,760
The Temporary

776
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,940
Let's have a look at earth-pity

777
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,700
We need to eat spicy food

778
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,100
Today is my birthday

779
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,300
I should eat the long-sleeved noodles

780
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,140
And today's best Envoy

781
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,020
You should eat the dresses

782
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:28,620
It's really hot

783
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,220
It's made of donors

784
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,900
think benefited

785
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,140
I want not the noodles

786
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,300
It's my long-sleeved noodles

787
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,420
Okay

788
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,180
The answer

789
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,780
is

790
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,740
because he said he was about to be born.

791
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,060
Let's look at the seventh question.

792
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,220
What ingredients did Su Yuehua buy?

793
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,780
It caused

794
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,380
Han Wangfei to be born.

795
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,100
A.

796
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,420
The person who was born in the river,

797
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,780
B.

798
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,580
The person who was born in the egg,

799
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:54,900
C.

800
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,540
The person who was born in the flower,

801
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,580
B.

802
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
The person who was born in the egg,

803
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I guessed it right.

804
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,700
I remember it very clearly.

805
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,220
They remember it more clearly than I do.

806
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,580
It seems that Han Wangfei

807
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,860
is allergic to eggs, right?

808
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,300
Yes.

809
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,420
Han Wangfei is an old man.

810
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
He was born to use water

811
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,860
to raise his body.

812
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,580
The person who was born in the river,

813
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
B.

814
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,380
The person who was born in the flower,

815
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:14,540
B.

816
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,620
The person who was born in the flower,

817
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,060
C.

818
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:19,820
Okay.

819
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,660
The question is all right.

820
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,100
So,

821
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,140
I will go directly to the next two games,

822
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,260
okay?

823
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,700
It's still hot.

824
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
It's still hot.

825
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,420
Fried meat with chili.

826
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,420
We can make one person.

827
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,620
You can make one person.

828
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,660
Hello.

829
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,500
Welcome.

830
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:42,980
Hi, my man.

831
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,900
Han Wangfei.

832
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,020
Han Wangfei is here.

833
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,180
Can you tell who and who you are?

834
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,260
I need to change my mind towards all those people.

835
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
It's quite a exciting game,

836
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,580
so I made two people with different safety instructions

837
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,660
I prepared it to think.

838
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,900
When I improved a lot

839
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:59,320
I can't predict with the

840
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,660
many nel of people.

841
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,780
But I think

842
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,140
if I let every one of you

843
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,980
realize that

844
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,020
I'm already on stage today,

845
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,900
I know that I can play the other role well

846
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,440
in the music show

847
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,140
bit recommend today.

848
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,860
which one is the most profound?

849
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,460
Which one?

850
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,140
I think I am...

851
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,740
Do you remember

852
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,940
when I gave you the gold lock?

853
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,260
I said,

854
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,540
actually, I've known you for a long time.

855
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,260
I've known you for a long time.

856
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,180
Peter Pan said

857
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,940
the scene of the love story.

858
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,340
What about you?

859
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,060
I washed your feet.

860
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,180
And this project.

861
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,380
Don't you know I washed my feet with him?

862
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,380
I don't know.

863
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,140
They know you washed my feet.

864
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,380
It's really in the wash basin.

865
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,940
I took the towel and rubbed it.

866
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,380
Why don't I remember this scene?

867
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,500
Which fake rock?

868
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,820
Who did the girl wash her feet for?

869
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,260
This scene

870
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,980
should be memorable.

871
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,020
I remember it very well.

872
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,460
I was afraid that I couldn't wash my feet for the first time in the government.

873
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,500
I couldn't refuse it.

874
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,820
I'm sorry.

875
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,300
You...

876
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,060
I'm sorry.

877
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,980
Kai said

878
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,660
why is your scene the same?

879
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,380
Because that's a real

880
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,940
love story for him.

881
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,020
Forget it.

882
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,580
And I personally brought it to him.

883
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,540
It's a ring, right?

884
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,380
It's a big ring.

885
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,780
It's hard to bring.

886
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,860
He didn't open the door.

887
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,780
There are many strings.

888
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,620
It's the kind of lock with long strings.

889
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,700
It's not just a lock.

890
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,420
The string is so thick.

891
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
It's a ring.

892
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,100
Here comes the ring.

893
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,100
It's not a ring.

894
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,220
I'll give it to you personally.

895
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,060
Don't give it to me

896
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,180
when you're alive.

897
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,380
Is this gift very valuable?

898
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,340
When you give it to him,

899
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,300
it's a token of your love.

900
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,660
Actually, I think the gift is good.

901
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,180
The point is that I told him

902
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,020
and the precious moment between us

903
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,780
is more precious.

904
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
In so many situations,

905
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:28,740
do you have any special impression

906
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,180
about your impression?

907
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:33,940
No.

908
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,140
I knew you would answer like this.

909
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,300
You think that feeling is very good.

910
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,060
The meaning of that scene is very good.

911
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,260
Yes.

912
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,860
Actually, we've known each other for a long time.

913
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,380
Right?

914
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,100
And then we can't tell each other.

915
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,060
What's next?

916
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,540
I don't remember.

917
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,420
You got touched.

918
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:52,940
I don't know.

919
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,460
I was touched by that lock.

920
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,140
It's so heavy.

921
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,940
I don't know how much you love me,

922
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,500
but I've never

923
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,620
thought about your true feelings.

924
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,540
I don't expect you to

925
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,460
have the same heart to tell me.

926
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,780
I hope that one day,

927
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,780
you can be with me.

928
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,500
Maybe because I've acted many times,

929
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,860
then I'll be like this.

930
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,780
Right.

931
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,020
Rui Xian.

932
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,380
I have a scene with Ziming.

933
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,620
He's going to be the queen.

934
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,060
He made a bowl of noodles for me one night.

935
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
It's so heavy.

936
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,500
So we're the last scene

937
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
of the night.

938
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:31,980
Yes.

939
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,780
We have a pen.

940
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,500
We've been eating.

941
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:33,980
You know?

942
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,700
We've been taking pictures.

943
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,660
And then we've been taking pictures.

944
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,260
And then we've been taking pictures.

945
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,180
And then we've been taking pictures.

946
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:37,900
It's so painful.

947
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,340
That scene.

948
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,780
Yes.

949
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,060
We've eaten a lot of noodles.

950
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,940
And a lot of cakes.

951
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,700
Is the noodles he made

952
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,940
really hungry or something?

953
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,300
No.

954
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,420
It's a kind of

955
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,940
a kind of a show.

956
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,900
I think it's a kind of a

957
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,460
sister-in-law with him.

958
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,820
And then he's going to be the queen

959
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,300
in that scene.

960
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,660
And then he's going to say

961
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,300
he'll make a bowl of noodles for me one night.

962
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,900
And maybe Yingsiping

963
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,780
has never been so warm to him.

964
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,060
So that scene is quite impressive.

965
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,020
The real sister-in-law

966
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,100
Yes.

967
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,220
is still very warm.

968
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,060
Because I know that in the drama,

969
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,340
the right-hand sister

970
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,140
is actually a little bit

971
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,740
a little bit of a enemy, right?

972
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,820
It's quite complicated.

973
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,580
Right?

974
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,980
Can you be so much more?

975
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,260
It's related to competition.

976
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:17,980
Are they all colleagues?

977
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,780
Yes.

978
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,420
They are...

979
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,220
Secret.

980
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Secret, right?

981
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,700
Share other things.

982
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,220
Yizhe, what about you?

983
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,020
There's a scene where the demon is rejected.

984
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,900
Because in the scene,

985
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
I feel like I've shot a lot of scenes.

986
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,900
They are all rejected.

987
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,980
The demon is rejected.

988
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,380
The scene where he's rejected.

989
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:35,900
Yes.

990
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
The scene.

991
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,420
One day, I feel like I'm hurt.

992
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,940
Why is this scene still rejected?

993
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,820
It's a little bit...

994
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,460
I feel a little uncomfortable in my heart.

995
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,540
It's quite impressive.

996
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,020
Which scene is rejected?

997
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,620
You just said you've hurt it.

998
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,620
It's a little bit weird.

999
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,700
Because it's not actually that scene.

1000
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,300
It's because I've probably shot a lot of scenes before.

1001
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,380
He rejected me.

1002
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,540
He rejected my scene.

1003
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,740
And then I shot another scene that day.

1004
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,620
And then I can say

1005
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,260
why do you always shoot this kind of scene?

1006
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,060
That day, I felt like I was in a bad mood.

1007
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,660
I shot it later.

1008
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,620
I shot it later.

1009
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:02,980
Yes.

1010
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,300
It will be like this.

1011
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,620
Mr. You.

1012
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,660
Today, the female official has a warm welcome.

1013
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,940
She is allowed to come out to see the light.

1014
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,580
But why is Mr. You here?

1015
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,220
The character in the movie

1016
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
doesn't affect the feeling

1017
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
in your current life.

1018
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,100
Why do I think that

1019
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,420
life is...

1020
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,060
Because you've said it all.

1021
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:37,900
It's in the movie.

1022
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,060
It's always being treated.

1023
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,500
It's okay.

1024
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,860
I think we should see each other in private.

1025
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,580
I'm not unhappy when we see each other.

1026
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,500
Yes.

1027
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,700
We still have a good relationship.

1028
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,260
Yes.

1029
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,860
We still have a good relationship.

1030
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,700
Yes.

1031
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,180
What is it called?

1032
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,660
This is called the fried pork.

1033
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,060
Last time,

1034
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,260
we were invited to eat out last time.

1035
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,220
We ate out together last month.

1036
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:03,660
Yes.

1037
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,020
Four generations are really good friends.

1038
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,500
Let's see the kitchen.

1039
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,940
I think it should be

1040
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,020
the one in the dream

1041
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,700
and the one in the lake.

1042
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,140
I thought about a pig.

1043
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,780
I remember that movie.

1044
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,300
The pig was a normal color.

1045
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,740
It became a pig's belly.

1046
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,540
It was very hard to bake.

1047
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,220
It was really hard to bake.

1048
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,340
It was like a play.

1049
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,340
It was like a joke.

1050
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,900
Right?

1051
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:28,780
Okay.

1052
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,860
After we shared it,

1053
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,060
it was a small dish.

1054
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,860
Because the audience asked this question.

1055
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,020
Next,

1056
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,820
let's see

1057
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,180
the most anticipated scenes of the audience.

1058
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,740
Let's take a look at a video.

1059
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,340
The pig's belly is not crispy.

1060
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,620
It's hard to say.

1061
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,060
What do you mean?

1062
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,780
It's not crispy.

1063
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,500
What is it called?

1064
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,300
Your fan.

1065
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:46,700
Yes.

1066
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,300
It's like eating a crispy

1067
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,620
and a strange feeling.

1068
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,900
It's so weird.

1069
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,180
It's you.

1070
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,940
So weird.

1071
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,780
Yes.

1072
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,300
Your Highness.

1073
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
What do you want me to do?

1074
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,420
It's a play.

1075
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,820
When?

1076
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,700
It's not for you.

1077
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,460
Your Highness.

1078
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,020
It's not crispy.

1079
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,900
Give it to me.

1080
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,460
It's a real love.

1081
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,180
It's a real love.

1082
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,620
This question is from Xu Kai.

1083
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,300
Why do you think

1084
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,180
Zhu Zhanjie loves crispy?

1085
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,460
He gave the dish box

1086
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,020
to other men.

1087
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,780
I must eat it secretly.

1088
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,020
Maybe it's because

1089
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,260
others want to celebrate it.

1090
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,260
No.

1091
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,180
It's also a proof

1092
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,860
that he loves to eat.

1093
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,660
I care about him.

1094
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,780
It's a face-off.

1095
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,940
He loves to eat crispy.

1096
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,740
Men

1097
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,940
have a little pressure

1098
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,100
to love.

1099
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
No.

1100
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,620
Yao Zijun knows what to do.

1101
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,260
She's in front of the door.

1102
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,180
She doesn't want him to see

1103
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,020
that he loves to eat crispy.

1104
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,940
It's so funny, right?

1105
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,380
Zhu Zhanjie loves to eat crispy.

1106
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,260
Actually, the others

1107
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,620
know it.

1108
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,540
Because you just

1109
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,740
gave me the crispy one.

1110
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,140
Come on.

1111
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,020
I'll give you two crispy ones.

1112
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,420
So, he eats crispy in the play.

1113
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
Can you share with us

1114
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,300
what else you have?

1115
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,420
I don't know.

1116
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,340
They are two different people.

1117
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
Yes, they eat crispy.

1118
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,900
They are two different people.

1119
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,220
No.

1120
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,540
They can't see me.

1121
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,380
Yes.

1122
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,540
Because I want him to

1123
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,780
give me the crispy one.

1124
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,580
How do you

1125
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,580
treat Zhu Zhanjie

1126
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,340
to eat crispy?

1127
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:01,980
He's the emperor.

1128
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,580
He has a reason.

1129
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,420
You are so ungrateful.

1130
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,060
You seem to have given me the crispy one.

1131
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,900
But I was caught by someone.

1132
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,500
He's out of the game.

1133
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,620
Really?

1134
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,900
Yes, he's out of the game.

1135
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,300
He's still in the costume.

1136
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,660
Where's the doctor?

1137
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,620
I think

1138
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,700
what Kai Kai just said is right.

1139
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,580
Because you must

1140
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,580
like this person

1141
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
to eat the crispy one.

1142
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,740
Otherwise, if you

1143
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,580
don't have feelings for him,

1144
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,500
he won't care about you.

1145
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,380
Are you

1146
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,540
a person who loves to eat the crispy one?

1147
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,980
Not at all.

1148
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,100
Not at all.

1149
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,140
No.

1150
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,180
What is it?

1151
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,940
It's the crispy one.

1152
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,860
It's all the crispy one.

1153
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,340
No.

1154
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,060
If you are in love in the future,

1155
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,940
if you do these things to each other,

1156
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,220
like eating with other girls,

1157
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,340
or what else,

1158
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,060
will you eat the crispy one?

1159
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,260
Like the video just now,

1160
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,460
or something like that?

1161
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,020
I think

1162
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,060
the crispy one is the best.

1163
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,260
That's your phone number.

1164
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,060
I can't turn around and leave.

1165
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,740
What should I do?

1166
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,500
The one you see

1167
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,340
except for the one you eat,

1168
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,740
you ask the wrong person,

1169
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,820
why you give it to him?

1170
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,900
Why do you treat others well?

1171
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,660
That's not true.

1172
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,580
Actually,

1173
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,780
there's a little bit of emotion.

1174
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,420
If you ask,

1175
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,220
it will be a little awkward.

1176
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,540
It looks like a little anger.

1177
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,900
Actually,

1178
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,460
seeing this thing will be angry.

1179
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:23,820
Right?

1180
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,540
If you ask again,

1181
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
why you give it to him?

1182
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,700
What else?

1183
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,420
You will become a little hearty.

1184
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,300
You won't ask directly,

1185
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,820
maybe you will go to the side-touch machine

1186
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,900
to ask about this thing.

1187
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,020
What's going on?

1188
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,620
This thing.

1189
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,700
Right.

1190
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,300
But don't let him know.

1191
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,780
Just let me guess.

1192
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,580
Just let you know that he's angry anyway.

1193
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,420
But he doesn't know why he's angry.

1194
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,460
It's not right.

1195
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,140
What's the reason?

1196
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,820
To guess.

1197
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,540
It's the heart.

1198
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,900
It's the heart.

1199
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,540
Heart.

1200
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,300
Then you will say,

1201
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,940
I come here and ask you,

1202
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,340
why you give it to him?

1203
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,100
Little heart.

1204
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,820
Are you doing this for me?

1205
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,260
I'm good at taking you.

1206
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,260
This is called

1207
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,140
the limit.

1208
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,020
The limit.

1209
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,980
Next, we have a question.

1210
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,060
We have to test everyone

1211
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,620
to know each other's level of understanding.

1212
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,780
Let's test our upper-class crew.

1213
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,700
Fujin thinks that

1214
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,100
he's doing the signature move

1215
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,380
in the drama.

1216
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,580
What's your signature move?

1217
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,620
This is so right.

1218
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,380
It's not the first reaction

1219
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,500
he's doing.

1220
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,340
Kaka thinks that

1221
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,980
which scene is the sweetest in his drama?

1222
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,060
It should be in his book.

1223
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,460
Book room.

1224
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,460
I know which one.

1225
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,820
Yes.

1226
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,740
It should be in the scene in the trailer.

1227
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,660
And the trailer scene.

1228
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,780
You make a black cooking.

1229
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,340
Okay.

1230
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:41,820
This is not...

1231
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,900
What?

1232
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,780
glutinous rice.

1233
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,100
I'm also the boss.

1234
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,700
I'll give it to you.

1235
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,220
What's your signature move?

1236
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,420
It's only for you.
