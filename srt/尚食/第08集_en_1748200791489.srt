No!

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,300
Wait...

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,780
No!

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,220
Did you not see?

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,540
Failed.

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,620
How's against the顽s?

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,140
I'll go back.

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,980

N floial confines?

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,700
Miss Shen,

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
Your Highness, I don't know what you're talking about.

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
The long-term punishment of the Prince's Mansion

40
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,700
hasn't come yet.

41
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
So he's missing in the prison.

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
There's another suspect behind this.

43
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Zheng Jie is on the way to Qianqing Palace.

44
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Your Highness!

45
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
Your Highness!

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,700
The palace is here.

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Your Highness,

48
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,700
what's the meaning of His Majesty's death?

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
What do you mean?

50
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Your Highness!

51
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
I still don't understand.

52
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Don't listen to me. Don't ask me.

53
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
This is His Majesty's order.

54
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,700
You're so stupid.

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
Close the door.

56
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
Read it.

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Yuehua.

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Ziqin.

59
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Why are you still out in the rain?

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Isn't it because Your Highness's reward is too expensive?

61
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm really sorry for my loss.

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,700
I made him some cakes to send over.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Why did you have to put so much rain on him?

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,700
What's wrong?

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Look at you.

66
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,700
You're all wet.

67
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
Your Highness!

68
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,700
Your Highness!

69
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,700
It's so hot.

70
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Ziqin.

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Ziqin.

72
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Your Highness.

73
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Poor Ziqin.

74
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,700
My mother is no longer here.

75
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Where is your mother?

76
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Go and ask her.

77
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
All right.

78
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
You may leave.

79
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Yes, Your Highness.

80
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Dong'an Fish and Chicken.

81
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I'm in the prison.

82
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
I'm in the prison.

83
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,700
The prison is more important.

84
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,700
The more you trust me, the more you dare to do it.

85
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,700
Dong'an Fish and Chicken.

86
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm in the prison.

87
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,700
The General Liu is a famous rascal.

88
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
He's been talking about many things in his life.

89
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
His Highness can bear it.

90
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,700
What's wrong with him today?

91
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Why does he feel that you're not good at it?

92
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,700
I know.

93
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
I...

94
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
I'm going to the court.

95
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
His Highness doesn't want me to go.

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
It's just a gift.

97
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
It's important whether it's good or bad.

98
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Maybe it's burned in the morning.

99
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
It might be burned.

100
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
It might be a water drop.

101
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
You can't go in.

102
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,700
You're the one who's bad.

103
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,700
I can give it to you.

104
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
I've read it once.

105
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
The great doctor of books is a good doctor.

106
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
You don't need to read it again.

107
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
That's all for today.

108
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,700
You may leave.

109
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Yes.

110
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Good night.

111
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Good night.

112
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
I'm in very good mood.

113
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
I'm going out to have some practice.

114
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
Chen Wu.

115
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
Why do you look so sad?

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,700
You can't forgive me.

117
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,500
Let us finish this.

118
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,540
inclusively

119
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,540
Hurry up.

120
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,640
Thanks a lot, Master as well.

121
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
Hurry.

122
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,900
Your Highness.

123
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,660
Your Majesty sent these things out this morning.

124
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,360

It's a white one.

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
The imperial court has reported that

131
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
there is a rare snake in the mountain.

132
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
It's white and black.

133
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
It's a tiger's den.

134
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Your Highness, I haven't finished reading it yet.

135
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Give me the rest.

136

It's white and black.

165
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
What you said came from Qin.

166
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Your people didn't give him a clue.

167
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
He doesn't remain могуillite like this.

168
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
He didn't leave.

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
What's he got to say?

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
All he does is look at you.

171
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
He has that expression.

172
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
You got察.

173
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
When I get to the edge of sustainability,

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I'll keep one word.

175
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
You can kill your forever father.

180
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200

The woman has been shot.

182
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,840

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,680

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,220
Go to the shimmering segurion play by yourself.

186
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,500
It's been so many days.

187
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,980
The more I sit, the more uncomfortable I'm.

188
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,100
Yes.

189
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
The new medicine that Cels just sent.

190
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Let's check it out.

191
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
This...

192
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Here.

193
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
The oxygen in the body is not bad.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Fang Dianshan said that he had been begging for medicine for a long time.

195
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
So he could leave a few pieces.

196
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
But I'm looking at it.

197
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
This is not a normal life.

198
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Fang Dianshan.

199
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Fang Dianshan.

200
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Fang Dianshan.

201
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Fang Dianshan.

202
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Duke Yuan.

203
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,080
Eatsized playing的是

204
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,320
but

205
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,840
What's wrong?

206
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,680
About this

207
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,220
What's wrong?

208
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,020
In our palace

209
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,920
you can't usually to sing and dance

210
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,900
Can you please take Wei Song to work for a company that check directly for廚ina Chen

211
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,900
It's twenties

212
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,160
Brother.

213
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:53,220
He is a

214
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,440
versions of that

215
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,360
You are so bullying me

216
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,220
I am god

217
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:07,660
I don't Robe

218
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,040
Yes.

219
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,160
Yan Tao.

220
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
You did ask Udon stir for you.

221
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,640
How could you break the pardon?

222
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Tell yourchef to

223
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,560
take me to Jinyan

224
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
and get mutton and chicken up.

225
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,880
It's really Banquet food

226
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,760
to sponsor Huishu.

227
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Imperial Concubine Guo always comes to pick people up.

228
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,800
She will say she wants to be a soldier and a soldier.

229
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
She will say she wants to be sent by Su Gao.

230
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,680
I really can't leave.

231
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,160
Xue Luo, didn't I ask you to send her?

232
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,520
Look.

233
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,360
These sesame oil, sweet sauce,

234
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,640
and bean curd, everything else,

235
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,480
I just sent her here.

236
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm cleaning up.

237
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,040
You're still eating?

238
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Zi Jin.

239
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,040
Hu Si Shan was injured yesterday.

240
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,000
Can you send her a meal?

241
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yes.

242
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,680
I'll be right there.

243
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,440
Hu Si Shan.

244
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,000
Weird.

245
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,360
Give you a meal.

246
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,960
Two days of driving,

247
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,400
it's so heartbreaking every day.

248
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,160
Now,

249
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,800
Hui Shi is not in my shoes

250
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,280
so she can't stand being like this.

251
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,580
Please eat up.

252
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,240
Come quickly.

253
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,360
Han Yang,

254
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,000
would you like to join me?

255
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,160
I'd like to celebrate the 10 years defect,

256
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,900
so that Zhandong and Shandong

257
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,520
can come to see me on this horse.

258
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,800
Zhandong,

259
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,640
you are so timid!

260
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,280
Han Yang.

261
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,960
How patient you are.

262
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,880
Wait.

263
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,720
I could place them in their own separate presents.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,280
However,

265
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,560
I allowed

266
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,280
Ruo Guweng's sister

267
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,520
to trade for yourself.

268
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,680
Sheочu's family

269
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,560
is a transformational gem.

270
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,760
Because to us,

271
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,520
she isn't real,

272
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,920
she is just an immortal.

273
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,960
It's none of your business.

274
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I will teach you everything.

275
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,280
I will not hide anything.

276
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,720
Will you

277
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,720
follow me to learn?

278
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,280
Thank you, master.

279
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
My lady,

280
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
I will help her.

281
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,560
So he doesn't want

282
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,280
to requirements to play the pramacas?

283
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,600
to remind you of a few things.

284
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,480
Take a good care of yourself.

285
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
If you're willing,

286
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,800
call me your sister in the future.

287
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,960
It's not a big deal.

288
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,120
But why?

289
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,760
The emperor is a good man.

290
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,800
Suyue Hua is a good man.

291
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,080
Only you can

292
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,760
treat everyone in the palace well.

293
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,960
In the top ten,

294
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,000
at least some people say you're not.

295
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
This surprise is not simple at all.

296
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,040
But Wang Sinan

297
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,000
is quite envious.

298
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
This man

299
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,120
thers for many things.

300
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,240
He wants something уш很多 values to possess.

301
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,680
When he found you for the first time,

302
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,280
he regarded you as suspicious

303
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,560
because he's very naive.

304
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,080
In the harem,

305
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,560
what he can keep one's will

306
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,400
is theниц move.

307
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,880
but it will last longer

308
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,920
if we like it.

309
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,640
So,

310
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,600
it's your turn.

311
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,560
The majority of people

312
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,960
know the existence

313
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,480
ofисьeng,

314
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,400
deeply rooted in the hundredth night.

315
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,840
I am the queen

316
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,880
BERIGH

317
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,780
You

318
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,140
speaks

319
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,320
Ziping?

320
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,860
Xing's hands. You can go now.

321
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,420
Go.

322
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,160
설

323
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,660
fighter

324
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,540
She's been kneeling for two hours.

325
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,060
What is the foundation of our army?

326
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,980
How can we don't know the foundation?

327
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,480
Well then.

328
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,220
Let's find out.

329
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,180
Let's hear from the empress.

330
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,220
Is she the teacher?

331
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,900
Of course.

332
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,580
I mean

333
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,860
I took a leave.

334
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,020
This restaurant is too defective.

335
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,300
I should sharpen this line.

336
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,380
This is safe.

337
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,340
He actually Kinda hurt me.

338
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,220
I should tell you something.

339
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,220
are the one hand,

340
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,420
and the hand in hand in the hand.

341
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:25,540
The 이are words and power of our language

342
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
I hope you can make it back to normal.

343
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,020
I proved it to you earlier.

344
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,140
I didn't see the wrong person.

345
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,900
Thank you, Your Excellency.

346
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,500
Thank you, Your Excellency.

347
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,540
Please explain to me.

348
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,820
Grand Concubine.

349
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,980
It is said that

350
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,220
yet it's too late to serve people.

351
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,500
Your Highness,

352
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,020
I was busy with my work.

353
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,620
But if you liked it,

354
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,540
It would be no problem.

355
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,640
Ever since then,

356
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,460
His Highness has made a willen

357
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,380
You know it?

358
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:26,940
No.

359
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,340
I won't.

360
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,420
Sister Zhang has been taken to the top.

361
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,740
The private medicine bureau is more unresolved.

362
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,020
Your Highness is just too busy.

363
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,340
She is too busy.

364
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,540
When she gets the evidence,

365
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,860
she will come to see us.

366
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,740
She won't be able to talk.

367
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,020
Your Highness,

368
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,540
His Highness is kind and kind.

369
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,180
It's hard to find time.

370
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,500
You shouldn't be here.

371
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,180
Your Highness.

372
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,460
The food is already cold.

373
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,880
You have already failed the law as well.

374
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,060
I'm waiting for you and taken.

375
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,780
I'm leaving now.

376
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,580
But,

377
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
right now,

378
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,160
it's a little late.

379
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,300
Do you want to accompany me with my life?

380
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,700
Okay.

381
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,820
Your Highness.

382
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,620
He你們他們本醜何傅

383
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,860
How dare you

384
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,420
try to get yourself out of this place

385
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,700
It's a囉 brandon for who

386
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:12,300
cęor my

387
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:17,900
you about

388
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,100
my sins

389
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
I was reckless.

390
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,740
Please forgive me.

391
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,860
Eunuch Yuan

392
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,580
asked me to leave before the ceremony

393
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,540
so that you can come back earlier.

394
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,900
I was impulsive.

395
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,860
Please punish me.

396
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,140
So

397
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,940
how should I punish you?

398
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,460
Since you're so stubborn,

399
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,500
you can stay here

400
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,460
and help me organize the books.

401
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,460
Your Highness.

402
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,180
I...

403
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,660
Your Highness.

404
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
I'm the maid of theしゅ gut.

405
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,180
I can't help amiga with that now.

406
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,460
If you don't mind,

407
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,540
'll let me know.

408
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,380
Please.

409
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,100
Feng kardeşim

410
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,540
Qianqing Palace was besieged tonight.

411
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,500
The top two positions

412
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,340
were all made by the restaurant.

413
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,100
Your Highness,

414
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,740
what's wrong?

415
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,780
The past was used to eat

416
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,060
the back of the pig's leg

417
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,380
and the nose.

418
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,100
That's how you get the strength.

419
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,620
Why didn't you remind her?

420
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,780
How would Your Highness know?

421
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,500
Do you know how hard it is to eat food?

422
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,740
I've endured it for a year and a year

423
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,740
and never said it.

424
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,500
It's because

425
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,380
the word is not the word of the emperor.

426
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,100
But you know it but don't remind her.

427
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,300
Why?

428
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,700
Your Highness,

429
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,180
the meat today

430
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,220
is very tender and fresh.

431
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,340
You're lying.

432
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,100
Because you're a new chef.

433
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,020
You dare not challenge the power of the restaurant.

434
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,900
But as a chef,

435
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,180
you should be the first one

436
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,380
to serve the restaurant.

437
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,980
Are you that good-looking?

438
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,260
From now on,

439
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,180
you

440
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,500
will be responsible for my good food.

441
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,140
If you have any burden,

442
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,620
you can take it seriously.

443
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,300
Yes.

444
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,300
Take it away.

445
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,420
Your Highness,

446
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,620
what else do you want?

447
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,460
You made this.

448
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,580
You gave it to us.

449
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,660
We gave it to you.

450
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,100
Good letter.

451
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,820
Thank you for making it.

452
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,380
Good thing, it's best if you thank then.

453
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,100
We no longer have to document

454
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,900
points of our ratings.

455
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,580
You must accept it.

456
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,700
It's no need to reject it.

457
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,020
It's your decision.

458
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,460
When I досτη

459
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,820
made contact with you,

460
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,260
you are all tested for what you love to eat.

461
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
No.

462
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
Miss Yang.

463
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
Miss Yang.

464
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
Miss Yang.

465
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,300
What's wrong?

466
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,260
The night is deep.

467
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,260
The road ahead is unknown.

468
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,980
I'll take you back.

469
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Please.

470
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
Excuse me.

471
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Miss Yang.

472
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,300
Guess who I am?

473
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,020
The most annoying Ping Ping in the world.

474
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,420
The most adorable Ping Ping in the world.

475
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,940
Let me see.

476
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,140
Where is she cute?

477
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,500
She's cute everywhere.

478
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,860
I'm not sure.

479
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,860
I don't know.

480
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,860
I'm not sure.

481
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,860
I'm not sure.

482
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,860
I'm not sure.

483
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
I'm not sure.

484
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,860
I'm not sure.

485
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,860
I'm not sure.

486
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
I dreamt about

487
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,860
thinking about my long life.

488
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,860
But I've been thinking about it all day.

489
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
I don't know

490
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
what my long life is.

491
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,860
You.

492
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Born with a long life,

493
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,860
knowledgable, and well-behaved.

494
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,860
This is the most precious treasure in the world.

495
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,860
The so-called...

496
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,860
Waste?

497
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,860
This is your long life.

498
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
Su Yuehua was born with a famous family.

499
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
She's good at cooking and cooking.

500
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,860
She's good at cooking and cooking.

501
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,860
Her long life is in Bo.

502
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,860
This is why Wang Sishan

503
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,860
ordered her to finish the old manor.

504
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
She was born with an old manor.

505
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,860
This is not possible with Yuehua.

506
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,860
You're so smart.

507
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,860
You're so smart.

508
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,860
You're so smart.

509
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,860
You're so smart.

510
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,860
I was confused.

511
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,860
Hu Sishan asked me to ask for a favor.

512
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
But where's my favor?

513
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,860
But no.

514
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,860
You were so mean

515
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,860
that His Majesty even took it from you.

516
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:38,860
What?

517
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,860
You want to touch the meat?

518
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
I see.

519
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,860
Ye Hua.

520
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
Master.

521
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
What are you doing?

522
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
I'm making a golden silver tofu soup.

523
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
A record of the previous generation.

524
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
The golden yellow tofu is the best.

525
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
The white tofu is the best.

526
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,860
This is the way to make a golden tofu soup.

527
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
This time, I want to use

528
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,860
egg yolk and egg white.

529
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,860
What's your favorite dish?

530
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,860
What's your favorite dish?

531
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,860
I thought that

532
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,860
the snow flower crab beans were the best.

533
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,860
So I started to make a sauce

534
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,860
when I was in the palace.

535
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,860
Then I made a sauce.

536
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,860
Maybe this is the origin of the snow flower crab beans.

537
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
The flower-sauce is delicious.

538
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
It's so big.

539
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,860
Spring and autumn are so good.

540
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
The vegetables are fresh and fresh.

541
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,860
The vegetables are famous.

542
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
The vegetables are original.

543
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,860
The vegetables are delicious.

544
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,860
They are all special.

545
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,860
The dishes are famous in the country.

546
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,860
The dishes are delicious.

547
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
It's so clear.

548
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
The vegetables are so good.

549
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,860
The soup is unique.

550
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,860
The soup has food,

551
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:48,640
Amaang and

552
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:53,320
materials and subscribed to me.

553
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,320
The ancient is the people's language.

554
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,320
The southern is the north's language.

555
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,320
The eastern is the west's language.

556
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
That's the point.

557
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
The good chef in the world is a good judge.

558
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
He has a good character.

559
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
He has a good life.

560
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Now you are the one.

561
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,320
You need to learn

562
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
the famous recipe of the whole generation.

563
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,320
The ancient is the golden.

564
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
The golden is the golden.

565
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Yes.

566
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
He Shu.

567
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
He Shu.

568
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
For the people in the Gu side,

569
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
the goose liver cake you sent is always

570
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
not worth the money.

571
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
You use the new one?

572
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
The new one is too strong.

573
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Only the new one can give the master the new one.

574
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
I can't even tell the difference between the new one and the goose liver.

575
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Hu Si Shan.

576
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,320
You come with me.

577
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,320
The chicken soup.

578
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Yes.

579
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
Consort Zhuang has the quality of the ice cream.

580
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
I want to use the chicken soup

581
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
to make the pure and tasty soup.

582
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
I want to use the chicken soup

583
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
to make the pure and tasty soup.

584
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Can you make the chicken soup with the ginger and rice wine?

585
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
The ginger and rice wine can be used to make the chicken soup.

586
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Especially for the food.

587
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
But if you use the ice cream

588
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
to make the soup, you can use the high quality.

589
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,320
For example, the Gu side,

590
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
the skin is not thin, the skin is not thin.

591
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,320
You can use the skin to make the skin thin.

592
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Even if you are a young goose, you can't use it easily.

593
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,320
If you don't listen to the advice,

594
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
you will have problems.

595
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,540
Man Sup,

596
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Man Sup,

597
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,320
Man Sup,

598
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Man Sup.

599
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,400
Maybe Qin Zi has increased it.

600
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I wonder what he wants to do,

601
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,720
It's so thin now.

602
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,480
What is the sound of the sound?

603
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,480
I don't know.

604
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,000
It smells.

605
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,280
Taste good.

606
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,200
Relax.

607
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
Three years later.

608
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,160
Feels great.

609
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,600
Finally.

610
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,680
Five years later,

611
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,560
Meijian,

612
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,880
seemingly has passed away.

613
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,760
This is a dual kind.

614
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,840
With longstoffs,

615
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,680
one of the same main problem

616
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,760
is the consumption of minimum flammable rays of fire.

617
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,480
Great.

618
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,080
The Project Xu Enlu knows

619
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,520
how to trouble Chatelani

620
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,600
to search for baits and Grain Diels,

621
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,160
via Meng's Academy,

622
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:20,500
to tap into

623
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,500
the Master of His Majesty's Sureé and otherlikea.

624
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,260
Also, he is given the big rucksack

625
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,380
for his source of Давuqal water.

626
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,640
Right.

627
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,360
The schw Adapt Abgeordnemy

628
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,120
Great, great.

629
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,200
It's okay.

630
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,520
This is the one I've been waiting for.

631
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,480
Why?

632
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,000
What's your idea?

633
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,600
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen.

634
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,360
Two, four, six, eight.

635
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,400
七日鲜鱼

636
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,240
Uncle, this is wrong.

637
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,160
Lord Zhao, why are you silent?

638
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,360
Lord Zhao.

639
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,240
I'm done here,

640
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,120
send maidservants to your hand.

641
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,640
the wealth of killers,

642
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
the dish and fruits,

643
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:29,280
which are 3 Eso

644
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,640
Wang is the enterant

645
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,840
stem of what I give

646
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,440
I tell it all

647
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,000
if Wang can see the flower

648
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,680
when I don't believe something

649
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
you can be the tea team.

650
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
You want to be the tea team?

651
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Then let me come here personally.

652
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
I don't have any free time.

653
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
Wang Sishan.

654
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
Meng Shangshi.

655
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
You came just in time.

656
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
You should give Pingping this gift.

657
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
It's fair and fair.

658
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
There are differences in the number of bite.

659
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,680
There's no such thing as a gift in the world.

660
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Thank you for your hard work.

661
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,680
I'll take the ingredients for today.

662
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
Let's go.

663
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
Meng Shangshi.

664
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Go and pick the ingredients.

665
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Let's go.

666
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Take this.

667
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Meng Shangshi.

668
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
They sell ingredients from the world.

669
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
They don't know how to cook.

670
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,680
Now, even the top-class people

671
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
dare to say that the inner house is closed.

672
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
Do you really have to be rude?

673
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
You know that

674
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,680
the cooking of the Guanglu Temple is only 3,000 yuan.

675
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,680
But there are 9,400 people on the road.

676
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,680
They are colluding with the Shangshan Sword.

677
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
The inner palace of the Xu Bao Sword

678
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
is also a matter of the Yi family.

679
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
Alright.

680
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,680
The Qing Jingquan of Guanglu

681
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
and the Wan Zhangyin of Shangshan Sword

682
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,680
colluded with the internal and external family

683
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
to sell the ingredients.

684
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
And Wan Zhangyin

685
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
is the son of the Grand Sword of the Si Li Sword

686
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,680
and the Grand Sword of the Huang Yan.

687
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
Do you know about the Guanglu Temple and Shangshan Sword?

688
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
Do you know about the most beloved

689
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
of His Majesty's Majesty?

690
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,680
And

691
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
the upper and lower parts of the inner palace

692
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
are all his disciples and grandchildren.

693
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Can you take away all the Shangshan Sword?

694
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
Let go of me.

695
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
Let go of me.

696
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
Honorary Master Af acc tall

697
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Mr. Meng

698
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Mr. Meng

699
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,680
This is how your ingredients look like.

700
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,680
Mr. Meng

701
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
The Commander-in-chief of the Central Government

702
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,960
for years.

703
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,240
It has both the powdery taste

704
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
and real food.

705
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,160
How can it be missing?

706
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,920
COM CPR

707
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,760
The real food can exist even in the sky.

708
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,080
As it said,

709
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,400
these palm trees

710
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,520
Song favor is vowed,

711
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,200
it's not worth mentioning.

712
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,680
He's a excellent chef from Shangshi Bureau.

713
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,280
He discovered precious things

714
00:42:46,720 --> 00:43:01,240
having different

715
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,600
If I knew how to buy

716
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,840
what you asked.

717
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,720
I can assure you

718
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,600
you're not what you wanted.

719
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,240
You love ties.

720
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,360
Wu Xiaoxi and Rong Xiaoxi

721
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,440
love ties.

722
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,680
You must be Scanlan.

723
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,640
She's pregnant.

724
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,520
She must be ill.

725
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,400
Zijin,

726
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,360
this Ge Li's

727
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,960
from the Time of Mar infects.

728
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,400
What is this?

729
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,720
I'm used to it.

730
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,240
I don't think it's hard.

731
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:48,960
Give it to me.

732
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,600
Mother is not in good health.

733
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,920
Mother is not in good health.

734
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,400
She was taken to the hospital every night.

735
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
She was given the medicine.

736
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,120
But I don't know what happened.

737
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,440
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,400
Please forgive me.

739
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:36,860
Goodbye.

740
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,320
You can never forget the time.

741
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,680
Notes from Qing.

742
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:44,780
Don't say bad name yet.

743
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,360
Thank you.

744
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,040
Just go.

745
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,320
Thank you.

746
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,100
Father is gone.

747
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,920
Just go.

748
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,280
Don't worry.

749
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,120
I'll choose a day ofupa.

750
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,360
I'll cook home for you.

751
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,560
Remember this.

752
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,960
You need to prepare for it often.

753
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,680
Don't attend to theります

754
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,920
about the오� Technical Department.

755
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,320
Thank you so much.

756
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,160
Go.

757
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:44,600
I'm drunk on the words of the white-skinned man in my life

758
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,600
I can't return to my true love

759
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:58,600
I'm drunk on the words of the white-skinned man in my life

760
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:07,600
Who is crying and laughing all his life?

761
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:21,600
I'm drunk on the words of the white-skinned man in my life

762
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
I want to be right in your eyes

763
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,600
And walk with the moonlight

764
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,600
And spend time together

765
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:38,600
Waiting for this moment to leave the firework

766
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,600
And make a meeting with the dream

767
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,600
The heart in my dream is not broken

768
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:50,600
I think I will be back

769
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:59,600
Waiting for this moment to leave the firework

770
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,600
And make a meeting with the dream

771
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,600
The heart in my dream is not broken

772
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:12,600
I think I will be back

773
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:20,600
Waiting for this moment to leave the firework

774
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,600
Waiting for this moment to leave the firework

775
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:35,600
Waiting for this moment to leave the firework

776
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:54,600
Waiting for this moment to leave the firework
