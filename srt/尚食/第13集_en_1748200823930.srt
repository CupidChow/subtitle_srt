00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Sweet called love

4
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,800
Wine

5
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,840
Purple

6
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,120
Blood

7
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,340
Hit Got Inferior

8
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Ityam every day

9
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,440
doesn't colour

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Father.

11
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
What are you laughing at?

12
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,560
Your Highness, you don't have to waste time.

13
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,360
You asked Lord Xia to accompany me to visit the village.

14
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,120
You know the people's suffering.

15
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,520
Lord Xia always forced me to eat with the chicken.

16
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
I've been in hatred for a long time.

17
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,680
So I sent people to the investigation room secretly

18
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,960
to find his crime.

19
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,400
But the person who sent me back told me

20
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,640
that Lord Xia only has clothes and a bowl of air in his room.

21
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,160
Nothing else.

22
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,440
Actually,

23
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,880
it's just a matter of time for me to kill him.

24
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,320
Okay.

25
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
Just tell me if you did.

26
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,600
Sure.

27
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,040
What is the matter?

28
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,960
My Lord.

29
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,360
You've been ill for two times.

30
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm afraid you'll be over a thousand years old.

31
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,640
Take me

32
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,280
to the northern expedition this time.

33
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,200
Okay?

34
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,080
A hundred years old

35
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
is a long time.

36
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,760
There's no trace of the death of Ranjie.

37
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,880
Dougharse much has tasted

38
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
it's been thousand years.

39
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,600
I want rid of

40
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
a hundred years in the order of

41
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,160
ingly quick.

42
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,840
But where can you not go?

43
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,120
Royal Grandpa.

44
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,800
Don't worry, Arina.

45
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,400
Because of you

46
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
you were kept in Beijing,

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,080
we can't�

48
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,960
take this famous future

49
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,400
and tilts our lives.

50
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,160
The days

51
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,540
are steely.

52
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,040
People take so long

53
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,160
that each slight tear

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,760
I try too hard

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,200
to make them dupe me if I nicht faith in their emperor,

56
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,760
it's right.

57
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,960
It's also right for me

58
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
to knead Kas Fan's army.

59
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,880
I

60
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,000
should let people

61
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,480
exude minister Xiu

62
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,800
without the permission

63
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,120
from the local people.

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,680
Also,

65
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,280
people from rice fields

66
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,120
Celsius mixture out of the world.

67
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,680
Child.

68
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,460
Your father

69
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,240
has written many famous influencer books

70
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,800
and is really awesome

71
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,120
with many books.

72
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,400
Now that you think

73
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,320
old young man

74
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,120
has the strength,

75
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
you can leave them here.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,600
teokbokki.

77
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,960
You have been from 20th years

78
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,240
to publish a book in Sunset S своего cycle

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,960
by the Autonomous Empire

80
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,920
Why is he contending to Sac가?

81
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,280
His family came from different lands

82
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
and his father died

83
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,240
幾人

84
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,760
One person lost his life

85
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,200
izzily

86
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,760
The death is worth mine

87
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,200
The death of one who will be貌

88
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,320
by the spirit.

89
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,080
Is yours

90
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,680
early or late?

91
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,200
Clear and clear

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,280
We are a hot summer

93
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,400
directed by Gun who is no that

94
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,280
γ

95
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
You...

96
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,960
You really finished your task?

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
You still don't have to do it?

98
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Go ahead.

99
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Zhan Ji.

100
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Wait for His Lordship to win the battle.

101
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,960
Let's go hunting together.

102
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Yes.

103
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
I'll take my leave.

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
The year is the fourth of the year.

105
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
The emperor's army is 100,000 soldiers.

106
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
The land is the fifth of the year.

107
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
The emperor's army is 100,000 soldiers.

108
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
The land is the fifth of the year.

109
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
The war is in the north.

110
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
The emperor's army is the first to rule the country.

111
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,960
In June, the Ming army

112
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
arrived at Dalanam and

113
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,960
escaped from the Wenfeng.

114
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
The Ming army searched the valley for 300 miles.

115
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
The army was full of food and water.

116
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
The emperor ordered the army to move the army.

117
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,960
In July, the emperor arrived at Yunmuchuan.

118
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
The emperor ordered the army to return to the capital.

119
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
The army was full of food and water.

120
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Soon, the emperor was willing to move the country.

121
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
He followed the order.

122
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Yao Zhang Shan.

123
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Don't you have anything to say to me?

124
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm afraid I will miss you.

125
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
I don't have anything to say to you.

126
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
I'm afraid.

127
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm afraid.

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,960
You don't look like you're afraid of being afraid.

129
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
I went back to the capital in March.

130
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I saw grandpa and I left in a hurry.

131
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
I stayed in the capital for three days.

132
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
I deliberately didn't want to see you.

133
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I wanted to see

134
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
if you'd come to me.

135
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,400
Red-braised pork is made by the High Priest's Office.

136
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,680
The High Priest's Office knows it.

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,160
You helped me

138
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,800
get the rabbit back

139
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,640
for you.

140
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,480
Your Highness, this...

141
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,560
I'll write a letter to you.

142
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
You'll be rich in a month.

143
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,840
I asked you to make a gift.

144
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,040
How dare you make a red-braised pork?

145
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,120
With a girl like you

146
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,240
in your hands,

147
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,280
you're really touching.

148
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,880
What are you laughing at?

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,000
Your Highness,

150
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,520
this is another one.

151
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,640
Your Highness has already

152
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,440
taken the one you gave me.

153
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,200
How can it stay until now?

154
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,440
I haven't been back for so long.

155
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,280
You haven't been thinking about me for a long time.

156
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,120
Your Highness.

157
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,560
Your Highness.

158
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,200
Speak.

159
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,120
Your Highness.

160
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:36,880
Your Highness.

161
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,480
Stay in the High Priest's Office.

162
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,320
Don't go anywhere.

163
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,920
Don't stay here for too long.

164
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,280
We don't have time for these operations.

165
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,480
Your Highness.

166
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,240
My Queen.

167
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,280
You're early.

168
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,560
Please stay and take care.

169
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,680
Please keep healthy.

170
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,080
Your Highness.

171
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,680
Your Highness.

172
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
Where is Royal Descendant?

173
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,680
Your Highness,

174
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,440
Lord Yang Rong and His Majesty have been reported to the capital.

175
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,640
Royal Descendant has received a message

176
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,320
and reported to His Highness.

177
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
He is going to the capital right now

178
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,200
and will be buried.

179
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,400
Once the imperial court hears about it,

180
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,840
it will be very dangerous.

181
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,960
Passing my order to Ctrl- això.

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,600
Take Royal Descendant to the palace dealership

183
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,800
and then cellular fields heard oldu.

184
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,400
Yes.

185
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,960
It is not your illness.

186
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
In August of the 22nd year of Yongle,

187
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
the Crown Prince, the Crown Prince and the Crown Prince

188
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
won the child's palace in Kaiping.

189
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
They were injured in the army.

190
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
Be careful.

191
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
You go down first.

192
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
Come down. Hurry up.

193
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Grandpa.

194
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
You said you'd come back from a long journey.

195
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
You and I were both going to take the child's hand.

196
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
Now that the palace is in the past,

197
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
why did you marry someone else?

198
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
You were always in a relationship.

199
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
You never had a chance to talk to him.

200
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
But what did you do to me?

201
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,840
You lied to me.

202
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
But...

203
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Your Majesty, please.

204
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Your Majesty.

205
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
What?

206
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Your Majesty.

207
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
The Crown Prince was kidnapped.

208
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
The imperial harem had 40 people.

209
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
He was deeply buried.

210
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
According to the order of the Crown Prince,

211
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
the Crown Prince was killed

212
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
by the imperial family.

213
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
He was killed by the imperial family.

214
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
He was killed by the imperial family.

215
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,840
According to the order of the Crown Prince,

216
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
the concubines from the imperial harem

217
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
were to be buried under the throne.

218
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
How many people?

219
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
16 people.

220
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,840
They were to be buried under the throne.

221
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
Your Majesty.

222
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Wait.

223
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Your Majesty, please.

224
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,840
The family of the concubine of the funeral

225
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
was in a state of emergency.

226
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,840
The father was attacked by a guard.

227
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Could you please take the late emperor's clothes

228
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
and send him to the road?

229
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
Go.

230
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
Yes.

231
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
You can't go in.

232
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,840
The queen is ordered

233
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,840
to bring Consort Zhuang Fei with her.

234
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Besides,

235
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
the concubines

236
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
must keep the food on the road.

237
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Why bother to bring Consort Zhuang Fei with them?

238
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
I have to go.

239
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Consort Zhuang Fei.

240
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
This is the lotus soup you mentioned many times.

241
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
Try it.

242
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
It tastes like the one before.

243
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
It's different.

244
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,840
The lotus soup my mother made

245
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
is different.

246
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Help me.

247
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I beg you again.

248
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,840
Help me.

249
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Consort Zhuang Fei.

250
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Get up.

251
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
You have been taking care of us

252
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
for many times.

253
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
We are so grateful.

254
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
But we are just a small maid

255
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
in the imperial court.

256
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
The funeral is a funeral.

257
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
What should we do?

258
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
The final danger of the funeral

259
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
is that

260
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
after the sunset,

261
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
the concubines will be buried under the throne.

262
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
The concubines will be buried under the throne.

263
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,840
The concubines will be buried under the throne.

264
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Help me out of the palace.

265
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,840
Help me out of the palace.

266
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Consort Zhuang Fei, you...

267
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
The Queen doesn't want to see us.

268
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
I can't beg her.

269
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
I'm not...

270
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
I'm not trying to escape.

271
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
I just want to see my mother.

272
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,840
She doesn't have a son.

273
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
No one can rely on her.

274
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
I don't beg her.

275
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
I just want to see her.

276
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Even if she says

277
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
she wants to say goodbye to me in the end,

278
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
I'll come back

279
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
if I say goodbye.

280
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
I beg you to help me.

281
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
I beg you to help me.

282
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Please.

283
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
I just want to say

284
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
I'll come back.

285
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
I...

286
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,840
I just want to see my mother.

287
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Can't you

288
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
satisfy me

289
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
with such a little request?

290
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
You want to leave the palace?

291
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
You want to leave the palace?

292
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Consort Zhuang Fei,

293
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
there are only three people now.

294
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
If you don't come back

295
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
before sunset,

296
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
we will die together.

297
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
You want to let me go?

298
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Great.

299
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
I swear I'll come back.

300
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Great.

301
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Before sunset,

302
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,840
you want to kill yourself?

303
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
If I die,

304
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
I'll take this thing

305
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
and take it back.

306
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Get out.

307
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Get out.

308
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
Get out.

309
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Your Highness.

310
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Get out.

311
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
What are you doing?

312
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Your Highness.

313
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Please calm down.

314
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Please calm down.

315
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
I'll do it again.

316
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,920
Not again.

317
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Your Highness.

318
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Blocked the time with the imperial newly.

319
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,120
Don't go out

320
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,840
without any agitation.

321
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,680
Once you deliver the regaining,

322
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,000
you can leave.

323
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,240
But many people

324
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,800
visit us in the Great Zhang Swordswork

325
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,420
in the sun

326
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,440
while moving out.

327
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,600
Childhood people

328
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,520
go to all shallots

329
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,480
and patrol around.

330
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Passing through the long street and reaching the front,

331
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,840
we met the guards and they sent the demons to watch.

332
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
They said that the Ninth Cicada's Mask

333
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
sent by the Liang general had a good look.

334
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,840
When the fox went up, you should ask him clearly.

335
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Next one.

336
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Come.

337
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Yao Han.

338
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
What are you doing?

339
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
You're still right.

340
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
I came first.

341
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
What's wrong with me standing in front?

342
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
You really don't understand.

343
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
Do you know where this is?

344
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
It's a trap.

345
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,840
Get out of here.

346
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Let's go.

347
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Boss.

348
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
No, it's his heart.

349
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Except for Xuan Wu Men,

350
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,840
a man who is really sad

351
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
is in Beian.

352
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
You're so kind.

353
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
You're a dead man.

354
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
You really sent him back.

355
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
You're a dead man.

356
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
Why do you have to be so mean to him?

357
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
You're full.

358
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
It's better to wait for him to come.

359
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Go in.

360
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
Why?

361
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Yeah.

362
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Why?

363
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,840
Yeah.

364
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,840
Why?

365
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
I helped him before.

366
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
He was so powerful.

367
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,840
But now he's about to be buried.

368
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
He's useless.

369
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Why do you have to risk your life

370
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
to help him?

371
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Why are you looking at me?

372
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Am I wrong?

373
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
I came here

374
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
to make a walnut.

375
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
Why does it taste different?

376
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,840
He's about to die.

377
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
What's the difference?

378
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
Okay.

379
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Even if you say so,

380
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Xuan Wu Men is in good shape.

381
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,840
But how can he go out of Beian?

382
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
I heard that

383
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,840
there are hundreds of red cloths

384
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,840
and hundreds of guards.

385
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,840
It's hard to escape.

386
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Zi Jin.

387
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
We're going to chase them back now.

388
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
We can still punish them.

389
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
What do you think?

390
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Zi Jin.

391
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Zi Jin.

392
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
Could it be the walnut?

393
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Zi Jin.

394
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
You're the only one who can trust him.

395
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,840
If it's me,

396
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
I'll have a chance to escape.

397
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
I'll leave right away.

398
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,840
The Empress will come back.

399
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
She never said anything.

400
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
In front of the threat of death,

401
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,840
no one will be selfish and angry.

402
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
No one else.

403
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,840
You can't come in to deliver food.

404
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
But why are you still here?

405
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Aren't you afraid of death?

406
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
You're afraid of death?

407
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Zi Ping.

408
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
He'll come back.

409
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
You know it.

410
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Who will come back to deliver food?

411
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Liar.

412
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
You're a fool.

413
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
You fool.

414
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,840
Let's go.

415
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Hurry up.

416
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Hurry up.

417
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,840
There's a princess in the Palace of the City.

418
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Hurry up.

419
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Hurry up.

420
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
Hurry up.

421
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Miss Yao.

422
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
The light.

423
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
They'll be back soon.

424
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Hurry up.

425
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
They're in front of us.

426
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
Don't delay.

427
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
Hurry up.

428
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
You go.

429
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
You go first.

430
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
Zi Ping.

431
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Don't worry about the other people in the Palace of the City.

432
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
I'll stay.

433
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Why do you say that?

434
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
I should be a dead person.

435
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
I'll take it as my life.

436
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
I'll protect you from now on.

437
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,840
What's the meaning of this?

438
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,840
The night we died,

439
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
I escaped from the heaven alone.

440
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Do you think

441
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,840
the person who opened the door to the world

442
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
is really my brother?

443
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Now you know

444
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
what kind of monster you are.

445
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Hurry up.

446
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
I'm not leaving.

447
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
Zi Ping.

448
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
Open the door.

449
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840
Yes.

450
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
Why are you still stuck?

451
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Look.

452
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Yes.

453
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Open the door.

454
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
Open the door.

455
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Open the door.

456
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Open the door.

457
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Open the door.

458
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
Turn around.

459
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Yes.

460
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I'll go to the Grand Commandant's Palace.

461
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,840
I'll dress up.

462
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,840
Who allowed you to be so rude?

463
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,840
No rule.

464
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,840
Consort Zhuang.

465
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Qi Yan.

466
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm sorry.

467
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
I'm sorry.

468
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
I'm sorry.

470
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
I'm sorry.

471
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Qi Yan.

473
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Qi Yan.

474
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
I thought Consort Zhuang was gone.

475
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
But

476
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
how did she get out of the door?

477
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Zi Jin.

478
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
I'm sorry.

480
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm sorry.

481
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
I'm sorry.

482
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
I'm sorry.

483
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
I'm sorry.

484
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
I'm sorry.

486
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
Zi Jin.

488
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
Zi Jin.

489
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Zi Jin.

490
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,840
What's wrong?

491
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
Didn't you like the sweet potato cake the most?

492
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
It's so delicious.

493
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
I can't bear to eat it.

494
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
I can't even swallow it.

495
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,840
I don't know why.

496
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
It's not delicious at all.

497
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,040
You were ordered to keep this dish.

498
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,840
Then it will cleanse you.

499
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Go back to your seat.

500
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,840
We've never been so stupid.

501
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,320
There's more than several times

502
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,760
that I let you happen.

503
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,640
Yes, there is.

504
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,340
Thank you,

505
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,520
Your Majesty.

506
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,980
What time is it now?

507
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,200
That's what I ordered.

508
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
You haven't even learned the soup profoundment and lycheeards.

509
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,800
They are all raised by god.

510
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,720
Here.

511
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,280
This food is from VICTORY.

512
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,080
Although it is wide Industry Bloody- staat,

513
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,920
it is also not dry and crunchy YouTuber with the brand close-up.

514
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,080
Significant taste.

515
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,820
What are you doing?

516
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,020
How can I get accessibility

517
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,240
in the profession ofningar.

518
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,780
You prepared this for consumption.

519
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,420
Warming up a distanced for the mother's sake.

520
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,680
Her missing event is soon to come.

521
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,440
I sent a recipe that

522
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,240
it's ancel in the house.

523
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,160
Towałware, coriander, convohesas,

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Yes.

526
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Where did Zejin go today?

527
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Go and check it out.

528
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
I'll go by myself.

529
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Your Highness!

530
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Zejin.

531
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,760
It's not reasonable.

532
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,760
Zejin.

533
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Consort Zhuang,

534
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,760
I made you a lotus root soup.

535
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Try it.

536
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
It's very delicious.

537
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
It's very delicious.

538
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,760
I made you a lotus root soup.

539
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Try it.

540
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Wang Sishan,

541
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
I just want to get the last heart.

542
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Zejin.

543
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
Ziping.

544
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
Hurry.

545
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Ziping.

546
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Ziping.

547
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,160
I made it for you.

548
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
You made it for me.

549
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,560
I made it with araz altre.

550
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,760
I made it with araz european Mexico,

551
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
which is like a corn blue.

552
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,760
This is meat卵.

553
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,600
I'm sorry.

554
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,400
I lied to you.

556
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,320
I left the capital

557
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,880
and didn't want to come back.

558
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,760
But Jiang Fu ran away.

559
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,320
I could only carry my mother

560
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,200
and knock at the door.

561
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,960
But the family of our family

562
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,600
didn't dare to resist the humiliation.

563
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,720
But my two feet

564
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,280
are no longer far away.

565
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,840
I had a fever for a few days

566
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
and couldn't fly out of here.

567
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,320
Your Highness,

568
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,040
it's time to take the road.

569
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,800
I'm in the last moment in the world.

570
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,520
It's warm.

571
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,640
Your Highness.

572
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,120
Your Majesty!

573
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,600
Your Majesty.

574
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,880
His Majesty will be here!

575
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,000
His Majesty will be here!

576
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,080
Does His Majesty come here

577
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,960
to give his person offices?

578
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,160
Please.

579
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,940
At your later order.

580
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,280
Don't make her rearranged into amana.

581
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,040
That's not relevant.

582
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,960
You shouldn't do anything to me, Your Majesty.

583
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,400
OK.

584
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,760
Miss.

585
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,400
Mother, I'm going inside.

586
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,960
Your Highness.

587
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
Your Highness.

588
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Your Highness.

589
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
Your Highness.

590
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,960
Your Highness.

591
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Your Highness.

592
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Are you all right?

593
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Get down.

594
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Now,

595
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
you all understand?

596
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
How dare you!

597
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
I have no children.

598
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
I will die of shame.

599
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
I will die of shame.

600
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Moreover,

601
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
His Majesty is now in the health of the body.

602
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
I just

603
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
can't bear to see him die.

604
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
I just can't bear to see him die.

605
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
However,

606
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
I can't bear to see him die.

607
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,960
You were promoted by the Emperor of the Crown Prince,

608
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,960
and you have never been able to cure your son.

609
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Why don't you think about it?

610
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
Who will decide your fate?

611
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
You.

612
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
Your Highness.

613
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
Your hand

614
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
is shaking.

615
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
I will send you back to the palace.

616
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
Ziping.

617
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Ziping.

618
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Ziping.

619
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
Yanzi.

620
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Ziping.

621
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Ziping.

622
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Ziping,

623
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Zijin.

624
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Zidin.

625
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:38,960
Ziping.

626
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Zi Jin.

627
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Hurry.

628
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Come back.

629
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
What are you doing?

630
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Didn't you know how to get out of the door?

631
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Now that we've been in the same country,

632
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,960
we're still in the same place.

633
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
We still have a chance.

634
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Let's go.

635
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Come here.

636
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Tell me.

637
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,960
Why are you leaving?

638
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,960
The funeral.

639
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
The funeral is just a waste of money.

640
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
We're the servants of the Shang's Bureau.

641
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Promise me.

642
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
You don't have to go to the imperial grandson anymore.

643
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
We don't have to be the servants of the Shang's Bureau.

644
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Just be the servants of the Shang's Bureau.

645
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,960
Okay?

646
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
Ziping.

647
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
The rich and the rich are the first to taste the food.

648
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,960
No matter how precious everything is,

649
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,960
it's not enough to face life.

650
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
Look at today's situation.

651
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,960
I'm afraid you'll be pretending to be the servants of the Shang's Bureau.

652
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Don't worry.

653
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,960
I won't.

654
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,960
If I were the concubine,

655
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
if I were the son of the Wu,

656
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,960
I might be buried.

657
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
But if I were the concubine,

658
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,960
I might be killed by the wrongdoers.

659
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
I'm leaving the palace today.

660
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
I have no way out.

661
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
How can I go out of the capital?

662
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
How can I live with a girl?

663
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,960
How can I be a good girl?

664
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,960
Zijin.

665
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,960
What should we do?

666
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
The sky is like a black-and-white map.

667
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Don't you want to escape?

668
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
She wants to.

669
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
But where will she escape?

670
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Even if she really escapes,

671
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
she's still a member of the Zhu Lianjiu tribe.

672
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,960
She can't escape.

673
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Since she can't escape,

674
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,960
she'll stay.

675
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Ziping.

676
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
It's a grave mistake.

677
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
It's a right to make a mistake.

678
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
It's a right to make a mistake.

679
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,380
But she's the ancestral

680
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
and the crown prince.

681
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,960
She can't be a official.

682
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
I'm not afraid.

683
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Ziping.

684
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Don't be afraid.

685
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,960
No matter when,

686
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
remember the four words.

687
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
It's a human being.

688
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,960
Think about it.

689
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
Whether it's a female official,

690
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
or a concubine,

691
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
even the most ordinary people,

692
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
there's no place for them.

693
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
There's always a way out.

694
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
No matter where you go,

695
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
no matter how far you go,

696
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,960
as long as you're with someone,

697
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
not alone,

698
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
you can support me for a long time

699
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,960
with this thought.

700
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
Maybe the way out

701
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:28,960
is the way out.

702
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,960
Go.

703
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
Hu Sishan.

704
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
This is the medical kit I wrote.

705
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Help me check it.

706
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
She gave the Consort Zhuang a jade pendant

707
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
and left Beiya School in Ping'an.

708
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,960
What kind of jade pendant?

709
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,960
I'm not afraid.

710
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
I'm not afraid.

711
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,960
I'm not afraid.

712
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
I'm not afraid.

713
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,960
I'm not afraid.

714
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,960
I'm not afraid.

715
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,960
I'm not afraid.

716
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,960
I'm not afraid.

717
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,960
I'm not afraid.

718
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I'm not afraid.

719
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,960
I'm not afraid.

720
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I'm not afraid.

721
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,960
I'm not afraid.

722
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
I'm not afraid.

723
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,960
I'm not afraid.

724
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,960
I'm not afraid.

725
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,960
I'm not afraid.

726
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
I'm not afraid.

727
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
I'm not afraid.

728
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
I'm not afraid.

729
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
I'm not afraid.

730
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
I'm not afraid.

731
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,960
I'm not afraid.

732
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,960
I'm not afraid.

733
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
I'm not afraid.

734
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,960
I'm not afraid.

735
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
I'm not afraid.

736
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,960
I'm not afraid.

737
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
I'm not afraid.

738
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:03,960
I'm not afraid.

739
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,960
I'm not afraid.

740
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,960
I'm not afraid.

741
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
I'm not afraid.

742
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,960
I'm not afraid.

743
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,960
I'm not afraid.

744
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,960
I'm not afraid.

745
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,960
I'm not afraid.

746
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,960
I'm not afraid.

747
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,960
I'm not afraid.

748
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,960
I'm not afraid.

749
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,960
I'm not afraid.

750
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,960
I'm not afraid.

751
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,960
I'm not afraid.

752
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,960
I'm not afraid.

753
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,960
I'm not afraid.

754
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,960
I'm not afraid.

755
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I'm not afraid.

756
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,960
I'm not afraid.

757
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,960
I'm not afraid.

758
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,960

759
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
I'm not afraid.

760
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,960
I'm not afraid.

769
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,960
You can't be a little bold.

770
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,960
If we go against the strict landland,

00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,960
will we be wiped out?

772
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,960
This person is beautiful.

773
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,380
Who are you thinking of?

774
