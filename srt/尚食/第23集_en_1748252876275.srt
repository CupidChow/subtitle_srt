00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short dance moves

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The game is a little bit complicated

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The game is a little bit complicated

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Listen to the story Magical Plants

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,120
Shang Xin?

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,500
tired

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,100
sorry

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,100
It looks good

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,480
but one more other

28
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,780
cool

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,800
how was the drink down there?

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,820
Taste five two one

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,920
taste six

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,540
taste seven

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,440
happened in different time.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,200
You can change cooking Stadt later.

35
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,920
Combine 30 tactful pulse egg whites and

36
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
più calatria.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,560
My lady.

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,800
I did report it to you earlier.

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,440
But you know it.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,760
Why don't you support it?

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
I don't listen to advice from the solid.

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,720
Even if he breaks his hands,

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,480
he will be free.

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,440
If you really don't care about it,

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,040
why do you send me the medicine?

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,600
Who sent you the medicine?

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,040
I've never been here.

48
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,440
I didn't send you any medicine.

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,480
If you say it again,

50
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,560
I'll be your witness.

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,880
No, I sent it.

52
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,880
I sent it everywhere.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Continue.

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes.

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,280
Start.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,720
Yes.

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,600
My.

58
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,580
Of course, I am a girl top class person.

59
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,220
Let me introduce the male lead of day one.

60
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,720
Who, you are?

61
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,120
I am Wang Xiao Shi.

62
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,520
I go to regarding a girl friend.

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,860
It is Wang Xiao Shi.

64
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,780
Hello?

65
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,980
Is everyone fine?

66
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,640
Hm?

67
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,760
I am also fine.

68
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,340
Who let Luo X Simon come here?

69
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,960
What is this place?

70
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,220
I asked him to come to me.

71
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:36,940
Zi Jin

72
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,040
Although that one of the Ahudため

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,580
Do you think I am my future sister

74
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,340
Who's mature and out of sight

75
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,420
No one thing

76
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,800
You go

77
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,820
Yes

78
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,480
Commander Ma,

79
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,080
will you be able to owe me

80
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,120
convincingly

81
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,160
send Olivia out of his house at midnight?

82
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,920
Let陋y what I want.

83
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:42,220
Your Majesty, I, the Crown Prince, have been in a good mood since I was a child.

84
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,220
I was lucky enough to have a good-hearted man to serve me.

85
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Today is the holiday of the High Court.

86
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,220
I am bold enough to serve you.

87
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Please accept my condolences.

88
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:01,220
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince is always drinking this wine every day.

89
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
It's been a long time.

90
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,220
I can't see him in the palace anymore.

91
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,220
I think it's better to keep it in mind.

92
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,220
To make this dish a perfect dish,

93
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,220
it's also good to let the royal grandson, the ancestor, create a new life,

94
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,220
and not forget the people's life.

95
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,220
Okay, I will do it.

96
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
Pass it to the officials.

97
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,220
Yes.

98
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Your Majesty, this osmanthus pith is a good pith

99
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:47,220
for78

100
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,220
lan

101
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,220
and Adding合

102
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,740
word

103
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,740
Okay, just go on.

104
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Yes.

105
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,740
Luckily, it's Father.

106
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,740
If it's Grandpa, we'll have to rush out.

107
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
Look at this.

108
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,740
It's really worth trying.

109
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,740
What's the taste?

110
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,740
It's really good.

111
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,740
It's really good.

112
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Your Majesty left the golden dragon, the rabbit and the crab.

113
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,740
It's a pity that Hu Shang is still a little bit worse.

114
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,740
Zi Jin, why did you go to Song Shui yourself?

115
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,740
It's a good thing that he's been injured.

116
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
His Majesty is very strict.

117
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,740
He might even allow me to finish my words.

118
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
You really...

119
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,740
I'm sorry.

120
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Let's go to the kitchen and have a look at the jade.

121
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Yes.

122
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,740
Your hand...

123
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,740
It's okay.

124
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
I'll go now.

125
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Don't worry, Young Master.

126
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
I'll go now.

127
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Your Majesty.

128
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
Your Majesty.

129
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
Your Majesty.

130
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Your Majesty.

131
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Your Majesty.

132
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,940
The stone can penetrate the heirloom of Tang.

133
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,420
The care product

134
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,580
is like a stone.

135
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,660
If you do,

136
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,180
you will be forgiven for your efforts.

137
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,020
That can't be,

138
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,900
all families are worthy

139
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,020
of their gratitude.

140
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,740
How are they borrowing from the emperor?

141
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,100
If they are using safe Mexico

142
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
then it is aALways

143
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,180
hey standpoint,

144
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,580
Lord Peivity,

145
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,580
This pot is made of eight kinds of fresh ingredients.

146
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
But it's not a delicate knife skill.

147
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,580
It's fresh ingredients and natural taste of food.

148
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,580
Taste?

149
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,580
The crispy soup bag sent by the public yesterday

150
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,580
looks delicate,

151
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,580
but it's too much because of its seasoning.

152
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,580
It's only my fault to see a precious ingredient and memory.

153
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,580
Fresh, wasteful, and noble items

154
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,580
are to discover the taste of food.

155
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,580
After all, the food we eat is the real thing.

156
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,580
It's not the memory and seasoning that we have to remove.

157
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,580
Your Highness is right.

158
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
The way you act is getting more and more complicated.

159
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,580
You should punish them well.

160
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Am I saying something stupid again?

161
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
Like it?

162
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,580
What a savory smell.

163
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,080
You have to be tight-fisted.

164
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,840
Here.

165
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,880
But it's acting diplomacy.

166
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,600
queued- BS

167
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,360
before the klutz jodals

168
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,280
have stayed there for long

169
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:06,480
to add the fields in his steady

170
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,400
We have added the vines

171
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,840
and the façade

172
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:24,280
tocot

173
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
The fire is burning.

174
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
The four of you are more than one.

175
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Your Majesty.

176
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,280
After hearing the sound of the pearl,

177
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
it's as bright as a tiger's den.

178
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
The taste of the pearl is crisp and tender.

179
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
It's delicious.

180
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm looking forward to it.

181
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
What is that?

182
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,280
The Qilin Gate.

183
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Your Majesty.

184
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
This is the Qilin Gate.

185
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Your Majesty.

186
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
The top of the top is the Qilin Gate.

187
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Xiangrui is the real one.

188
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

189
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

190
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

191
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

192
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Mr. Hu.

193
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,280
In order to prepare this pearl,

194
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
you must have spent a lot of effort.

195
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
They are happy to be in the town.

196
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
This pearl

197
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,280
may burn out any smell.

198
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Your Majesty, you are wise.

199
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
After this pearl is changed,

200
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
it's called the smell of the pearl.

201
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Come on.

202
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Let's have a toast.

203
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

204
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Your Highness.

205
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
What if it burns out a golden hole

206
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
in the pearl?

207
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Your Majesty.

208
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Send the Empress back.

209
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
This way.

210
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
Your Majesty.

211
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
Don't let the assassin go.

212
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Wait for me.

213
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Be careful.

214
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Hurry up.

215
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
Beat him.

216
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Beat him.

217
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Hurry up.

218
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,280
Hurry up.

219
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,280
Help me.

220
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Help me.

221
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
Help me.

222
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
Come on.

223
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,280
Come on.

224
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Run.

225
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Run.

226
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Run.

227
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Run.

228
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
This way.

229
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Run.

230
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Run.

231
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Run.

232
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Run.

233
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Run.

234
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Run.

235
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Run.

236
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Run.

237
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Run.

238
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
Run.

239
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
Run.

240
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Run.

241
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Run.

242
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Run.

243
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Run.

244
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Father.

245
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Get away.

246
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
I'll kill you

247
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
when you come to save me.

248
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
solving for the benefit of the höch Może

249
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Never cost Baochuan

00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280

251
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
If your7 r23

252
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
are not useful to you

253
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
change the name

254
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
This army

255
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,780
is heavy 0u100

256
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Put the Chineseppe

information

259
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,960
Our problem with

260
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,280
the escape

261
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,400
Don't worry.

262
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,800
I'm going back to the palace.

263
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm going back to the palace.

264
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,960
Be careful.

265
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Your Highness, did you hurt yourself?

266
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,760
Zhan Qi.

267
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,360
It's okay.

268
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,640
Send Mother back.

269
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,440
Yes.

270
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,200
Let's go.

271
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,000
Chen Wu.

272
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,000
Take care.

273
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,680
Yes.

274
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,000
Er Mer.

275
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,000
Come in.

276
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Episode 1

277
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Your Highness, you're hurt.

278
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,240
I'll go report it now.

279
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:21,880
Stop.

280
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,840
Your Highness.

281
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,680
Mother has been frightened.

282
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,680
Don't let her take the oil.

283
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,680
Go and see Shunyan.

284
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,080
Okay. I'll take it.

285
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,160
No, I can't.

286
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,000
Your Highness,

287
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,680
although she's int sim chatterbunny,

288
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,560
the wound is g MRT.

289
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Soon,

290
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
I'm sure Xia Dan will be very hot.

291
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Be careful and don't be careless.

292
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Eunuch Yuan, Ye Xiao is here.

293
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Your Highness, the Empress has brought Ye Xiao here.

294
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Please eat more.

295
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Wait. Your Highness.

296
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
Your Highness is not very well.

297
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
You can't be careless when you drink.

298
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
What's in here?

299
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280
What's wrong?

300
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Your Highness, there's a bowl of white porridge.

301
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
And a bowl of peach-coconut blood.

302
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,280
And two more light dishes.

303
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Peach-coconut blood is high, it's warm and not bloody.

304
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,280
Okay, this one is good.

305
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Eunuch Kun, did you know that Your Highness was injured?

306
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
Your Highness.

307
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,280
I forgot to prepare the ingredients for the breakfast tomorrow.

308
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
You go back first.

309
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
What's wrong?

310
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Who are you going to prepare for?

311
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
You know it all by yourself.

312
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
You're going back? Go back.

313
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Come out.

314
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Yao Dianshan,

315
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,280
the Minister of the Lake asked me to bring you a painting.

316
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,280
I know you will come.

317
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm showing my respect to your husband.

318
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I'm sincerely grateful.

319
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
Lin Liao, you should come back and see me.

320
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,280
This painting is very delicate and delicate.

321
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
I'm not afraid of being hurt.

322
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
I'm afraid that I'll be hurt.

323
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
I'm afraid that I'll be hurt.

324
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,280
I'm afraid that I'll be hurt.

325
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
I'm afraid that I'll be hurt.

326
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
I'm tender and tender.

327
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,280
It's indeed a delicious food that can't be eaten too much.

328
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
I thought that after all these years,

329
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
I could finally get rid of the anger.

330
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
I didn't expect that.

331
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
I'm doomed.

332
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
You've already lost.

333
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,280
I chose to use the pearl powder to make the soup.

334
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,280
The stone is to remove the emperor's prejudice.

335
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,280
The real pen is to return to the real me.

336
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,280
You chose this painting to remove the emperor's prejudice.

337
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,280
What's the difference between the officials of the county?

338
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
The soup.

339
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,280
And the coconut and the red dates.

340
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,280
The water is not used, but the coconut.

341
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,280
The soup is indeed not sweet.

342
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,280
It's sweet and not greasy.

343
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
It's not bad.

344
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,280
The sour taste of the fish soup is...

345
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
The soup that has soaked the glutinous rice in the world

346
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,280
has entered the main bucket.

347
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
It's heated again and again.

348
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
After natural fermentation,

349
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,280
the soup can be opened to the skin.

350
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,280
It seems that nine different soups

351
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,280
must be the effort to make the soup.

352
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Okay.

353
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,280
The clear and the blue are the remaining blue.

354
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
I'm not wrong.

355
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,280
Sit.

356
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
He Shu told me that

357
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,280
you have something to tell me before you left the palace.

358
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Do you hate me?

359
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,280
You helped me.

360
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,280
But you also destroyed my right hand.

361
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,280
I have nothing to say to you.

362
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
I'm sorry.

363
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
I can't say anything.

364
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,280
Everything I did

365
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
was to forgive.

366
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,280
When I just entered the Hu family,

367
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,280
I let three children out.

368
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,280
He was born with only three jin.

369
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,280
Everyone said that he was not alive.

370
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Even my father and grandmother

371
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,280
thought that he was a thunderbolt.

372
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
I was always afraid that my sister

373
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,280
would not grow up safely.

374
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
I just left the palace

375
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,280
and left a lie.

376
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
What lie?

377
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I said that

378
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
when three sisters were born,

379
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,280
I saw a red and white flag.

380
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
I protected it.

381
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Not long after,

382
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,280
this word became a flag.

383
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,280
I was so happy.

384
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Who would have thought that

385
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
a child's words

386
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,280
would eventually become a sign of

387
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,280
a family of hushies.

388
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,280
I was weak and had a lot of problems.

389
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
My father said that

390
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,280
I would be a burden

391
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,280
if I entered the palace.

392
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,280
I had already said that I would marry him.

393
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
But for him,

394
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,280
I still agreed.

395
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,280
I was alone.

396
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,280
The daughter of the Hu family

397
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,280
has nothing to do with Huo Wu.

398
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,280
I would stay here every night.

399
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
I would not dare to stop.

400
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Do you know why?

401
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Because I was afraid.

402
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,280
I was lonely.

403
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,280
I did not dare to look at the mirror.

404
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Because I did not want to see

405
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
the face of the mirror.

406
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,280
I was so cold and thirsty.

407
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,280
You told me everything.

408
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Aren't you afraid that I will tell you?

409
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,280
The late emperor said that it was Xiang Rui.

410
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Everything you lost

411
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
is gone.

412
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
It was all my fault.

413
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
You should blame me.

414
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
You should hate me.

415
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
It has nothing to do with the crown princess.

416
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
If you hate me,

417
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
kill me.

418
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
Do not pity him.

419
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,280
I am the reason for the crime.

420
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
You promised me

421
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
that once you are defeated,

422
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
you will leave the capital.

423
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,280
You will not go anywhere.

424
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Take care.

425
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Ziqian.

426
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
Ziqian.

427
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Ziqian.

428
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
Your Highness.

429
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Sister is so sincere.

430
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,280
I wish you a safe life.

431
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Good luck.

432
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Sister.

433
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
Doctor.

434
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
I am leaving.

435
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Why do you do this?

436
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,280
You touched the handkerchief on the fabric.

437
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Why do you want Hu's body to be exposed?

438
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,280
I used to blame you.

439
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Hate you.

440
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
But I can't take revenge.

441
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,280
I have been hoping for you to be reunited.

442
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
But the princess is so envious.

443
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,280
My existence will be your weakness.

444
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,280
You don't want me to blame you.

445
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
But I can't bear to hurt you.

446
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
So,

447
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
I can only think of you.

448
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,280
The only thing I can do for you.

449
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
My father married Ji Mu.

450
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
He had a sister.

451
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
No one cares about me.

452
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,280
So,

453
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
no matter how hard I try,

454
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,280
I will come to you.

455
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
To find that...

456
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
who gave me life.

457
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
Go back.

458
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Mother.

459
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,280
I am not afraid of anything.

460
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
I will only be your wife.

461
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
But now,

462
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
I am different.

463
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
I will do anything.

464
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
I can take care of you.

465
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
I can be your soldier.

466
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
I will do anything.

467
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
I will do anything.

468
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,280
You can't leave us.

469
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
It's you.

470
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
I ask you.

471
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,280
How did master die?

472
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280
The book I left for me is not finished.

473
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Master didn't want to kill me.

474
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Master didn't do anything.

475
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
He sacrificed himself to protect you.

476
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,280
But you killed someone to cover up the truth.

477
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
What are you?

478
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,280
He knows my death is too short.

479
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
Life is a habit.

480
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Who can guarantee that

481
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
he will never reveal the secret?

482
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,280
So you killed him.

483
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Yes.

484
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
You know the truth now.

485
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
How is it?

486
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Do you want to kill me

487
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
and avenge him?

488
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
Do it.

489
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Kill me.

490
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Thank you.

491
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Just kill me.

492
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Just kill me.

493
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,280
Just kill me.

494
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Just kill me.

495
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Please.

496
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Yes.

497
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
Pupulang.

498
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,280
Look.

499
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
How beautiful it is.

500
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Sister.

501
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Sister.

502
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Sister.

503
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Wait for me.

504
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
Sister.

505
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
Sister.

506
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Sister.

507
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Wait for me.

508
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Don't leave me.

509
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Don't leave me.

510
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Sister.

511
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Don't leave me.

512
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
Sister.

513
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Sister.

514
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
You all heard it.

515
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
The Fox King.

516
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
The Fox King is a self-proclaimed man.

517
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Really?

518
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
Little girl.

519
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
People from Guanglu Temple,

520
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Gongzheng Temple,

521
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
all come here.

522
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
This is the most possible thing in the palace.

523
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Don't mention it.

524
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
What's wrong?

525
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
Nothing.

526
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
What a coincidence.

527
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
I've told you about it.

528
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
Before my right hand recovers,

529
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
I'll stay at the top of the city

530
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
to do some chores.

531
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,280
I can help the palace.

532
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
The princess' concubine

533
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
is more beautiful than

534
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
the one who's here.

535
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
I'm not a princess.

536
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,280
I'm just a princess.

537
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,280
I'm just a princess.

538
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
I'm just a princess.

539
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
I'm just a princess.

540
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
I'm just a princess.

541
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,280
The princess' concubine

542
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
is more beautiful than the one who's here.

543
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
Give it to me.

544
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Stop it.

545
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
You don't want the luxury rich girl.

546
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
You want to eat cabbage here?

547
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
What?

548
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
Did you see it?

549
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
My face is getting green.

550
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
It's even greener than cabbage.

551
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,280
I'll go there as soon as I can.

552
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
It's not easy.

553
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Zi Jin.

554
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,280
I'm sorry.

555
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,280
I'm sorry.

556
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
I thought...

557
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,280
I was waiting for this moment to leave the fire rain.

558
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,280
I dream of a long and deep memory.

559
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,280
The heart in my dream is not broken.

560
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,280
I thought...

561
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,280
I was wandering around.
