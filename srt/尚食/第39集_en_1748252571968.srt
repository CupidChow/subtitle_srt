The world is full of love and love

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and love

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and love

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The whole world is full of love and love

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The whole world is full of love and love

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The whole world is full of love and love

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The whole world is full of love and love

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The whole world is full of love and love

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The whole world is full of love and love

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The whole world is full of love and love

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The whole world is full of love and love

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The whole world is full of love and love

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The whole world is full of love and love

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The whole world is full of love and love

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The whole world is full of love and love

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The whole world is full of love and love

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The whole world is full of love and love

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The whole world is full of love and love

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The whole world is full of love and love

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The whole world is full of love and love

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 3

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I cannot be a master at all.

23
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,820
Then I can help you back here.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,100
I won't expertise you anymore.

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,280
I…

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,240
don't want

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
to care about Chen Feifei anymore.

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,480
Since you want me to return it,

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,060
how about I do it?

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,280
Go away.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,440
Leave me alone.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,200
Leave.

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,440
Go away.

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,440
Leave.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,940
Leave.

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,220
��

37
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,820
¡?

38
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,960
Work hard for progress.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,620
Brain!

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,060
There is a Şu in it.

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
We tried several methods to collect.

42
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,740
But in my memory,

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,840
君

44
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,260
there is no dwari behind team FHF.

45
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,980
is the secret you've been hiding.

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,700
It's not a secret.

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,260
It's just that you didn't care about it.

48
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,820
The Palace said it's good for the kitchen.

49
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,420
It might be useful for the young.

50
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,940
In that case,

51
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,300
it'll take half a month.

52
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,940
The Moon Car will be here in time.

53
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,660
Great!

54
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,940
It's really great!

55
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,180
You even said

56
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,340
you'd eat so much.

57
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,740
It's so far from the Palace.

58
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,580
It's hot in the middle.

59
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,420
It's hot.

60
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,500
Come.

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,100
Be careful.

62
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,660
Come.

63
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,420
Put it here.

64
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:20,820
Come.

65
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:20,940
Come.

66
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,500
Let me go.

67
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,940
The Palace of Dream is so strange.

68
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,900
It's so hard to get in.

69
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,500
Be careful.

70
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,420
There's no one

71
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,820
who can get in.

72
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,180
It's just a temporary room.

73
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,100
No matter how much you wait,

74
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,060
you might not be able to use it for the rest of your life.

75
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,860
Your Highness.

76
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,860
Your Highness.

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,140
Don't worry.

78
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,620
I'll help you

79
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,780
with this matter.

80
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,460
And I'll ask the Empress Dowager

81
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,580
to make the Palace of Dream.

82
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,060
Thank you, Noble Consort.

83
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,940
I'm not going to say this.

84
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,140
I have something to give you.

85
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,860
Put it there.

86
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,380
This is...

87
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,060
That's good.

88
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,580
Let's go.

89
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,060
Come.

90
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,180
Get out!

91
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,340
You're not a good person.

92
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Just stay in the corner.

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,300
Noble Consort is here.

94
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,900
Noble Consort Sun.

95
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,460
It's been a long time.

96
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,900
Yuhua.

97
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,260
I've been thinking about this.

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Why do you look so bad?

99
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,820
Maybe

100
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,340
I overestimated you in the past.

101
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,500
You're so strange.

102
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,100
But it's obviously someone else's fault.

103
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,420
You always come to yourself.

104
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,260
Do you know that

105
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,860
the more you are like this,

106
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,660
the more I hate you.

107
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,180
I hate you for

108
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,980
what I said.

109
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,940
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

110
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,380
This is so unreasonable.

111
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,940
But in this world,

112
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
especially in real life,

113
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,300
you can understand it with reason.

114
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,900
Did you kill Hu Shangzhi?

115
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,940
Happy birthday?

116
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,100
I finally know

117
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,820
the good in pain and the evil in the heart.

118
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,020
Can I not understand my point so simple?

119
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,980
This is too far away.

120
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,180
Even the way for a while.

121
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,460
I should be helped as well.

122
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,340
My own child has my indifference against his approximate age.

123
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,140
One fearless woman

124
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,100
wouldn't be theace.

125
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,020
You had a chance

126
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,260
they've offered the entertainment off of a large budget

127
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,300
can this be expensive anyway?

128
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,180
What is this?

129
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,540
The Anniversary Spirit.

130
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,780
This is само-col ??

131
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,020
According to those traitors,

132
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,260
during the proper treatment

133
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,180
of wild cabbage

134
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,420
since only 1000 kinds of wild cabbage

135
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,660
the Melon processing

136
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,840
of the wild vegetables

137
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,120
till the year has passed

138
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,640
it can help the lives of humans

139
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,560
It's a pity that before he died

140
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,580
He made such a document

141
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Why did you lie to me?

142
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,660
How could she be this kind of person?

143
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
Why did you lie to me?

144
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
How could she be this kind of person?

145
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,300
Why did you lie to me?

146
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,460
I'm asking you, why did you lie to me?

147
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,580
Empress Dowager has set up the dream palace.

148
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,660
But she decided to stay in the palace of peace.

149
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,660
Impossible.

150
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,460
Even if she has the will of Empress Dowager,

151
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,340
she won't leave before she's punished herself.

152
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
I'm here today to tell you this.

153
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
How could she be this kind of person?

154
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
You're good at spreading rumors.

155
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
I don't believe it.

156
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,460
I don't believe it!

157
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Su Sui Fei, why did you lie to me?

158
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,740
I want to see Empress Dowager.

159
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,140
I want to see her.

160
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Let me out.

161
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
I want to see her.

162
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,140
Let me out.

163
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,140
I want to see Empress Dowager.

164
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,140
Let me out.

165
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Let me out.

166
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,140
Let me out.

167
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,140
Let me out.

168
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,140
Mom, it's delicious.

169
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
The world is so beautiful.

170
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,420
It's not as precious as the mountain.

171
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,420
Be careful.

172
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,420
Be careful.

173
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,420
Jin.

174
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Su Ping.

175
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Su Ping.

176
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,340
Just wait a little longer.

177
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
Be careful.

178
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
Be careful.

179
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
It's hot.

180
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
Thank you.

181
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
Come again.

182
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
Thank you.

183
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Thank you.

184
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,340
The former village head of the town, Chen Xiao,

185
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,740
and the chief mountain goat.

186
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
We can finally rest.

187
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Thank you.

188
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Your Highness.

189
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
This.

190
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
There are also giant wild vegetables.

191
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
They are all in the same size.

192
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,740
Go find the beggar in the town and sing.

193
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,740
You have to teach the people how to cook.

194
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,740
Don't be so impulsive.

195
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,740
Yes.

196
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,140
Your Majesty.

197
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,140
Sit here.

198
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
Your Majesty.

199
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,540
Le'an is right in front of you.

200
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,540
You had a cup of tea and you have taken good care of it.

201
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,540
You are so good at raising the spirits.

202
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,540
You can take the blame tomorrow.

203
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
I will take care of it.

204
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
I will take care of it.

205
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
I will take care of it.

206
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
Yun Qi.

207
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
You served me.

208
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,940
How long have you served me?

209
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,140
I have been following Your Majesty since I was six.

210
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,140
I have been in the air for 24 years.

211
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,940
I also remember when you just entered the palace,

212
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,940
you took me as your companion and took me to the woods.

213
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
Then I was caught.

214
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,940
But I can't remember how I was doing.

215
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
I remember that.

216
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,940
Then the emperor was furious and almost killed me.

217
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
He took me to the woods.

218
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
I was sorry for you, Your Majesty.

219
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,940
I was so embarrassed.

220
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,540
Everyone says you are a coward.

221
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,540
You are a spy.

222
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,540
Do you know that?

223
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
A spy?

224
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,540
It's definitely a spy.

225
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,540
Your Majesty. A spy. Your Majesty.

226
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
Get up.

227
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
I know.

228
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,540
You also have the courage to be fearless.

229
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,540
I was in the north of the emperor.

230
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
I was not lucky to be in the enemy camp.

231
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,540
I was only a few hundred.

232
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:27,540
I remember this very well.

233
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
Your Majesty was sixteen years old.

234
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
But that was a conspiracy.

235
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,540
At that time, we set the enemy's general to the horse.

236
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
The enemy was in a mess.

237
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,540
We could not take it.

238
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,540
You were the only one who took my revenge.

239
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,540
You seem to have been hit by two arrows.

240
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Your Majesty.

241
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Even if I die,

242
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
I will be the shield of Your Majesty.

243
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,540
Only by sending you out safely,

244
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
can I be able to close my eyes.

245
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,540
At that time,

246
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,540
the middle part was not very bright.

247
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,540
It was laughed at for a long time.

248
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Your Majesty.

249
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,540
Your Majesty.

250
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
Your Majesty.

251
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,540
It's okay.

252
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
Before we left the palace,

253
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,540
the Empress Dowager gave two arrows

254
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
to the emperor.

255
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Do you think...

256
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Yes.

257
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Your Majesty.

258
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
It's Yang Shiqi from the school.

259
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
Hurry.

260
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
Yes.

261
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
Hurry.

262
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
How is it?

263
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Hurry.

264
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Good.

265
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,740
Your Majesty.

266
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Your Majesty.

267
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
Your Majesty.

268
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
My emperor.

269
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,540
My emperor.

270
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,260
Your Majesty.

271
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,060
Your Majesty.

272
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,860
Zhan Qi.

273
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,140
Why are you still here?

274
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,380
Empress Dowager.

275
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,980
The Empress Dowager is still in the hospital.

276
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,220
She can't rest assured.

277
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,620
I'm worried about the Empress Dowager.

278
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,340
I'm worried about you.

279
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,380
Sit.

280
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,660
If she doesn't let you come,

281
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,620
you won't come.

282
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,620
You are the palace maid

283
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,820
who will be given to her concubine.

284
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,820
It's not your turn to be the concubine.

285
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,780
Yes.

286
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,900
If the Empress doesn't let you come,

287
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,980
you will come too.

288
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,980
Why?

289
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,300
You are His Majesty's biological mother.

290
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,220
The Empress Dowager has been pregnant.

291
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
Her claims might start from day one.

292
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,140
That was pathetic purpose.

293
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,180
Just you wait.

294
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:23,780
Speak.

295
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,380
Why did you reveal your crime?

296
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,620
It's just...

297
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,900
Your Majesty are in the happy mood right now.

298
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,260
But why aren't you starting to send me my military cover?

299
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,260
I don't agree with the emperor's marriage.

300
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,260
The Gu family has no Chu army.

301
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,260
He left this night.

302
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,260
I have no doubt about it.

303
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
Your Majesty,

304
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
the red dress is the best.

305
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,260
God will surely make the Sheng family happy.

306
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
The empress never dared to argue with me.

307
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
I am sorry.

308
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,260
I am so warm and kind.

309
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Let me ask you.

310
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,260
Have you forgotten the past of changing the organization?

311
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,260
Empress Dowager,

312
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,260
if the organization is right,

313
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,260
it will definitely pass on the past.

314
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Anyway,

315
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,260
I will see the day he disappears.

316
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,260
If...

317
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,260
If I can't do it,

318
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,260
there will be a future.

319
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
It seems that

320
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,260
I have found a good opponent for myself.

321
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,260
Go back.

322
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,260
This night

323
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,260
is still long.

324
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,260
Go.

325
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Lord Zhao is a mother of the mother.

326
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
He ordered me to wait for more than ten people to serve him.

327
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
He took the palace gate.

328
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,260
This is a gift for him.

329
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Before more Qing army found out,

330
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,260
the empress Dowager controlled it first

331
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,260
and no one dared to resist.

332
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Let's do it.

333
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Go.

334
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
Lord Zhao.

335
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Lord Zhao.

336
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
Lord Zhao.

337
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Lord Zhao.

338
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
Lord Zhao.

339
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Lord Zhao.

340
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,260
Lord Zhao.

341
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Lord Zhao.

342
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
Lord Zhao.

343
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,260
If the empress dowager knew this,

344
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
he would have made a huge mistake.

345
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Brother Huang is from Jianguo,

346
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,260
he is entrusted to me.

347
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
I am from Jianguo.

348
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,260
He is so weak.

349
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
He is from the imperial family.

350
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
He is from the imperial family.

351
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,260
He is a man of the imperial family.

352
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Get out.

353
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,260
Lord Zhao.

354
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,260
Lord Zhao.

355
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Lord Zhao.

356
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,260
Be careful, Lord Zhao.

357
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,260
You don't follow the order.

358
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,260
Why are you here?

359
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,260
Lord Zhao.

360
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
I want to ask you for help.

361
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,260
What are you doing?

362
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
Let me go.

363
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
What are you doing?

364
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
I can't go.

365
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
Go.

366
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,260
Let me go.

367
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Go.

368
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Go.

369
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Jing.

370
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,260
Go to Kunning Palace

371
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,260
and pick some clothes for the empress.

372
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,260
And her favorite snacks.

373
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
One pack per person.

374
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,260
It's cold in the air.

375
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
Yes.

376
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,260
Jing.

377
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Stop.

378
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,260
What are you doing?

379
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,260
Where is the empress?

380
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
Your Highness.

381
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
I...

382
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,260

Aren't you going to treat the Empress as a hostage?

within different provinces.

456
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,180
There's nothing there.

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,340
the Queen of Ming is you today.

466
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,340
You even protected her.

The Queen.

469
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
She has a noble status,

470
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,340
but she's already in danger.

471
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
If she hadn't come to the hospital,

472
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,340
she wouldn't have been ill.

473
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,340
It's also a question of the world

474
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,340
that's passed on.

475
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,340
It's not my opinion.

476
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,340
It's a death sentence.

477
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
Your Majesty, the high-ranking officials

478
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,340

480
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,340
and take risks.

481
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,340
Isn't it also a death sentence?

482
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340

If I can't get back the chance,

487
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
the Ming Dynasty will be replaced by the new emperor.

488

00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,620
I can bear it.

I'll do it.

503
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,220
It's because that person is Zhu Zhan Ji.

That's all.

505
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,940

574
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
Even for a day.

575
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
I've always thought

576
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
that I must win you

577
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,520
because I'm your wife.

578
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
You

579
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
are so selfish

580
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
to save others.

581
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
I can't

582
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
make such a person's heart.

583
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Really?

584
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,520
But I'm dying soon.

585
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
But you're by my side.

586
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Life is so boring.

587
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
In the palace,

588
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
I think I'm useless.

589
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
But here,

590
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,520
I feel so comfortable.

591
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
Your Highness.

592
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
It will be good.

593
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
Everything will be good.

594
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Ziqin.

595
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
I want to entrust

596
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
something to you.

597
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
I've been

598
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
a bad person

599
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
no matter what.

600
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
But I know

601
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
you can do very well.

602
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,520
You can do it.

603
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
You can do it.

604
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
You can never leave it.

605
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
I know

606
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,520
you're not angry.

607
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
You're more frightened

608
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
than me.

609
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Your Highness.

610
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Your Highness.

611
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
It won't be a problem.

612
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,520
I'm tired.

613
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,520
I'm really tired.

614
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
I'm so tired.

615
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Ziqin.

616
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
I don't want to be alone.

617
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
You won't be alone.

618
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,520
I'll protect you here.

619
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,520
I'll protect you here.

620
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
I'll protect you here.

621
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,520
I heard that

622
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,520
Sister-in-law is ill.

623
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
I've seen it.

624
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
Your Highness.

625
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
You're a man of your word.

626
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,520
You're a man of your word.

627
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,520
What's the meaning of

628
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,520
taking the army to the palace at night?

629
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

630
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,520
I heard that

631
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
what?

632
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
This traitor, Zhu Gaoxu,

633
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,520
is a traitor.

634
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
He's a man of his word.

635
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,520
He's a man of his word.

636
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,520
He's a man of his word.

637
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,520
He's a man of his word.

638
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
As your uncle,

639
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
I can't do anything.

640
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,520
So

641
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
you're here to protect me

642
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
at the palace at night?

643
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
Of course.

644
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
You don't know that, do you?

645
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
Your Majesty.

646
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,520
My good nephew, Zhan Ji,

647
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
has killed

648
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,520
the traitor, Zhu Gaoxu,

649
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
in Le'an.

650
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,520
Sister-in-law,

651
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,520
please give me a decree.

652
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
I'll be the one to supervise the state affairs.

653
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
I'll take all the troops

654
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
to the capital

655
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,520
and fight with Zhu Gaoxu.

656
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
I'll avenge and avenge

657
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Zhan Ji.

658
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,520
Brother.

659
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,520
Now the king of Zheng and the queen of the country,

660
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,520
and the empress,

661
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Consort Ping,

662
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,520
are all in danger.

663
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
I advise you to think twice.

664
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,520
If you insist on not moving,

665
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,520
you can't resist the imperial guards

666
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,520
and the imperial guards.

667
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,520
You just want to control me

668
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,520
and Consort Ping of the harem

669
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,520
and put the heavy burden on the court

670
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,520
to threaten His Majesty.

671
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,520
If I don't move,

672
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
you'll kill the king and the empress, right?

673
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
I'll leave now.

674
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,520
Is the king of Zheng in your hands?

675
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,520
Go.

676
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,520
Close the door.

677
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
Yes.

678
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
Your Highness,

679
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,520
His Majesty is surrounded by the imperial guards.

680
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,520
What?

681
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,520
Zhu Gaoxui.

682
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,520
My son is out of the palace.

683
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
He dares to teach me everything.

684
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,520
Do you really think

685
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,520
I'm a immortal

686
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:39,700
and a

687
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
immortal?

688
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,520
Please send us out

689
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
by yourself.

690
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
Mother.

691
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,520
You can't do

692
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,520
such a big thing.

693
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,520
The imperial guards

694
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
can only be sent out now.

695
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,520
Zhu Zhanji.

696
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,520
Third Uncle,

697
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
aren't you going to meet your family?

698
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
In order to prevent you from losing hope,

699
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,520
I brought Second Uncle back.

700
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,520
I'm a king of the Yi State.

701
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
I don't want to be a lonely family.

702
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
You are always

703
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,520
my wife.

704
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,520
You can only stay by my side.

705
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,520
Did you owe His Majesty

706
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
what you owe him?

707
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,520
How can you

708
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,520
return it to me?

709
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,520
You can't return it to me?

710
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,520
I just want you to return it to me.

711
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,520
In this way,

712
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,520
you can

713
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,520
