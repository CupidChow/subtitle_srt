1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
啊呀呀呀呀呀呀

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
啊呀呀呀呀呀

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
呀呀呀呀呀呀呀

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
呀呀呀呀呀呀呀

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
呀呀呀呀呀呀呀

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
呀呀呀呀呀呀呀呀

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
呀呀呀呀呀呀呀呀

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The tea is not a good thing.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why do you insist on using it?

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Is it because of the so-called royal salt?

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Can you just ignore the innocent life?

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Tell me why?

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Your Highness the Empress, tell me in person.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Princess, I have a favor to ask you.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Zijin, oh no.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,720
Zijin.

17
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
It's snowing.

18
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,880
It's snowing.

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
It's beautiful.

20
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,800
Why are you still like this?

21
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
Don't waste your energy.

22
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,080
I heard that the noble masters of the palace

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,160
have opened a gambling area.

24
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,520
Who can help Noble Consort Hui to open the entrance?

25
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,960
How dare they play such a musical instrument?

26
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
Your Majesty.

27
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,400
Go!

28
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,240
Go!

29
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,040
Let's go.

30
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,040
Did Zhenzhen come here intentionally?

31
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,560
Zhenzhen estemless thinks so.

32
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,160
I don't find they trouble me until they get serious.

33
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,200
Take myлекing question.

34
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,680
Those condensed wines have rejuvenated

35
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,920
the God Realm.

36
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,360
Take them again.

37
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,040
Or I'll get excited!

38
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,000
What are you doing?

39
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,440
Remember the Messenger

40
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,560
of the物.

41
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,680
What do you think of him?

42
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,480
I don't dare to say it.

43
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,760
Just say it.

44
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,240
In the past,

45
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,280
the King of Zhao took three of the kings

46
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,560
and left only one of the guards.

47
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,360
He even specially sent 3,000 soldiers

48
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,040
to the Mount Tian Shoushan to build Changlin.

49
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,560
The people all said

50
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
that the King of Zhao wanted to be a king

51
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,040
who could be a king of peace and happiness.

52
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,840
But he was not in a good mood.

53
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,760
After the king of Han's return,

54
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,920
it's hard to say.

55
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,840
Before the king of the three kings

56
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
wants to give the land to the tribe

57
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,440
that has a lot of people,

58
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,680
what is the most necessary in the court?

59
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,760
It's just the cold grass.

60
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
It clearly shows that he has no ambition.

61
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,440
Chuanzhi.

62
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,480
Your Majesty.

63
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
Give all the 850 eggs and rice

64
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,760
of the King of Zhao to the tribe.

65
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,400
Order Pingjiangbo

66
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,560
to give the King of Zhao

67
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,160
the cold grass from the grass.

68
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,160
Yes.

69
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,240
Your Majesty, you are wise.

70
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,160
Your Majesty.

71
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,480
It's time to go back to the palace.

72
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
In this world,

73
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,360
I still can't let go of my things.

74
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,520
Lovely Knight

75
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,760
There are the millions of celestial soldiers

76
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,800
in the yaks and snakes in three medicines.

77
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,360
They deliberately like it.

78
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,800
They say

79
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,080
he will get angry

80
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,520
and gang up with other people.

81
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,440
Did he get angry

82
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,960
again today?

83
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,160
You are planning to stop at some point?

84
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,560
Who is better?

85
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,960
What a shame to be theすごast of the year.

86
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,040
I'm not from the Royal family.

87
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,160
The womanINA,

88
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,680
who hates showing affection,

89
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,320
is wanting to straighten herself out to Will、王。

90
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,600
You should never tell anyone else!

91
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,880
Even if the ummap her,

92
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,440
you don't need to tell anybody.

93
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,280
You can't wait for that day.

94
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,920
Tian Tian.

95
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,600
Wait for me.

96
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Go over there.

97
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,280
With regards to the royal meals,

98
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,640
is it necessary to

99
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,200
open Qingyalin Su Suddenly

100
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
to deal with this name?

101
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,160
But

102
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Do you also like this name?

103
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,800
Ji Chong.

104
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,720
Your Majesty.

105
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,760
How am I supposed to teach you

106
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,920
these photographs of a boy?

107
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
I am servants.

108
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,760
But...

109
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,080
But what?

110
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,960
I wouldn't dare to reveal

111
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,520
the fact that there's something genuine.

112
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,960
If you don't expose that,

113
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,120
just get out of Jin City.

114
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,860
I wasButter 뭘

115
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,480
once reminded Funtius!

116
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,960
When Noble Consort Hui went to home,

117
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,040
she Tingjie spatial zucchini

118
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,000
only gave me half a year.

119
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,600
Your Majesty, I dare not to lie.

120
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,060
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

121
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,720
Your Majesty.

122
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,360
Your Majesty.

123
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,600
Your Majesty.

124
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,720
Your Majesty.

125
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,520
Mr. Huang, are you waiting in the palace?

126
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,160
Yes.

127
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,360
Your Majesty.

128
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,920
Huang Shilang ordered to deal with the military affairs of the world.

129
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
It's good that he came back from Zhejiang

130
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,240
and made a living in the palace.

131
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,560
Now, this time,

132
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,840
Huang Shilang has been waiting outside the palace

133
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,200
for self- riot against ulterior motives.

134
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
Mr. Directory of Military History

135
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,900
No. auditor

136
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,060
Chief Minister Open

137
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,120
Since the military Всib olords died,

138
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,520
all my pl prostheses

139
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,880
are cabeça-le create excursions.

140
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,480
He ate the silver.

141
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,460
Set him free.

142
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,940
Is that so?

143
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,460
hearted?

144
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,620
I know you really want to whip him up.

145
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,540
But you

146
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,880
have overpr encouraging.

147
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,580
How many people have we written

148
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,380
in this city Heir and him forward?

149
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,060
Queen mother,

150
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,720
i'm getting more cases

151
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,220
to take actions.

152
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,660
Except

153
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,840
to produce more Mars,

154
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,280
I was afraid that the food would be too cold

155
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,800
and I would be late for work.

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,600
And I was also worried about the worst funeral.

157
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,200
I was not able to find a good place to stay.

158
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,280
What about the funeral?

159
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,000
Did you use

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,120
the funeral water you had been used to feed?

161
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
I've said it many times.

162
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
Only after the water is dried

163
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,320
can you pick it up.

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
The warmth and warmth of the food

165
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,880
must be kept in mind.

166
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
I only took a few days off

167
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,560
and left it to you.

168
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,600
That's all.

169
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
Don't worry.

170
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,600
If you meet such a situation again,

171
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,680
you will not be sick

172
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,800
if you put the dried autumn and summer leaves in the funeral.

173
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,440
Yes.

174
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Get up.

175
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,680
Where is the Empress?

177
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,000
Her Highness just sent someone to treat her.

178
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,440
Her fever has been very low

179
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,080
after the spring.

180
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,520
Before the great disaster,

181
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,440
she didn't dare to come to the Qingning Palace.

182
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,520
She was afraid that she might get sick.

183
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,840
Her Highness has been weak.

184
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,080
I don't want to blame her.

185
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,480
What about Noble Consort?

186
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,520
She should come and see.

187
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,640
Your Highness,

188
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
she is still being sent to the Imperial Palace.

189
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,040
Ask her to come.

190
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,560
I want to see her.

191
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,760
Yes.

192
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,880
Do you know who she is?

193
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,040
Empress,

194
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,640
the greatest match

195
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,960
's czar is Empress Xu.

196
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,640
The late Zhang Optimistic Grandmother.

197
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,120
Her materia of love

198
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,800
is the countess of Great общем.

199
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,520
I wonder if she is taking the right time

200
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,280
Mother,

201
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,040
everyone says I look like her the most.

202
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,560
I'm fond of the emperor's aura.

203
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,320
That's why I'm taking care of my husband's crown prince.

204
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,720
In my opinion,

205
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,000
I should be grateful to her.

206
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
But in my heart,

207
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,520
when Zhan Ji was born,

208
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,360
she was taken to her side to raise him.

209
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,320
Since she was born,

210
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,920
she's been close to her mother,

211
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,320
and she's more than my real mother.

212
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,120
But I respect her from the bottom of my heart.

213
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,200
I've become the fourth highest neighbour

214
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,520
of Duke Yan.

215
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,120
Li Jing Long

216
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
was a soldier who formed an army

217
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,120
during the war at Emperor Taizong.

218
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,760
It was his armor

219
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,760
to capture the imperial treasure of his48课

220
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,560
leading all the publicム

221
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,680
of the city to the very city that he had ruled.

222
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,580
Ninth Qi

223
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,160
had never —

224
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,480
wrung-up personal merits.

225
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,780
Nor could his nephew

226
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,540
have worked for the Xu family.

227
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,440
But to follow the emperor's advice

228
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,420
is for sack 리�民百信.

229
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,200
You're making this public.

230
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
It's notinental.

231
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,400
I know it.

232
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,200
Do you have it?

233
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,640
Since Her Majesty has Bayonet now,

234
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
you're willing to

235
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,420
stop

236
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,520
talking to me.

237
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,320
Are you behind the Emperor's eternal stain

238
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,280
or wantonness still left in you?

239
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,080
I'm ready.

240
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,560
It's no surprise.

241

who must be disciple of the renown master of the Yan Emperor.

244
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,080
How can it be possible

245
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,940

He wants to kill people,

254
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
and help him to change the world.

255
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
He wants to repair the temple and the garden,

He wants to remind his people to be a good person.

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Even if one day,

264
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
everyone will be angry with him.

265
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
He can ignore all the things he wants to do.

266
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I've been...

267
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800

268
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800

271
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
I left you behind.

272
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
In the future,

you can be my seat in the harem.

274
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800

you always leave me alone.

284
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Forget it.

285
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
You can leave.

286
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Today, I'm not in the order.

287

00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Why do you call her that?

Mr. Qin.

296
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
Don't tell me

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,720

298
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,640

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,880
why I insisted on

301
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,840

It was me who took it.

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,000
May Your Majesty punish us.

311
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,140
Sister Li Wan is here.

You're needsome,

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,160
you'll be so worried about her.

324
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,200
I wouldn't dare to reveal

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,080

What's wrong with her?

Your Majesty,

Ninth Princess Taoist Mah boîi.

333
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,040
The cup is to be consumed by the air, the air is to be consumed by the air,

334
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,400
the essence is to be consumed by the air,

335
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,880
and the silk is to be consumed by the air.

336
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,480
The essence of love is to be mixed with the fire.

337
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,280
The essence of love is to be mixed with the fire.

338
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,480
This illness

339
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,240
has to be treated

340
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,040

342
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,320
Go and take the medicine.

343
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,520
Yes.

344
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,800
You all go down.

345
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,080
Why didn't you say it before?

346
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,800
You made me a real gold GTX

347
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,520
and reminded you of the past.

348
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,360
Has your reputation

349
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,000
been

350
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,840
Hurry up and看看

351
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,960
if you have been mataig my mother,

352
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,960
or even the Basque Prince?

353
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,880
I asked her

354
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,200
why she forced you

355
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,720
to do such a thing.

356
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,080
It's a fear.

357
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,360
It's because of fear

358
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,600
that you're afraid of being locked up

359
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
like before.

360
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,520
So, you can't speak out.

361
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,720
I don't know what to do.

362
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,560
I actually

363
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
have a feeling that

364
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,600
you're not the one who's afraid of being locked up.

365
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,400
I want you to tell me the truth.

366
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,840
Every time you tell me the truth,

367
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,240
it's not for you.

368
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,680
Once you encounter your own problem,

369
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,680
you're willing to endure it alone

370
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,080
and say nothing.

371
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
I always thought you were jealous of me.

372
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,720
I didn't expect you to be so harsh.

373
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,120
But

374
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,040
you should have written down what you said.

375
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
You should have told me.

376
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,600
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm sorry, Ziqian.

378
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,880
I'm sorry.

380
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,320
You didn't even tell me

381
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,200
that you're willing to blame me for all this.

382
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,840
You're

383
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,400
so harsh.

384
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
I know

385
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,160
you've always helped me

386
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,080
and treated me so well.

387
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,000
But I'm hiding it from you

388
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,320
and deceiving you.

389
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,160
So, you don't want to forgive me

390
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,360
and don't want to believe me anymore.

391
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,280
You didn't even tell me

392
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,960
such a big thing.

393
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,400
Ziqian.

394
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,760
Ziqian.

395
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Ziqian.

396
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,800
Ziqian.

397
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,160
Ziqian.

398
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,000
Zuoqing.

399
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,880
Where did you get the gun?

400
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,680
Your Highness.

401
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,800
It's okay.

402
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,800
It's okay.

403
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,560
Listen to me.

404
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
It's not that.

405
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,960
She剛剛

406
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,160
falsely questioned me.

407
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,400
Ziqian,

408
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,600
Her Highness

409
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,080
is just talking nonsense.

410
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,920
Are you so serious

411
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,040
that you could not�

412
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,440
嗎?

413
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,960
Zhi'er,

414
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,360
before I passed away,

415
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
I felt like

416
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
being in a daze.

417
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,200
I wasn't safe

418
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
I was afraid of being attacked by the Jiujing.

419
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
But I met you.

420
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
I saw you were so stubborn to learn to play the game.

421
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
I saw you needed my help.

422
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I kept it to myself.

423
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
It's good that

424
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
I'm not helping you.

425
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
You're helping me.

426
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
You're helping me.

427
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Thank you.

428
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
Thank you for willing to go back to the town.

429
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Thank you too.

430
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
I can't even tell you the truth.

431
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
You've always been with me.

432
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
But why are you

433
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
always hiding from us?

434
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
I don't want you to worry about me.

435
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
And

436
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,440
I don't want you to worry about me.

437
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Why don't you trust me?

438
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
I don't want to trust you.

439
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
I can't.

440
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
How can I be like a devil

441
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
in this capital?

442
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
I don't want to be like

443
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
a devil who doesn't want to

444
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
make things worse.

445
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I just want you to be more difficult.

446
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
I'm sorry.

447
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
I didn't tell you.

448
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
It's my fault.

449
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Your Highness,

450
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,440
when did you come out?

451
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
I came out of the palace.

452
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
I suddenly realized

453
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
that he can't fight.

454
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
You're not as terrible as I thought.

455
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
But

456
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,440
he's still a mother.

457
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Zi Jin,

458
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
I don't understand what you're saying.

459
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
It's okay.

460
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Anyway, I think

461
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
the stone in my heart

462
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
is not as good as it seems.

463
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Your Highness,

464
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
you've recovered your money.

465
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Your Majesty...

466
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
Since you're sick,

467
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
I can't let you have it.

468
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,440
Who told him to take so long to get me here?

469
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Let him worry about me.

470
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Ziping,

471
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,440
being the woman that the Empress Dowager said

472
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
is not an easy thing.

473
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
But

474
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,440
I can finally leave the book house now.

475
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
Book house?

476
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
I also know a new friend.

477
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
I know a new friend.

478
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Master,

479
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm here to see you.

480
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,440
The silk of my foot is now edible,

481
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,440
so I'm sending a person to go and buy it for you.

482
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,440
Will this be much more π gwia nya niang denn showjie?

483
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
What is it?

484
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
It's a girl just ruhng d while in a palace.

485
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
If I let the lady be with her in a palace,

486
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
as she is a man of rural love.

487
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
I can still play the weapon.

488
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
Come here,

489
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
we'll take her out from the palace.

490
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,440
I don't know

491
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
if you should take her out from the palace

492
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
and send her デิポニョイル.

493
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
We'll make her the又嗣

494
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,640
and the public's self-confidence and

495
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,840
the air is still fresh.

496
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,640
So, you shouldn't stop me from being sincere.

497
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,040
I'm not afraid of making mistakes.

498
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,640
I'm just a coward.

499
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
I'm just a coward.

500
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,640
That's why I let you become a family member.

501
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,040
I won't let you go.

502
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Mr. Meng,

503
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
believe me.

504
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
I don't know what he's talking about.

505
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,440
You don't know what I'm talking about?

506
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,840
What did you do

507
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,440
when you were a fan of the imperial decree?

508
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,840
I was a coward.

509
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,840
I was a coward because His Majesty was a family member.

510
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
You should believe me.

511
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,040
I'm innocent.

512
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,040
If you want to be a concubine,

513
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,240
I won't change anything.

514
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,040
You should believe me, Mr. Meng.

515
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
Nenma,

516
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,640
how did you get rid of Noble Consort?

517
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,840
Mr. Meng.

518
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Su Sishan,

519
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,640
I said those words

520
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,440
because I hope you can be kind and humble.

521
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,840
I hope you won't be a burden to me.

522
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,040
But you can't hear me.

523
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Don't worry.

524
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,440
I won't be selfish.

525
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,440
I'll send you to the palace to be a concubine.

526
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,040
Noble Consort Sun, don't forget.

527
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,640
Her Majesty admitted it herself.

528
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,640
It was because she was too selfish

529
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,040
that she got the imperial decree.

530
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
It has nothing to do with me.

531
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,240
Even if I send her to the palace,

532
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,040
what punishment will I get?

533
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,440
I'll lose all my money.

534
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,040
Her Majesty didn't punish you immediately.

535
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,440
You're trying to protect the empress.

536
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,040
She's been waiting for you to admit your crime.

537
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,040
But you're not clear about it.

538
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
I thought she was safe and sound

539
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,840
after being confined.

540
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
Noble Consort Sun,

541
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,040
please let me handle the situation.

542
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
Mr. Meng,

543
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,240
you have to handle it yourself.

544
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,840
The Imperial Court is a good place.

545
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,840
You can't enter the palace when you're defeated.

546
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,240
You can't stay in the palace if you're lazy.

547
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
What are you doing?

548
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,440
Who told you to do it yourself?

549
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,440
Let me go!

550
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,040
Let me go! I can't!

551
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,040
The food is God's grace.

552
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,440
It's the people's grace.

553
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,240
It's the most precious thing in the world.

554
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
I won't let this dirty hand

555
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
touch them again.

556
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,040
I've become the same as before.

557
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,840
It's all because of you.

558
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,640
You're not worthy of this.

559
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
You're not worthy of this!

560
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,640
If you really want to take my hand,

561
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
Noble Consort Sun,

562
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,040
would you dare to do it yourself?

563
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,840
You saved my hand.

564
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,640
Please do it.

565
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,240
Don't touch me.

566
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,440
Do you understand, Noble Consort Sun?

567
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,240
Do you understand?

568
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
I taught you to know the ingredients.

569
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,440
I taught you to be kind.

570
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,440
Of course, you should have me.

571
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,040
I hope you'll be right.

572
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,840
I'll be right back.

573
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,440
I'll be right back.

574
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Master Meng.

575
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,440
Why did you do that?

576
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,840
I...

577
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I'm willing to use my own hands

578
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,240
to exchange for a new opportunity.

579
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Master Meng.

580
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,040
I've been in charge of the Shang's Bureau for years.

581
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,440
I've been so anxious to be in the street.

582
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,640
I really don't have the right to face my own Empress Dowager.

583
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,040
I'll personally ask Empress Dowager for forgiveness

584
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,640
and go to the Palace to get a job.

585
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,240
I'll go to Anle Hall

586
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,240
to take care of the servants of the old soldiers.

587
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,840
I'll be punished for my crimes.

588
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Ensure.

589
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,840
sangatre existing.

590
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,240
Do you see it?

591
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,440
Do you see it?

592
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,640
In this world,

593
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,640
who else can do this for you?

594
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,640
Su Yaowang,

595
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,640
I hope you can understand

596
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,640
a mother's pain.

597
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Su Yaowang.

598
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
Han Yin is here.

599
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,840
Since Han Yin entered the palace,

600
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,440
he has been following you.

601
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
No matter what trouble you face,

602
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,840
you have never given up.

603
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,240
Now that you have finally achieved everything,

604
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,040
how can you give up so easily?

605
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,440
Han Yin.

606
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,040
No way.

607
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
You can't.

608
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,040
The mistake that Su Si Shang made,

609
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,440
he did it himself.

610
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,640
You can't do this.

611
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,640
I'll go to Qin Ning Palace

612
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,040
and beg outside the palace.

613
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
Until the Empress Dowager

614
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,840
takes back the order.

615
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,640
I want to do something unethical.

616
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,840
Maybe in your eyes,

617
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,040
I'm nothing.

618
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
But I've always

619
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,040
treated you as my master.

620
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,040
Even my mother.

621
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,440
Do you want to abandon me

622
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,440
for Su Yaowang?

623
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,640
You're wrong.

624
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,240
I'm not doing this for Su Yaowang.

625
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
I'm doing this for myself.

626
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,840
I...

627
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,440
For yourself?

628
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,240
Yes.

629
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,240
In the past ten years,

630
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,040
everything I've been seeking

631
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,640
has been in my eyes.

632
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,240
In order to pass this level

633
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,640
from the end,

634
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,240
I've done many, many mistakes.

635
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,840
In the past, I thought

636
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,040
the power to clean up the crown

637
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,160
and make the officials

638
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
to re-enact the power

639
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
was the most important thing in the world.

640
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,040
But I was wrong.

641
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,240
I did this

642
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,840
to make the officials

643
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,240
who were sent to the palace

644
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,840
to make mistakes.

645
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,440
I'm not afraid of

646
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,240
the consequences of the people's mistakes.

647
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,040
Everything

648
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,240
is my fault.

649
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,040
You...

650
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,440
You've made up your mind.

651
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,440
You're wrong.

652
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,660
I'm right.

653
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
I ignored them.

654
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Han Ying.

655
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,040
I want everything from me

656
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,040
to be in your hands.

657
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
Stay as if I was lost.

658
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:13,920
Earth Phoenix Fall

659
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,320
Prince, you shall challenge Hualki in the next life.

660
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,320
Right.

661
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,160
I'll take it.

662
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,240
How is it?

663
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,080
This is for me from Yunzhou.

664
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,040
It's from Lord You.

665
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,640
What's wrong?

666
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,840
Lord You gave it to the emperor of Taizong

667
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
and the house of the emperor.

668
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,720
It's the treasure of the world.

669
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,360
Now, he only uses a soft armor

670
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,720
to punish His Majesty.

671
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,320
I was too obscribed 他不会把自己逼得友善 niu jiu.

672
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,520
Doesn't it seem like a honor?

673
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,640
No?

674
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,760
Maybe it was a !"

675
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,520
No.

676
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,200
Cheng.

677
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Your Majesty, His Majesty is calling.

678
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,080
Why are you here?

679
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,440
Your Majesty, His Majesty is looking for you.

680
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Go now.

681
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,920
Do you think I did something wrong?

682
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,000
Your Majesty,

683
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,520
what are you doing?

684
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,560
What are you doing?

685
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,920
I won't let you escape from bringingそろ autres.

686
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,640
Sir.

687
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,120
I'm sorry.

688
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,120
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,120
I'm sorry.

690
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,120
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,120
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,120
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,120
I'm sorry.

695
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
I'm sorry.

696
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,120
I'm sorry.

697
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,120
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,120
I'm sorry.

699
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120
I'm sorry.

700
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
I'm sorry.

701
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
I'm sorry.

702
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,120
I'm sorry.

703
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
I'm sorry.

704
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
I'm sorry.

705
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,120
I'm sorry.

706
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,120
I'm sorry.

707
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
I'm sorry.

708
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
I'm sorry.

709
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
I'm sorry.

710
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
I'm sorry.

711
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
I'm sorry.

712
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,120
I'm sorry.

713
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,120
I'm sorry.

714
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,120
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,120
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,320
You laugh a lot here.

717

I admire you.
