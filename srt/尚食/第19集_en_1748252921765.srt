The world is full of love and passion

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
the game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the game is just a dream

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Part 11

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Part 11

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,400
During சAES, he was a relic of people

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,900
With вес some people getting excited

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,480
When can monday come觸

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,300
electric fan

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,920
I've done so much for movies.

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:07,980
Mr. Song

29
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,740
Have you ever feel any fun?

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,880
Or be happy like this?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,720
I'll do it.

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,720
You're too slow.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm better than you.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,600
Your Highness,

35
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,920
Miss Yao...

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,880
Didn't I say

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,800
not to mention her?

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,760
Get out.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,920
Yes.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
Your Highness.

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm fine.

42
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,280
You're so worried about King of Wei's illness, right?

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,280
I went to the imperial court

44
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,240
to study there.

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,760
I'm worried he got sick.

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
Prince Ling has gone too far.

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Zijun,

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,240
why did you

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,880
make a fool of yourself

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,920
out of being the eldest misil Symphony?

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,640
Was it worth it?

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,520
Forgive what I should do.

53
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Is it worth it?

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
As for what I should do,

55
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm the one who should save her.

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,600
No matter what the consequences are,

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm willing to accept it.

58
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
Is there anything worth it?

59
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
The account of the palace official's men

60
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,200
is very good.

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,080
I told them just now,

62
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,400
Her Highness the Empress doesn't want to see you again.

63
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,600
Can you hold it?

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,200
You still regret it.

65
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,320
Sister,

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,040
I will hand your abducting

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,140
and remaining

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,580
as Your King macerat أép terrace.

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,720
Then the slaves of Yesar

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,480
areLL sent by you.

71
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
Lao Yang was wrong,

72
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,180
but I had steward ran for custody.

73
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,200
Now,

74
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,100
how can I say anything against WeChat?

75
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,960
I don't want to see you die personally.

76
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
This is fate.

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
How many accounts have you got?

78
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Only six.

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
You can't take the six accounts.

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
If you come again,

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
I won't have you again.

82
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
If you beg for forgiveness,

83
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
you'll be wrong.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
You can't live without the account.

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Lord Gaowen,

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
I have nothing to do with it.

87
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
You're a coward.

88
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
But you still risk your life

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
to save others.

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
You're a coward.

91
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
But you still risk your life

92
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
to save others.

93
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Isn't that wrong?

94
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
If you don't take the account,

95
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
I'll save you one more time.

96
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
You'll be punished again soon.

97
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
And I'll never save the person who died.

98
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Go on.

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
My lord,

100
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
it looks weak.

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Who knows it's so big?

102
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
My lord,

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
it's not fair.

104
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
You'll die if you die.

105
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Why do you care?

106
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
You'll die if you die.

107
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I'll sue you again and again.

108
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Why don't you listen to me?

109
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
My lord.

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Stop.

111
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
My lady,

112
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
just say it.

113
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
I'll save you.

114
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Thank you for your kindness.

115
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
And two more.

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I can stand it.

117
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
You don't need to beg.

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Even if you look at me,

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
you'll be fine.

120
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
My lord, this...

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
Go on.

122
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Go on.

123
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Go on.

124
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,200
Go on.

125
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
My lord,

126
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I've taken the medicine for the demon.

127
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
The medicine.

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
The medicine he uses every day

129
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
is used by you personally.

130
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Send it to the market.

131
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Yes.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't want to be your concubine.

133
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I don't want to be a living corpse for you.

134
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I don't want to be a puppet for others.

135
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
My lord.

136
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Why don't you help me?

137
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
My lord,

138
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
why don't you help me?

139
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Don't you want to be a puppet?

140
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm afraid that

141
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I should find a way to get out of here.

142
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
As for his death,

143
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I'll be the one to do it.

144
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
What?

145
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
You're right.

146
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Where's the person you're looking for?

147
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
He's looking for someone.

148
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
My lord,

149
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,200
I hope you won't let me down this time.

150
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
You're awake.

151
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Come.

152
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I'll help you.

153
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Come.

154
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Help him out.

155
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Yes.

156
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Come.

157
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I'll help you.

158
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Come.

159
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I'll help you.

160
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Come.

161
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Come.

162
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
I'll help you.

163
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Thank you.

164
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Thank you.

165
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Greetings, Your Highness.

166
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Do you remember what I said to you?

167
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I don't forget.

168
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Why did you make it so hard for others?

169
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
You don't need to endure it.

170
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
To Your Highness the Empress,

171
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
it's not someone else.

172
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
It's the superior minister

173
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
who taught me to be a servant.

174
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
And my best friend.

175
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,200
What's the proof that you want to be a servant?

176
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Your Highness the Empress,

177
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I wasn't in the kitchen at that time.

178
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
But I know that

179
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
from the selection of dishes to the intelligence,

180
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
the superior minister has strict rules.

181
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
There won't be such a criticism.

182
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Your Highness the Empress is asking you for evidence.

183
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I don't have evidence.

184
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Your Highness the Empress,

185
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
there must be a warning

186
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
if there's something urgent.

187
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
No matter what the Prince of Wei's illness is,

188
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
the Empress can't get rid of it.

189
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Why?

190
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
In the past,

191
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
the Empress used to come to the kitchen.

192
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Who are you talking about?

193
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Your Majesty,

194
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
you know everything.

195
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Why did you come here?

196
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
You know everything.

197
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Why did you come to me?

198
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
You're talking.

199
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Your Majesty,

200
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
the past is a dream.

201
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,200
You're a ruler of the country.

202
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Of course she won't blame you.

203
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,200
She's the one who has written

204
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,200
all her hatred on me.

205
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
If you want to do it,

206
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I'll do it.

207
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Ah Shan.

208
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
Ah Shan is still a child.

209
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
How can she be so heartless?

210
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Noble Consort Guo just said

211
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
who did it to you.

212
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Your Majesty, I'm so sorry.

213
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I couldn't stop you.

214
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Since you're suspicious,

215
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
why don't you face me?

216
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Your Majesty,

217
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
how is the Prince of Wei's illness?

218
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
What did the imperial physician say?

219
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
When can the child be born?

220
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
Don't touch her.

221
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Your Majesty.

222
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
These days,

223
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I've heard others say

224
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
that I'm a big trouble.

225
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
But I'm sorry again.

226
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Even if you have hatred,

227
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
you have to respect me.

228
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Your Majesty.

229
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Noble Consort Guo has no evidence.

230
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
The Wang family has a plan.

231
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
You can still believe it.

232
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Your Majesty.

233
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
The imperial physician.

234
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
The imperial physician is a good man.

235
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
He's a good man.

236
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I've already confirmed it.

237
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
From now on,

238
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
you can't talk about it again.

239
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Your Majesty.

240
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,200
You'd better believe in a conspiracy.

241
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
You'd better save the person who saved your wife's life.

242
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
The Crown Prince is here.

243
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Father.

244
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
The cause of death is not far away.

245
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I've already ordered him to return to the capital

246
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
and take the time to cure him.

247
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Zhu Zhanji.

248
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Who's going to be so rebellious?

249
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Your Majesty.

250
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Please allow me to take the pulse for the Prince of Wei.

251
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Go.

252
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
You...

253
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
What are you doing?

254
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Don't touch my son.

255
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Your Majesty.

256
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
Zhu Zhanji.

257
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Are you going to kill your brother?

258
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Your Highness.

259
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
The imperial physician has already made a decision.

260
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
Prince of Wei is going to be unconscious

261
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
because he's poisoned.

262
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Why are you angry with His Majesty?

263
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Father.

264
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm not your father.

265
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
I'm not your uncle.

266
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
You...

267
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm his brother.

268
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
I won't let anyone hurt him.

269
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
What do you mean?

270
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm his mother.

271
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Will I hurt him?

272
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Father.

273
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Please allow me to go to the room.

274
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Your Majesty.

275
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Prince of Wei is not poisoned.

276
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
He has a cold and fever.

277
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
He has a fever and a cold.

278
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
He has a fever and a fever.

279
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
He has a fever and a fever.

280
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Are you out of your mind?

281
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
The court judge said

282
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Prince of Wei has used

283
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
a poison-intensive medicine.

284
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Are you sure?

285
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Yes.

286
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Guards.

287
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Arrest him.

288
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,920
Tell me.

289
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,520
Yes.

290
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Zhu Zhen Ji!

291
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,880
You have melon here!

292
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,760
Dare to take it as your order!

293
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,680
Father,

294
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,040
the fence is adorned too.

295
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,440
How is the wishful side

296
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,440
going to fail

297
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
if the välicow atempted it?

298
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,240
Unless

299
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,600
someone finds a good choice

300
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,640
to hide smalllarges.

301
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,720
You...

302
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,400
Your Majesty.

303
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,720
Father,

304
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,040
the wishful side will go

305
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
How could you not think of the key

306
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
for your wisdom?

307
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,880
You just have to listen to it.

308
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,800
Your Majesty!

309
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,720
You can't believe what Zhu Xin said!

310
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,640
I can take the child's surname

311
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,360
and you're still here to stir up the trouble.

312
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,640
Guo Shi,

313
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,600
do you still deserve to be a mother?

314
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,200
Father, I'm taking Xiao Shi away.

315
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,720
She's in my palace to recuperate.

316
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,520
As for Noble Consort,

317
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,000
she's your concubine.

318
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
I can't help feeling it.

319
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,140
How about

320
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:40,280

321
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,640
Xiao Shi.

322
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,000
Come up.

323
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,240
Ah Su.

324
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,120
Ah, Ah.

325
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,200
Your Majesty,

326
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:56,720
Your Majesty,

327
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,800
Your Majesty,

328
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Anshan!

329
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Anshan!

330
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Come.

331
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Your antichr ADHD is ephemeral

332
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,580
Your Majesty.

333
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Chu Xuan.

334
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
I must find out the secret in his heart.

335
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,320
Dis nationalism,

336
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,200

344
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,600
Why do you not tell me

345
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,720
why you're tragic about Chinese?

346
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Your Highness, I was wrong.

347
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,720
All right, I understand.

349
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,720
I don't know why the Empress doesn't want to see me.

350
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Do you know that Empress Yao has met Empress?

351
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
What did she say?

352
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,720
She said that Empress is not a good choice for the royal family.

353
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
What else?

354
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,720
It was the first person in the world to recognize Lu Jiao Cai as a poison.

355
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,720
That's why she was involved in so many things.

356
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
It's a misunderstanding.

357
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
I didn't expect that

358
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Wu году Guui do not want to see me when I saw her.

359
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,720
You have made it up.

360
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,820
Your Highness, though you know everything,

361
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:46,820
you can go back to room tomorrow.

362
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
But my son isку,

I'll be your brother

372
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,840
that's all

373
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,320

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,920

378
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,720
What about Ziping?

379
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,520
Has he not come back yet?

380
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,400
You've been asleep for two days.

381
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,600
You're finally awake.

382
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,160
Don't worry.

383
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Since it's proven that His Highness is alive,

384
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,440
and not poisoned,

385
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,920
he'll be back sooner or later.

386
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,080
Yao Zhang Shan!

387
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,400
Yao Zhang Shan,

388
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,080
the Crown Princess ordered you to deliver the food.

389
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,320
erm,

390
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,480
Well,

391
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,720
sorry,

392
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,720
it's all right.

393
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,880
Even if you are awake,

394
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,040
Being able to walk it mentally makes it regain consciousness.

395
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,680
Leng Ziheng,

396
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,000
can you do me a favor?

397
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,360
Yes.

398
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,760
Leng Ziheng,

399
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,360
it's me.

400
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,200
Here's my heart.

401
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,280
Crown Prince.

402
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,680
Seeing Your Grace off here.

403
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,480
Do you know why I punish you

404
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,720
because you mentioned Her Majesty

405
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,320
in front of the Empress

406
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,000
and 이유 for the Mushroom Bureau?

407
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,440
But why do you end up

408
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,880
saying those two things?

409
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,280
Manager Hu

410
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,160
has criticized Her Majesty in front of him.

411
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,680
Thus,

412
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,960
I asked you to kneel here

413
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,000
That's all.

414
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,960
All right.

415
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,600
You can leave now.

416
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,520
This

417
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,680
win is just me.

418
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,740
Okay.

419
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,520
Zhang soccer.

420
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
Come.

421
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,580
I'm okay.

422
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,360
I want to go in and take a rest.

423
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
I'm hurt.

424
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Still say no?

425
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
I saw it.

426
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Take out your hand.

427
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
Let me see.

428
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
What are you doing?

429
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Put your hand out.

430
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,960
Where is the wound?

431
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,520
I said I'm fine.

432
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,320
Get up.

433
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,880
Let me see.

434
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,560
Hurry up.

435
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,240
You're the queen of the palace.

436
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
You can't take the position of the princess.

437
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,440
Do you know

438
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,040
you almost died?

439
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,400
All right.

440
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,960
Don't cry.

441
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,200
Look.

442
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,840
I'm doing fine now.

443
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,120
The queen won't kill me now.

444
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,080
Who are you?

445
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,800
Come back.

446
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,480
Come back.

447
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,960
Don't cry.

448
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,560
I'm in the palace.

449
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,840
You're still crying.

450
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,840
When I came back, I heard you went to the Qingning Palace.

451
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,360
Why are you so stupid

452
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
to let the crown prince out?

453
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,760
You're going to go out and beg others.

454
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,040
How can you beg yourself?

455
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
альной.

456
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,000
It's over.

457
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,800
Don't cry.

458
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,120
Don't cry.

459
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,280

Get up.

471
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,400
It's not good. Listen to me.

472
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,040
Get up.

473
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,160
You can't go down.

474
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,760
Listen to me.

475
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,160
Listen to me.

476
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,640
Good.

477
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,200
Your Highness.

478
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,800
It's almost time.

479
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,760
It's almost time.

480
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,480
You can't go down.

481
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,280
Your Highness.

482
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,960
Your Highness.

483
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,680
Zhai Shan.

484
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,760
What are you doing?

485
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,920
I've been sick for so long.

486
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Why didn't Mother come to see me?

487
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,880
I want to see Mother.

488
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,480
I'll be right back.

489
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,840
Nonsense.

490
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,320
Go.

491
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,080
Doctor Cheng.

492
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
Thank you for your hard work.

493
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,680
Your Highness is seriously ill.

494
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,800
It's my duty.

495
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,040
Doctor Cheng.

496
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,560
I'm going to ask you

497
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,000
about the prescription for the King.

498
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,600
Yes.

499
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,960
Xiao Shi.

500
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,960
Who made you so confused?

501
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,120
Brother.

502
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,360
Is Mother a bad woman?

503
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,960
Who said that?

504
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,200
Everyone says she's a bad woman.

505
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,920
To frame the Queen,

506
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,960
she killed me.

507
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,360
Is that true?

508
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
Father is angry now.

509
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,800
He doesn't even want me.

510
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,880
He doesn't want to see me, right?

511
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,520
When you were sleeping,

512
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,840
Father came here long ago.

513
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,280
But he has something to discuss with you.

514
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,440
As for your mother,

515
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,840
when she was sick,

516
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,440
she went to the temple to pray for you.

517
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,280
So she couldn't stay with you.

518
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,000
Really?

519
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,200
When you're well,

520
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,480
you'll know the truth.

521
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,480
But if you don't listen to me,

522
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,800
I'll be angry.

523
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,200
Brother,

524
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,640
when I'm well,

525
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,160
you can't forget my promise.

526
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,680
I'm going to the camp.

527
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,400
I want to go hunting.

528
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
But...

529
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,440
Don't worry.

530
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,800
I'll find the best doctor

531
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,480
to treat you.

532
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,960
When you're well,

533
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,600
I'll take you hunting.

534
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,840
Your Highness,

535
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm not a good person.

536
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,680
If you don't want to eat,

537
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,360
you have to ask me questions.

538
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,440
I...

539
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,640
I can't do that.

540
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,560
Your Highness,

541
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
I'll stop next time.

542
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,760
Your Highness,

543
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,720
there are too many rumors in the palace.

544
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,760
If someone tries to break the barrier,

545
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
they'll misunderstand you and Her Highness.

546
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,280
Why don't you tell the truth in advance

547
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,880
to avoid the brotherhood?

548
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,320
Noble Consort Guo has ten million troops.

549
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
She's also Shan's mother.

550
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,680
How can you say that to a child?

551
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,520
You have to say it when the whole rain is over.

552
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,560
I'll say it myself.

553
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,440
Who will do the same?

554
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,640
Your Highness,

555
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
I'm sorry.

556
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
I dare not.

557
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,280
Your Highness,

558
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,880
I dare not.

559
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,040
I'm sorry.

560
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,680
You can leave.

561
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,080
I won't bother you anymore.

562
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,440
Your Highness,

563
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm six years old.

564
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,640
You're my god.

565
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Where can I go?

566
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,960
If you let me go,

567
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,320
I'll take the land of Lvzhi.

568
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,000
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,080
I dare not.

571
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,480
Your Highness.

572
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,040
I dare not.

573
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,720
Yuanqi is also a good person.

574
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
She'll make mistakes.

575
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,360
Why don't you spare her

576
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,080
when I'm on my side?

577
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,000
Yuanqi,

578
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,440
you have to keep your word.

579
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,120
Don't make trouble.

580
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,520
I dare not.

581
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,640
If I make trouble again,

582
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,880
I'll cut off your tongue.

583
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,240
Go and get the memorials yourself.

584
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

585
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

586
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,040
Get up.

587
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,120
I won't forget

588
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,920
the great merit of the Crown Princess.

589
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:51,680
Only for you

590
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,280
I made mistakes again.

591
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,640
Little Shi.

592
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,500
The queen of the palace comes

593
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,280
and asks for a reward.

594
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,860
She turns and wonders how the queen is doing.

595
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,380
Then she begins to Cyber Award on the first day of the eros여� marriage.

596
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,140
Your depend십 unemployed?

597
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,060
After próprio empole.

598
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,660
You're the original generation of time

599
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,680
thatokobatokaila,

600
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,860
or the one who was always practicing senhorit可愛 humor.

601
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,060
she brings cuteness like the lamp of a lord coming to this一點 corridor

602
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,620
and do your work well.

603
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,300
Yes.

604
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,660
Sister Han Yi,

605
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,020
let me see the dream master first.

606
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,980
Don't take me to the forest.

607
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,900
I don't want to go there.

608
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:50,940
Dream master,

609
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,900
please don't help me.

610
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,620
Dream master,

611
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,860
please, dream master.

612
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,420
Please, dream master.

613
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,580
Please, dream master.

614
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,660
Please, please, please, please.

615
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,460
Please, help me.

616
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,740
Help me.

617
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,420
Ask the dream master.

618
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,860
What mistake did Wen Dianshan make?

619
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,940
You have to drive him away.

620
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,940
You have to be punished for your work.

621
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,500
You have to be punished for your work.

622
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,900
You can decide the punishment later.

623
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,780
I will be the one to be the head of the court.

624
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,740
Do you understand?

625
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,300
Yes.

626
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,580
The dream master is so arrogant.

627
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,980
He even doesn't find a reason to leave Wen Yantao.

628
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,180
The one who is going to beg for mercy

629
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,660
must be a good person.

630
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,820
All right.

631
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,780
Wen Yantao is a good person.

632
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,300
When the dream master fell into the dark,

633
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,900
he was still in a dilemma.

634
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,420
He went to the forest at this time.

635
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,220
Maybe it's a good thing.

636
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,060
Now, when the dream master lost the support of the empress,

637
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,860
he lost the biggest one.

638
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,700
Everyone who is relying on him

639
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,660
is being punished one by one.

640
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,820
Guess who will be the next one to be expelled?

641
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,340
All right.

642
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,340
Zijin, I finally got a good look.

643
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,580
I got a good look.

644
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,780
I got a good look.

645
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,420
I got a good look.

646
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,180
All right.

647
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,060
You don't have to rely on anyone else.

648
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,860
Unless it's a dream master,

649
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
it's impossible for me to be expelled.

650
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,420
I will never rely on the enemy.

651
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,580
Besides,

652
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,540
you haven'tellels any cream on all their level.

653
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,020
Why must you be so irrational?

654
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,340
You don't want to deny it either.

655
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,600
You want to get back together in Shixiong.

656
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,060
And then wanna get back together

657
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,580
in the heaven.

658
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,420
Wouldn't you like to get back together

659
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,220
in the heaven?

660
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:10,420
No.

661
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,580
You just didn't want to get back together.

662
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:13,980
I just didn't want you

663
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,020
to refuse that idea.

664
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,820
If it's true,

665
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,460
you will never be freed.

666
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,020
A civil organization

667
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,660
won't be lei Shuanyang considerate to you.

668
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,820
after they last so long in their soldiers.

669
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,220
Now that's the case.

670
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,580
Please wait patiently.

671
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,380
Your Highness, please have a eat atabling.

672
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,580
This is so implementable.

673
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,380
I won't revolt you.

674
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,660
Why are you so cruel to me now?

675
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
Why?

676
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,660
Please answer me.

677
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,660
Noble Consort doesn't believe in the truth.

678
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,660
That's why she's so easy to defeat.

679
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,660
It's useless to be sad.

680
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Why don't you think about how to pay for it?

681
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,660
The court has been in jail.

682
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,660
The real disaster is ahead.

683
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Your Highness, it's better to take the blame than to be a coward.

684
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,660
If you can trust me,

685
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,660
I'll help you to overcome the difficulties.

686
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
Prince Wei has recovered.

687
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,660
But the spirit is weak and the food is not good.

688
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,660
Your Highness, I'm worried.

689
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,660
I want everyone in the court to recover.

690
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
Yes.

691
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,660
We've heard the order from the court.

692
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
No matter what method you use,

693
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,660
you must be brave to help Prince Wei.

694
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,660
You're well-off.

695
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,660
The Eastern Palace is well-off.

696
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,660
If you can't do it, it's hard for the court to escape.

697
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Go now.

698
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Yes.

699
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Yukun, help me to...

700
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,660
Your Highness,

701
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660
what food will you prepare for Prince Wei?

702
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,660
I'll help you, okay?

703
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,660
No need.

704
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,660
Since you decided to stay in the Imperial City,

705
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,660
there's no connection between us.

706
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
But do you know that

707
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,660
when I was five years old,

708
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,660
I started to enter the kitchen.

709
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,660
I practiced the day and night.

710
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,660
Can you be my idol?

711
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,660
I want to be a good chef.

712
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,660
I want everyone to see the beauty of China.

713
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,660
I want to be a good chef.

714
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,660
I want to be a good chef.

715
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,660
I want to be a good chef.

716
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,660
I want to be a good chef.

717
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,660
I want to be a good chef.

718
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
The famous chef of the Imperial City,

719
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,660
and the cook who is rich and rich,

720
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
the cook who is on the street,

721
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
and the cook who is a cook,

722
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,660
are all doing the same thing.

723
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
They are divided into three or six or nine.

724
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
And the housekeeper,

725
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,660
the mood is like this.

726
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,660
What? You don't understand?

727
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
Just be straight.

728
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,660
Be good.

729
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,660
You are so rude.

730
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,660
Why are you so late?

731
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,660
I have to see you, Wang Zhao.

732
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,660
What is this?

733
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
I heard that

734
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,660
using the Qu Flower as a pot,

735
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,660
it can cure the poison in the oven.

736
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,660
It can also lighten the fire.

737
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,660
It is good for your health.

738
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,660
That's why I am afraid of it.

739
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,660
Your Highness,

740
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,660
in order to suit your taste,

741
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,660
I added a little bit of ice sugar

742
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,660
to make it less bitter.

743
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,660
Have a sip.

744
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Have a sip.

745
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,660
Try this crystal Gui Huagao.

746
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,660
I picked it myself.

747
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,660
I heard that you often think

748
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,660
that the fire is too strong

749
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,660
and the smoke is too strong.

750
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,660
It can be reduced.

751
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,660
Or,

752
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,660
do you want to try the crab dumplings?

753
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Your Highness, have a bite.

754
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,660
I don't want to eat it.

755
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,660
Your Highness,

756
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,660
let's have a bite of crab dumplings.

757
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,660
Look at this crab dumpling.

758
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,660
The skin is thin.

759
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,660
You can see the filling inside.

760
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,660
Each one is so full.

761
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,660
It is very delicious.

Have a bite.

763
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,660

that it can bite the sugar.

774
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,660
The filling is full of the sweet and bitter egg.

775
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,660
This is the sweetest and most sweet

776
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,660

You are so funny.

793
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,660
You are trying to make me laugh.

794

Take it all away.

I am afraid to be in trouble.

799
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,660

Look at the size.

00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:25,660
It is small.

809
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,660
But it takes 120 pieces.

810
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,660
How dare you!
