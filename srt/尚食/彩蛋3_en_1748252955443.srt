00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm going to use the same method as the other one.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:54,880
C

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,880
The best flavor is the human heart.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Today, we invited eight fans of Mango TV

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,880
to serve you a new year's dish.

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,880
It's the traditional gourmet food.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
It's finally here.

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,880

the key words are not known by Xu Kai and Wu Jingyan.

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Let's look forward to it.

40
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Besides that,

41
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
today, we invited

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880

to our live broadcast.

44
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Let's welcome Xu Kai and Wu Jingyan

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,880
to our live broadcast.

46
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
Welcome.

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,880
Hello,

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Mango TV fans.

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Hello, I'm Xu Kai.

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Yes, welcome Xu Kai

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
to our live broadcast room.

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,880
How do you feel about our live broadcast room?

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Very warm and very pleasant atmosphere.

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,880
And warm and pleasant.

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
Because today,

56
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
our theme is

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,880
Zhu Zhangjin and Yao Zijin's family dinner.

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Whatever is not rare,

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
it is a candy for everyone.

60
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,880
So I also want to tell you

61
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
that you can use this link

62
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,880
to invite Yao Zijin to our live broadcast room.

63
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
And Huang Taicun

64
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,880
to talk with you about something important.

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
I believe that

66
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,880
everyone's chats are all spread out now.

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Right?

68
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
Where is Jingyan?

69
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,880
OK, let's talk more.

70
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Please welcome Jingyan.

71
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Welcome Jingyan.

72
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Welcome you.

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Hello.

74
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Hello, we are Jingyan.

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Hello.

76
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Kai.

77
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,880
Hello.

78
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Hello.

79
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
You are so happy.

80
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,880
I am very lonely.

81
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
But we have a lot of fans

82
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,880
who are with Jingyan, OK?

83
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
OK.

84
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
I don't know if you are lonely

85
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
or very warm.

86
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
OK.

87
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Then I want to tell you

88
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,880
because today,

89
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
our Jingyan

90
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
because of the epidemic situation,

91
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,880
through this cloud live broadcast

92
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
we can see

93
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
a kind of family dinner

94
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
with you.

95
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
I believe everyone can feel

96
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
that Wu Jingyan

97
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
and Xu Kai

98
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,880
are in this hot spot.

99
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
I believe that

100
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
people are already

101
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,880
in the mood.

102
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
Actually,

103
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
we have prepared some snacks

104
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
at the scene.

105
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
I don't know.

106
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Did Jingyan eat something?

107
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
I think they have prepared

108
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
snacks

109
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
that are not snacks.

110
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Yes, they have prepared snacks.

111
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Right?

112
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
Yes.

113
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
At the scene,

114
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
we have prepared snacks

115
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
and we have prepared tea.

116
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
At the beginning,

117
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
let's have a cup of tea first, OK?

118
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
OK.

119
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Let's have a cup of tea

120
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
with our audience.

121
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Welcome everyone.

122
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
Thank you for watching

123
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,880
our live broadcast.

124
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Let's have a close-up of our Jingyan.

125
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Next,

126
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
we can start

127
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
eating and chatting.

128
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
You can see that

129
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
people are already here.

130
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
The family dinner is about to begin.

131
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Because of the food,

132
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
we have been looking forward to it for a long time.

133
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,880
What she said

134
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
is that the young girl Yao Zijun

135
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,880
grew up in the palace.

136
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
And she taught us

137
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Chinese food

138
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
to spread the sun and shine.

139
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
And she told the story of Zhu Zhanji.

140
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Right?

141
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Today,

142
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,880
we have prepared

143
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
some of the most important

144
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
high-performance films.

145
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
I don't know

146
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
whether it was before

147
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Xu Kai and Wu Jingyan

148
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
have seen the film.

149
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
No.

150
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
No.

151
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
So it's our first time watching it, right?

152
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Yes.

153
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
OK, let's follow Jingyan

154
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
and Xu Kai

155
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
to see the film together.

156
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Zhang Wu,

157
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
it's on the side.

158
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Your Highness,

159
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
please don't say that.

160
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Maybe

161
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
someone will come.

162
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm the first one to say that.

163
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,880
The moon is in the right color tonight.

164
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Let's go.

165
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Go to the moon.

166
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,880
I'm living for you.

167
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm living for you.

168
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
I'm the only one in my life.

169
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,880
I'm telling you,

170
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
I won't let you go.

171
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,880
It's all over.

172
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
Your Highness just said

173
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
it's all over.

174
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Yes.

175
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
Yes, I feel like

176
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
it's all over.

177
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
It's all over.

178
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
I feel like

179
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm sure you all

180
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
have the same thoughts

181
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
as Jingyan.

182
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
She's always going up the Yangtze River.

183
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
She's so sweet.

184
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
So,

185
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,880
please introduce

186
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
your role

187
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
in the film.

188
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Jingyan.

189
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Jingyan.

190
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm Jingyan.

191
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm in the film.

192
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm playing Yao Jingjing.

193
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
I'm playing a princess.

194
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,880
It's really good.

195
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
The film has

196
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,880
about one thousand movies.

197
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
You're so good.

198
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Yes.

199
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Congratulations.

200
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Do you know

201
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
if you've heard our voice?

202
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
It's actually

203
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,880
a hidden welfare part

204
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
in our live stream.

205
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,880
During the live stream,

206
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
as long as you two

207
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
say our welfare key words,

208
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
it will trigger our welfare mechanism.

209
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
So congratulations to

210
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
the two members of the welfare committee

211
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
in this round.

212
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
So, thank you very much.

213
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
You've already shown up

214
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
on our screen.

215
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Congratulations.

216
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
The film is very beautiful.

217
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
And the girl is also

218
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
very beautiful.

219
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
And the costume

220
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
has reached

221
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
more than three thousand.

222
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
It's beautiful

223
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
and it's a very cool and cool scene.

224
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
At the same time,

225
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
there's also

226
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,880
the love between Zhu Zhanzhi and Yao Jingjing.

227
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
I'm in the film.

228
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Yao Jingjing is a

229
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
very good cook.

230
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
She's a good girl.

231
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
I admire her

232
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
because

233
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
at that time,

234
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
she had a lot of courage.

235
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,880
She had a lot of ideas.

236
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
I admire her courage.

237
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,880
Yes.

238
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
She's a kind of

239
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
independent girl.

240
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Independent girl.

241
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
So this kind of film

242
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,880
should be very colorful.

243
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,880
And there are

244
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
a lot of sweet films.

245
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
We just

246
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,880
just watched a little bit.

247
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
It's already sweet.

248
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I don't know, Xu Kai.

249
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Can you introduce

250
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
the role you played in it?

251
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
I played Huang Taicun.

252
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Zhu Zhanzhi.

253
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
And he's a genius

254
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
who's both good and bad.

255
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
You call him a genius, right?

256
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Zhu Zhanzhi is a genius,

257
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
right?

258
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
He has such a beautiful Yao Jingjing.

259
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Look,

260
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
he's on the scene.

261
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,880
He's...

262
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Yes.

263
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
I think there's nothing

264
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
missing.

265
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
A man

266
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
who's perfect.

267
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
A genius.

268
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Can you

269
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,880
introduce the two of you?

270
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Actually,

271
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Jingyan has already said something.

272
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Do you think that

273
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
compared to the role

274
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,880
you've played in the past,

275
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,880
there are some different characteristics?

276
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
I think the biggest difference

277
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
is that

278
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,880
he has a

279
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
excessive process.

280
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,880
His character

281
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
has changed very quickly.

282
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,880
For example, I'm Huang Taicun.

283
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
And then

284
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
I became the Crown Prince

285
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,880
and then I became the Emperor.

286
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
So I often

287
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,880
discuss with the director at that time.

288
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
I said,

289
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Director,

290
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
I was obviously very happy just now.

291
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Why did I suddenly

292
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
become unhappy in this film?

293
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
He said you're the Emperor.

294
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
You're happy, you're angry, you're happy.

295
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
You won't be caught by someone.

296
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I said,

297
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
what should I do?

298
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
He said,

299
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
you're the one who's taking care of everything now.

300
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
You're the one who's taking care of everything.

301
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
So I think it's very difficult.

302
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
It's not as if you're angry

303
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
and you're

304
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
looking at everything

305
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
in your life differently.

306
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
So I think

307
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
I've been learning

308
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
this.

309
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
Because after all,

310
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
His aura

311
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
and his

312
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
difficulty are too big.

313
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
I think I've been

314
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,880
learning this.

315
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,880
I can't use

316
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
all the things

317
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
I see in my life

318
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
to

319
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
really bring the Emperor into my life.

320
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
You told me

321
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
that it's actually very difficult.

322
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
For example,

323
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
I said to some old actors,

324
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
I also said

325
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
I was a bit angry.

326
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
I said,

327
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Teacher,

328
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,880
it's okay.

329
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
I'm not that kind of person.

330
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
So I think this is a very difficult point.

331
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
A very different point.

332
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Actually, it's a journey to grow.

333
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Yes.

334
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Including, you see,

335
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
because when you're shooting,

336
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
it's not like you're

337
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
following the plot.

338
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Maybe you were playing

339
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
the Emperor in the last second.

340
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
You were playing the Emperor in the next second.

341
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
So the difficulty of this change

342
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
is also here.

343
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes.

344
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
What about you, Jin Yan?

345
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
I just heard from Kai.

346
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
I was talking to him.

347
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
The director told him

348
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
that everything is his

349
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
feeling.

350
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
I was thinking about him.

351
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
When we were shooting,

352
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
no wonder

353
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
he took everything

354
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
to death.

355
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Take you?

356
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Yes.

357
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,880
This place is also mine.

358
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Everyone is his.

359
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
I can understand

360
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
that

361
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
it wasn't easy

362
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
to make him feel good.

363
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Yes.

364
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I think

365
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
this series of girls and Kai

366
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
is the second time

367
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
we've worked together.

368
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
Different places.

369
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Yes.

370
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
I always think

371
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
I'm still a maid.

372
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
I started from the beginning.

373
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
But when I saw Kai,

374
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
he was already the Emperor.

375
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
It's not like

376
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
we grew up together

377
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
before.

378
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
The relationship

379
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
between the characters

380
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
has changed.

381
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
It makes people feel

382
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
familiar and unfamiliar.

383
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
It's a challenge.

384
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
But because of the familiarness,

385
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
it's a good match.

386
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Yes.

387
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
We have to go to the same place

388
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
where we used to be.

389
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,880
It's so familiar.

390
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
It's a difficult place.

391
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
And

392
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
I think

393
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
the relationship between Yao Zijun

394
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
and Zhu Yanji

395
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
makes me feel a little bit

396
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
worried.

397
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
It also makes the audience feel worried.

398
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
It's because

399
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
they've met

400
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
for a long time.

401
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
They've been together for a long time.

402
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
They've met each other.

403
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
I think this is

404
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
a special place.

405
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,880
I don't know if the audience

406
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,880
can

407
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
love this place.

408
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
When I read the script,

409
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
I thought,

410
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
why is it still missing?

411
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Anyway,

412
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
if it's still missing,

413
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
I finally saw it.

414
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
I thought,

415
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
it's okay.

416
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
I finally got it.

417
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
It's a very touching moment.

418
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
So,

419
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
as long as you keep chasing,

420
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
you will keep chasing.

421
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
Because it's really

422
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
hard to get to the bottom of your heart.

423
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
And then it's sweet.

424
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
Maybe there's a place

425
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
where you're still very tired.

426
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
So, it's a place

427
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,880
where you're always close to.

428
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
There are many places

429
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
that attract people.

430
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I also saw

431
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
two of my four friends

432
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
who have been

433
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
playing the role of

434
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Zhu Zan Ji

435
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
and Yao Zijing.

436
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
They've already got a name

437
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
for the role of a C.P.

438
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Have you heard of it?

439
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,880
I'll tell you about it.

440
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
It's called

441
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Golden Palm.

442
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
It's rich.

443
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
I saw it.

444
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
I saw it.

445
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,880
It's not that

446
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
it's missing.

447
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
I don't know.

448
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
I know.

449
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
I just think

450
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
this character

451
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,880
is like a dish

452
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
in our history.

453
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,880
It's like a dish.

454
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Golden Palm

455
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
can also be a dish.

456
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
How do you

457
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
see the name of the C.P.?

458
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I think it's cute.

459
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,880
And Golden Palm

460
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,880
has a meaning

461
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,880
of being with and pure.

462
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
So, I think it's very suitable.

463
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
It's just right for us

464
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
to be together

465
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
in the drama

466
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
and be together

467
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
to grow together.

468
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
It's a contrast.

469
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Yes.

470
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
I think it's a romantic character.

471
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Because if you know

472
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
that boys can

473
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
understand

474
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
some of the words

475
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
of the flower,

476
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
I think it's very detailed

477
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
and thoughtful.

478
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Do you know that, Jinyan?

479
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
I think

480
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
many people

481
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
don't know

482
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,880
about the flower.

483
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
So, he's very important

484
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
to your C.P.

485
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
Jinyan, how do you

486
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
see the name of the C.P.?

487
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
I heard

488
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
that it's very suitable

489
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
for the drama of the top.

490
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Especially,

491
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Xiao Bei has made

492
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
a little

493
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
detail

494
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
in the food

495
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,880
for the Zhe Shan Chicken.

496
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,880
Yes.

497
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
And then,

498
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
he has

499
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
a very positive effect.

500
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Yes, when you see

501
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
the relationship

502
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
of the two of them,

503
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
you will feel

504
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
very magical.

505
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
You will feel

506
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
very normal.

507
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
You will feel

508
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
very practical.

509
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Yes, you can.

510
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Speaking of this,

511
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
because

512
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
we just saw

513
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
the high-end film,

514
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
because it's the first time

515
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
you've watched it.

516
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Now, let's recall it again.

517
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
When we were filming,

518
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,880
which scene

519
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
do you think

520
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
is the sweetest

521
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
or the most impressive?

522
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
I think

523
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
we can recall it now.

524
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
The sweetest scene

525
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
must be

526
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
the kiss between us.

527
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
And the most impressive scene is

528
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
actually,

529
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,880
when we first started filming,

530
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
did you remember

531
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
the scene where we were

532
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
very strict?

533
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
When we first started filming,

534
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
we were

535
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
filming the scene

536
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
where we were

537
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
in the bookshelf.

538
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Yes, I think

539
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
we were walking over there.

540
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Yes.

541
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Fortunately, we met before.

542
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Let me tell you.

543
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
It was embarrassing.

544
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Is it like this?

545
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
When we were filming,

546
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
I asked the director,

547
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
is it like this?

548
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
I walked over there

549
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
and put it so close.

550
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
I said, is it like this?

551
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
The director said,

552
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
it's almost like this.

553
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
I said, OK.

554
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
We don't need

555
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
to go to

556
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
the awkward point anymore.

557
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Yes.

558
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I think this is

559
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
the scene

560
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
when we first started filming.

561
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
I think it's impressive.

562
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Yes.

563
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Actually, the two of them

564
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
are quite familiar with each other.

565
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
So, when we were filming this scene,

566
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
it was actually

567
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
a comfortable state.

568
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
When we just received the kiss,

569
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
did you have

570
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
a lot of

571
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
blood,

572
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,880
or any other stuff?

573
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
No.

574
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
No?

575
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
No.

576
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
Kai's

577
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
one-on-one-over,

578
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
is almost the same.

579
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Almost the same.

580
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
The acting of Kai's

581
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
one-on-one-over

582
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
on the scene

583
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
was a few years ago.

584
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,880
But this one-on-one-over

585
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,880
is a kiss.

586
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
One-on-one-over.

587
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
OK.

588
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Yes.

589
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Because the two of them

590
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,880
are very involved in the atmosphere,

591
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
in fact,

592
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,880
you can feel it

593
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
when you are in the atmosphere.

594
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
It's great.

595
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,880
It's been a few years.

596
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,880
What do you think

597
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
is the sweetest scene

598
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
that you have ever seen?

599
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,880
I like it more

600
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,880
than the innermost one.

601
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,880
Yes.

602
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
It's a little space for everyone.

603
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
The one scene that I have

604
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
impressed me

605
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
is actually

606
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
the one in the drama

607
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,880
with Yao Jijin and Zhu Shanji.

608
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
It's the first time

609
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
I've seen Zhu Shanji

610
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
in a scene

611
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
that looks like this.

612
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I watched him from a distance.

613
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,880
I knew Zhu Shanji

614
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
was so handsome.

615
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,880
In the one-on-one-over,

616
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,880
I feel like

617
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
I've been waiting for a long time

618
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,880
to see this person.

619
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
And then I saw him.

620
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
And then I saw him.

621
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
And then I saw him.

622
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
And then I saw him.

623
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
And then I saw him.

624
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
It's the kind of

625
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
sweet smile.

626
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
It's the kind of smile

627
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
that I really like.

628
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I believe that

629
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
when you are chasing after him,

630
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
because everyone just said

631
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
that you might have to wait

632
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
until the next episode

633
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
to see

634
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
the kind of smile

635
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
that you really see.

636
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
So in this drama,

637
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
you must follow your grandpa,

638
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
follow Xu Kai,

639
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
and follow your grandpa.

640
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
Actually,

641
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
after I finished talking about it,

642
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
I think

643
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
our image is getting stronger.

644
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
I believe that

645
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
the fans of Mango TV

646
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
are more looking forward to it.

647
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
So,

648
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
don't forget to

649
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
follow the script

650
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,880
when you are on the show,

651
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
okay?

652
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,880
Let's look forward to it.

653
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
So, what I just said is

654
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
the family business.

655
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
We can't miss

656
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
some delicious food.

657
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
So, next,

658
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,880
we will start

659
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
the delicious banquet

660
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
with the baby in the live broadcast room.

661
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
So, first,

662
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
let's ask Jingyan, okay?

663
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Because in the drama,

664
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
we are the top female official

665
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
of Yao Zijing.

666
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
I believe that

667
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
you must have some

668
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
understanding of the cooking.

669
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
What do you think

670
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
is the best dish

671
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
in your mind?

672
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,880
After I finished acting,

673
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
I really drew my heart

674
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
when I saw the cooking.

675
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
It's so difficult to look at the door.

676
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
I think

677
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Yao Zijing

678
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,880
cooked for Zhu Zan Ji.

679
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Whether it's

680
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
from the season of food,

681
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
the coldness,

682
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
or

683
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
for example,

684
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
the food from this morning

685
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
and dinner

686
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
are different.

687
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
The food from the cooking

688
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
consists of

689
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
ingredients,

690
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
spices,

691
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
and herbs,

692
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
which is very, very

693
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
flavorful.

694
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
It's

695
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
something to be loved

696
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
by the cook.

697
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
The food

698
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
may be

699
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
a standard of Yao Zijing.

700
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
So, for me,

701
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
it's

702
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
the flavor.

703
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
It's a big contrast.

704
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,880
I really drew

705
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
my heart.

706
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
With the cooking

707
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
of love,

708
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
the taste

709
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
is really warm.

710
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
It's a heart.

711
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Yes, it's so hearty.

712
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Because of Jin Yan's answer,

713
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,680
we have prepared a small interaction for Jin Yan.

714
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,160
Of course, Xu Kai will be here to finish it.

715
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,360
Before we start,

716
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,200
we have to prepare three dishes in the drama.

717
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,680
Let's invite our director team to come and serve the dishes.

718
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,240
Okay.

719
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,960
Can you see the three dishes on the table?

720
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,480
It's very far.

721
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,440
It's very far.

722
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,280
I think I can see...

723
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,720
What is it?

724
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,680
At least I can see three plates, right?

725
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,480
Can you see three plates and three white plates?

726
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,760
First, we need Jin Yan to prepare three dishes.

727
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,640
Anyway, the first one is the second one.

728
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,120
This is the third dish.

729
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,160
Choose one, okay?

730
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,280
Which dish do you choose?

731
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,760
I'll sell a jar first.

732
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,600
Come on, choose one, okay?

733
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,320
Okay, it's like rice with rice.

734
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,400
In my opinion,

735
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,240
I want the middle one.

736
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,880
The one in the back.

737
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,280
What is it?

738
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,360
Okay, the third dish.

739
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:24,720
Yes.

740
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
Xu Kai, come and open it, okay?

741
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,000
Let's see what it is.

742
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,280
Dong, dong, dong, dong.

743
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,000
Okay, maybe Jin Yan can't see it clearly.

744
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
Let me show you.

745
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,920
What is this?

746
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,000
This should be...

747
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,120
This should be a dish.

748
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,800
A dish?

749
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,480
Did you have it in the drama?

750
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,240
Yes.

751
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,840
Yes.

752
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,920
Since it's already there, it seems that you already know it.

753
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,720
Then, let's take a look at Jin Yan.

754
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:59,360
Let's use this dish to describe Zhu Zhan Ji.

755
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,040
The dish is special.

756
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,280
This person is not only a person who likes an appearance,

757
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,400
but also has a deep inner voice.

758
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,240
He can sing, dance,

759
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,760
write, play,

760
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,960
and also love.

761
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,080
Yes, like Zhu Zhan Ji.

762
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,040
He knows it.

763
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,200
Zi Shu should have a good voice.

764
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,720
I can understand.

765
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,880
I can understand what Jin Yan said.

766
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,680
He just said that the appearance is a dish.

767
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,120
The dish is a whole, which is my skin.

768
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,360
And my talent represents every rice.

769
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,520
So it's a dish, right?

770
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,240
Yes.

771
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,120
You just said that my various talents are in me.

772
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,120
My beauty is my talent.

773
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,840
That's too much.

774
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,560
This person is too much.

775
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,360
He has a very bright appearance.

776
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,280
He suddenly has a special one.

777
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,200
It makes people think that the more you eat, the more fragrant it is.

778
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,160
The more you taste it, the more you will be more mature.

779
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,320
Such a quality.

780
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,240
The more you taste it, the more you will be mature.

781
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,480
I agree.

782
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,400
Really.

783
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,920
I just want to say that the last one is a little bit more.

784
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,960
He is also good at keeping things.

785
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,120
Let's take a look at the other two dishes.

786
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,360
The two dishes you chose.

787
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,080
One is the early one.

788
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,200
The early one.

789
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,080
There are also some in the heart.

790
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,720
This is my...

791
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,960
The important food that takes the pork and ginseng flavor.

792
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,080
Yes, the early one.

793
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,880
The other one is actually instant noodles.

794
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,400
So I found that these three dishes are actually quite difficult.

795
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,280
But after passing the performance of Jingyan,

796
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,880
I think if Xu Kai can evaluate or give a score,

797
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,000
how many points do you give?

798
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,640
That's all I have.

799
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
That must be a lot of points.

800
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,160
Right?

801
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,440
The performance gave a full score.

802
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,400
You can see that Jingyan really praised our heart.

803
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Just now, our top female official,

804
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,560
our Zijing, is probably too professional.

805
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,880
Just now, we can use this word to praise people in the kitchen.

806
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,400
So everyone can remember what Jingyan just said.

807
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,120
When we are in the pursuit, we will brush the wood, okay?

808
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,880
Then let's ask our Huang Taisun.

809
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,040
Because you must have tasted a lot of delicious food in the drama.

810
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,320
Just now, Jingyan has a total of over 1,000 dishes, right?

811
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Yes, the full score.

812
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,840
If you want to evaluate the Yau Zijing in the drama,

813
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,960
what kind of dish do you think is Yau Zijing?

814
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,040
I think Jingyan has already heard it all.

815
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,840
I think whatever dish Yau Zijing has in the kitchen,

816
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,160
she is the best.

817
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,080
What is your opinion about Jingyan?

818
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,680
I'm used to it.

819
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,480
The answer to Xu Kai's question is always perfect.

820
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,320
Just now, Zhu Zhanji said that

821
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
it's actually a set of Chinese dishes, right?

822
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,280
So what do you do?

823
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,160
It's perfect in his heart.

824
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
The same.

825
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
How can Zhu Zhanji use a dish to describe it?

826
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Anything is not perfect in his heart.

827
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,640
He is a genius.

828
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,280
You are a genius.

829
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,680
You are a genius.

830
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,880
You are a genius.

831
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,400
You are a genius.

832
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,920
You are a genius again.

833
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,840
Yes, genius.

834
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,520
We have already used the food to describe it.

835
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,760
So next,

836
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,920
because of the presence of Mr. Huang,

837
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,720
we will also do a five-digit challenge

838
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,080
to describe our Yau Zijing.

839
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,360
The rule of our interaction is that

840
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,440
Zhu Zhanji has to describe Yau Zijing in the drama

841
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,840
the most sour, the sweet, the bitter, the spicy,

842
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,520
the most salty place.

843
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,880
It's a challenge to do a compliment.

844
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,800
I think it's quite difficult.

845
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,360
Now Xu Kai becomes a feeling of Zhu Zhanji.

846
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,880
Then let's compliment our Yau Zijing.

847
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,640
There are five flavors.

848
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,320
I feel that Xu Kai is sweating a little.

849
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,520
If you are ready,

850
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
I'll start.

851
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,800
Come on, describe it.

852
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,440
Very difficult.

853
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,680
The sourest, the sweetest, the bitter, the spicy, the salty, right?

854
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,040
Yes.

855
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,280
The sourest is what I'm reading.

856
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,280
When we were in the study room, we were in the team.

857
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,080
The sweetest is when we were in the study room,

858
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,280
I was in the place of the place where I forced Yau Zijing to sprinkle sugar.

859
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,360
The bitterest is...

860
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,160
The audience should look forward to it.

861
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,840
This is not the end.

862
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,920
The most spicy, the most spicy is...

863
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,720
Yau Zijing is also in the study room.

864
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,800
He is a...

865
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,720
Yes, but Yau Zijing is a...

866
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,000
A career-oriented woman.

867
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,520
Very strong, very strong, very independent.

868
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,600
Yes.

869
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,760
The most salty is...

870
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,600
Is it the play?

871
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,040
He is also in the study room,

872
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,160
refusing me.

873
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,560
The second one is refusing.

874
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,800
Very cool.

875
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,200
He rejected you.

876
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,240
He is a cool man, not bitter.

877
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,320
I think he is very strict.

878
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,880
I think he is very handsome, right?

879
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,120
He is very sweet and strict.

880
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,440
I think he is very handsome.

881
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,400
Huang Taicun,

882
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,040
such a great man.

883
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,800
You actually rejected me.

884
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,720
But I am also telling you

885
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,520
that he is in the study room.

886
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,240
Yes.

887
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,120
That is the second one.

888
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,760
He rejected me in the study room.

889
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,680
This is the study room with the five-star-discount.

890
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,880
Yes, the story happened in it.

891
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,320
So, the sour, sweet, bitter, spicy,

892
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,560
and salty are all in the study room, right?

893
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,680
Yes, you can say that

894
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,640
you feel that you two are in the drama.

895
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,040
But how sweet is it?

896
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,640
You still have to chase after it.

897
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,960
Huang Taicun just praised the word,

898
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,280
so much.

899
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,160
I want to ask our word.

900
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,040
In your eyes,

901
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,600
what do you think is the biggest advantage of Zhu Zhanji?

902
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,280
I really can't finish it.

903
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,000
But in this live broadcast,

904
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,600
I can't turn off the TV for a long time.

905
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,840
I think Zhu Zhanji is

906
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,520
a very perfect person in my heart.

907
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,600
Very perfect.

908
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,720
Any girl who sees it,

909
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,800
will feel that

910
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,560
she is really...

911
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,120
She is the one in my heart.

912
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,600
She is not short of a point.

913
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,120
She is not short of a point.

914
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
You are too official.

915
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,840
I want to ask you something.

916
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,760
She is willing to let go of herself.

917
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,240
She wants to let go of herself.

918
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,360
She loves you very much.

919
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,440
This is your style, right?

920
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,680
This is the style of the drama.

921
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,720
The more so, the more I can't leave.

922
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
Are you in a hurry?

923
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,840
This is the style of men.

924
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,320
Not the style of Zhu Zhanji.

925
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,080
How to say?

926
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,960
Anyway, I think

927
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,320
Zhu Zhanji and Yao Ziqi

928
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
are both perfect in their hearts.

929
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,840
If you hear it now,

930
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,200
if you can take Zhu Zhanji away,

931
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,840
what is the most important thing

932
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,880
that you want to take away from her?

933
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,400
The most important thing is...

934
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,360
It's not life, right?

935
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
It's not life, right?

936
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,040
I don't want your life.

937
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
You have so many talents.

938
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,440
Why do you want your life?

939
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,520
I want to use all your talents

940
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
on me.

941
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,680
I want to keep you as a person.

942
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,640
Your talents and talents

943
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,440
are all for you.

944
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,560
I'm coming.

945
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,960
So you want to take her talent away, right?

946
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,560
Then I'm not a failure.

947
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,960
I can't let you go.

948
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,280
I'm only rich now.

949
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,040
Zhu Zhanji.

950
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,800
It's good to be a person.

951
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,920
I can be a talent for you.

952
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,720
I have a lot of talents.

953
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm tired, too.

954
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
It's perfect.

955
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,400
Darling,

956
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,760
how can you have such a perfect Zhu Zhanji?

957
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,480
Right?

958
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,960
How can you have such a good Zijin?

959
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,320
Fine.

960
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,200
It's very difficult.

961
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,840
And I was a little просто with Zijin.

962
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,280
She made a lot of effort

963
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,160
to get the suit for Zhu Zhanji.

964
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Because she is so smart

965
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
She is a prince

966
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
She has everything

967
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
She is so talented

968
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
She is a smart and talented artist

969
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
She is also a handsome and energetic person

970
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,160
What should I do?

971
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
I am very disheartened

972
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
What should I do?

973
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Since this is the case

974
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,160
I will start with the position of this man

975
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
I will start with my own foundation

976
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
I will start with the position of this man

977
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Then the steps are very clever

978
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Then I will tell him

979
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
I like you

980
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
I like you

981
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
I will express my gratitude to you

982
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,160
The next step is more important

983
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Goodbye

984
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
I am leaving

985
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,160
The kitchen machine is also very good

986
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Just use a few words to take down her position

987
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
You can start with the kitchen machine

988
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,160
The most early

989
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
The most early

990
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
I made a lot of food

991
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
I made a lot of food

992
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
And I also showed my talent

993
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Give her some words

994
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Give her a painting

995
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
Give her a play

996
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
It's also a talent

997
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Give her a piece of advice

998
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
This is to show your talent

999
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Also showed it to her

1000
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
But the most important thing is to hold her position

1001
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,160
Then hold her heart

1002
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,160
For her

1003
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
The most important thing is to

1004
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Do your job well

1005
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Then let this man take care of you

1006
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Then don't spend too much time on her

1007
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Go away quickly

1008
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
I should not listen to this part first

1009
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
You are so stubborn

1010
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,160
I told you

1011
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
So this is the case

1012
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
You are like this

1013
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
You are like this

1014
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
I have a set of rules

1015
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
It doesn't matter

1016
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
You go do what you want to do

1017
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
I'll let you go

1018
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
You are the same

1019
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
You two are the same

1020
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Actually, I think Ji Yan just said

1021
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
We can use the little door

1022
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Remember

1023
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,160
When facing a perfect person

1024
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Actually, the way to use it

1025
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
I think this move

1026
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Can also be used in reality

1027
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Ji Yan, what do you think?

1028
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
You can buy a few more in the morning

1029
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
You can open your eyes

1030
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Do you care if the move is in reality?

1031
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
I'm in the drama

1032
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
I asked how I like it in the morning

1033
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
He said in the morning

1034
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
He said in the morning

1035
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
My reaction was like

1036
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,160
You are such a talented person

1037
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Love to eat the breakfast

1038
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
So in reality

1039
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
The breakfast is not easy

1040
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
You can't say it in the morning

1041
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
Then do you think

1042
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
In reality

1043
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
A quick-dish breakfast

1044
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Can you move a person?

1045
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
No, if Xu Kai

1046
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
If you live in a hotel

1047
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
I think it's okay

1048
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
Yes

1049
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Do you know why you can live in a hotel?

1050
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Actually, people are different

1051
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Because the person who does this

1052
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Is Yao Zijing

1053
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Yes

1054
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Youth Zijing

1055
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
I'm in love with you

1056
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
I can never leave Yao Zijing

1057
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Okay, just said

1058
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Yao Zijing is on the way to upgrade

1059
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
The way to beat the monster

1060
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Is to cut down a food king

1061
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
So is Royal Descendant a food king?

1062
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
I think

1063
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
He

1064
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
Actually

1065
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
My father is a food king

1066
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
I think Royal Descendant

1067
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
Zhu Zhanqi, he wants more

1068
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Not to say what he wants to eat for him

1069
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,160
He wants to use this excuse

1070
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,160
To see Yao Zijing

1071
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
So he has to go to the hospital every day

1072
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
To make him eat

1073
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Actually, it's to see him

1074
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
I think more important is

1075
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Not to eat

1076
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
But to think about him

1077
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
Because you can cook

1078
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,160
So I just wanted to see you

1079
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Then I said you can cook for me

1080
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
So I can see you

1081
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
Right?

1082
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Yes

1083
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
Then ask Zijing

1084
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
You just said

1085
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Want to hold a person's heart

1086
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
First, hold his stomach

1087
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
You

1088
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
You agree with this statement, right?

1089
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
I have no ability

1090
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
I don't know how to cook

1091
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
I don't have this kind of understanding

1092
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
But for Yao Zijing

1093
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
He is a natural human being

1094
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
He works in the kitchen every day

1095
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
Why don't I use this food

1096
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,160
To enter this man first?

1097
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Right?

1098
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
Just give him this kind of

1099
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
This kind of environment

1100
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Just grab this opportunity

1101
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
Just use

1102
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,160
So use your own self-adaptation

1103
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,160
To grab Zhu Zhanqi's heart

1104
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,160
Yes

1105
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
Use your own advantage

1106
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
To take this position

1107
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
To do this

1108
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
So a love-hate-hate-hate-hate-hate

1109
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
We learned today

1110
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Is to use your own

1111
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
Ability to show to the other person

1112
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,160
So I think

1113
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
All the viewers of our live broadcast

1114
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Are blessed today

1115
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Because while pursuing

1116
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Actually we also talked about

1117
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
A lot of things that can be used by students

1118
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
Actually, when Yao Zijing

1119
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
Entered the office

1120
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
Zhu Zhanqi seems to have been

1121
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Payed attention to him, right?

1122
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
This film has been like this

1123
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
That can be said to be

1124
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Zhu Zhanqi has been with Yao Zijing all the way

1125
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
From a palace maid to a female poet

1126
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
He grew up to be a good-looking

1127
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,160
Good-looking

1128
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Including a good-looking

1129
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
He witnessed his change

1130
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
So I want to ask

1131
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
Xu Kai

1132
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Is in this role of Zhu Zhanqi

1133
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Or which 17th

1134
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
He liked the most

1135
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
What do you think?

1136
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
I think which 17th

1137
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
Is not important to me

1138
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Because he

1139
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
No matter what career

1140
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
He doesn't have my position

1141
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
So I think he

1142
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
As long as he is in my heart

1143
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,160
This person is good

1144
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
So what he does

1145
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
Is the most in my heart

1146
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Because he is higher than me

1147
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
So I don't care about his position

1148
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
I just see him

1149
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,160
What's going on in front of me

1150
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
So Zijing means

1151
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
No matter if you are a chef

1152
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
He actually likes you

1153
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Because you are not important to him

1154
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Then why did I

1155
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Why did I spend so much time

1156
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
To cook

1157
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
How many episodes have I spent

1158
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
How many episodes have I spent

1159
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,160
I didn't care

1160
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,160
I care about you cooking for me

1161
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
But I don't care about your position

1162
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
OK, the school sister

1163
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
Will be more and more excited

1164
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
I have to remind everyone here

1165
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
Because we, Jingyan and Xu Kai

1166
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
Came to our Yunzhi broadcast room

1167
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
So I brought you a big blessing

1168
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,160
Today not only has Mango TV

1169
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Our annual card

1170
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
The real five-page

1171
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
The super low-end of the annual card

1172
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Will also be specially customized

1173
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
The top-of-the-line card and live broadcast props

1174
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Surprise降 0

1175
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
So the big sister

1176
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
Will bring the top-of-the-line

1177
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Our huge card

1178
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
Will also be equipped with a series

1179
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,160
Super low-end of the sea

00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
Including the baby who is pregnant

00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Will be received by us

1182
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
Kai Kai and Jingyan

1183
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Newly signed sea

1184
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
So what you have to do is

1185
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
Hurry up

1186
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Our interactive page

1187
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
To participate in our

1188
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
OK, so far

1189
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
Just now

1190
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
We talked about

1191
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
Some of the delicious things

1192
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
Today we are at the family banquet

1193
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
Of course we have to record a song

1194
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Although we can't

1195
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
Come to cook at the scene

1196
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
But we can through

1197
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
Another form

1198
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,160
Come to serve you a dish

1199
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
Just now

1200
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
Want to ask our Xu Kai

1201
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
Guess what the dish is

1202
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
I guess it must be that kind of dish

1203
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
Very fragrant

1204
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,160
Then I'm very hungry

1205
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,160
That kind of dish

1206
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Yes, but

1207
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
We can't cook this dish at the scene

1208
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,160
So we have to go through

1209
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
A small interactive way

1210
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
To present the dish to you

1211
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Because everyone knows

1212
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Our this

1213
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
What about Zijing

1214
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Is in this drama

1215
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,160
The dish is very delicate

1216
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
Then first of all

1217
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
We have to ask Jingyan

1218
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
To send out a set of actions

1219
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
Need our Xu Kai

1220
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Through our steps

1221
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,160
To do street magic

1222
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
To all magic

1223
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
The position is considered to be a challenge

1224
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Challenge successful

1225
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Jingyan

1226
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,160
You are going to be punished

1227
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
But the challenge failed

1228
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Just need Xu Kai

1229
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
To be punished

1230
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Don't know if the two are ready

1231
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
Then I'll start

1232
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
To give this street performance

1233
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
To Jingyan first

1234
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,160
OK, it's the action, right?

1235
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,160
OK, very simple

1236
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,160
Look at it

1237
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Look at it

1238
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Like this

1239
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
OK, I'm done

1240
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Challenge failed

1241
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Simple

1242
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
No

1243
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,160
You must be on the scene

1244
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
To imitate

1245
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Just failed

1246
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
I believe you must have

1247
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Remember a few small actions

1248
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,160
For example, the body

1249
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,160
For example, the waist

1250
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
Yes, the first action

1251
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
The second action

1252
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
The third

1253
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
Four

1254
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,160
Five

1255
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
Six

1256
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,160
Seven

1257
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
Eight

1258
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
You're wrong

1259
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
I really can't save you

1260
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Can't save you

1261
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
You're wrong

1262
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
He didn't do it right

1263
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm like this

1264
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
I'm like this

1265
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
You're wrong

1266
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Challenge failed

1267
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
You're punished

1268
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
OK

1269
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
OK, Jingyan

1270
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Do you think he succeeded in the challenge?

1271
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Of course not

1272
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
Xu...

1273
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
I didn't follow the order

1274
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Yes, we failed at the beginning

1275
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
We have to lose after the game

1276
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
OK, let's take a look

1277
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Let's see what kind of fan

1278
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
The most favorite fan

1279
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
Let's go to the props, OK?

1280
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
OK

1281
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,160
Come on

1282
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Xu Kai, you have to continue

1283
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
You can shake it, OK?

1284
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
This is our fan

1285
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
OK, let me tell Jingyan

1286
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
What's the use of it, OK?

1287
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,160
You can shake it, OK?

1288
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Good night

1289
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Good night

1290
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Who said this to you?

1291
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,160
The fans said it, OK?

1292
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
The fans said it to their fans

1293
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,160
It's normal

1294
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
It's normal

1295
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
I can do it

1296
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
You can do it

1297
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
It's normal

1298
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
OK

1299
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
You have to have every version

1300
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Good night

1301
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
What else do you have?

1302
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
Tell me what else do you have?

1303
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Yes

1304
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,160
You have a good voice

1305
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,160
But

1306
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
For example, you are going to sleep

1307
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
For example, baby

1308
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Baby is going to sleep

1309
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Baby

1310
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Baby

1311
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
For example

1312
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Yes, you have to say more

1313
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Don't worry

1314
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
It's a feeling of sleeping

1315
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Because there must be a lot of people

1316
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Who will do a night sleep

1317
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
We can't always do a night sleep

1318
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
OK?

1319
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Add a little bit of feeling

1320
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Good night

1321
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
Sleep

1322
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
This is good

1323
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,160
Good

1324
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
Good

1325
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
Good

1326
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
It's not good to watch live baby

1327
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
Hurry up and put it down

1328
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
And then make our night rain

1329
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
OK?

1330
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,160
Every day, every day

1331
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
It will be more fragrant

1332
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Then please give us a second action

1333
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
OK?

1334
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,160
I remember my death this time

1335
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Let's do it

1336
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
It's a little bit simple, OK?

1337
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Come on

1338
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
Let's start

1339
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Sit down

1340
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Then

1341
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,160
Are you done?

1342
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Yes, it's very simple

1343
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
OK

1344
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Xu Kai, you can definitely hold it

1345
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,160
The heart

1346
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
But Jingyan, you know what?

1347
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
He just did everything for you

1348
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
We, we, Kai Kai

1349
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
How about we

1350
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Do one of our fans, OK?

1351
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
Cute

1352
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
It feels like a channel, OK?

1353
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
OK

1354
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Xu Kai, you did everything

1355
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,160
And finally, there is a very cute expression

1356
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Then this round

1357
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Even if we Xu Kai challenges

1358
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Then we need

1359
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,160
Jingyan to accept punishment

1360
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,160
Then we still need Xu Kai to turn around, OK?

1361
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
Turn our welfare board

1362
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
I'll help you choose one

1363
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
Come on

1364
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Help you choose one

1365
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,160
Help you choose one

1366
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
Choose one

1367
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,160
One, two, three

1368
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,160
It's your turn

1369
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
What did you say about that night rain?

1370
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,160
You scared me

1371
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
I want to listen to the boys

1372
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
The boys are like

1373
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
They are so sleepy

1374
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,160
Boys

1375
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
Because they are sleepy

1376
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,160
They are sleepy

1377
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,160
They are sleepy

1378
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,160
They can't sleep directly

1379
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Why do they have to be sleepy?

1380
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,160
I just slept

1381
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
You are really sleepy

1382
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
You are still sleepy

1383
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
The boys are sleepy

1384
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
They can't sleep

1385
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
I can also tell the sisters

1386
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Right?

1387
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,160
There are many sisters in this live

1388
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
Very good

1389
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Very good

1390
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
Come

1391
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Come

1392
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Recently, you are chasing the good friends of the previous ten

1393
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
You should pay attention to your body

1394
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Don't eat too late

1395
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
You should sleep at night

1396
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
OK?

1397
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
OK, get on the bed

1398
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Good night

1399
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
You are good at speaking

1400
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Next time

1401
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,160
I'll be back

1402
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,160
You are good at speaking

1403
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,160
Next time, you can't say it

1404
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
You are very official

1405
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
I just changed it

1406
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
The second version, come

1407
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Come

1408
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,160
OK, don't watch the show

1409
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Watch it again

1410
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Good night

1411
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
OK, both of you have a wonderful performance

1412
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,160
Because they tell you that the show is very beautiful

1413
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,160
But don't be too noisy

1414
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
OK?

1415
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
You should pay attention to your rest

1416
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,160
OK, tell you

1417
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
We are at home today

1418
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
And there are many good friends

1419
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
Actually, they also sent some blessings

1420
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
Their heart also came to the scene

1421
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
Let's give some blessings

1422
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Let the two of you take a look, OK?

1423
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
Let's see which of the friends

1424
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,160
sent the blessings

1425
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
I just want to see how Feng Tian introduces

1426
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
I don't know

1427
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Why don't you say it?

1428
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,160
He is hiding something

1429
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
He is hiding something

1430
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Yes, yes, yes

1431
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,160
Yes, yes, yes

1432
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Of course

1433
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Of course

1434
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
I will ask you a simple question

1435
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
If your comments are good

1436
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
I will also ask you a simple question

1437
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
If your comments and pig's feet

1438
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
fall into the water at the same time

1439
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Who will you save?

1440
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
You don't know

1441
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
In the play

1442
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
When Yin Ziping always

1443
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
went to upgrade his dream

1444
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
When he was playing the game

1445
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
His purple gold is next to him

1446
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
He has no limits

1447
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,160
His love

1448
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,160
So in front of love

1449
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
There is love, indeed

1450
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Not worth mentioning

1451
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Did you say Teacher Xu?

1452
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
I said it

1453
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Ping Ping is also my love

1454
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Yes, Teacher Xu has your school

1455
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
school's launch

1456
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
That is, the school will be in the school

1457
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
And then I

1458
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
I heard Teacher Xu

1459
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
A more magical school student

1460
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
I can't help it

1461
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
I will laugh with him

1462
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Including that teacher Wu

1463
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Teacher Wu's hair

1464
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
It's too heavy

1465
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
So he

1466
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,160
The hair is falling down

1467
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
It will fall down every time

1468
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
So at this time

1469
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Teacher Xu on the stage

1470
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
Will laugh at him

1471
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,160
And then I can't help it

1472
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
I will also laugh with him

1473
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,160
I saw some good friends

1474
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,160
Actually, you are in a good mood

1475
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,160
Are you happy?

1476
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
But you have some

1477
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
Small rabbit grass

1478
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,160
As this

1479
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
This teacher

1480
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
Do you want to respond a little?

1481
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,160
Because I was talking about the play

1482
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,160
Only Feng Tian said

1483
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,160
I laugh at the machine

1484
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
The magic school student

1485
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
You are too magic school student

1486
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
Because there are a few scenes

1487
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Really

1488
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
I am usually very serious

1489
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
But there are a few scenes

1490
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Really funny

1491
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,160
So I will laugh at the scene

1492
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
There is a scene

1493
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
There is a scene

1494
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,160
Where the maid

1495
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
Will defeat us

1496
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
But everyone in that dress is very long

1497
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
So when she gets up

1498
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
I took off her skirt

1499
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Then she took off her skirt

1500
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
So run

1501
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Then I really can't bear it

1502
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,160
That kind of magic school student

1503
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
Is very self-reliant

1504
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,160
If you perform on the scene

1505
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,160
It's because you can't show the school student

1506
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Right

1507
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
I haven't been on the scene

1508
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
Naturally

1509
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,160
Then ask this Zijing

1510
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,160
Just now, Jingyan

1511
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Just now, Pingping said

1512
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
If Pingping and Zhu Zhanji

1513
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,160
Fall into the water at the same time

1514
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
Who will you save?

1515
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Do you want to respond to the scene?

1516
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,160
Love and love

1517
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
Of course I will Pingping first

1518
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
Of course I will Pingping first

1519
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Pingping is a little

1520
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
I need my wine

1521
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,160
Zhu Zhanji

1522
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
He will fly anything

1523
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,160
No, he won't

1524
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,160
I believe

1525
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,160
You will forget

1526
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
You will fly

1527
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,160
I've seen it all

1528
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,160
When you were on the scene

1529
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
There was a scene

1530
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
He will dance

1531
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,160
He will play these dances

1532
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Artistic genius

1533
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Artistic genius

1534
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,160
Yes

1535
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Hum

1536
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
A genius, okay?

1537
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
So your answer is Pingping

1538
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,160
I want to save Pingping

1539
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
Yes, take Pingping

1540
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
He can't do it himself

1541
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,160
Need me

1542
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,160
So actually Zijing

1543
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
Still very considerate

1544
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
Because I believe

1545
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
If Zijing has a problem

1546
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
Zhu Zhanji will save him

1547
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
So this is the emotional line

1548
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Okay?

1549
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,160
Everyone follows up

1550
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
Thank you for your blessings

1551
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
I believe

1552
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Our Jingyan and Xu Kai

1553
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
Have been accepted

1554
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
Then next

1555
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,160
Our dishes are also ready

1556
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
Then we'll start

1557
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
Let's have a cup of tea while we eat

1558
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,160
What are you eating?

1559
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
Try this

1560
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
This is good

1561
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Yes, yes, yes

1562
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
I can

1563
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Then I'll ask Zijing

1564
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,160
And ask Zhu Zhanji

1565
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
In this kind of role

1566
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Think about it

1567
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,160
The two of you are in parallel space

1568
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,160
What kind of life do you think

1569
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,160
The big play will be?

1570
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Has anyone thought about it?

1571
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,160
Wait a minute

1572
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
I'll have a taste first

1573
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
Come on, Jingyan

1574
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
What are you eating?

1575
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
It feels good

1576
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
They are

1577
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Very sweet

1578
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,160
I think they will be happy

1579
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,160
Very happy

1580
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
Then

1581
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
Sweet and sour

1582
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
Then in the palace

1583
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,160
I cook for you

1584
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,160
You give me a piece of paper

1585
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,160
You sing the kind of

1586
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Very beautiful

1587
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,160
The kind of life of fairy-tale

1588
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,160
The kind of life that makes people envy

1589
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,160
The kind of life after marriage

1590
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,160
That's it

1591
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,160
After marriage

1592
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
You know it again, right?

1593
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,160
No, no, no

1594
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,160
This is a big play that I think about

1595
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,160
It's okay

1596
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Okay, okay

1597
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,160
It's a big play that you imagine, right?

1598
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
It's very, very happy

1599
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
What kind of man and woman

1600
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
What kind of cooking

1601
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,160
I'll make it

1602
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
I pick water for you to pick

1603
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
That's not going to happen

1604
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,960
Zhu Zhanji is very

1605
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,160
Very sleepy

1606
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
Man and woman

1607
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
Yes

1608
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,160
There's a group of people behind you

1609
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,160
To pick up for you, right?

1610
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
I think it's

1611
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,160
In the book

1612
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
I read the book

1613
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
You make paintings

1614
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Then I play the piano

1615
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,160
You play the violin

1616
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
Then I can always eat

1617
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,160
What you do is delicious

1618
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Then I take you to the sea of ​​waves

1619
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Your

1620
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Yes, give me

1621
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Almost the same as me

1622
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
A series

1623
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Yes

1624
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
A series

1625
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,160
That's because the two of them

1626
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
In the drama

1627
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,160
So this big play

1628
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,160
Is usually like this

1629
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
It's all more sweet, right?

1630
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
But what about the big play

1631
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160
We can only know it by ourselves

1632
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,160
I hope there's also such a beautiful big play

1633
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,160
That's the second question

1634
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
It's also what fans want to know

1635
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,160
If you can spend a day with the other person

1636
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,160
In the real life

1637
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
What do you think

1638
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,160
I'm in Xu Kai's life

1639
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Or am I in Zhu Zhanji's life

1640
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,160
Zhu Zhanji appeared in your life

1641
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,160
In our 21st century

1642
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Oh, that's it

1643
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,160
You lost your foot

1644
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,160
21st century

1645
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
2022

1646
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
2022

1647
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,160
Really

1648
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,160
I'm clear

1649
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,160
I'm clear

1650
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,160
You're dancing

1651
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,160
This is good

1652
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,160
Congratulations

1653
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
I don't know if you guys

1654
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,160
Have you heard our voice

1655
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,160
Actually

1656
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,160
It's a hidden welfare part

1657
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,160
In our live broadcast

1658
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,160
In the process of the broadcast

1659
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,160
As long as the two of you

1660
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,160
Speak to our welfare audience

1661
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
Will trigger our welfare mechanism

1662
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
So congratulations

1663
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,160
The two members of this round

1664
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
Or welfare friends

1665
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,160
So the most important thing is

1666
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
Already shared in our screen

1667
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,160
Show up

1668
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,160
Congratulations

1669
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,160
Oh

1670
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
It's fun

1671
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,160
It's so fun

1672
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,160
It's so fun

1673
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,160
I think Zhu Zhanji will be very happy

1674
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,160
He should be

1675
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,160
It's like opening his eyes

1676
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
Then

1677
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,160
How did you spend this day with him

1678
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,160
What about you

1679
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,160
Play with him

1680
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
Eat with him

1681
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
Eat that

1682
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,160
We're eating something now

1683
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
Then

1684
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,160
I'll take him to the bridge

1685
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,160
What's that

1686
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
I'll take you to make a hairstyle

1687
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
Take off your head

1688
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,160
But your hair

1689
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,160
It's very important

1690
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,160
Take off your head

1691
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,160
Yes

1692
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
Take off your head

1693
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,160
Take off your hair

1694
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,160
And eat something

1695
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,160
I think Zhu Zhanji is so happy

1696
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,160
It should be the happiest day in his life

1697
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,160
Because it's not that

1698
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
When the emperor is very tired

1699
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
But back to the present

1700
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,160
Your hair will feel fresh and refreshing

1701
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,160
Xu Kai has thought about it

1702
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,160
I was killed by my grandfather

1703
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Maybe you don't want to go back

1704
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,160
I

1705
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,160
Then I will definitely bring

1706
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,160
Zijing

1707
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,160
Going to the hotel

1708
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,160
Come to the hotel for a day

1709
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
I'll show him

1710
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
He lives in Zhu Zhanji's place

1711
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,160
Let him come to the hotel

1712
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,160
This is also my place

1713
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,160
It's the same scene as me

1714
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,160
Let you feel it

1715
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,160
It's not the same

1716
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,160
But the character is different

1717
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
Different generation

1718
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,160
Yes

1719
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,160
It feels like home

1720
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,160
But

1721
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,160
Your face is not Zhu Zhanji

1722
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
That's Xu Kai

1723
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
I found that Xu Kai

1724
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,160
It feels more powerful in the scene

1725
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,160
It's all the place he's standing

1726
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,160
You can go to Ming Dynasty

1727
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,160
You can go to Song Dynasty

1728
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Which place

1729
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,160
Which dynasty

1730
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,160
What is it

1731
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,160
What kind of palace

1732
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,160
What kind of public palace

1733
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,160
That kind of

1734
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,160
Take you to a lorry

1735
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Go to the park

1736
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,160
Dreaming of a tiger

1737
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,160
I think it's a good thing to know

1738
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
Is there a lorry exchange?

1739
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,160
Ten years but you play the lorry

1740
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,160
OK

1741
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,160
I played an ad

1742
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,160
But you play the lorry

1743
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,160
Thank you Xu Kai

1744
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,160
For the support of the lorry

1745
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,160
The support of the lorry

1746
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,160
I'm so touched

1747
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,160
I just talked about it

1748
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,160
I'm very happy

1749
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,160
What we just received

1750
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,160
Everyone took a name

1751
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,160
Golden Flower

1752
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,160
You think

1753
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
This kind of cp

1754
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
What is the different place

1755
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
In the cp combination

1756
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
Or do you think

1757
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,160
What kind of

1758
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
What kind of contact model are you

1759
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,160
I think they are

1760
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,160
The cp of high IQ

1761
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,160
Very good

1762
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,160
And it's all that

1763
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,160
Pulling up the master

1764
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,160
Pulling up the station

1765
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,160
That's too big

1766
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,160
Just the cp of the cp of the pk battle

1767
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,160
It's a feeling of high-ranking teams

1768
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,160
So how do you look cool

1769
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,160
Where is Xu Kai

1770
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
Yes, actually, like Jingyan said

1771
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,160
It's like a male and a female gun

1772
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
Then a strong hand

1773
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,160
Both accompany and support each other

1774
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,160
Both grow

1775
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,160
I think the mode of love

1776
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,160
If you want to stay long

1777
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,160
It should be like this

1778
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
The feeling of riding the opponent

1779
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,160
So the more you go over it

1780
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
I think the more you wear it

1781
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,160
Feel right

1782
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,160
OK

1783
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,160
I'm going to watch a lot of fans

1784
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,160
Baby ask Jingyan

1785
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,160
This is a drama

1786
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
It's a professional food team

1787
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
Produced and shot

1788
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,160
Is there in the process of shooting

1789
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,160
In order to fit the character

1790
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,160
Control your own figure

1791
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
But when I was in the top

1792
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,160
It's the most thin one in the last few years

1793
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,160
Because before the opening

1794
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,160
I specially cut

1795
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,160
Probably cut down 5 or 6 jin

1796
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
Just the character that was thinner than before

1797
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,160
Yao Zijun's identity

1798
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,160
I think the reason for his identity

1799
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,160
I don't think he should be too round

1800
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,160
Or just on the weight

1801
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,160
And then on the makeup

1802
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,160
It's the same as Mr. Zhao Xin

1803
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,160
The whole eye and lipstick

1804
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,160
It's very bold

1805
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,160
Almost a lie

1806
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,160
I'm going to put on my makeup

1807
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,160
The part in the upper room

1808
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,160
He's a

1809
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,160
Just a maid

1810
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Cooking in the kitchen

1811
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
He's in charge of the position

1812
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,160
He's in charge of the body

1813
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,160
It's good for this person to look

1814
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,160
It's a little bit of a fruit and sales

1815
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
It's a little bit of a decision

1816
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,160
I also add a little bit of this problem

1817
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
I'm also acting for the role

1818
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,160
Because the role of Zhu Zhanji

1819
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
Can't be too sales

1820
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,160
Because of his body environment

1821
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,720
My

1822
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,160
It's just to be a little bit more flexible

1823
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,160
Okay

1824
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,160
Then the scene was a little bit of a shock

1825
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,160
Okay

1826
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,160
What was the most thin at the time

1827
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,160
What was the degree

1828
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,160
How many jin

1829
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
You just said the thinnest

1830
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
I usually cut 95 jin

1831
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,160
When I first started

1832
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,160
I cut it to 8

1833
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,160
I'm not wrong

1834
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
We usually don't have that much weight

1835
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,160
90 jin

1836
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,160
And when I first started

1837
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,160
I cut it to 85 or 65 jin

1838
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,160
More than 65 jin

1839
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,160
Then there was no weight

1840
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,160
Because it was too cold in the winter

1841
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,160
And then the body

1842
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,160
It's also getting better

1843
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,160
And then slowly

1844
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,160
Get up

1845
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,160
It's a little bit of a fat

1846
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,160
This scene

1847
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,160
Actually, it's a hard work, right?

1848
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,160
I just said

1849
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160
Because there are a lot of food inside

1850
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,160
The props inside should be very attractive

1851
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,160
Who is the props answerer

1852
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,160
The two

1853
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,160
Of course it's him

1854
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,160
I didn't eat anything

1855
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,160
I made it for him

1856
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:22,160
I saw him eating next to him

1857
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,160
I saw him eating

1858
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,160
Is it delicious

1859
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
I always eat hot pot

1860
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,160
I let them eat it

1861
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,160
I got some food from the scene

1862
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,160
I haven't started to shoot

1863
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
I really eat

1864
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Really

1865
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
Really

1866
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,160
Really eat

1867
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,160
Really eat

1868
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,160
Then hot pot

1869
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,160
Will it be eaten

1870
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,160
There will be a little bit of a seed on the next day

1871
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,160
Is it a combination character

1872
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,160
In order to be a character

1873
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,160
The identity and character of the character

1874
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
Yes, Huang Taicun

1875
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,160
Then go to the emperor

1876
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,160
This feeling

1877
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,160
Also did a lot of work

1878
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,160
Yes

1879
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,160
I've done a lot

1880
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,160
Just for the sake

1881
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,160
I've done a lot

1882
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,160
Yes

1883
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Then ask Zijin

1884
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
In the drama

1885
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,160
Zhu Zhanji and You Yifan

1886
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Who is better

1887
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,160
I can't say who is here

1888
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,160
Of course it's Zhu Zhanji

1889
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,160
The world's first bad guy

1890
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,160
The man who is the best

1891
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,160
Every woman loves that kind of person

1892
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,160
No one else

1893
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,160
What do you think

1894
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,160
What does he look like

1895
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,160
What does he look like

1896
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
A body

1897
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,160
The most attractive thing about Zhu Zhanji

1898
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,160
Is Xu Kaiyan's card

1899
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,160
No words

1900
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,160
You said it yourself

1901
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,160
Really

1902
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,160
Very sweet

1903
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,160
Very happy

1904
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,160
Sour candy on the spot

1905
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,160
In reality

1906
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,160
If you meet these two types of men

1907
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,160
Who do you think will be more welcomed

1908
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
In real life

1909
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,160
Of course Zhu Zhanji

1910
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,160
In the drama

1911
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,160
Yao Zijin has no motivation

1912
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,160
There is a kind of

1913
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,160
Half point to You Yifan

1914
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,160
Is it a consideration

1915
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,160
How to say

1916
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,160
Never have

1917
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,160
A heart to say

1918
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,160
Of course

1919
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,160
And there is a scene

1920
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,160
Who do you choose

1921
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,160
Of course I choose

1922
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,160
Yes

1923
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,160
Zhu Zhanji

1924
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,160
You Yifan is a treasure

1925
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,160
Which one do you choose

1926
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,160
Because he has a few girls

1927
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,160
Just lack of security

1928
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,160
Will feel that

1929
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
People who can protect

1930
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,160
Will also like it

1931
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,160
Because it's perfect

1932
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,160
I don't think it's good

1933
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,160
Only say a lot of girls

1934
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,160
I don't think it's good

1935
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
Come to ask Yao Zijin

1936
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,160
Through the touch

1937
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,160
This skill

1938
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,160
The peak of the career

1939
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,160
Can you tell me

1940
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,160
Yao Zijin became a top

1941
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,160
What difficulties did you encounter

1942
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
Including how to solve

1943
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,160
Your workplace crisis

1944
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,160
There are many people who have workplace crisis

1945
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,160
You don't want Yao Zijin to be good

1946
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,160
Will have

1947
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,160
It's like this

1948
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,160
It's very tough

1949
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:49,160
The experience of the workplace

1950
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,160
Anyway, he is

1951
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,160
After entering the palace

1952
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,160
He likes his eyes

1953
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,160
He is not

1954
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,160
Who to rely on

1955
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,160
Or who not rely on

1956
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
Just fight alone

1957
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
The most important thing is

1958
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,160
It depends on your ability

1959
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,160
It's his job

1960
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,160
Do this thing

1961
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,160
Naturally, there will be a chance later

1962
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,160
Someone will appreciate him

1963
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,160
You see, it's also because of this skill

1964
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,160
Get close to the workplace

1965
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
So do your own work

1966
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,160
Do it well

1967
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,160
This is very important

1968
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
It depends on your ability

1969
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,160
Just do one thing

1970
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Make him do it

1971
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,160
Will be less

1972
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,160
Will be discovered

1973
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,160
Yes

1974
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,160
He is doing things

1975
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,160
He is doing things

1976
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,160
Then make you do it

1977
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,160
BG is called a person

1978
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,160
It's like the script itself, okay

1979
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,160
I think this is the point

1980
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,160
So you can

1981
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,160
All of this is such a good reason

1982
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,160
Then ask Xu Kai

1983
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Which one of the characters

1984
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
You think you played

1985
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,160
Which one is the most suitable for marriage

1986
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,160
I think every one is suitable for marriage

1987
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,160
I think this should be asked

1988
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,160
Which one is more suitable for marriage

1989
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,160
The audience should think

1990
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,160
Which one is more suitable for marriage

1991
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,160
Right

1992
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,160
Come on

1993
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,160
Our fairies, come up

1994
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,160
Our fans

1995
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,160
Which one is the most suitable for marriage

1996
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,160
Which one is the most suitable for marriage

1997
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,160
If you ask Ji Yan

1998
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,160
We will definitely think

1999
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,160
Zhu Zhanji is the most suitable for marriage

2000
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,160
Do you agree

2001
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,160
He played

2002
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,160
Kai's eyes are very good

2003
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,160
I think it's all

2004
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,160
That one

2005
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,160
Every one of his own characteristics

2006
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,160
All of his own characteristics

2007
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,160
All of them are very good

2008
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,160
Very good

2009
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,160
All perfect

2010
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,160
Perfect

2011
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,160
All of them will be liked by people

2012
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,160
Then the main characters in the drama

2013
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,160
And Yao Zijing

2014
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,160
Often communicate through words

2015
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,160
There are many such pictures

2016
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:30,160
Right

2017
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,160
Then you can draw a new character

2018
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,160
of the two of you, okay

2019
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,160
Be a fan of the fans

2020
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,160
A fan

2021
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,160
Let's see what this soul is drawing

2022
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,160
Come on

2023
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,160
Let's go to the props

2024
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,160
Okay

2025
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,160
Come on, we're ready

2026
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,160
Thank you

2027
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,160
Okay

2028
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,160
You don't need to draw

2029
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,160
Then I won't draw

2030
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,160
You draw

2031
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,160
I won't draw

2032
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,160
Then you can do this

2033
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,160
Because

2034
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,160
Xu Kai needs to draw with Ji Yan now

2035
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,160
To draw Ji Yan's portrait

2036
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,160
I think Ji Yan

2037
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,160
You can give him some tips

2038
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,160
Or just

2039
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,160
He draws Zijing's feeling

2040
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,160
So I think you can give him some

2041
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,160
My tips are completely

2042
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,160
Unable to affect the soul

2043
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,160
I'm very sorry

2044
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,160
What kind of me is he

2045
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,160
Can't go to that

2046
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,160
To interfere with him

2047
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,160
Yes

2048
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,160
It's like this

2049
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,160
The genius painter is born like this

2050
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,160
You don't draw

2051
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,160
I don't draw

2052
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,160
I wait for you to draw

2053
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,160
He should draw a mouth

2054
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,160
Or a hair cut

2055
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Or a head

2056
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,160
I want to draw a very high one

2057
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,160
And wear that skirt

2058
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,160
I think you can imagine

2059
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,160
You think too much

2060
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,160
This is not

2061
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
Or

2062
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
I think

2063
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,160
Did you draw both of them

2064
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,160
Or just one

2065
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,160
He and I

2066
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,160
The soul painter

2067
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,160
The soul painter

2068
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,160
Can only be the genius painter

2069
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,160
The genius painter

2070
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Can only be the

2071
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,160
Just exhibition

2072
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,160
I can't see

2073
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,160
Can't see

2074
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,160
I can't see

2075
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,160
We recommend

2076
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,160
This is Zijing

2077
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,160
This is me

2078
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,160
How to say

2079
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,160
Can you give a big punch

2080
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,160
Can you show it

2081
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,160
You can see it very clearly

2082
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
This is a house, right

2083
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,160
There are many holes in his head

2084
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,160
There are various houses on that head

2085
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,160
So this is Zijing

2086
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,160
I

2087
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,160
This hat is not well drawn

2088
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,160
It's that kind of

2089
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,160
Clothes

2090
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,160
So you caught his gold

2091
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,160
It's a hat

2092
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,160
Head

2093
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,160
Yes, I won't draw anything else

2094
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,160
Other things feel like eyes, nose

2095
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,160
Including this hand and feet

2096
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,160
Actually are almost

2097
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,160
Because they are all high-end

2098
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,160
Yes, this is very high

2099
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,160
Well

2100
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,160
This is our Xu Kai

2101
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,160
Can you draw on the scene

2102
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,160
Sign your name, okay

2103
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,160
It's a blessing for our fans

2104
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,160
Because we just said

2105
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,160
There will be a lot of blessings for everyone today

2106
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,160
Such a soul painter

2107
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,160
Can

2108
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,160
Good

2109
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,160
Thank you, thank you, Xu Kai

2110
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,160
Come to draw

2111
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,160
That's really

2112
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,160
18.5 billion

2113
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,160
Okay, come on

2114
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,160
Please burn it later

2115
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,160
No, no, no

2116
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,160
We will be too ugly

2117
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,160
We will definitely hide it

2118
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,160
Then help our fans

2119
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,160
Baby, ask Xu Kai

2120
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,160
Just asked when did you post the vlog

2121
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:35,160
But your answer is

2122
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,160
These two days

2123
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,160
Then please ask

2124
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,160
Which day is these two days

2125
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,160
I just wanted to say these two days

2126
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,160
Then in two days

2127
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,160
It will be very fast in two days

2128
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,160
Yes

2129
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,160
It will be very fast

2130
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,160
Already prepared

2131
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,160
Just two days later

2132
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,160
Will be published

2133
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
Look forward to everyone

2134
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,160
The kind that lasts for more than ten minutes

2135
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,160
Let me tell you

2136
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,160
It looks very useful

2137
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,160
Ten minutes of editing

2138
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,160
If everyone comes together

2139
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,160
Let's monitor Xu Kai, okay

2140
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,160
If you look at our live broadcast

2141
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,160
Be sure to go and see

2142
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,160
Did you post a vlog

2143
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,160
I hope our Xu Kai can do more business

2144
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,160
Give more fans more benefits

2145
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,160
Okay, thank you for sharing

2146
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,160
Then since the beginning of the last time

2147
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,160
I have received many fans' attention and love

2148
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,160
Today they have been our

2149
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,160
Yunbing guest

2150
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,160
We are participating in our home broadcast

2151
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,160
Then continue at this time

2152
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,160
Let's follow our

2153
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,160
Watch our live broadcast

2154
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,160
Let's have a cup together

2155
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,160
I also hope that everyone

2156
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,160
The air is coming in

2157
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,160
Come in next time

2158
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,160
The air is coming in

2159
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,160
I hope everyone can like it more

2160
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,160
The last time, okay

2161
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,160
I will chase it up

2162
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,160
I must chase it up

2163
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Next is the time when we are very sweet

2164
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,160
It's called the sweet time of the banquet

2165
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,160
Just drank water

2166
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,160
I definitely want to eat something

2167
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:57,160
We will enter an interesting part

2168
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,160
We will taste five kinds of candy once a year

2169
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,160
What Xu Kai needs to do is

2170
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,160
Guess what kind of candy he eats

2171
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,160
Let's show you

2172
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,160
Which kinds of candy

2173
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,160
Our five candy

2174
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,160
Already

2175
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,160
What's wrong with you

2176
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,160
You want to give a reaction

2177
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,160
No

2178
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,160
I'm also delaying

2179
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,160
Our props are already up

2180
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,160
We just said that there are five kinds of candy

2181
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,160
Among them, there is lemon candy

2182
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,160
There is durian soft candy

2183
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,160
There is跳跳 candy

2184
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,160
There is air candy

2185
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,160
There is also a lotus candy

2186
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,160
Air candy is actually nothing inside

2187
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,160
Just want to perform without food

2188
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,160
So this has a little bit of a test

2189
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,160
To our Jingyan

2190
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,160
Jingyan needs to rely on your acting, okay

2191
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,160
It's too difficult

2192
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,160
If Xu Kai guesses any one of them

2193
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,160
Jingyan can choose one for him

2194
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,160
Let him eat it immediately

2195
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,160
Okay

2196
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,160
If Jingyan is ready

2197
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,160
Let's start

2198
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,160
Okay

2199
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,160
One more

2200
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,160
One by one

2201
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Then Xu Kai needs to close his eyes

2202
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,160
No

2203
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,160
Two

2204
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,160
Two

2205
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,160
Okay

2206
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,160
I'll close my eyes when I eat

2207
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,160
Okay

2208
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,160
I'll close my eyes when I eat

2209
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,160
Okay

2210
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,160
I can finally eat

2211
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,160
Okay

2212
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,160
Okay

2213
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,160
All the audience will know

2214
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,160
It looks delicious

2215
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,160
Okay

2216
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,160
Okay, start

2217
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,160
Okay, Xu Kai, please open your eyes

2218
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,160
What expression

2219
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,160
Why are you so hard

2220
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,160
I'm scared

2221
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,160
I'm scared

2222
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,160
I'm scared

2223
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,160
You're scared

2224
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,160
You want to lie to me

2225
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,160
You can say anything

2226
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,160
You want to say I'm a liar

2227
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,160
I'm very good to you

2228
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,160
I'm close

2229
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,160
It must be

2230
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,160
What's the name of the sweet candy

2231
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,160
Sweet

2232
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,160
Sweet

2233
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,160
Is it cotton candy?

2234
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:57,160
Okay, the last answer you give is

2235
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,160
Three, two, one

2236
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,160
Cotton candy

2237
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,160
You are

2238
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,160
I'm so nervous

2239
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,160
Jingyan

2240
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,160
The last answer Xu Kai gave is

2241
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,160
Cotton candy

2242
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,160
Don't you believe me

2243
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,160
Do you believe me

2244
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,160
I thought you were lying to me

2245
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,160
Are you really a sugar-coated person

2246
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,160
The real one

2247
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,160
You swear

2248
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,160
You're really a sugar-coated person

2249
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,160
I'm really a sugar-coated person

2250
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,160
I said it's a cotton candy

2251
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,160
You don't believe me

2252
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,160
Jingyan, you're so sincere

2253
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,160
Why do you think Xu Kai is a cotton candy

2254
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,160
Why

2255
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,160
I'm a big fan

2256
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,160
I'm a big fan

2257
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,160
I'm crying

2258
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,160
The first one is a challenge

2259
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,160
Okay, Jingyan

2260
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,160
You can pick a candy

2261
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,160
Let Xu Kai eat it

2262
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,160
You can pick a candy

2263
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Let me peel the straw too

2264
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,160
Yes, peel the straw

2265
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,160
Pick a candy

2266
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,160
Here

2267
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,160
You can feel it

2268
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,160
It's the favorite candy we've ever had

2269
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,160
I haven't had it for a long time

2270
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,160
It's delicious

2271
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,160
Really

2272
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,160
Yes, it should be delicious

2273
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,160
This is a punishment

2274
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,160
I don't believe it

2275
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,160
I think so too

2276
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,160
But there's no way

2277
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,160
Jingyan is a sugar-coated person

2278
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,160
Look

2279
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,160
He doesn't believe me

2280
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,160
He doesn't believe this candy

2281
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,160
It's a candy for Xu Kai

2282
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,160
It's a candy for Xu Kai

2283
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,160
It feels like music

2284
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,160
It's so good

2285
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,160
It's so good

2286
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,160
I can hear the sound

2287
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:29,160
I can smell it

2288
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:30,160
It's so bad

2289
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,160
What's it

2290
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,160
It's so good

2291
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,160
But it doesn't have strawberry flavor

2292
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,160
But it's the feeling of the candy

2293
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,160
It's very strong

2294
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,160
I think it's bigger

2295
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,160
It's much bigger than you think

2296
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,160
You only ate a piece

2297
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,160
It's half-cooked

2298
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:48,160
I ate half a bag of candy

2299
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,160
You just don't believe me

2300
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,160
There's no way

2301
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,160
You can't eat more

2302
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,160
I don't know

2303
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:57,160
Xu Kai's next challenge

2304
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,160
Let's see if you believe Jingyan

2305
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,160
Okay

2306
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,160
If you're ready

2307
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,160
Close your eyes

2308
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,160
Tian Hei, close your eyes

2309
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,160
I'm sure you'll believe this time

2310
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:06,160
Come on

2311
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,160
Come on

2312
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,160
Don't trust me

2313
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,160
Jingyan is sincere for the first time

2314
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,160
Be sincere

2315
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
Let's see what the second time

2316
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,160
is like

2317
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,160
I'm a person who doesn't deserve to believe

2318
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,160
I'm sure you'll believe this time

2319
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,160
Come on

2320
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
How can you play this?

2321
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,160
This thing

2322
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,160
This is also very difficult

2323
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,160
This is my punishment

2324
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,160
You're lying

2325
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,160
Really

2326
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,160
Let's see what Jingyan will say

2327
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,160
I'll give you candy

2328
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,160
I'll give Xu Kai candy

2329
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,160
I'm thinking about it

2330
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,160
Don't move

2331
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,160
I'll find something

2332
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,160
Okay

2333
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,160
Think about it

2334
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,160
Give me that

2335
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,160
Okay, I got it

2336
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,160
Yes, give me this

2337
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,160
I found it

2338
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,160
I can help my material

2339
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,160
Then open your eyes

2340
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:54,160
Okay

2341
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,160
Xu Kai, open your eyes

2342
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:58,160
Okay

2343
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,160
Open this

2344
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,160
You want to lie to me again?

2345
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:06,160
Lying

2346
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,160
You're

2347
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,160
You said it was sincere

2348
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,160
This thing

2349
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,160
The thing that's inside of it

2350
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,160
I was thinking about saying cotton candy

2351
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,160
Do you believe it?

2352
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,160
Do you believe it?

2353
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,160
Is it really cotton candy?

2354
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,160
Think about it

2355
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,160
I think you don't trust me anymore

2356
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,160
Don't you trust me?

2357
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:26,160
No

2358
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,160
I'm just concerned about you

2359
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,160
Confirm it

2360
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,160
Do you really believe it?

2361
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,160
I believe it

2362
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,160
You really believe me

2363
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,160
You're thinking about it

2364
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,160
I don't believe you

2365
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,160
Cotton candy

2366
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:38,160
The answer is

2367
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,160
Cotton candy

2368
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,160
It's a brother

2369
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,160
It's a brother

2370
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,160
It's a friend

2371
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,160
You're really good at it

2372
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,160
Okay, the first time

2373
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,160
The second time

2374
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
The first time I didn't guess right

2375
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,160
The second time I guessed right

2376
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,160
That's a good word

2377
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,160
Xu Kai guessed right

2378
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,160
The third time

2379
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,160
We'll do it

2380
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:04,160
A real

2381
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,160
Actress, okay?

2382
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,160
Don't give any hint

2383
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,160
How about it?

2384
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,160
Okay, take my props

2385
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,160
Take my straw

2386
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,160
Take my props

2387
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,160
Come on

2388
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,160
The third one

2389
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,160
Okay, the third one

2390
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,160
I really don't want to eat this

2391
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,160
I'm a little scared of this taste

2392
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,160
But it's really my punishment

2393
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,160
Oh my god, you'll also come to a round later

2394
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,160
This taste

2395
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:27,160
You eat it

2396
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:30,160
You eat it

2397
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,160
This is cotton candy

2398
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,160
I hate this taste the most

2399
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,160
I really don't like this taste

2400
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:38,160
I don't like it, I give up

2401
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,160
This is my punishment

2402
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,160
Because cotton candy is like stinky tofu

2403
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,160
Some people like it

2404
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,160
Then they really like it

2405
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,160
Yes

2406
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,160
This taste is bigger than fruit

2407
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,160
It's the cotton candy

2408
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:50,160
I'm so fierce in this cotton candy

2409
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,160
How about this?

2410
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,160
How about you

2411
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,160
Come to the stage to show a

2412
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,160
Let's guess the word

2413
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,160
Okay

2414
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,160
Close your eyes

2415
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,160
Okay

2416
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,160
It's also like a punishment

2417
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,160
Okay?

2418
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,160
Look

2419
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,160
How do you treat the rock-paper-scissors

2420
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:03,160
How do you treat the cotton candy

2421
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,160
Let's take a look

2422
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,160
I'm eating

2423
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,160
What are you eating?

2424
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,160
What are you eating?

2425
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,160
What is this?

2426
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,160
I hate you

2427
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,160
I don't believe you

2428
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:26,160
I don't believe her, she ate it

2429
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,160
I think it's like air

2430
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,160
Tiao Xiao Tang

2431
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,160
Nihong candy

2432
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,160
Okay, the last one

2433
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:39,160
The answer we gave Jingyan

2434
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,160
Is 321

2435
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,160
Nihong candy

2436
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,160
Congratulations, Jingyan

2437
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,160
You ate a Nihong candy

2438
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,160
Is it sour?

2439
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,160
No, it's air candy

2440
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,160
You're wrong

2441
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,160
You ate a Nihong candy

2442
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,160
I can tell you

2443
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,160
I believe my first intuition

2444
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,160
I think she didn't eat it

2445
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,160
It's air candy

2446
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,160
You should not believe it

2447
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,160
You tried Nihong candy

2448
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,160
Do you know?

2449
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,160
I tried Nihong candy

2450
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,160
I ate a candy that I told you

2451
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,160
It's sweet

2452
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,160
I also ate a Nihong candy

2453
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:10,160
So sweet

2454
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,160
It's too sweet

2455
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,160
Do you think it's sweet?

2456
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,160
This candy

2457
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,160
Please sweet, she's so proud

2458
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,160
It's sweet

2459
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,160
A candy that was sweetest in 2002

2460
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,160
Sweetest in 2002

2461
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:24,160
You're laughing at me

2462
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,160
Congratulations

2463
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:28,160
Did you hear our voices?

2464
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,160
Actually, it's a hidden welfare part

2465
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,160
In our live broadcast

2466
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,160
As long as the two of you

2467
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,160
Speak to our welfare officials

2468
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:36,160
Will trigger our welfare mechanism

2469
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,160
So congratulations

2470
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,160
To the two members of this round

2471
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:40,160
Or welfare friends

2472
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:43,160
You will get Xu Kai and Wu Jin Yan's signature

2473
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,160
So the most important details

2474
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,160
Has been shown in our screen below

2475
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,160
Congratulations

2476
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,160
Thank you, Jin Yan

2477
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,160
And thank you, Xu Kai

2478
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,160
It's been so long

2479
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,160
Did you say the key word?

2480
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,160
I said the key word

2481
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,160
But you don't know what the key word is

2482
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:57,160
Okay?

2483
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,160
I'll give you a welfare benefit at any time

2484
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
Okay, the two of you

2485
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:02,160
We've seen the tacit understanding

2486
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,160
I think Jin Yan is very, very, very

2487
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,160
Very reliable

2488
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,160
Really

2489
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,160
Including the acting is very, very good

2490
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,160
Xu Kai just showed a

2491
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,160
The feeling of showing all the candies

2492
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,160
So you can see this kind of acting

2493
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,160
The dessert just now

2494
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,160
Is that both of you

2495
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,160
Have tasted the dessert

2496
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,160
Then we have another surprise

2497
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:22,160
For the live broadcast of the live broadcast

2498
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,160
That's our wonderful flower show

2499
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,160
I think everyone is already

2500
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,160
A few big

2501
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,160
Then follow our two main actors

2502
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,160
Let's take a look together

2503
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,160
Flower show

2504
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,160
Flower show

2505
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,160
High mountains flow

2506
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,160
It's hard to tell

2507
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,160
What's the meaning of this?

2508
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,160
I'm laughing at both of you

2509
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,160
What?

2510
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,160
What?

2511
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,160
What?

2512
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,160
What?

2513
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,160
What?

2514
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,160
What's the meaning of this?

2515
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,160
What's the meaning of this?

2516
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,160
What's the meaning of this?

2517
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,160
What's the meaning of this?

2518
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,160
I can't answer the question

2519
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,160
After we two met

2520
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,160
You're not going to answer, are you?

2521
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,160
Because you see this

2522
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,160
After we met

2523
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,160
There's nothing wrong with it

2524
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,160
Okay, then go back

2525
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2526
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,160
I'm sorry

2527
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2528
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2529
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,160
So rude

2530
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,160
What's this?

2531
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:36,160
I don't know

2532
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:37,160
This is a letter

2533
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2534
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,160
Don't move

2535
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2536
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2537
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2538
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2539
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2540
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2541
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,160
Zhang Wu

2542
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,160
Put it on

2543
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,160
Your Highness

2544
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:04,160
Don't say that

2545
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,160
Maybe

2546
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,160
someone will see this

2547
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:16,160
I'm the mouse of the hidden head

2548
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,160
The moon is in the right place tonight

2549
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,160
Okay, he's going

2550
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,160
I'm living for you

2551
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,160
It seems to be the only meaning in my life

2552
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,160
I won't feel bad if you don't die

2553
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,160
I'm sorry, uncle Yang

2554
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,160
I'm telling you

2555
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,160
I won't let you go

2556
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,160
I don't want to be your concubine

2557
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,160
I don't want to live for you

2558
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,160
I don't want to be a puppet

2559
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,160
Your enemy is not good at fighting

2560
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,160
I'm afraid you'll be lost by Zhan Wenjiao and Bian Xian

2561
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,160
You have no right

2562
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,160
to take other people's life

2563
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,160
Why don't you ask?

2564
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,160
It's not easy to be a emperor

2565
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,160
It's not easy to be a emperor

2566
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:26,160
I'm doing this for the sake of prosperity

2567
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,160
As long as I can go up

2568
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,160
I'm willing to do anything

2569
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,160
I won't let these dirty hands

2570
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,160
touch them

2571
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,160
Let me go

2572
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,160
Let me go

2573
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,160
No

2574
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,160
There's a assassin

2575
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,160
Protect Your Highness

2576
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,160
Your Highness

2577
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,160
As for the royal family

2578
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,160
I don't want to live for you

2579
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,160
It's so fun

2580
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,160
Because I was just

2581
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:48,160
running around alone

2582
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,160
I was playing the piano alone

2583
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,160
I was playing the piano

2584
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,160
I was playing the flute

2585
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,160
But it seemed like

2586
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,160
Xu Kai was playing the piano

2587
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,160
Right

2588
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,160
Because he looks like him

2589
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,160
I've already shot a few

2590
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,160
The director said

2591
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,160
No, there was someone at the scene

2592
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,160
I'm sorry

2593
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,160
Mr. Kai, you played the piano

2594
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,160
I said

2595
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:04,160
Why didn't you tell me

2596
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,160
half an hour ago?

2597
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,160
I was playing the piano

2598
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,160
in a place where I played the piano

2599
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,160
It's the same as the one you're talking about

2600
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:10,160
I know

2601
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,160
So in the process of shooting

2602
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,160
there are still many fun places

2603
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,160
Can the two of you

2604
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,160
be able to be in this time

2605
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,160
Because everyone is always pursuing

2606
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,160
Can you give us

2607
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,160
a little more

2608
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,160
Very warm heart

2609
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:28,160
Very romantic

2610
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,160
There is romance

2611
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:31,160
Oh, no

2612
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,160
No romance

2613
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,160
No romance

2614
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,160
What other official words

2615
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,160
I want to think about

2616
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,160
A kind of

2617
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,160
plot

2618
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,160
plot

2619
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,160
It's your turn, Jingyan

2620
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:43,160
I've already said a few key words

2621
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,160
Okay, key words

2622
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,160
Official key words

2623
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,160
I'll say one

2624
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:51,160
Anyway, I've already

2625
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,160
said a lot

2626
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,160
I think it's really

2627
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,160
The biggest

2628
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,160
thing in the play

2629
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,160
The two of us

2630
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,160
The same

2631
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,160
The same

2632
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,160
Okay, I've finished

2633
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,160
what I said today

2634
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,160
What happened

2635
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,160
Everyone, please chase

2636
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,160
The plot behind is more wonderful

2637
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,160
And then Jingyan

2638
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:12,160
I think it's a very big

2639
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,160
blessing

2640
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,160
So don't make a mistake

2641
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,160
Okay

2642
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,160
Why is the food so good

2643
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,160
The food must be so good

2644
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,160
It's good

2645
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:23,160
It's warm and

2646
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,160
emotional

2647
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:25,160
I'll accompany you

2648
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,160
Every moment

2649
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,160
Let you

2650
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,160
In your heart

2651
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,160
For our plot

2652
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,160
Can't stop

2653
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,160
The romance

2654
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,160
And then

2655
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,160
Let you

2656
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,160
No

2657
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,160
I'm done with the word

2658
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,160
Sihong

2659
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,160
Come

2660
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,160
Both delicious

2661
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,160
And then both sweet and beautiful love

2662
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,160
And

2663
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,160
Sweet mood

2664
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,160
Oh, the word is gone again

2665
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,160
Sweet mood

2666
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:53,160
And

2667
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,160
