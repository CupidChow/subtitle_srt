How do you feel about our live broadcast room?

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,200
Very warm

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
Very pleasant atmosphere

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,400
Very warm and pleasant

57
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,360
Because today our theme is

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,000
Zhu Zhangjin and Yao Zijin's family banquet

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,040
Whatever is not rare

60
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,720
is to give everyone sugar

61
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,840

about those things

68
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
I believe that at this moment

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
everyone's chats have been brushed up

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,600
right?

71
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Where is Jingyan?

72
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,720
OK, let's talk more

73
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,880
Please welcome Jingyan

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,720
Welcome you

76
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,320
Hi

77
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Hello

78
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,080
Let's drink first

79
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,440
Hello, everyone, I'm Jingyan

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,720
Hello

81
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,560
Kai

82
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,600
Hello

83
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,320
You are so happy

84
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm watching you

85
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,960
So happy

86
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,800
I feel very lonely

87
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,640
But no

88
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,760
There are many fans

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
who are with Jingyan, OK?

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,560
Absolutely not lonely

91
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,920
Very warm

92
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,240
OK, everyone, tell everyone

93
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,520
Because today our Jingyan

94
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,280
Because of the epidemic situation

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
But through our

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,240
live broadcast room

97
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Actually a family banquet

98
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,240
Yunfang is meeting everyone

99
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,120
I believe everyone can feel

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,520
Wu Jingyan and our Xu Kai

101
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,200
Our passion for the live broadcast

102
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,680
I believe that now people have arrived

103
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,600
Actually, we prepared some tips for the live broadcast

104
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,480
I don't know

105
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,080
Did Jingyan eat it?

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
I said they prepared it for me

107
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,440
It's not a tip

108
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,560
It's a snack for snacks

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,640
Yes, we also prepared some snacks, right?

110
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:58,960
Yes

111
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,720
Now we have prepared snacks

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,960
And we also prepared tea

113
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
At the beginning

114
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,480
Let's drink tea first, OK?

115
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:06,840
OK

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,360
Let's drink with our audience first

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Cheers

118
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,440
Welcome everyone

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,240
Thank you for watching our live broadcast room

120
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,400
Remember our Jingyan

121
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,120
Then we can start eating and chatting

122
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920
Everyone can see that people are already here

123
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,480
The family banquet is about to start

124
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,200
Because of the food

125
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,000
Everyone has been looking forward to it for a long time

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,080
What she said is

127
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,760
The young girl Yao Zijun grew up in the palace

128
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,920
And she taught us Chinese food

129
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,080
The sun shines big

130
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,240
And the story of the pig's trotter is revealed, right?

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,200
Today we also prepared some

132
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
High-performance clips

133
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,360
Including Xu Kai and Wu Jingyan

135
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,240
Have you seen the clips before?

136
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,160
No

137
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,880
So we all watched it for the first time, right?

138
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,600
Yes

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
Then let's follow Jingyan and Xu Kai

140
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,840
Come back together

141
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,400
It's noon

142
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
It's time to go

143
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,600
Your Highness, don't say anything

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Maybe someone will say this

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,640
I'm a motorcycle Interestingly

146
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:39,840
Mom is a mouse of Betelten

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,960
vaccinations

148
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm telling you, I won't let you go.

149
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm telling you, I won't let you go.

150
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,960
All of this is over.

151
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Just now, Ji Yan said that it's over.

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Yes, I feel like I'm done with the show.

153
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Anyway, the road is so sweet.

154
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
I feel like I'm sure everyone has the same thoughts as Qingqing.

155
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
I've been going up the Yangtze River.

156
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
I feel very, very sweet.

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Now, let's see what Xu Hai and Ji Yan have to say

158
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
to introduce our role in the show.

159
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
Ji Yan first.

160
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
Ji Yan.

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
I think that in the show,

162
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Ji Yan is Yao Lijin.

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
And in the show, she is a princess.

164
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
It's really good.

165
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,960
There are more than one thousand of these dramas.

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
She's dancing.

167
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
That's good.

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Congratulations.

169
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
I don't know if you've heard our voice.

170
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Actually, it's a hidden welfare part in our live broadcast room.

171
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
In the process of the live broadcast,

172
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
as long as the two of you say our welfare key words,

173
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
they will trigger our welfare mechanism.

174
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
So congratulations to the two members of this round,

175
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
the two members of the welfare committee.

176
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
So, the most important news is already on our screen.

177
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
It's out now.

178
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Congratulations.

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
And this drama is very good.

180
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,960
And the girl is also very beautiful.

181
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
And then the whole costume

182
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
has reached more than three thousand.

183
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
It's beautiful and a hidden welfare.

184
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
At the same time, there is also

185
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,960
the love between Zhu Zhanji and Yao Zijin.

186
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
I played in it.

187
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Yao Zijin is a girl who eats well.

188
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
And then she...

189
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
I admire her a lot.

190
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
It's because at that time,

191
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,960
she had a lot of brave and super-precious thoughts.

192
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
I admire her courage.

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
It's a kind of...

194
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
It's a kind of...

195
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
It's a kind of...

196
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
A kind of independent girl.

197
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Independent girl.

198
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
So this drama should be very good.

199
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
And there are a lot of

200
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
sweet scenes in the drama.

201
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
We just watched a little bit.

202
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
It's already sweet in the heart.

203
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I don't know, Xu Kai.

204
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
You can introduce it to everyone.

205
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
The role you played in it, okay?

206
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I played Huang Taicun.

207
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Zhu Zhanji.

208
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,960
And then he is a genius

209
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
who is a literary and martial arts duo.

210
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
You call him genius yourself, right?

211
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Zhu Zhanji is very genius, right?

212
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
And he has such a beautiful Yao Zijin.

213
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Look, he is lying on the line.

214
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
He is...

215
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Yes, I think there is nothing lacking.

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
A man.

217
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Perfect.

218
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Genius.

219
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Can you both introduce it to everyone?

220
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Actually, Jingyan has already said some things.

221
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Do you think there are some different

222
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,960
characteristics of the role you played in the past?

223
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
I think the biggest difference is that

224
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
he has a way of being excessive.

225
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,960
He has a very fast change in the role.

226
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
For example, I played Huang Taicun.

227
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
And then I became the crown prince

228
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,960
and then I became the emperor.

229
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
So I often talked to the director at that time.

230
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I said,

231
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Director, I was obviously very happy just now.

232
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
Why did I suddenly...

233
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I became unhappy in this drama.

234
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
He said you are the emperor.

235
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
You are happy and happy.

236
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
You will definitely not be caught by anyone.

237
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
I said,

238
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
what should I do?

239
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
He said you should take it as

240
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
everything is yours now.

241
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
You will be punished.

242
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
So I think it is very difficult.

243
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
It is not as if you are not angry

244
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,960
and you are not the same as everything in life.

245
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
So I think

246
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I am still learning.

247
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Because after all, the emperor's

248
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
temperament and his difficulty are too big.

249
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
I think I am always

250
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
learning.

251
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
I can't really take everything

252
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
that is human to me

253
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
to the emperor.

254
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
You told me that

255
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
it is actually very difficult.

256
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
For example, I said to some old dramas,

257
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
I also said that I was a little bit...

258
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
I also cried and said,

259
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Teacher, it's just fine.

260
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
I won't be too...

261
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
So this is a very difficult point.

262
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
A very different point.

263
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Actually, it is also a journey.

264
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Yes.

265
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Including, you see, because when you were shooting,

266
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
it was not actually the one that came with the plot.

267
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Maybe the last second you played was the emperor's grandson.

268
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
The next one was the emperor's.

269
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
So the difficulty of this change is also here.

270
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Yes.

271
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
What about the next few years?

272
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
I just heard from Kai-Lan.

273
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
The director told him that

274
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
everything is his own feeling.

275
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
I was thinking about him.

276
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
When we were shooting,

277
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
no wonder everything was taken by him.

278
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,960
You?

279
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Yes.

280
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
This place is also mine.

281
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Everyone is his.

282
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
I can understand that

283
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
it was not easy at that time.

284
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
But he was very good.

285
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
I think this series,

286
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
the second time we worked together with Kai-Lan,

287
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
was different.

288
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,960
I always think that I was still a maid.

289
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I started from the beginning.

290
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,960
But when I saw Kai-Lan,

291
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
he was already saying that he was the emperor's grandson.

292
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,960
It was not the stage where we both grew up together.

293
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,960
The relationship between the characters has changed.

294
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,960
It makes people feel more familiar and unfamiliar.

295
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
It's a challenge.

296
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
But because of the familiarness,

297
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
the co-paste is very good.

298
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Yes, it's very good.

299
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,960
It's different from the previous relationship.

300
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
At the same time, it's so familiar.

301
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
This is a difficult place.

302
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,960
And I have a relationship with Yao Zijun and Zhu Yanji.

303
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
I think it makes me feel a little bit more worried.

304
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
It also makes the audience feel worried.

305
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,960
It's because they have met for a long time.

306
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
They have been together for a long time.

307
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
They only met each other.

308
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
I think this is a special point.

309
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I don't know if the audience can handle it.

310
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
When I read the script,

311
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I thought why is it still missing?

312
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
It's still missing.

313
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Anyway, it's still missing.

314
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
If you finally see it,

315
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
you will feel that it's okay.

316
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
You finally wait.

317
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
It's very touching.

318
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Yes, it's a touching feeling.

319
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
This is what it means.

320
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
If you keep chasing after it,

321
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
you will keep chasing after it.

322
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Because it's really hard to get it.

323
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
And then it's sweet.

324
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
Maybe there's a place where it's still very hard to get it.

325
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
So it's a place where you can be close to it.

326
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Anyway, there are many places that attract you.

327
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,960
I also see that the fans have already put two people together.

328
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,960
One is Zhu Zhanji,

329
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
and the other is Yao Zijing.

330
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
They have all taken a CP name.

331
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Have you heard of it?

332
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
I'll announce it.

333
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,960
It's called Golden Palm Flower.

334
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
I saw it.

335
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
I saw it.

336
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
His expression is different.

337
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Maybe you don't know it.

338
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
I know.

339
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
I just think this is like a dish

340
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
in our city.

341
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
It's like a vegetable.

342
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
Golden Palm Flower can also be made of vegetable.

343
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,960
How do you see the name of this CP?

344
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
I think it's cute.

345
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,960
And Golden Palm Flower is meant to be accompanied and pure.

346
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
So I think it's very suitable.

347
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,960
It's just right for us to be in the drama.

348
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
I compared it with Zijing,

349
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
accompanied by each other,

350
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,960
and found each other.

351
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
I think Zijing is a very romantic person.

352
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Because if you want to know

353
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,960
if boys can understand some of the flowers,

354
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
I think he's a very considerate person.

355
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
Zijing, do you agree?

356
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I think many people don't know

357
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,960
about Golden Palm Flower.

358
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm also going to investigate it.

359
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,960
So he's very important to your CP name.

360
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Zijing, how do you see the name of this CP?

361
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,960
I heard it's very suitable for the drama.

362
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,960
It's like a little star in a food

363
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,960
made by Yao Zijing.

364
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,960
It's like a little star.

365
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,960
And it has that kind of anti-sacrifice effect.

366
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,960
When you see this CP,

367
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,960
you will be amazed by the way they act.

368
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,960
You will feel that your body is getting normal.

369
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,960
It's like a little bit of a real treatment.

370
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
That's great.

371
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Speaking of this,

372
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
because we just saw the high-end film,

373
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
because you guys are also watching it for the first time.

374
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Now let's recall it again.

375
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
When you two were filming,

376
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,960
which one of the films you think is the sweetest

377
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
or the most impressive?

378
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I think you can recall it now.

379
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,960
The sweetest must be the kiss between us.

380
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
And the most impressive is...

381
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Actually, when we first started filming,

382
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,960
we were very strict.

383
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Do you remember?

384
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
When we first started filming,

385
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,960
we were filming in the bookshelf.

386
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
Yes, we were walking you there.

387
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Yes.

388
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Fortunately, we met before.

389
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm telling you,

390
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
we were embarrassed.

391
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
When we were walking,

392
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
we asked the director if we should do this.

393
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
I just rolled it over.

394
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I was so close.

395
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
I said,

396
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
the director said,

397
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
it's almost there.

398
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I said, OK.

399
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,960
We don't need to go to the awkward spot anymore.

400
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Yes.

401
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
I think this is the impression

402
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,960
of the first time we were acting like this.

403
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Yes.

404
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Actually, the two of us are quite familiar with each other.

405
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
So when we were acting,

406
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
we were in a comfortable state.

407
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
And the kiss we just received,

408
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,960
do you remember the kiss?

409
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Do you have any...

410
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
NG or something like that?

411
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
No.

412
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
No?

413
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
No.

414
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
No.

415
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
The past of Kai's...

416
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Almost the same.

417
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Almost the same.

418
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
The acting of Kai's

419
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
was the past of several years.

420
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
But the past of Kai's was the kiss.

421
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
The past of Kai's.

422
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
OK.

423
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,960
Yes.

424
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Because the two of us

425
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,960
are very invested in that atmosphere.

426
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Actually,

427
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
it's OK when you feel it.

428
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
That's great.

429
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
What about the past few years?

430
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
What do you think is the sweetest scene?

431
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
What do you think?

432
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
I like it more.

433
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Because it gives you some space.

434
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,960
The scene I think deeply

435
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
is actually the same in the drama.

436
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I saw the first time

437
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
what kind of scene

438
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Zhu Yanji looks like.

439
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
I watched him from afar.

440
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
I know Zhu Yanji is so handsome.

441
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,960
The scene in the justice.

442
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I think that feeling

443
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
is waiting for a long time

444
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
to see this person.

445
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,960
And then I saw him.

446
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
And then on the face of this girl,

447
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
there is the first time

448
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
that kind of

449
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
very sweet smile.

450
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,960
I think that's very deep.

451
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
I like it.

452
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
I believe that because when you are chasing,

453
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
because everyone just said

454
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
that you might have to wait until the second episode

455
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
to see

456
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
the smile you really see.

457
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
So in this drama,

458
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
everyone must follow the script.

459
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,960
Follow Xu Kai and chase.

460
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Actually,

461
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
after I finished talking,

462
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
I think our picture

463
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
is getting stronger.

464
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
I believe that the fans of Mango TV

465
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
are more looking forward to it.

466
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
So,

467
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
in this drama,

468
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
everyone must remember to chase.

469
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,960
Let's look forward to it together.

470
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,960
What I just said is the family business.

471
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,960
We can't miss some delicious food.

472
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Next,

473
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
we will start

474
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
the delicious banquet with the baby

475
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
in the live broadcast room.

476
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
First,

477
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
let's ask Jingyan.

478
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Because in the drama,

479
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
we are a top female official in Yao Zijing.

480
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I believe that

481
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
there must be some

482
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
some of your own understanding

483
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
when you meet them.

484
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
What do you think

485
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
is the best dish

486
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
in your heart?

487
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
After I finished acting,

488
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,960
I really put my heart

489
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
into the way

490
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
I treat the food.

491
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
It's too difficult.

492
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
The door is too high.

493
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
I think

494
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
including Yao Zijing

495
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
cooked for Zhu Zhanji,

496
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
whether it's

497
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
from the season of food,

498
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
whether it's cold and hot,

499
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
or,

500
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
to be honest,

501
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
the food that comes in this morning

502
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
and the food that comes in the evening

503
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
are not as delicious as the food that comes in the evening.

504
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
I think that

505
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
the food that comes in the evening

506
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
is not as delicious as the food that comes in the evening.

507
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
And then,

508
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
including the ingredients,

509
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
the effect,

510
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
or the heat

511
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
that comes in the evening,

512
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
what season it is,

513
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
what kind of food it is,

514
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
it's very, very

515
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
lovey-dovey.

516
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
The food

517
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
that comes in the evening

518
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
might be

519
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
a standard of Yao Zijing.

520
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
For me,

521
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
I just like the smell.

522
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
There's a big contrast.

523
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
It's a contrast that makes me feel happy.

524
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
With the food that comes in the evening,

525
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
the taste

526
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,960
is really warm.

527
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
It's very heart-warming.

528
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Yes, it's heart-warming.

529
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Because of Jingyan's answer,

530
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
we also

531
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
prepared a small interaction

532
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
for Jingyan on the spot.

533
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Of course, Xu Kai will also

534
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
complete it together.

535
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Before we go to the table,

536
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
let's prepare

537
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
three dishes in the drama, okay?

538
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Let's invite our director team

539
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
to come and serve the dishes.

540
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Okay.

541
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Jingyan, can you see

542
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
the three dishes on the table?

543
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
It's very far.

544
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
It's very far.

545
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
I can probably see

546
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
what it is.

547
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,960
At least,

548
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
you can see three sticks, right?

549
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Yes.

550
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
You can see three sticks,

551
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
three white things.

552
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
First, we need Jingyan

553
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
to have three dishes.

554
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Anyway, the first one, right?

555
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
This is the second one.

556
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
This is the third dish.

557
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Let's pick one, okay?

558
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Which dish do you choose?

559
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
I'll sell a pot first.

560
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Come on.

561
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
You pick one, okay?

562
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Okay.

563
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
It feels like a rice bowl.

564
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
In my opinion,

565
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
the one in the middle, right?

566
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
The one in the back.

567
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
What's the one in the middle?

568
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Okay.

569
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
The third dish.

570
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Yes.

571
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Xu Kai,

572
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
come and open it, okay?

573
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Let's see what it is.

574
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Okay, maybe Jingyan can't see it very clearly.

575
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Let me show you.

576
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
What is this?

577
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
This should be

578
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
a dish.

579
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
A dish?

580
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Oh.

581
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Did you have it in the drama?

582
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Yes.

583
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
Yes.

584
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
Since it already has it,

585
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
it seems that you already know it.

586
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Then, let's take a look at Jingyan.

587
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,960
It's the feature of this dish

588
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,960
to describe Zhu Zhanji.

589
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
It's a very popular dish.

590
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
This person is not only

591
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
a foreign person

592
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
who likes it,

593
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
but also

594
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
has a deep inner heart.

595
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
He can do anything.

596
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
He can do anything.

597
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
He can do anything.

598
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
He can sing,

599
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
he can dance,

600
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
he can ride a horse,

601
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
he can write,

602
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,960
he can play the piano,

603
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,960
he can also

604
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
play love.

605
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Yes.

606
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Just like Zhu Zhanji.

607
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
He can do it.

608
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
I think he should have a good voice.

609
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I can understand.

610
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
I can understand what Jingyan said.

611
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
He just said that the appearance is a dish.

612
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
The dish is a whole dish.

613
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
It's my skin.

614
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
And my talent

615
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
represents every rice.

616
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
So it's a dish.

617
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
Right?

618
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Yes.

619
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,960
You just said that

620
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
I have all kinds of talents.

621
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Every rice is my talent.

622
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
That's too much.

623
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
This person.

624
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
That's too much.

625
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
This person

626
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
is not only a foreign person

627
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
who likes it,

628
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
but also

629
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,960
makes people

630
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
feel more and more delicious,

631
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
more delicious,

632
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
more fragile,

633
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
like a piece of paper.

634
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
A piece of paper.

635
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
A piece of paper.

636
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
I agree.

637
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Really.

638
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
I just said that

639
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
the last one is a little bit more.

640
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
He even cares about the treasure.

641
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Let's take a look at

642
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
the other two dishes,

643
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
okay?

644
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
The two dishes you chose.

645
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,960
One is the early morning.

646
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
The early morning.

647
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
There is a series.

648
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
This is my...

649
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,960
It's about taking down Zhu Zhanji's taste.

650
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Right.

651
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
The key ingredient.

652
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
The early morning.

653
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
The other one is the instant noodles.

654
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
So I found

655
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
that these three dishes

656
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
are actually quite difficult.

657
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
But after

658
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
passing the performance of Jingyan,

659
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,960
I think

660
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
if Xu Kai

661
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
can evaluate

662
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
or give a score,

663
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
how many points do you give?

664
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
It's all thanks to me.

665
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
It must be full.

666
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Right?

667
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
Give full points on the spot, okay?

668
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
You can see that

669
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Jingyan really

670
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
praised

671
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Zhu Zhanji's heart.

672
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Just now,

673
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
our top female official,

674
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
our Zijin,

675
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
was too professional.

676
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
Just now,

677
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
we can use this word

678
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
to praise the chef.

679
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
So

680
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
you can remember

681
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
what Jingyan just said

682
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
with the small books.

683
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
When we were

684
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
pursuing the show,

685
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
we also brushed the wood, okay?

686
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Next,

687
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
we will ask our Huang Taisun.

688
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Because you must have

689
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
tasted a lot of delicious food in the drama.

690
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Jingyan just had a breakthrough.

691
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
There are more than a thousand kinds.

692
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Right?

693
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Yes.

694
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
All of them.

695
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
If you want to use

696
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
a dish

697
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
to evaluate

698
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
the Zijin in the drama,

699
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
what kind of dish

700
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
do you think

701
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Zijin is?

702
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
I think

703
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Jingyan has already

704
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
heard it for a long time.

705
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I think

706
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,960
whatever dish

707
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Zijin has in Zhu Zhanji's heart,

708
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
it's all delicious.

709
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Xu Kai's answer.

710
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
Jingyan,

711
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
how do you feel about

712
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
his comments?

713
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Xu Kai is used to it.

714
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,960
Xu Kai's answer is

715
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
perfect.

716
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Zhu Zhanji just said

717
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
that

718
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
it's actually a medium-sized dish, right?

719
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
So

720
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
what you do

721
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
is perfect in his heart.

722
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
How can Zhu Zhanji

723
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,960
use a dish to describe

724
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
anything

725
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
that is not perfect in his heart?

726
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
He is a talent.

727
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
He is also a genius.

728
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,960
He is a genius.

729
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
A genius.

730
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,960
Yes.

731
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,960
We have already

732
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
used the dish to describe it.

733
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
So

734
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
next,

735
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
because of the royal grandson

736
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
at the scene,

737
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
we will also

738
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
do a little

739
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
five-digit challenge

740
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
to describe

741
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
our Zijin.

742
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
The rule of this

743
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
interaction is

744
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Zhu Zhanji

745
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,960
has to describe

746
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Zijin in the drama.

747
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
The sourest,

748
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
the sweetest,

749
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
the most bitter,

750
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
the most spicy,

751
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
the most salty

752
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
place

753
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
to complete a

754
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
exaggerated challenge.

755
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I think it's pretty hard.

756
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Now

757
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Xu Kai becomes

758
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
a Zhu Zhanji.

759
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
A feeling.

760
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Then

761
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
let's praise

762
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
our Zijin.

763
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
There are five flavors.

764
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,960
I feel that

765
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Xu Kai is sweating a little.

766
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
If you are ready,

767
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
I will start.

768
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Come on, describe it.

769
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Very difficult.

770
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
The sourest,

771
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
the most sweet,

772
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
the most spicy, the most salty, right?

773
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
Yes.

774
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
The sourest is

775
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
when I was

776
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
in the study room,

777
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
when we were in the study room,

778
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
the team.

779
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
The sweetest

780
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
is

781
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
when we were in the study room,

782
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
when we were in the study room,

783
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
I forced Zijin to

784
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
sprinkle sugar.

785
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
The most bitter

786
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
is to look forward to the audience.

787
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
This is not the end.

788
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
The most spicy,

789
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
the most spicy is

790
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Zijin is also in the study room.

791
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
She is a

792
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
yes,

793
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
but Zijin is a

794
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
career-oriented woman.

795
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Very strong,

796
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
very strong,

797
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
very independent.

798
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Yes.

799
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
The most salty is

800
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
the play, right?

801
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
She is also

802
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
in the study room,

803
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
she refused me.

804
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,960
The second one refused me.

805
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Very cool.

806
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
She refused you,

807
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
she is a good worker.

808
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Not bitter.

809
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
She is very handsome,

810
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
very handsome,

811
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,960
very sweet,

812
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
very sweet.

813
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
She is very handsome.

814
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
She is a good worker.

815
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
Huang Shaisun.

816
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
She is such a

817
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
excellent person.

818
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
You actually refused me.

819
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
I am also

820
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
a professional in

821
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
the study room.

822
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Yes.

823
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Then the study room

824
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
refused me.

825
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
This is a

826
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
study room with five-spice.

827
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Yes,

828
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
any story happened inside.

829
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
So,

830
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
the sour, sweet,

831
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
bitter, salty

832
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
are all in the study room,

833
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,960
right?

834
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Well,

835
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
I can say that

836
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
you two

837
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
have felt how sweet

838
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
in the drama.

839
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
But

840
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
how sweet is it?

841
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
You still have to chase after it.

842
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Huang Shaisun

843
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
has praised the script so much.

844
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
I want to ask our script.

845
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
In your eyes,

846
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
what do you think

847
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
the biggest advantage of Zhu Zhanji?

848
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,960
I really can't say it.

849
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
But in this live broadcast,

850
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,960
I can't turn off the TV for a long time.

851
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
I think Zhu Zhanji

852
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
is a very perfect person

853
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
in my heart.

854
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Very perfect.

855
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Any girl

856
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,960
will think that

857
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
it's really...

858
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,960
This person

859
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
is the person in the heart.

860
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
He's not sure.

861
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
He's not sure.

862
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
You think

863
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
he's too official?

864
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
I want to ask you something.

865
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
He's willing to let go

866
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
and let you be yourself.

867
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
He loves you very much

868
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
and he's willing to let you go.

869
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
This is your style, right?

870
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
This is Zhu Zhanji's style.

871
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
The more so,

872
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
I can't get away.

873
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Is it a romantic story?

874
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
This is a man's style.

875
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
It's not Zhu Zhanji's style.

876
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,960
How can I say?

877
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Anyway, I think

878
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Zhu Zhanji and Yao Ziqi

879
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
are both perfect in their hearts.

880
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
If you hear it now,

881
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,960
what is the most

882
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
you want to take

883
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
from Zhu Zhanji's

884
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,960
skills?

885
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Skills

886
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
are not his life.

887
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,960
I don't want your life.

888
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,960
You have so many talents.

889
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,960
Why do you want your life?

890
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,960
I want to use your talents

891
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
to my body

892
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
and keep you as a person.

893
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Your talents

894
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
and skills are for you.

895
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I want my life.

896
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Come on.

897
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
So you want to take

898
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
his talents away, right?

899
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Then I'm not a useless person.

900
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
I can't let you do that.

901
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
You only have money left.

902
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Zhu Zhanji.

903
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
If you take him away,

904
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
you're done.

905
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
You can have your own talents.

906
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
You have so many talents.

907
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm tired.

908
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
You're perfect.

909
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Darling,

910
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
why do you have

911
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
such a perfect Zhu Zhanji?

912
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Right?

913
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
Why do you have such a good Zijin?

914
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Good.

915
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Well,

916
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
I feel like

917
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
a great Zijin has

918
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,400
veryή

919
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
Once

920
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
I went to Tibet

921
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
to gain

922
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
a Zijin from

923
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
a tight blurry background,

924
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Li Zile,

925
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
and a big Big concern,

926
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
I wanted to get a Zijin from Zhu Zhanji.

927
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
So smart.

928
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,520
She is a prince.

929
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
She has so many talents.

930
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,640
and handsome people

931
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,600
What should I do?

932
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,880
I'm very disheartened

933
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,520
What should I do?

934
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,720
Since that

935
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,320
Let's start with the man's stomach

936
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,000
Let's start with your own foundation

937
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,720
Let's move his stomach first

938
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,560
Then the step is very clever

939
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,800
Then just

940
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
Tell him

941
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,880
I like you

942
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,640
Express your gratitude

943
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,720
And then the next step is more important

944
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,000
Goodbye

945
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,920
I'm leaving

946
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,440
The battleground was also pretty good

947
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
Just a few words

948
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,120
Take his stomach

949
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,760
I started to take the step

950
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,200
It's the earliest

951
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,280
The earliest

952
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,320
I made a lot of food

953
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,400
I made a lot of food

954
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,080
Then I also showed my talent

955
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
Give him a few words

956
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,280
Say a word

957
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,120
Give him a word

958
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,480
It's also a talent

959
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,440
Give him an idea

960
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,120
This is to show your talent

961
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,320
Also showed him

962
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,400
But the most important thing is

963
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,800
Grab his stomach

964
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,760
Then grab his heart

965
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,520
For him

966
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,440
You have to

967
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,400
The most important thing is to

968
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,320
Do your own thing

969
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,760
Then let this man

970
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,920
Finally you leave

971
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,080
Then don't spend too much time on him

972
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,920
Go away

973
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
Go away

974
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,000
I should not listen to this part first

975
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,840
You are

976
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm telling you the story of the man who pinched you

977
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,320
It was like this, right?

978
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,560
Then you are like this

979
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,280
You also have a set of rules

980
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,760
Say that the time is okay

981
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,040
Let's do what you want to do

982
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,000
Let me let you go

983
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,080
The same

984
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,440
The two of them are the same

985
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,320
Actually, I think

986
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,040
What Jinyuan just said

987
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,400
We can use the little man to remember

988
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,280
Just face a perfect person

989
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,880
Actually, the way to use it

990
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,800
I think this move

991
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,960
You can also use it in reality

992
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
What do you think, Jinyuan?

993
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,480
You can buy more than a few at the earliest

994
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
You don't have to ask

995
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,000
Do you care about this move in reality?

996
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,440
I was in the drama

997
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,280
I asked myself

998
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,240
How can I like it at the earliest

999
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,080
He said at the earliest

1000
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,920
My reaction was like

1001
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,840
Just like that

1002
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,680
You are such a talented person

1003
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,800
Love to eat at the earliest

1004
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,920
So at the earliest

1005
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,080
You can't express your feelings, right?

1006
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Then do you think in reality

1007
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,560
A quick-drying dish can move a person

1008
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,880
No, if it's Xu Kai

1009
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,160
If it's Zhu Zhanji

1010
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,000
I think it's okay

1011
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,480
Yes, do you know why Zhu Zhanji is okay?

1012
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,560
Actually, it's a separate person

1013
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,960
Because the person who does this is Yao Zijing

1014
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,920
Yes

1015
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,480
I am very kind to my family

1016
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,640
I will never leave Yao Zijing

1017
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,320
Okay, just said that Yao Zijing

1018
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,960
On the way to upgrade the monster

1019
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,800
Is to cut down a food emperor

1020
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,760
So is Huang Taicun a food?

1021
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,280
I think

1022
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,640
He

1023
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,400
Actually

1024
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,160
My father is a food

1025
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,560
I think Huang Taicun

1026
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,080
Zhu Zhanji he wants more

1027
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,040
Not to say Yao Zijing

1028
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
What does he do for him

1029
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,160
He wants to use this excuse

1030
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,120
To see Yao Zijing

1031
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
So he has to go to the market every day

1032
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,000
He makes him a food

1033
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,240
Actually just to see him

1034
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,720
I think more important is

1035
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,440
Not food

1036
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,200
But thinking about him

1037
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,240
Because you can cook

1038
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,200
So I just wanted to see you

1039
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,640
Then I said you can cook for me

1040
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,240
So I can see you

1041
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,720
Right?

1042
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,960
Yes

1043
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
Then ask Zijing

1044
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,440
Did you say

1045
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,920
Want to catch a person's heart

1046
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,360
First of all, to catch his stomach

1047
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,040
You

1048
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,840
Do you agree with this statement?

1049
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,800
I have no ability

1050
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,040
I just don't know how to cook

1051
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,360
I don't have this kind of understanding

1052
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,320
But for Yao Zijing

1053
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,720
He is a natural human

1054
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,680
He works in the kitchen every day

1055
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,960
Why don't I use this food

1056
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,600
To enter this man first

1057
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,360
Right

1058
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,360
Just give him this kind of environment

1059
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,840
Just grab this opportunity

1060
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,920
Just use

1061
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,920
So use your own self-improvement

1062
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,120
To catch the heart of the fighter

1063
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,880
Right, use your own advantage

1064
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,240
To do these things in this position

1065
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,040
So a love-hate-hate-hate

1066
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,200
We learned today

1067
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,600
Is to use a self-improvement

1068
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,560
To show off to the other side

1069
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,480
So I think

1070
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,280
All of the fans who watch our live broadcast

1071
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,400
Today is blessed

1072
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,640
Because while pursuing the drama

1073
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,880
Actually we also talked about

1074
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,000
A lot of useful things that can be learned

1075
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,940
Actually, when Yao Zijing entered the top

1076
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,920
Zhu Zanji seems to have been paying attention to him

1077
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,640
Right

1078
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,840
This is how the drama is going

1079
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
That can be said to be

1080
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,120
Zhu Zanji has been with Yao Zijing all the way

1081
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,400
From a palace maid to a maid

1082
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,600
Grow to

1083
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,080
Good-looking, good-looking

1084
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,920
Including good-looking

1085
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,240
See his changes

1086
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,360
So I want to ask Xu Kai

1087
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,480
Is in the role of Zhu Zanji

1088
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,560
Or what was his favorite time

1089
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,320
Which period of time

1090
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,120
What do you think

1091
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,520
I think which period of time

1092
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,880
Is not important to me

1093
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,960
Because he

1094
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,680
No matter what career he is

1095
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,160
He doesn't have my position

1096
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,680
So I think he is in my heart

1097
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,600
As long as he is the person

1098
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
I think he is in my heart

1099
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,720
Is the one I like the most

1100
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,240
Right

1101
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,440
Because he is taller than me

1102
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,760
So I don't care about his position

1103
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,160
I just

1104
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,440
I just look at him in front of me

1105
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,160
So what does Zijing mean

1106
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,440
He means

1107
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,920
Whether you are a chef

1108
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,000
Actually, I like you

1109
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,840
It's not important

1110
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,360
I don't care

1111
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,560
Then why did I have to spend so much time

1112
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,240
To cook

1113
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,560
How many times have I cooked

1114
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,960
How many times have I cooked

1115
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,240
It turns out that Zhu Zanji doesn't care

1116
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,880
I care about you cooking for me

1117
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
But I don't care about your position

1118
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,800
OK, the school sister will be more and more excited

1119
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I must remind everyone here

1120
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Because we, Jingyan and Xu Kai

1121
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,240
Came to our Yunzhi broadcast room

1122
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,840
So I also bring you a big blessing

1123
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,160
Today, not only is there a Mango TV

1124
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,960
Our annual card

1125
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,320
The current female Zhe

1126
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,200
The super low-end of the annual card Zhaowu Zhe

1127
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,520
Will also be specially customized

1128
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,120
The online online card and live broadcast props

1129
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,240
Surprise降 0

1130
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,920
So the big sister will bring the online

1131
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,120
Our huge screen

1132
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,280
The physical card will also be equipped

1133
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,880
A series of super-large sea bubbles

1134
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,600
周邊

1135
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,160
Including the baby who is pregnant

1136
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,120
Will be randomly received

1137
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,440
Our Kai Kai and Jingyan

1138
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,320
Newly signed sea bubbles

1139
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,880
So what you have to do is

1140
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,200
Hurry up and rub our screen

1142
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,560
OK, so far

1143
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Just now, two of you

1144
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,120
Talked about some of the beautiful things about food

1145
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,480
Today, we are at the house

1146
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,000
Of course, we have to record a song

1147
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,240
Although we can't make food at the scene

1148
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,960
But we can use another form

1149
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,760
To serve you a dish

1150
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,960
Just now

1151
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,360
I want to ask our Xu Kai

1152
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,560
Guess what the dish is

1153
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,600
I guess it must be that kind of dish

1154
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,640
And then I'm very hungry for that kind of dish

1155
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,320
Yes, but

1156
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,800
We can't make this dish at the scene

1157
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,360
So we have to go through a small interaction

1158
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,800
To show you the next dish

1159
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,400
Because everyone knows that we

1160
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,680
Oh, Zijing is in this drama

1161
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,120
The dish is very delicate

1162
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,960
First of all, we have to ask Jingyan

1163
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,640
To make a set of actions

1164
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,880
Need our Xu Kai

1165
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,280
Through our steps to do street imitation

1166
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,720
To imitate all the props

1167
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,240
That's the challenge

1168
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,480
Challenge successful

1169
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,880
Then Jingyan, you're going to be punished

1170
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,760
But the challenge fails

1171
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,240
Xu Kai is going to be punished

1172
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,560
Don't know if you're ready

1173
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,120
Then I'll start

1174
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,920
To give Jingyan the first place

1175
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,320
OK, it's the action, right?

1176
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,680
OK, very simple

1177
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,160
Watch carefully

1178
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,120
Like this

1179
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,360
OK

1180
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,120
OK, I'm done

1181
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,960
Challenge failed

1182
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,920
Simple, right?

1183
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,160
No

1184
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,520
You must be on the scene to imitate

1185
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,680
Challenge failed

1186
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,200
This kind of

1187
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,440
I believe you must have remembered

1188
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,600
A few small actions

1189
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,880
For example, the heart

1190
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,960
For example, the left and right waist

1191
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,080
Yes, the first action

1192
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,160
The second action

1193
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,000
The third

1194
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,760
Four

1195
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,480
Five

1196
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,600
Six

1197
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,320
Seven

1198
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,960
Eight

1199
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,040
Wrong

1200
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
I really can't save you

1201
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,800
Can't save you

1202
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,160
Is it wrong?

1203
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,960
He didn't make a team

1204
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,080
I'm like this first

1205
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,360
I'm like this first

1206
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,320
Wrong

1207
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,840
Failure

1208
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,680
Punish

1209
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,120
OK

1210
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,560
Jingyan, do you think he's done?

1211
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,480
Of course not

1212
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,280
Xu

1213
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,400
I didn't follow the order

1214
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,800
Yes, we should have failed

1215
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,120
You have to lose after the game

1216
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,320
OK, come on

1217
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,280
Let's take a look

1218
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,080
Let's see what kind of

1219
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,760
Fans' favorite welfare version is

1220
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Come on, let's go to the drama, OK?

1221
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,440
OK

1222
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,920
Come on, Xu

1223
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,680
You have to continue to punish

1224
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,800
You come and shake it, OK?

1225
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,240
This is our welfare version

1226
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,360
OK, let me tell Jingyan

1227
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,480
What are you using, OK?

1228
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,680
You can shake it

1229
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,400
OK

1230
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,160
Good night

1231
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,280
Good night

1232
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,760
Who said this to whom?

1233
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,160
To the fans, OK?

1234
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,760
To the fans

1235
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,480
Yes, fans like your fans

1236
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,680
Is it a normal kind?

1237
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,840
Or is it?

1238
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,000
It's okay

1239
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,440
It's okay

1240
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,640
It's normal

1241
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,520
OK

1242
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,800
Every version needs it

1243
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,200
Good night

1244
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,920
What else?

1245
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
Tell me what else?

1246
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,320
It's...

1247
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,000
Good night

1248
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,800
You said it very well

1249
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
It's very confident

1250
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,040
But

1251
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
For example, you're going to sleep

1252
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,160
For example, you said

1253
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,840
Baby, baby, you're going to sleep

1254
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,080
Baby

1255
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,920
That...

1256
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,160
Baby

1257
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,240
Good night

1258
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,440
For example, for example

1259
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,920
Yes

1260
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,320
Say more

1261
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,560
It's a kind of

1262
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,720
It's a kind of sleep, OK?

1263
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,920
Because there must be a lot

1264
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,280
It will be a good night

1265
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
We can't always be good night

1266
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,720
This kind of

1267
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,120
OK

1268
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,480
Add a little bit of feeling

1269
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,280
Good night

1270
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,440
Go to sleep

1271
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,800
This is good

1272
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,880
This is good

1273
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,400
Good night

1274
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,720
Good night

1275
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,280
Good night

1276
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,360
Look at the baby who is live

1277
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
It's still welfare

1278
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,960
Hurry up and put it on

1279
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,240
Then we will make our night rain road

1280
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:53,680
OK?

1281
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,760
Every night here

1282
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,680
Everyone will sleep better

1283
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,280
Then please

1284
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,040
Our show

1285
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,600
The second set of actions, OK?

1286
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,440
I remember my death this time

1287
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:02,880
Let's do it

1288
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,720
Let's do it simpler, OK?

1289
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,480
Come on

1290
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,440
Start

1291
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,840
Sit down

1292
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,040
Then

1293
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,360
OK

1294
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,560
Have you finished?

1295
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,480
Yes, it's very simple

1296
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,080
OK

1297
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,800
Xu Kai will definitely take you

1298
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,360
Yu Xin

1299
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,480
But Jingyan, you know what?

1300
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,840
He just finished

1301
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,080
He did it for you

1302
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,000
We will see

1303
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,480
How about we

1304
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,000
Do one for our fans, OK?

1305
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,520
OK

1306
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,600
Cute

1307
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,320
It feels like we are in a movie

1308
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,520
OK

1309
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,440
Xu Kai is

1310
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,960
The whole show is coming out

1311
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,760
There is a very cute expression at the end

1312
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,480
Then this round

1313
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,600
Even if we challenge Xu Kai

1314
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,960
Then we need Jingyan to accept punishment

1315
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,880
We still need Xu Kai to make a round, OK?

1316
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,240
Make a round of our welfare board

1317
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:07,840
I choose one for you

1318
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,040
Come on

1319
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,000
OK, I choose one for you

1320
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,880
Choose one for you

1321
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,160
Choose

1322
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,520
One, two, three

1323
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,120
It's your turn

1324
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,880
What did you say in that evening voice?

1325
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
What did you say?

1326
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,680
You want to give it to the boys?

1327
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,280
To the boys

1328
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,360
The kind of guys who make them fall asleep

1329
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,480
Boys?

1330
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,520
Because

1331
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,280
Because they fall asleep

1332
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,200
They fall asleep

1333
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,280
They can't sleep directly

1334
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,960
Why do they have to make them fall asleep?

1335
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,840
I just fell asleep

1336
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,880
You are really

1337
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,000
You still have to make them fall asleep

1338
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,440
What kind of guys make them fall asleep?

1339
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,680
I can also tell my sisters

1340
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,280
Right?

1341
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,840
There are many girls in the live broadcast room

1342
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,960
Very good

1343
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,200
Come on

1344
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,720
Recently, you are chasing the good friends of the previous ten

1345
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,960
You have to be careful about your body in the night

1346
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,920
Don't sleep too late

1347
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,640
You have to sleep at night, OK?

1348
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,000
OK, get on the bed

1349
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:13,680
Good night

1350
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,960
You said it very well

1351
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,080
Don't say it next time

1352
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,080
It's very official

1353
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,920
You are

1354
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,280
I just changed it

1355
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,520
The second version, come on

1356
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,120
Come on

1357
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,480
OK, don't watch the show

1358
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Watch it again

1359
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,720
Good night

1360
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,840
OK, both of you have a wonderful performance

1361
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,800
Because I tell you

1362
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,080
The show is very beautiful

1363
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,440
But don't be too noisy

1364
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,160
OK?

1365
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,600
You have to be careful about your rest

1366
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,680
OK, I tell you

1367
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,040
In fact, there are many good friends in our last show today

1368
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,720
In fact, they also sent some blessings

1369
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,680
Their heart also came to the scene

1370
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,280
Let's give some blessings

1371
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,320
Let the two of you take a look, OK?

1372
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,640
Let's see which of the friends sent the blessings

1373
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,680
I am actor Wang Yizhe

1374
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
Hello, everyone

1375
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,080
I am He Rui Xian

1376
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,640
Hello, everyone

1377
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,080
Hello, everyone

1378
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,560
I am actor He Feng Tian

1379
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,920
I am a doctor in the last show

1380
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,120
In the last show, I played a heroine who played the role of the heroine

1381
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,320
In the last show, I played the role of the heroine

1382
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,040
Yoyufan is a very good guard

1383
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,720
He has a relationship with Zhu Zhanji

1384
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,040
It's not just a military relationship

1385
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,720
There is also a feeling of a kind of friendship

1386
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,080
I just want to see how Feng Tian introduces

1387
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,600
He and Yao Zijin

1388
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Yao Zijin should be considered a light in Yoyufan's heart

1389
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,720
I want to silently protect him

1390
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,280
With Jinyan, there are many opponents in Zijin

1391
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,040
We have been together for a long time

1392
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,880
The mutual support behind it

1393
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,760
It becomes a good secret that no one talks about it

1394
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,600
I am in the drama of the last show

1395
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,680
The relationship between Zhu Zhanji and me

1396
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,760
Actually, it's the main character relationship

1397
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,440
It should be considered

1398
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,080
I am actually a little bit of a man

1399
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,360
And then the relationship with Yao Zijin

1400
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,560
He's hiding something

1401
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,480
See, right?

1402
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,040
I'm a little bit of a man

1403
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,480
Huang Shunxi

1404
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,160
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

1405
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,200
Love has no limit

1406
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,320
I want to steal Zhu Zhanji's food

1407
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,120
Although I am deeply concerned about Zhu Zhanji

1408
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,400
I am very willing to be with him

1409
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,960
But Zhu Zhanji is very, very, very good at cooking

1410
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,040
So I will let Yoyufan feel that when he does something bad

1411
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,840
It's not really reasonable

1412
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,520
For Yao Zijin, I want to steal

1413
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,440
Yao Zijin is too much for Yoyufan

1414
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,240
What do you mean by stealing?

1415
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,520
No matter how Yoyufan helps him and treats him

1416
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,760
And then Yoyufan is still in the heart of the past

1417
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Only Zhu Zhanji

1418
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,200
This makes me very upset

1419
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
Of course, what if you don't?

1420
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
I will be sorry to bother you

1421
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,080
Then I will be polite

1422
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,160
Ask you the simplest question

1423
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,840
If your bottle and Zhu Zhanji fell into the water at the same time

1424
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,120
Who will you save?

1425
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,040
You don't know

1426
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,600
In the play

1427
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,360
When Yin Ziping went to upgrade his dream

1428
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,280
When he was playing

1429
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,920
His son-in-law was in the next line

1430
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
His love

1431
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,640
So in front of love

1432
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,880
Love is indeed not worth mentioning

1433
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,120
And then Mr. Xu said

1434
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,280
It's also my love

1435
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,880
Mr. Xu is famous for his school-runs

1436
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,720
Just go to the school-runs at the scene

1437
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,400
Then I heard Mr. Xu

1438
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,880
It's a more magical school-run

1439
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,000
I can't help it

1440
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,280
I will laugh with him

1441
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,560
Including that Mr. Wu

1442
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,120
Mr. Wu's hair on his head

1443
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,080
It's too heavy

1444
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,560
So he runs every time

1445
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,920
The hair must be dropped

1446
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,280
Every time it falls on the ground

1447
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,960
So at this time

1448
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
Mr. Xu on the stage

1449
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,840
Will laugh there

1450
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,320
And I can't help it

1451
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,760
I will laugh with him

1452
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,000
Seeing these good friends

1453
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,720
Actually

1454
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,040
Are you in a good mood?

1455
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,440
Are you happy?

1456
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,040
But you have some little rabbits

1457
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,240
As the owner

1458
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,000
Do you want to respond a little?

1459
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,680
Because they were talking about the play

1460
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,120
Only Feng Tian said

1461
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,400
I am a school-runner

1462
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,880
It's too magical

1463
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,320
Because there are a few plays

1464
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,160
Really

1465
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,840
I am usually very serious

1466
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,680
But there are a few plays

1467
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,000
Really funny

1468
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,320
So I will laugh

1469
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,480
There is a play

1470
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,880
There is a play

1471
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,680
The maid wants to defeat us

1472
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,520
But everyone wears a long dress

1473
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,040
So when she gets up

1474
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,480
Take off her dress

1475
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,680
Then she runs like this with her dress

1476
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,560
Then I can't help it

1477
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,040
That kind of magic school-run

1478
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
It's very self-reliant

1479
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,320
If it's a performance on the scene

1480
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,120
It's not going to be played

1481
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,760
That school-run

1482
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,440
Yes

1483
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,520
It's natural to play on the scene

1484
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,360
Then ask Zijing

1485
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,640
Ask Jingyan

1486
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,760
Just now, Pingping said

1487
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,840
If Pingping and Zhu Zanji fell into the water

1488
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,800
Who will you save?

1489
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,560
Do you want to respond to the scene?

1490
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,480
Love

1491
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,160
Of course I will save Pingping first

1492
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,920
Of course I will save Pingping first

1493
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,280
Pingping is a little

1494
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,160
I need my wine

1495
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,080
Zhu Zanji

1496
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,880
He will fly anything

1497
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,720
No, he won't

1498
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,560
I believe

1499
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,240
You will

1500
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,480
You forgot you will fly

1501
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,040
I've seen it

1502
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,440
When you were on the scene

1503
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,880
There is a play

1504
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,520
He knows how to play

1505
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,280
He will play these plays

1506
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,000
Yes

1507
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,720
Artistic genius

1508
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,800
Artistic genius

1509
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,440
Yes

1510
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,240
A genius, okay?

1511
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,440
So your answer is Pingping

1512
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,560
I want to save Pingping

1513
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:22,920
Yes

1514
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,200
Take Pingping up

1515
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,440
He can't do it himself

1516
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,560
Need me

1517
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,000
So actually Zijing

1518
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,600
Is very considerate

1519
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,480
Because I believe

1520
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,760
If Zijing has a problem

1521
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,640
Zhu Zanji will save him

1522
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,520
So this is the emotional line of the play

1523
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,200
Okay?

1524
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,560
Everyone follows

1525
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,080
Thank you for your blessings

1526
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,160
I believe Jingyan and Xu Kai

1527
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,400
Have been accepted

1528
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,320
Then next

1529
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,360
Our dishes are ready

1530
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,360
Then we'll start

1531
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,200
Let's have a cup of tea

1532
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,080
Let's have a chat while eating, okay?

1533
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,800
What are you eating?

1534
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,440
Try this

1535
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,480
This is good

1536
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,640
Good

1537
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,480
Then I'll ask Zijing

1538
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,920
And ask Zhu Zanji

1539
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,280
Okay?

1540
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,480
In this kind of role

1541
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,880
Think about the two of you

1542
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,720
In the parallel space

1543
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,800
What kind of life do you think the big play

1544
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,440
Will be?

1545
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,440
Has anyone thought about it?

1546
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,960
Wait a minute, I'll have a taste first

1547
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,400
Come on, Jingyan

1548
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,080
What are you eating?

1549
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,600
It feels good

1550
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,080
They are

1551
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,040
Very light things

1552
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,840
I think they will

1553
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,720
Very happy

1554
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,520
And then

1555
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,160
Sunset

1556
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,240
And then in the palace

1557
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,280
I cook for you

1558
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,560
You give me a cloth

1559
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,960
You sing the kind of

1560
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,880
Very beautiful

1561
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,120
The kind of life of fairy-tale

1562
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,840
The kind of life that people envy

1563
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,560
The kind of life after marriage

1564
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,080
That's it

1565
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,680
After marriage

1566
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,200
Ah, you know it again, right?

1567
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,000
No

1568
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,240
This is a big play that I imagined

1569
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,440
It's okay

1570
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,120
Okay

1571
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,040
So it's a big play that you imagined, right?

1572
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,840
It's very, very happy

1573
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,880
What kind of man and woman

1574
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,760
What kind of cooking

1575
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,480
I'll make a cloth

1576
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,160
I pick water for you to wash the dishes

1577
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,280
That's not going to happen

1578
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,080
Zhu Zanji is very

1579
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,960
Very good

1580
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,400
Very good

1581
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,880
Man and woman

1582
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,120
Yes

1583
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,120
There's a group of people behind you

1584
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,400
To help you to wash the dishes

1585
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,920
Right?

1586
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,160
I think it's

1587
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,600
In the book

1588
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,440
I read the book

1589
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,600
You make a painting

1590
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,560
Then I play the piano

1591
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,760
And blow the whistle

1592
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,200
Then I can always eat

1593
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,800
What you cook is delicious

1594
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,600
Then I take you to the sea of ​​waves

1595
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,480
Well

1596
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,600
Your

1597
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,840
Yes, give me

1598
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,600
A series

1599
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,280
Yes

1600
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,240
A series

1601
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,120
That's because the two of them

1602
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,440
In the drama

1603
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,360
So this big play

1604
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,480
Usually is like this

1605
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,480
It's all more sweet, right?

1606
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,240
But what's the big play like?

1607
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,800
We can only know it by chasing ourselves

1608
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,880
I hope there's also such a beautiful big play

1609
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,400
OK

1610
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,920
Then the second question

1611
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,800
It's also what fans want to know

1612
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,480
If you can spend a day with each other in real life

1613
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,760
What do you think you will spend

1614
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,400
Is it in Xu Kai's life

1615
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,600
Or in Zhu Zanji's life

1616
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,480
Zhu Zanji appeared in your life

1617
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,800
Appeared in our 21st century

1618
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,400
Oh, that's it

1619
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,960
You lost 21

1620
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,120
2002

1621
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,160
Really

1622
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm clear

1623
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,160
You're so funny

1624
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,160
Hello

1625
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
Congratulations

1626
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,440
Don't know if you've heard our voice

1627
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,000
Actually, it's a hidden welfare part in our live broadcast

1628
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,120
In the process of live broadcast

1629
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,080
As long as the two of you say our welfare key words

1630
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,880
It will trigger our welfare mechanism

1631
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,120
So congratulations to the two members of this round

1632
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,400
Or welfare

1633
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,360
The most important details have been shared on our screen

1634
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,200
Show up

1635
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,400
Congratulations

1636
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
Oh

1637
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,400
It's fun

1638
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,480
It's so fun

1639
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,880
It's so fun

1640
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,480
I think Zhu Zanji will be very happy

1641
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,120
He should be open to the world

1642
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,960
Then

1643
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,720
How did you spend this day with him

1644
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,280
Play with him

1645
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,680
Let him eat

1646
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,960
Let him eat

1647
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,600
That we are eating now

1648
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,400
Then

1649
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,600
I'll take him to the shopping street

1650
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,960
I'll take you to make a hairstyle

1651
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,920
Take your hair down

1652
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,520
But your hair

1653
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,000
It's very important

1654
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,520
Hair

1655
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,520
Yes

1656
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,080
Take your hair down

1657
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,840
Wash your hair

1658
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,200
Make a hairstyle

1659
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,720
And then make a spa

1660
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,400
I think Zhu Zanji is so happy

1661
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,480
This should be the happiest day in his life

1662
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,280
Because it's not like

1663
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,080
When the emperor is very tired

1664
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,240
But when he comes back to the present

1665
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,160
Your hair will feel so fresh

1666
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:58,920
Xu Kai has thought about it

1667
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,960
I was killed by my grandpa

1668
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,000
Maybe you don't want to go back

1669
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,720
I will definitely bring

1670
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,800
Zijing

1671
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,960
To the movie theater

1672
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,360
Come to the movie theater one day

1673
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,960
Let him see

1674
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,680
He was living in the place where Zhu Zanji lived

1675
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,720
Let him come to the movie theater

1676
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,720
This is also my place

1677
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,160
It's also my same scene

1678
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,040
Let you feel it

1679
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,560
Is it the same?

1680
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,560
Yes

1681
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,560
But the people are different

1682
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,360
Different times

1683
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,600
Yes

1684
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,560
It feels like home

1685
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,360
But

1686
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,080
The face is not Zhu Zanji

1687
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,080
The face is Xu Kai

1688
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,640
I found out that Xu Kai has a stronger feeling in the scene

1689
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,680
Where is the place he was playing

1690
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,760
You can go to the Ming Dynasty

1691
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,240
You can go to Song Dynasty

1692
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,280
To everyone

1693
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,280
Which besieged

1694
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,240
What dig對啊

1695
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:08,960
What famous Gong

1696
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,840
But you play the penny

1697
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,520
OK

1698
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,280
I do it

1699
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,440
But you play the money

1700
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:14,680
Thank you

1701
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,640
Thank you Xu Kai

1702
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,600
For your support

1703
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,200
For your support

1704
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,160
I'm so touched.

1705
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,840
I was just talking about it. I'm so happy.

1706
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,760
We just received a message.

1707
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,160
Our fans have named it

1708
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,080
Golden Flower.

1709
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,000
Do you think there's something different

1710
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,680
between a CP and a different group

1711
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,560
in the other dramas?

1712
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,320
Or do you think

1713
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,280
you are in a similar way?

1714
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,640
I think they are

1715
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,240
the ones who are highly-loved.

1716
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,320
They are all very good.

1717
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,880
They are all

1718
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,600
the ones who are good at pulling the high-end and the high-end.

1719
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,680
The ones who are too big

1720
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,800
are the ones who are good at protecting each other.

1721
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,640
The CP of the P&K Battle.

1722
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,560
They are the ones who are good at fighting.

1723
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,880
So they are all very good-looking.

1724
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,600
What about Xu Kai?

1725
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Yes, actually, like Jing Yan said,

1726
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,720
they are all

1727
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,240
the strongest women and strong-willed.

1728
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,840
They are both good at supporting each other

1729
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,640
and growing together.

1730
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,760
I think in the way of being in love,

1731
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,960
if you want to be in love for a long time,

1732
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,920
you should be like this

1733
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,240
and play the opponent.

1734
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,160
Yes, that's right.

1735
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,200
So the more you are in love,

1736
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,200
the more you feel like you are in the future.

1737
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,080
OK, I want to ask

1738
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,880
many fans and fans.

1739
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,000
Jing Yan,

1740
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,280
this drama is

1741
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,120
made by a professional food team

1742
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,760
and is shot and shot.

1743
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,920
In the process of shooting,

1744
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,760
do you have any

1745
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,960
to control your body

1746
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,800
in order to fit the role?

1747
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,880
Actually, in my eyes,

1748
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,440
I was the most skinny one

1749
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,000
in the last few years.

1750
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,920
Before the shooting,

1751
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,600
I cut down

1752
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,960
about five or six jin.

1753
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,320
I was even thinner than the previous role.

1754
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,160
I think the reason why Yao Zijing is so skinny

1755
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,880
is that she shouldn't be too round.

1756
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,040
Not only in terms of weight,

1757
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,520
but also in terms of makeup.

1758
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,480
It's the same as Mr. Zhao Xing's.

1759
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,800
Her eyes, mouth, and face

1760
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,480
are very red.

1761
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,120
But she is almost

1762
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,240
the front of the makeup.

1763
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,880
The front part of the upper body.

1764
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,840
Actually, she is a

1765
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,640
maid.

1766
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,080
She is cooking in the kitchen.

1767
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,280
She is also in charge of the position.

1768
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,120
She is also in the body.

1769
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,360
This person seems to be

1770
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,880
a little bit more bold and sales.

1771
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,840
I think she is the one who is the most skinny.

1772
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,320
I also add to this question.

1773
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,840
I also want to play the role.

1774
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,280
Because Zhu Zhanji's role

1775
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,600
can't be too sales.

1776
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,000
Because of his background,

1777
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,600
I have a lot of weight in my group.

1778
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,000
I want to be more round.

1779
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,600
Yes.

1780
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,480
OK.

1781
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,960
Later, the scene was a bit more mature.

1782
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,960
OK.

1783
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,520
What was the most skinny

1784
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,160
when you were the most skinny?

1785
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,280
How many jin?

1786
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,520
You just said the most skinny.

1787
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,040
I usually have 95 jin.

1788
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
When I first started the show,

1789
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,320
I had 8 jin.

1790
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,600
No, I was wrong.

1791
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,000
We usually don't have that many jin.

1792
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,920
I had 90 jin.

1793
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,880
When I started the show, I had 8 jin.

1794
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,760
I had 5 jin.

1795
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,600
I had 5 jin.

1796
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,520
Then I didn't have any weight.

1797
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,920
Because it was too cold in winter.

1798
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,040
Then my body became better.

1799
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,200
And I started to get more and more round.

1800
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,160
Because I have a lot of weight.

1801
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,960
Actually, she is doing her best.

1802
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,040
I just said that

1803
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,280
because there are a lot of delicious food.

1804
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,720
The props in it

1805
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,120
should be very attractive.

1806
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,560
Who is the props answerer?

1807
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,080
The two of you.

1808
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,320
Of course, it's her.

1809
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,240
I didn't eat anything.

1810
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,480
I made it for her.

1811
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,320
I saw her next to her today.

1812
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,080
I saw her eating.

1813
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,240
Is it delicious?

1814
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,040
I always eat hot pot.

1815
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,560
I let them cook for me on the set.

1816
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,200
I haven't started filming yet.

1817
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,240
I really eat.

1818
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,200
Really?

1819
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,840
Yes.

1820
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,400
Really eat.

1821
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,200
Really eat.

1822
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,040
Really eat.

1823
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,760
Then hot pot

1824
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,480
will be eaten

1825
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,720
and there will be a little bit of seed on the next day?

1826
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,360
For the sake of the character's identity and character.

1827
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:46,680
Yes.

1828
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,680
Huang Taicun.

1829
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,400
And then to the emperor.

1830
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,640
This kind of feeling.

1831
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,040
It's also done a lot of efforts.

1832
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,720
Yes.

1833
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,680
It's paid a lot.

1834
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,440
It's for the sake of the people.

1835
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,640
It's paid a lot.

1836
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,640
Yes.

1837
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,600
Then ask Zijing.

1838
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,800
In the drama,

1839
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,720
Zhu Zhanji and You Yifan.

1840
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,720
Who is better?

1841
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,120
I can't say who Kai Kai is.

1842
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,680
Of course, Zhu Zhanji.

1843
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,880
The first time in the world.

1844
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,040
The first excellent man.

1845
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,920
Every woman loves that kind of person.

1846
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,960
No one else.

1847
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,960
What do you think

1848
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,280
he is most capable of?

1849
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,680
The most capable of Zhu Zhanji is Xu Kai Yan.

1850
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,680
No more.

1851
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,720
You said it yourself.

1852
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,520
Really?

1853
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,760
It's very sweet.

1854
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,600
Very happy.

1855
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,080
The scene is very sweet.

1856
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,800
In reality, if you meet these two types of men,

1857
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,200
who do you think will be more welcomed

1858
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,200
in real life?

1859
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,640
Of course, Zhu Zhanji.

1860
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,920
In the drama,

1861
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,480
You Zijing didn't have any expectations.

1862
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,520
He had some kind of

1863
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,360
thought about You Yifan.

1864
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,560
He never had any expectations.

1865
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,760
He has a lot of thoughts.

1866
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,120
Of course.

1867
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,080
And he has a scene.

1868
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,720
Who do you choose?

1869
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,760
Of course, I choose...

1870
00:54:58,760 --> 00:54:59,760
Yes.

1871
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,040
Zhu Zhanji.

1872
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,440
You Yifan is a treasure.

1873
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,960
Which one do you choose?

1874
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,400
Because he is a girl.

1875
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,800
He is not very safe.

1876
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,480
He thinks that

1877
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,440
some people who can protect him will like him.

1878
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,400
Because he is perfect.

1879
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,200
He thinks he is not good enough.

1880
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,040
He can only protect you.

1881
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,920
He only thinks that many girls

1882
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,280
think he is not good enough.

1883
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,520
Let me ask You Zijing.

1884
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,120
Through this skill,

1885
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,360
you have gradually reached the peak of your career.

1886
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,360
Can you tell us

1887
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,440
how You Zijing got into some difficulties

1888
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,760
on the way to the top?

1889
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,680
How did you solve your workplace crisis?

1890
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,280
There are many people who think

1891
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,400
they don't want You Zijing to be good.

1892
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,120
There will be.

1893
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,000
It's like that.

1894
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,960
It's also very difficult.

1895
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,360
The experience of the workplace.

1896
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,600
Anyway, after he got into the job,

1897
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,520
he likes his eyes more.

1898
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,560
He doesn't say who to rely on.

1899
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,600
Or who doesn't rely on.

1900
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,000
He is alone and fighting.

1901
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,040
The most important thing is

1902
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,400
his ability.

1903
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,560
His job.

1904
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,000
He did this.

1905
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,520
Of course, there will be a chance later.

1906
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,960
Someone will underestimate him.

1907
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,440
You see, it's also because of this ability

1908
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,080
that he got into the job.

1909
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,840
It's important to do your original job well.

1910
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,080
It's because of his strength.

1911
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,960
If he does well,

1912
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,280
he will be extremely motivated.

1913
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,360
He will be less,

1914
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,320
he will be discovered.

1915
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,360
Yes, he will do well.

1916
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,520
He will do well.

1917
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,760
He will be the best.

1918
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,480
It's like the words of the person.

1919
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,880
I think this is why

1920
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,480
you can do everything so well.

1921
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,120
Then ask Xu Kai.

1922
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,240
Which one of the characters

1923
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,160
is the most suitable for getting married?

1924
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,600
I think every one is suitable for getting married.

1925
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,800
I think this should be asked to the audience.

1926
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,840
Which one is more suitable for getting married?

1927
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,520
Right?

1928
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,480
Come on, let's play our fair game.

1929
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,000
Our fans,

1930
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,920
which one is the most suitable for getting married?

1931
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,320
If you ask Ji Yan,

1932
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,040
we will definitely think

1933
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,680
Zhu Zhanji is the most suitable for getting married.

1934
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,960
Do you agree?

1935
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,400
Kai's acting is very good.

1936
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,640
I think every one of them

1937
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,520
is his own feature.

1938
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,080
They are all very good.

1939
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,800
They are all perfect.

1940
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,400
Perfect.

1941
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,760
They will definitely be loved by people.

1942
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,880
Then the main characters in the drama are Yao Zijing.

1943
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,600
They often communicate through words.

1944
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,800
There are many such scenes, right?

1945
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,680
Then the scene can be drawn

1946
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,280
a new character for the two of them,

1947
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:31,840
OK?

1948
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,040
And it will be a blessing for the fans.

1949
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,640
Let's see what the soul-drawn hand is.

1950
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,000
Come on, let's play the props.

1951
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,720
OK?

1952
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,320
Come on, we are ready.

1953
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:43,840
Thank you.

1954
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,280
OK.

1955
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,240
You don't need to draw.

1956
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,240
I won't do it.

1957
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,440
You draw.

1958
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,160
I won't do it.

1959
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,280
Then can you do this?

1960
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,560
Because Xu Kai needs to draw with Ji Yan now.

1961
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,680
To draw Ji Yan's image,

1962
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,560
I think Ji Yan can give him some tips

1963
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,840
or because he draws with Zijing.

1964
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,440
So I think you can give him some tips.

1965
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,280
My advice is totally

1966
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,560
not to affect the soul-drawn hand.

1967
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,240
I'm very sorry.

1968
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,320
What kind of me is he who is so jealous of me?

1969
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,400
I can't go to that group to interfere with him.

1970
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,080
Yes.

1971
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:16,000
Good.

1972
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,960
The genius painter is born like this.

1973
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,680
You don't draw?

1974
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,080
I don't draw.

1975
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,280
I'll wait for you to draw.

1976
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,280
He should draw a mouth or a hairpin.

1977
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,400
Otherwise, the headpin should be very high.

1978
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,360
I want to draw it.

1979
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,520
And then wear that skirt.

1980
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,320
I think you can imagine it.

1981
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,920
You imagined too much.

1982
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,840
You can't draw this.

1983
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,680
Or what?

1984
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,320
I think you drew both of them?

1985
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,600
Or you only drew one?

1986
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,480
He and I.

1987
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,960
The soul-drawn hand.

1988
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,840
You only drew the genius painter.

1989
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,680
The genius painter.

1990
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,560
You can only draw...

1991
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,640
Wow, it's just shown.

1992
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,280
I can't see.

1993
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,280
You can't see?

1994
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:06,720
I can't see.

1995
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,400
Look.

1996
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:08,800
Let's try to draw closer.

1997
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,480
This is Zijing.

1998
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,000
What?

1999
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,040
This is me.

2000
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,040
How do you say?

2001
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,880
Can you give him a big hand?

2002
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,600
You can see clearly that this is a house.

2003
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,720
There are many holes in his head.

2004
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,240
There are various holes in his head.

2005
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:24,680
Yes.

2006
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,480
The head is in the head.

2007
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,680
So Zijing,

2008
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,720
I...

2009
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,040
This hat is not good.

2010
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,800
It's just a kind of...

2011
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,400
...animal.

2012
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,640
So you drew his golden tail.

2013
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,520
It's a hat.

2014
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,200
The head.

2015
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:38,520
Yes.

2016
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,280
I won't draw anything else.

2017
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,000
Other things are like eyes and nose.

2018
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,400
Including the hands and feet.

2019
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,560
They are all the same.

2020
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,440
Because they belong to Gao Yan Zhi.

2021
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:49,920
Yes.

2022
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,200
This is really high.

2023
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:53,920
OK.

2024
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,640
Since we are starting to draw the scene,

2025
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,520
can you sign your name?

2026
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,640
It's a blessing for our fans.

2027
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,600
Because we just said that

2028
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,560
there will be many blessings for you today.

2029
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:05,920
OK.

2030
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,560
A hand of soul.

2031
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:08,880
OK.

2032
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,640
A hand of soul.

2033
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:10,880
A hand of soul.

2034
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,560
Not bad.

2035
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:12,520
OK.

2036
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,040
Thank you Xu Kai.

2037
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:14,760
Thank you.

2038
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:15,800
For drawing.

2039
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,560
That's really...

2040
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,760
...a hundred and fifty million.

2041
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:19,840
OK.

2042
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,200
Please burn him down.

2043
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,720
No.

2044
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,320
We will hide him.

2045
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:24,320
It's too ugly.

2046
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,360
We will hide him.

2047
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,720
Then, please ask Xu Kai

2048
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,200
when did you post your VLOG?

2049
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,000
But your answer is

2050
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,400
in these two days.

2051
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,280
Please ask

2052
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,480
what day is it?

2053
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,040
I just wanted to say

2054
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:40,760
these two days.

2055
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,880
Then, in two days.

2056
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,480
In two days, it will be very fast.

2057
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,120
Yes.

2058
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,440
It will be very fast.

2059
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,720
It's already prepared.

2060
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,840
In two days, it will be released.

2061
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,880
Please look forward to it.

2062
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,560
It's like a dozen minutes long.

2063
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,160
Let me tell you.

2064
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,680
It's very useful.

2065
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,320
Ten minutes of editing.

2066
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,520
If you all come and watch it together,

2067
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,480
Xu Kai, OK?

2068
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,560
If you look at our live broadcast,

2069
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,640
you must go and see

2070
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,640
if there is any VLOG.

2071
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,720
I hope that our Xu Kai can have more business,

2072
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,040
OK?

2073
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:11,880
Give more fans,

2074
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,640
more encouragement.

2075
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,320
OK.

2076
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:13,720
OK.

2077
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:14,720
Thank you for your sharing.

2078
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,120

many fans and fans have received love and attention.

2080
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,880
Today, they have participated in our

2081
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,240
Yunbing class

2082
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,880
to our home broadcast.

2083
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,560
Then, let's continue to

2084
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,920
follow our

2085
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,760
all of our viewers,

2086
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,240
our live broadcast.

2087
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,400
Let's have a cup together.

2088
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,200
Let's have a cup together.

2089
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,040
Let's have a cup together.

2090
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,360
Let's have a cup together.

2091
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,360
Come on, next, Jingyan.

2092
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,400
Let's have a cup together.

2093
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,440
I hope that you can like it more.

2094
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,080
Let's have a cup together.

2095
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:40,480
OK?

2096
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,320
I hope that you can like it more.

2097
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,720
You must have a lot of it.

2098
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,600
Next, it's time for

2099
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,120
our very sweet time.

2100
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,240
It's called the feast time.

2101
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,280
I just drank some water.

2102
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,800
I must want to eat something.

2103
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,680
We will enter an interesting part.

2104
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,320
Jingyan will taste

2105
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,800
five kinds of candy.

2106
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,360
Xu Kai needs to

2107
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,840
guess what kind of taste

2108
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,080
he eats.

2109
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,640
Let's show you

2110
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,640
which kinds of candy.

2111
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,720
Our five candies

2112
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,400
have been placed in...

2113
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,560
What's wrong, Xu Kai?

2114
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:11,920
Nothing.

2115
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,600
You want to give a reaction?

2116
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,280
No.

2117
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,400
I'm already late.

2118
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,120
Our props have been placed in.

2119
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,680
We just received five kinds of candy.

2120
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,720
Among them,

2121
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,800
there are lemon candy,

2122
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,640
some soft candy,

2123
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,640
some dancing candy,

2124
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,680
air candy,

2125
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,680
and a cotton candy.

2126
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,720
Air candy

2127
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,440
doesn't have anything inside.

2128
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,800
It's just that it has to be performed by five kinds of food.

2129
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,760
So, this is a little test

2130
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,560
for Jingyan.

2131
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,040
Jingyan needs to rely on your acting skills,

2132
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:37,600
OK?

2133
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,200
It's too difficult.

2134
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,000
Xu Kai.

2135
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,360
If Xu Kai guesses any of them,

2136
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:44,160
Jingyan can choose a candy for him.

2137
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,720
Let him eat it immediately.

2138
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:47,360
OK.

2139
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,920
Jingyan, if you are ready,

2140
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:49,920
let's start.

2141
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,520
OK.

2142
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,280
One for me.

2143
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:54,960
One for you.

2144
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,480
Xu Kai needs to close his eyes now.

2145
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,680
OK.

2146
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,720
No.

2147
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,200
Two.

2148
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,480
Two.

2149
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,200
OK.

2150
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,520
I'll close my eyes when I eat it.

2151
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:04,800
OK.

2152
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:05,760
I'll close my eyes when I eat it.

2153
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,560
I can finally eat something.

2154
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,160
OK.

2155
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,040
All of our audiences know about it.

2156
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,760
It looks so delicious.

2157
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,320
OK.

2158
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:21,880
Let's start.

2159
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,360
Xu Kai, please open your eyes.

2160
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:26,520
What expression?

2161
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,200
Why can't I?

2162
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,800
Pili Pala.

2163
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,760
You want to lie to me?

2164
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,560
Pili Pala said it all.

2165
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:38,760
You want to say I'm a bad guy?

2166
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:39,880
I'm very good to you.

2167
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,880
Close your eyes.

2168
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,720
It must be...

2169
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,280
It's not sweet.

2170
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,120
What's the name of the sweet candy?

2171
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:47,320
Here.

2172
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,120
Sweet.

2173
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,520
Sweet.

2174
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,120
Is it cotton candy?

2175
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,040
OK.

2176
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,280
The answer you gave is three, two, one.

2177
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,680
Cotton candy.

2178
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,360
You are...

2179
01:03:58,360 --> 01:03:59,920
I'm so nervous.

2180
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:01,960
Jingyan,

2181
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:05,800
the final answer Xu Kai gave is cotton candy.

2182
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,640
Don't you believe me?

2183
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,280
Do you believe me?

2184
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,920
I thought you were lying to me.

2185
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,520
Are you really going to dance to the candy?

2186
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,960
The real one is...

2187
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,760
You swear you really...

2188
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,240
You really dance to the candy?

2189
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,880
I swear I really dance to the candy.

2190
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,760
I said it was Pili Pala.

2191
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,320
You don't believe me?

2192
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,800
Jingyan, you are so sincere.

2193
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,680
Why do you think Xu Kai is cotton candy?

2194
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,480
Why?

2195
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,560
I'm satisfied.

2196
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,520
I'm satisfied.

2197
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,840
You are crying.

2198
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,440
So,

2199
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,040
the first one is a failure.

2200
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,000
OK?

2201
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,240
Jingyan, you can just dance to the candy.

2202
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,400
Let Xu Kai eat it.

2203
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,840
You can also eat cotton candy.

2204
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,360
Let me try the Pili Pala.

2205
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,080
Yes, Pili Pala.

2206
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:48,840
Dance to the candy.

2207
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,960
Here.

2208
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,160
You can also feel it.

2209
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,920
We have loved it since we were little.

2210
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,120
I haven't had it for a long time.

2211
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,640
It's delicious.

2212
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,200
Really?

2213
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,000
Yes, it should be delicious.

2214
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,160
This is a punishment.

2215
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,520
It's not a punishment.

2216
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:06,840
I think so too.

2217
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,880
But there is no way to

2218
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,760
dance to the candy at Jingyan's scene.

2219
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,560
He doesn't believe me.

2220
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,320
He doesn't believe this candy.

2221
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,640
It's the scene where he gives everyone cotton candy

2222
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:19,320
and Xu Kai's cotton candy.

2223
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:19,960
It feels like a musical.

2224
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,040
It tastes like...

2225
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,320
Wow, it's so good.

2226
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,600
It's really good.

2227
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,520
I can hear the sound.

2228
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,440
It tastes so bad.

2229
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,280
What does it taste like?

2230
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,360
It tastes like strawberry.

2231
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,240
But it doesn't taste like strawberry.

2232
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,800
But it's the Pili Pala.

2233
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,720
It's out.

2234
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,360
It's very Pili.

2235
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,440
I think it's very big.

2236
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,040
It's much bigger than you just saw.

2237
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,120
You just...

2238
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,560
You just ate a bite.

2239
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,760
It's half-pickled.

2240
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,720
I ate half-pickled.

2241
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,800
Pili Pala.

2242
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,000
You just don't believe me.

2243
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:47,920
There's no way.

2244
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,000
It's useless to eat more.

2245
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:51,440
Okay.

2246
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,800
I don't know if Xu Kai

2247
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,800
will take the second challenge.

2248
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,520
Let's see if you believe Jingyan.

2249
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,280
Okay?

2250
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:57,480
Okay.

2251
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:58,320
If you're ready,

2252
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,280
close your eyes.

2253
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,360
Tian Hei, please close your eyes.

2254
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,800
I'll definitely believe you this time.

2255
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,640
Come on.

2256
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,880
Come on.

2257
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,240
Don't believe me.

2258
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,960
The first time Jingyan was sincere.

2259
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,480
You were sincere.

2260
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:11,160
Let's see what the second time was like.

2261
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,320
I'm a person who doesn't deserve to believe.

2262
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,360
I'll definitely believe you this time.

2263
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:16,960
Come on.

2264
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,880
How can you play this?

2265
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,680
This thing.

2266
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,200
This is also very difficult.

2267
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,920
This is my punishment.

2268
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,160
I'm not good at it.

2269
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,240
Just watch Jingyan

2270
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,280
play the sugar, okay?

2271
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,560
Play the sugar for everyone.

2272
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,720
Play the sugar for Xu Kai.

2273
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,320
I'm thinking.

2274
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,480
Don't move.

2275
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,120
I'm looking for something.

2276
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:39,800
Okay.

2277
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,800
Think about it.

2278
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,320
Give me one.

2279
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,160
That one.

2280
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,600
Okay, I got it.

2281
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:46,680
Give me this.

2282
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,080
I found it.

2283
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,160
I can help with my material.

2284
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,320
Open your eyes, please.

2285
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:51,920
Okay.

2286
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,480
Xu Kai, please open your eyes.

2287
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,720
Open your eyes.

2288
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,080
You want to lie to me again?

2289
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:03,880
You...

2290
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,120
You said it was sincere.

2291
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,760
This thing.

2292
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,040
The thing that's in it.

2293
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:10,440
This is the sugar.

2294
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,200
I want to say cotton candy.

2295
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,200
Do you believe it?

2296
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,200
Do you believe it?

2297
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,160
Really cotton candy?

2298
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:18,080
It's been a long time since I've thought about it.

2299
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,440
I'm so confident.

2300
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,720
I think you don't believe me.

2301
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,200
You still don't believe me?

2302
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,320
No, I don't.

2303
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,120
I'm just concerned.

2304
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:24,880
You should confirm it.

2305
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,240
Cotton candy.

2306
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,680
Are you really believing it?

2307
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,240
I'm believing it.

2308
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,000
You really believe me?

2309
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,240
You're thinking about it.

2310
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,040
What do you mean you don't believe me?

2311
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,120
Cotton candy.

2312
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,880
The answer you're giving is...

2313
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:37,680
Cotton candy.

2314
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,320
Cotton candy.

2315
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,200
It's a brother.

2316
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,240
It's a brother.

2317
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,040
It's a friend.

2318
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,280
You're really good to Xu Kai.

2319
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,080
Okay, the first time...

2320
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:52,920
The second time, I guess...

2321
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:53,800
The first time I didn't guess right.

2322
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:55,000
The second time I guessed right.

2323
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:56,840
Then Jingyan...

2324
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,040
I think Xu Kai guessed right.

2325
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,040
The third time we came here,

2326
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,840
with real acting, okay?

2327
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,680
Let's not give any hint.

2328
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,080
How is it?

2329
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,000
Okay, take my props.

2330
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,240
Take my props.

2331
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,120
Come on.

2332
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:12,920
The third one.

2333
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,000
Okay, the third one.

2334
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,120
I really don't want to eat this.

2335
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,520
I'm a little scared of this taste.

2336
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,760
This is really my punishment.

2337
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,280
Oh my god, you're gonna have a round of eyes later.

2338
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:22,520
This taste.

2339
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:24,600
You eat it.

2340
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,360
You eat it.

2341
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:29,720
Cotton candy.

2342
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,480
I hate this taste the most.

2343
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,560
I really don't like this taste.

2344
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,040
I can't.

2345
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,280
I give up.

2346
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,280
This is my punishment.

2347
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,840
Because cotton candy is like stinky tofu.

2348
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,000
Some people like it.

2349
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,960
They don't like it.

2350
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,280
This taste is bigger than fruit flavor.

2351
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,760
The cotton candy inside

2352
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,240
is too strong.

2353
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:47,920
How about this?

2354
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,400
Xu Kai,

2355
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,080
do you want to perform a scene

2356
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,000
to guess Jingyan's guess?

2357
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,400
Okay.

2358
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,080
Okay, close your eyes.

2359
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:55,680
Okay.

2360
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,120
It's the same, okay?

2361
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,120
Come on.

2362
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,520
Look at how you treat Xu Kai.

2363
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,720
How you treat Jingyan.

2364
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,880
Let's take a look.

2365
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,320
I'm gonna eat it.

2366
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,240
What is this?

2367
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,080
What are you eating?

2368
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:19,000
I'm not good at eating.

2369
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,200
I don't believe you.

2370
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:22,560
I don't believe her.

2371
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,160
She ate it.

2372
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,080
I think it's like air.

2373
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,640
Let's take a look.

2374
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:31,600
Cotton candy.

2375
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:34,920
Okay, the last one

2376
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,720
we give Jingyan is

2377
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:37,800
321.

2378
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,040
Cotton candy.

2379
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,200
Congratulations, Jingyan.

2380
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,360
You can eat a cotton candy.

2381
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,400
Is it sour?

2382
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,200
No, it's air candy.

2383
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:46,960
You're wrong.

2384
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,080
You can eat a cotton candy.

2385
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,160
She is the first one

2386
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,680
I believe in.

2387
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,160
I think she didn't eat it.

2388
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,320
It's air candy.

2389
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,440
You should try the cotton candy.

2390
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,280
Do you know that?

2391
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,080
Try the cotton candy.

2392
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,040
I'll eat it and you can eat it.

2393
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,760
It's sweet.

2394
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:01,720
I'll also eat a cotton candy.

2395
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,240
Wow.

2396
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,240
So sweet.

2397
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,000
It's too sweet.

2398
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:09,920
Do you think

2399
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,720
this candy is sweet?

2400
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,440
It's sweet.

2401
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,520
It's all wow.

2402
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,600
It's sweet.

2403
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,440
A candy that is the sweetest in 2022.

2404
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,480
A candy that is the sweetest in 2022.

2405
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,960
You're making fun of me.

2406
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,720
Hello.

2407
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:22,720
Congratulations.

2408
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,040
I don't know if you heard our voices.

2409
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,720
Actually, it's a hidden

2410
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,880
part of our live broadcast.

2411
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,720
During the live broadcast,

2412
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,520
as long as you two

2413
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,760
say our lucky words,

2414
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,560
we will trigger our welfare mechanism.

2415
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,440
So congratulations to the two members

2416
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,080
of this round of welfare.

2417
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,440
You will get a sign

2418
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,640
and a sign of the five-year-old.

2419
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,520
So the most important details

2420
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,480
have been shown on our screen.

2421
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:44,480
Congratulations.

2422
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,960
Thank you, Ji Yan.

2423
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,640
And thank you, Xu Kai.

2424
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,160
It's been so long.

2425
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,280
Oh.

2426
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,920
You mean the keyword, right?

2427
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:52,760
Yes, the keyword.

2428
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,200
But you don't know what the keyword is.

2429
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,280
We will give you the welfare at any time.

2430
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:56,800
Okay.

2431
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:57,720
We have already seen the two of you

2432
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,480
in the air.

2433
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:01,800
I think Ji Yan is very, very, very

2434
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,680
reliable and sincere.

2435
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,560
Including the acting is very, very good.

2436
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,400
Xu Kai just showed a

2437
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,600
feeling that all the candies have been shown.

2438
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,600
So you can see the acting.

2439
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,960
The dessert just now

2440
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,120
is that both of you have tasted the dessert.

2441
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,720
Next, we have a surprise

2442
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,880
for the viewers of the live broadcast.

2443
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,760
That is our wonderful

2444
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,320
flower-sweet and generous.

2445
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,120
I think everyone is already excited.

2446
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:26,520
Then follow our two main actors.

2447
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,640
Let's take a look.

2448
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,600
Flower-sweet.

2449
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,360
Flower-sweet.

2450
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:33,680
W 병-badosang.

2451
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:34,360
He stillöt

2452
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:48,380
ordinance the

2453
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,360
hat

2454
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:56,880
hope

2455
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,880
I can't do it.

2456
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,880
I can't keep on doing it.

2457
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,880
We are in the same team.

2458
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:10,880
You are in the same team, right?

2459
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,880
Because you see, this team is a little confused.

2460
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
There is nothing wrong with it.

2461
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:17,880
Okay, then I will go.

2462
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,880
Qingyang is not good.

2463
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,880
I mean, the whole team is different.

2464
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,880
So mean.

2465
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,880
What is this?

2466
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,880
Don't be afraid.

2467
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,880
Qingyang, I'm sorry.

2468
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,880
Zhang Wu, it's on the side.

2469
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,880
Your Highness, don't say that.

2470
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,880
This painting, maybe someone will use it.

2471
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,880
Mom, I'm the mouse of the hidden head.

2472
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,880
The moon is good tonight.

2473
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,880
Let's go to the moon.

2474
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:29,880
I'm alive for you.

2475
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,880
It seems to be the only one in my life.

2476
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,880
You are always cold.

2477
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,880
I won't feel bad.

2478
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,880
I'm fine.

2479
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,880
I tell you, I won't let you go.

2480
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,880
I don't want to be your concubine.

2481
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,880
I don't want to live for you.

2482
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,880
I don't want to be a puppet.

2483
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,880
Your enemy is not good at fighting.

2484
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:11,880
I'm afraid you will lose your faith in war.

2485
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,880
You have no right to risk your life for others.

2486
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,880
Why don't you ask?

2487
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,880
The emperor is not easy.

2488
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:20,880
God is not easy.

2489
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,880
I just want to be rich and rich.

2490
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,880
As long as I can go up, I can do anything.

2491
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:28,880
I won't let these dirty hands touch them.

2492
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,880
Let me go.

2493
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,880
Let me go.

2494
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,880
I can't.

2495
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,880
There is a assassin. Protect your highness.

2496
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:35,880
Your highness.

2497
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,880
As long as the emperor is in a hurry,

2498
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,880
the emperor won't let me do it.

2499
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,880
It's so fun.

2500
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,880
Because I was in the water alone.

2501
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,880
I was playing the piano alone.

2502
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:48,880
I was not blowing the whistle.

2503
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,880
But Xu Kai was playing the piano.

2504
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:50,880
Xu Kai was playing the piano.

2505
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,880
I was shooting a few scenes.

2506
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:53,880
The director said,

2507
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:54,880
Someone said,

2508
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,880
I'm sorry, Mr. Kai, you played the piano.

2509
01:14:58,880 --> 01:14:59,880
I said,

2510
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,880
why didn't you tell me half an hour ago?

2511
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,880
I was blowing the piano in a place that was reversed.

2512
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,880
It's the same as the one you said.

2513
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,880
I know.

2514
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,880
So, in the process of shooting,

2515
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,880
there are still many fun places.

2516
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,880
Can you two play in this time?

2517
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,880
Because everyone is always chasing.

2518
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,880
Can you give us more information?

2519
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,880
It's very warm.

2520
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,880
It's very romantic.

2521
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,880
It's romantic.

2522
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:27,880
Oh, no.

2523
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,880
It's romantic.

2524
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,880
It's not romantic.

2525
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,880
It's not romantic.

2526
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:31,880
What official words are there?

2527
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:32,880
I'll think about it.

2528
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,880
A kind of plot.

2529
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,880
It's a plot.

2530
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:38,880
It's your turn, Jingyan.

2531
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:39,880
I've said a few key words.

2532
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,880
Oh, okay.

2533
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:42,880
Key words.

2534
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:43,880
Very official key words.

2535
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,880
I'll say one.

2536
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
I've already said a lot.

2537
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,880
I think it's really the biggest thing in the play.

2538
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,880
The most important thing is the balance of the two of us.

2539
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,880
Okay, I've finished what I said today.

2540
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,880
What happened?

2541
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,880
Everyone, please follow.

2542
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,880
The plot behind is more wonderful.

2543
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,880
Jingyan also revealed herself.

2544
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,880
I think it's a great blessing.

2545
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,880
Don't miss it.

2546
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,880
Why is the food so delicious?

2547
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,880
It's so delicious.

2548
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,880
It's warm and romantic.

2549
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,880
I'll accompany you through every moment.

2550
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:31,880
I can't help but miss the plot in my heart.

2551
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,880
I'll let you...

2552
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:35,880
It's gone.

2553
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,880
It's gone.

2554
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,880
I'm so poor.

2555
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,880
There are food and sweet love.

2556
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,880
And sweet love.

2557
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:47,880
There's no more word.

2558
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,880
Sweet love and...

2559
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,880
some small emotions.

2560
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:54,880
Some small emotions.

2561
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,880
It's just a simple meal.

2562
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,880
I hope you can support us.

2563
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,880
I wish you a happy 2022.

2564
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,880
Congratulations.

2565
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:04,880
Did you hear the sound of the horn?

2566
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,880
It's a hidden blessing part of the live broadcast.

2567
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,880
In the live broadcast,

2568
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:11,880
as long as you receive the key word of our blessing,

2569
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,880
you will be able to activate our blessing mechanism.

2570
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,880
Congratulations to the two members of the round of the blessing.

2571
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,880
You will get a card and a signature photo of the five-year-old.

2572
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,880
And a mango TV membership card.

2573
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,880
The most important news is already posted on our screen.

2574
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,880
Congratulations.

2575
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,880
Of course, there's also a bell.

2576
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,880
This is our mango TV little cat.

2577
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:35,880
The two main actors for our top ten are Zhu Zhanji,

2578
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,880
and Yao Zijing.

2579
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,880
The role model for the role model.

2580
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,880
Okay?

2581
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,880
It's the same kind of gift for everyone.

2582
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,880
Okay, thank you.

2583
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,880
Thank you for coming to our top ten round of the blessing broadcast.

2584
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,880
We have so many wonderful moments with you.

2585
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,880
I hope you can support the top ten.

2586
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:00,880
Thank you for supporting Xu Kai and Jingyan.

2587
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,880
Next time, thank you to both of you.

2588
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,880
Thank you Jingyan.

2589
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,880
Thank you.

2590
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
Thank you Xu Kai.

2591
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,880
Okay.

2592
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,880
Then remember, after watching the live broadcast,

2593
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:09,880
we will go after you right away.

2594
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:10,880
Bye bye.

2595
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:11,880
Bye bye.

2596
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:12,880
Bye bye.

2597
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,880
Bye bye.

2598
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:14,880
Thank you Jingxin.
