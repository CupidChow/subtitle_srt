00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm not afraid of the world.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm afraid of the world.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm afraid of the world.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm afraid of the world.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm afraid of the world.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm afraid of the world.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm afraid of the world.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm afraid of the world.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm afraid of the world.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm afraid of the world.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm afraid of the world.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm afraid of the world.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm afraid of the world.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm afraid of the world.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid of the world.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid of the world.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid of the world.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No matter what, I won't love you.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've never begged you to save me.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not saving you.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's your hands that have been restored to the past.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yuhua, as a chef, you must be on the battlefield.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Pepper.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come on.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Test Bright Sun

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kyong.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,320
Can I find another girl outlined in this changing of the direction of her household

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,280
for good or bad,

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I will surely take my money.

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,760
Your Highness,

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
that means

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,320
I am an official of everyone?

34
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,760
Your Highness.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's been a long time.

36
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,480
Your Highness,

37
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
the rose cake may be a little too fresh.

38
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,680
Do you want to use something else?

39
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,320
I'm very angry now.

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,720
Don't you know I'm on fire?

41
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,200
Take it away.

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

43
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
Bring some honey and osmanthus.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,920
Go.

45
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,320
Go here.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,840
Go.

47
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,400
What's wrong?

48
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,360
You're not feeling well?

49
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,920
It's just that the lady is taking the medicine.

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,040
Take it away.

51
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,680
That's strange.

52
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,080
Why is Miao Xian taking the medicine?

53
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,960
You're taking the medicine, too.

54
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,760
And you didn't invite a doctor.

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,760
What?

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,280
Is it the prescription you prescribed?

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,120
I've never seen anyone around you.

58
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,920
Hua Ping is too young.

59
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm afraid she can't handle it.

60
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,560
So I specially picked

61
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
the four spiritual powers to send them here.

62
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,760
My lady,

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,360
the flower is so beautiful.

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,080
Greetings to you, Your Majesty.

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,120
Greetings.

66
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
She...

67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,260
Your Highness the Empress.

68
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,760
My Queen,

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,900
your rebellious baking came in early this morning.

70
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,200
Leave us.

71
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,480
Yes.

72
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,720
It's okay if you don't like it.

73
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
I'll send someone to send you off tomorrow.

74
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Mother.

75
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,720
I'm not in charge of you.

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,240
If you're a normal person,

77
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,360
I won't interfere with the family.

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
But are you?

79
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,640
You're the crown prince of the Eastern Palace,

80
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,160
Chu Jun of the Yi State.

81
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,760
If you don't have the Purple Sleeves,

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,280
who will take responsibility for the people of Jiangshan?

83
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,320
Mother.

84
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,400
You're still young.

85
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
You'll have the Purple Sleeves sooner or later.

86
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,000
Why are you so anxious?

87
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm not a man.

88
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,320
I don't want to be a man.

89
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,880
But the people are waiting

90
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,280
and waiting for the birth of the famous future heir.

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,520
How about this?

92
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,360
If you don't like

93
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,480
the concubines of the Eastern Palace,

94
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,960
then choose again.

95
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,320
You'll be satisfied with it.

96
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,320
Mother.

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,040
They're all good.

98
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm not dissatisfied with it.

99
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,960
They're all good.

100
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,280
But you're not the one who's loyal to them.

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,560
Mother.

102
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,080
If you send someone here again,

103
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll send Yuan Yang back.

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,480
Don't worry about it.

105
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,360
I'll take my leave.

106
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Zheng Qi.

107
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,360
You can't take responsibility for this.

108
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,320
Come back.

109
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,160
I will 수도 appreciation show here.

110
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I will help the concubines.

111
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,200
Watch it!

112
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,800
Is it necessary to make money from the top restaurant?

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,120
It's logical.

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,000
Master.

115
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,200
This child.

116
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,480
He doesn't understand it.

117
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,560
If I don't swordsman them today,

118
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,360
they will become criminals.

119
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,800
But he doesn't like the person he sent.

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,040
Then choose one he likes.

121
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
What are you doing?

122
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,480
Mo Shang,

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,880
no- cognac is usually found on late night,

124
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,400
I've Sherlock in Wicked왕 is saying

125
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,000
that if aDemon falls out in a time,

126
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,280
it ends withums buds

127
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:20,640
and

128
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,480
I once told you

129
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,800
that everything is劲善 before,

130
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,560
so劲善

131
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,520
is a requirement for Those who use sa 까 into Isidut Timingw well.

132
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,520
to preserve the original flavor and essence of the ingredients

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,520
and make the food that has not been fully recovered.

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Since you chose to focus on the good,

135
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
you should choose the ingredients that are important

136
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,520
to the body of the person who uses the good.

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Come on, tell me.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
How did you choose to remove the ingredients?

139
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,520
I have written down the original draft in the capital.

140
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
The only one that has been promoted is the Ruli,

141
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
and the one that has been promoted by Jinzhou Jun

142
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
and the one that has been promoted by Beidu.

143
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,520
But after several tests,

144
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
I found that the perfume leaves of the previous year

145
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
had a great effect on the skin.

146
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,520
So I got it into the medicine this time.

147
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,520
I know that the key point of the treatment is really good.

148
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
But the user is child-friendly.

149
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,520
The flavor of the peppercorn is too heavy. He won't like it.

150
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
It's better to use the oil and honey.

151
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,520
Also, the skin is clear and light.

152
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
It is very effective.

153
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
It is the medicine itself.

154
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,520
If you remove the skin, it will be a serious problem.

155
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,520
You said that it is not only good for the medical field.

156
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
I am a little bit serious.

157
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
As a chef,

158
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,520
I always know the characteristics of the ingredients.

159
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,520
I understand.

160
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Let's start with the point of the dream.

161
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Zi Jin!

162
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Mr. Meng,

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,520
to take the position of the head of the company to the capital, Xiao Yeguozihe.

165
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
That's Mr. Meng.

Come, Zi Jin.

175
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
Come and help me.

176
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,200

Go ahead.

181
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
Yes.

182
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
Your Highness, it's late at night.

183
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,840
When you were dreaming, you took a bamboo jade.

184
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
You were also a concubine and a maid.

185
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,840
You went to the funeral room.

186
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
You were accompanied by a blind woman.

187
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
You were able to see the whole world.

188
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Please have a seat.

189
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,840
Do you remember our betrothal?

190
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,840
I remember.

191
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
I remember.

192
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I remember.

193
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
I remember.

194
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I remember.

195
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
Do you remember?

196
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Miss Sha, why are you so bitter?

197
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Who can fight the royal family?

198
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
If you continue like this,

199
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
who can save you in the world?

200
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Crown Princess.

201
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Crown Princess, don't be angry.

202
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,840
Tell me slowly.

203
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,840
She will be suspicious.

204
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
When a person is born,

205
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
he will be like a dragon in a cage.

206
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
If you want to return to nature,

207
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
unless you draw a map.

208
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
You haven't been in the prison for half a year.

209
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
You are always in the old window.

210
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Do you really think

211
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
you can surpass the outside world?

212
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
You can replace your people with the past.

213
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,840
But I can't resist.

214
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
And I can't let anyone say no to me.

215
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Crown Princess.

216
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,840
I saw Ah Li grow up.

217
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,840
She is a good girl who knows the rules.

218
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
She is a good girl.

219
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Please look at my face.

220
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Give her another chance.

221
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Silly child.

222
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
You can't enter the palace.

223
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
You have to go two ways.

224
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Go out or die.

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
You are so young.

226
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,840
Do you really want to get your hair done?

227
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Do you want to live a long life?

228
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Crown Princess.

229
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,840
You have broken into the palace.

230
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
You are not afraid of getting caught?

231
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,840
I am sure.

232
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
I advise you not to be too ambitious.

233
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,840
You are always too naive.

234
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,840
But I am not afraid.

235
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Dare to bet?

236
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
When you have the honor to be the emperor,

237
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,840
and you see my son again,

238
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,840
you will be the one who will be the king.

239
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
By then,

240
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
you will be the king of the palace.

241
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
You will be the king of the palace.

242
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
You will be the king of the palace.

243
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
By then,

244
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,840
I will wait for you to beg me to give you this grace.

245
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,840
You have been in the palace for a while.

246
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,840
Do you know where the world belongs?

247
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Your Majesty.

248
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
The so-called royal family.

249
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,840
They are rich and rich.

250
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
They have the highest power.

251
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,840
They are the most ambitious in the world.

252
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Have you ever met the crown prince?

253
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
Your Highness.

254
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
He is wise and wise.

255
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
He knows how to break the rule.

256
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,840
He has a heart that loves the people.

257
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,840
I will give you the order tomorrow.

258
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,840
I will confer you as the crown prince.

259
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,840
I thank Your Highness for your kindness.

260
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Please take back your order.

261
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,840
What did you say?

262
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I am blessed and blessed.

263
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
I am not afraid to accept it.

264
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,840
The crown prince is not the crown prince.

265
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,840
The crown prince is not the crown prince.

266
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
You are the one who is free.

267
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,840
But you have a fate that is destined between you and him.

268
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Do you want to break the rule?

269
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:42,840
I am lucky to be in the palace.

270
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,840
I can get along with you.

271
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,840
I can get along with him.

272
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Your Highness.

273
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
I am really sorry for you.

274
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,840
But love and freedom are the key.

275
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,840
I don't want to be a concubine.

276
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Please allow me to do so.

277
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,840
Do you know what you are talking about?

278
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,840
Your Highness promised me that you would let me go.

279
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,840
How dare you talk to me like that?

280
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
I am the main character of the harem.

281
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
If I don't let you go,

282
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,840
you will have to be the crown prince in the harem.

283
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
You will be the crown prince for the royal family.

284
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,840
I am childish and stubborn.

285
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,840
I am not wise.

286
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,840
I don't deserve to be the crown prince.

287
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,840
How dare you say such a thing?

288
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Your bones are hard.

289
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
You can't handle the sharp knife and sword.

290
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,840
You are firm and can't handle the high and high power.

291
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Why can you talk to me like that?

292
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,840
You just use my tolerance and pity.

293
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,840
When you have lost your patience,

294
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,840
your brother, your grandson,

295
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,840
will be in a moment of suffering.

296
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,840
The royal family said that

297
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,840
the empress is gentle and generous.

298
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
But they all saw you wrong.

299
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,840
Your will is more firm than any man.

300
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Your decision is far more common.

301
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
But...

302
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Yu Qingzhi is not going back until he is dead.

303
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
I will take my leave.

304
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Your Highness, it's not reasonable.

305
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
You shouldn't have forgiven her.

306
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
It's really soft and sweet.

307
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
It's crispy and delicious.

308
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,840
When I was in Luonan,

309
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,840
she could be a good cook.

310
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
But she didn't have the time to cook for me.

311
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,840
Mother is right.

312
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,840
She is a good girl.

313
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Your Highness.

314
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
I just want to see

315
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
if there is anyone in the world

316
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
who dares to be impulsive and reckless.

317
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Even

318
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
the arrangement of the enemy's life.

319
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,840
I will take care of it.

320
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,840
I will take care of it.

321
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
I will take care of it.

322
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
I will take care of it.

323
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I will take care of it.

324
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,840
I will take care of it.

325
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
I will take care of it.

326
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
I will take care of it.

327
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,840
I will take care of it.

328
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
I will take care of it.

329
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,840
I will take care of it.

330
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I will take care of it.

331
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,840
I will take care of it.

332
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
I will take care of it.

333
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,840
I will take care of it.

334
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
I will take care of it.

335
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,840
I will take care of it.

336
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Wait here for me.

337
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,840
What's the matter with your deep depression?

338
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,560
What is this?

339
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,280
Qiu Zifu.

340
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,560
It's a strange power.

341
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,440
I don't need it.

342
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,960
If you come to me for this,

343
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,120
I'll go back first.

344
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,400
Your Highness.

345
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,440
Take it.

346
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,600
I said I don't need it.

347
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,640
Sister.

348
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,840
Actually, there's Wu Zisi.

349
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,080
It doesn't matter.

350
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,440
I sincerely

351
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
ask God for help.

352
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,400
I hope you can live a peaceful life.

353
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That's enough.

354
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,600
Sister.

355
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,160
Why do you keep saying

356
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,880
such strange things tonight?

357
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,760
Sister.

358
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,760
Changqing.

359
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,080
Who are you?

360
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,760
I know.

361
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,560
The Chemical Waist Pillar.

362
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,680
Another day.

363
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,360
Ziping.

364
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,000
What's the fuss?

365
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,560
Why didn't you keep your mind?

366
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm fine.

367
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,360
I wonder when the knife-making workshop

368
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,240
will be held.

369
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,200
What?

370
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,680
Last time, I saw Fang Nian Shan making Wen Zao tofu.

371
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,800
I heard that there are 158 tofu dishes

372
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,480
in the tofu banquet.

373
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,080
She's already in the fire.

374
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,840
She's always treating that tofu.

375
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,160
I don't know what she's doing.

376
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,840
Follow me.

377
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,480

But there are the most abundant kind

to become a talent in the field.

382
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,840
Every year,

for household registration.

386
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,640
The newly done P homeless

387
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,200

for the reconstruction of the same period.

393
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,720
Why did you stop me from going to school?

394
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,800
I think you're not scolding the merchants.

395
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,200
You're scolding the exchange of the wealth

396
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,480
that the father sent to all the places.

397
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,800
Do you know that

398
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,200
most of the people who the father sent

399
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,720
are people he admires.

400
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,360
Some even

401
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,320
have been serving for years.

402
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
Do you think

403
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,280
father believes in you or them?

404
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,600
I can't let such a person

405
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,880
be killed by the dye.

406
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,240
As the Александ of Ourーン,

whether the revenge can beuzn't.

00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,320
I will be framed by my own people.

411

461
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,640

Yes.

466
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,320
Huh?

467
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Did you date Jin Yirong

468
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,360

469
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,880

If anything goes wrong with your protection,

471
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,520
you'd be the one who does them wrong.

472
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,280
Be careful.

473
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,400
It'd make you troubles if someone comes to me.

474
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,440
Since His Highness knew about me,

475
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,440
I've been by my side since I was young.

476
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Once, I fell off the horse.

477
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
He came to guard me and was seriously injured for a year.

478
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Young Master,

479
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
he was a minor who was born in danger.

480
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,440
He was also a bloodthirsty.

481
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
I'll go get the fan.

482
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440

ugly to you.

487
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Why does it taste so good?

488
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
it's greasy.

489
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Zi Jin.

490
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,440

You ran so fast just now.

492
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,560
You didn't even ask me.

493
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,040
What's the matter?

494
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,840
I...

495
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,280

Your Highness.

High Tai Fei,

506
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,640
if I don't remember the correct space,

507
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
those comparisons

508
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,760
You haven't got married yet, have you?

509
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,280
Master Hu,

510
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,640
you're not willing to give up

511
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,120
after you've reached this level?

512
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,240
No matter what, I'm a master.

513
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,320
I can't even dare to

514
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,160
let you go in front of me.

515
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
Is this necessary now?

516
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,560
You're the master of the Shangshu Bureau

517
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,160
in your dream.

518
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,040
But the competition is the competition.

519
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,720
How can I let people

520
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,440
take the challenge?

521
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,640
In the third round,

522
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,640
are you willing to fight?

523
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,040
Why are you so stubborn?

524
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,880
The Shangyuan Festival

525
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,360
is the 100th time for the Shangshu Bureau.

526
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,560
We'll do it.

527
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,480
If I win,

528
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,160
I'll have to face the world

529
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,280
and admit it myself.

530
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,280
If I fail,

531
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,760
I'll leave the palace myself

532
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,040
and never step into the capital again.

533
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,320
How?

534
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:51,640
Yao Yanzi's

535
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,480
Let me see it.

536
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,880
a PD

537
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
Guo Yanzi wants you to wordt

538
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,040
Now, he's humiliated.

539
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,840
Who else in his dream

540
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,440
would take advantage of him?

541
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,080
Am I right, Zi Jin?

542
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,480
Let's not talk about that.

543
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,560
Can you promise me two things?

544
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,000
Two things?

545
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,680
Sweet bean curd?

546
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,240
How could the bean curd be sweet?

547
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,920
Your Highness,

548
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,480
it's from the Imperial Bureau.

549
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,480
How could the bean curd be sweet?

550
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,400
Why would the bean curd be sweet?

551
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,560
What did it contain?

552
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Your Highness,

553
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,120
it could contain sugar

554
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,840
or sugar,

555
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,120
or maybe rose petals.

556
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,960
I don't know the exact reason.

557
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,560
How could there be someone

558
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,920
who puts sugar in the bean curd?

559
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,720
Your Highness,

560
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,120
my grandmother is from Jinzhou.

561
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,720
She made it for me

562
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,840
because it's sweet bean curd.

563
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
It's very sweet and delicious.

564
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,360
But...

565
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,240
It's a whole pot.

566
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,240
How could the sweet and sour taste

567
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,320
not be spread at all?

568
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

569
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,360
It's a copper piece

570
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,400
of the pot.

571
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,360
It's made of copper.

572
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,640
It's made of it.

573
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,040
I'll come back after I've asked.

574
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,960
It's nonsense.

575
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,400
The bean curd can only be salty.

576
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,560
You never know who is the previous leader, right?

577
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,940
Hang on.

578
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,440
You an aint now.

579
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,960
Lets eat together later.

580
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,680
Thank you Your Highness.

581
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,720
I'm not afraid of the cold and the bitter.

582
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,000
I don't have any fear of the cold and the bitter.

583
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,600
I don't understand the words and the words.

584
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,960
How can I express my feelings?

585
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,560
I have only made two delicious food.

586
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,760
I'm very happy.

587
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,600
Just help me this time.

588
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,880
Hou Zijin.

589
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,000
I beg you, Zijin.

590
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,320
Hou Zijin.

591
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,200
I'll be grateful to you forever, okay?

592
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,800
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm sorry.

599
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I'm sorry.

600
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
I'm sorry.

601
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Go.

602
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Go.

603
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
Ziping.

604
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Go.

605
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,200
Tell the superior to go to the Tiantou Palace after the bureau.

606
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Yes.

607
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Your Highness.

608
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
This book seems to be from Lord Mei.

609
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,200
I forgot to take it.

610
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,400
I'll send it to him now.

611
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Give it to me.

612
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
It smells sweet.

613
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Go out and relax.

614
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,800
Someone is really thinking about Tiantou.

615
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Lord Mei.

616
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
It's 11 o'clock.

617
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
This is the restaurant's restaurant.

618
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Thank you.

619
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
Go.

620
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Your Highness.

621
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
What do you want me to do?

622
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
I'm done.

623
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
When?

624
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
When?

625
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
That's not for you.

626
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Your Highness.

627
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Don't fall.

628
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
Give it to me.

629
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Didn't you tell me personally?

630
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Don't mention it to anyone.

631
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I dare not to do it for you.

632
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
You're 20 years old.

633
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Your Highness.

634
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Your Highness.

635
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
That's the tea from the imperial court.

636
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
According to the law,

637
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
it should be 400 yuan.

638
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
But they are doing business all day.

639
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
The food is so bad.

640
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
It's so bad.

641
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,800
The emperor just ate it.

642
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
So he only ate it for a year.

643
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
He pushed the job to the imperial court.

644
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Guozhen.

645
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
You're so naive.

646
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
You didn't say anything.

647
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
You just dropped it from my hand.

648
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Why are you so happy?

649
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
I took it.

650
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
It's broken.

651
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
It's broken.

652
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
I'm so happy now.

653
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Say it again.

654
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm using bamboo shoots,

655
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
phoenix and mustard in the original.

656
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Don't look at me like that.

657
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,800
It's fried phoenix.

658
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,800
It's crispy and tender.

659
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
It's a good product.

660
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
Yin Ziping.

661
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
You're bullying Lord Mei on purpose.

662
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Let's go.

663
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Let's go.

664
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
Let's go.

665
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Let's go.

666
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Let's go.

667
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Let's go.

668
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
We have to go.

669
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
It's so hot.

670
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
It's hot.

671
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Why did you steal it?

672
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Let me go.

673
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Let me go.

674
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
You don't need to go to the palace.

675
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Go.

676
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Come with me.

677
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
What's going on?

678
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Why did you steal it?

679
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,800
I didn't steal it.

680
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I didn't steal it.

681
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,520
You let me go.

682
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,480
You let me go.

683
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,240
What's going on?

684
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,280
He stole it.

685
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,680
Arrest him.

686
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,360
Yes.

687
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,840
I've told him everything.

688
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,160
He's been begging for half an hour.

689
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,760
He still gave me the teeth.

690
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,680
Zhen's family wants you to change your rules

691
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,800
and be a person.

692
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,440
He still won't let me go.

693
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,960
He's waiting outside the cell.

694
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,120
He has to force me to be a student in the bar.

695
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,400
A student in the bar needs to be a person.

696
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,680
He's the one who's responsible for your safety.

697
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,280
He's more powerful than you.

698
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,240
He's a good person.

699
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,440
Don't be fooled by him.

700
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,160
He's a scholar who's educated on the surface.

701
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,840
He's so cruel.

702
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,560
He's still a man of my money.

703
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,160
There must be some misunderstanding.

704
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,480
What misunderstanding?

705
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,720
I won't give him a bad word.

706
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,840
I'm already a kind person.

707
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,720
Lin Ziping.

708
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:16,880
Zi Jin.

709
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,480
Zi Jin.

710
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,840
The wine from the bar is here.

711
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,920
Go and have a drink.

712
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,360
Yes.

713
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,840
Ziping, help him out.

714
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,480
Shortly...

715
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,160
The Joey piper,예 융,

716
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,400
Would you like to have it?

717
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,600
I'm greatest SR.

718
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,120
the flowers will bloom and bloom.

719
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,760
Hurry up.

720
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,640
Let me see.

721
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,840
It's too white.

722
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,880
Write it like this.

723
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,880
Write it again.

724
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,200
Almost.

725
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,680
That's too much.

726
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,560
Look.

727
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,920
Be careful.

728
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,880
The wine warehouse is in trouble.

729
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,080
Yao Zi Jin is in a coma.

730
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Is it your fault?

731
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,960
What's the reason?

732
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,320
You helped me to get up.

733
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,760
You didn't control the superior.

734
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,920
Although I don't know your real purpose,

735
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,800
you can't stop me

736
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,040
just to get out of the war.

737
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,480
The one who was arrested

738
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,360
was still in the palace.

739
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,720
What did he say?

740
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,360
He said it was an accident.

741
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,360
You shouldn't be happy

742
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,320
when your opponent is injured.

743
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,080
I...

744
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,320
Is it nothing but 빨리 health?

745
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Missed my note for all three,

746
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,880
all the shout out of you.

747
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,720
Do you really need to

748
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,560
give her reliance?

749
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,160
So when do you give Zi Jinised the veneration?

750
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,760
will it be a secret?

751
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,680
Mr. Meng,

752
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,520
Yao Ding Shan needs to recuperate.

753
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,040
He needs to be clear

754
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
about his situation and then make a judgment.

755
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,320
From now on,

756
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,240
Qi Yu's men will take over this place

757
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,960
and let him rest in peace.

758
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,480
Give him the medicine first.

759
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,640
Yes.

760
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,880
President Wang.

761
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,320
Although the drinking are heating up,

762
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,920
you'll add different drinks.

763
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,760
Different drinks

764
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,800
needs different flavor and taste.

765
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,680
This way

766
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,920
you won't lose it.

767
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,640
I only know the cold drinking taste of different drinks

768
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,760
It's hot and cost-effective.

769
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,560
I can only use warm wine.

770
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,840
I don't know

771
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
how much I can learn in a while.

772
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,320
Why don't you teach me?

773
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
Zijin, you're awake.

774
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,880
Zijin.

775
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,520
My hand.

776
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,400
Zijin, don't worry.

777
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,760
Remember to take a good rest.

778
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,760
It's good.

779
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,760
Don't move your hand.

780
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,760
It hurts.

781
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
Zijin.

782
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,640
Your Highness.

783
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,960
Your Highness has been drinking wine.

784
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,120
It's just that some headache.

785
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,240
You should take a break.

786
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,440
What's the matter?

787
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,040
Since you're taking a break,

788
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,240
I'll take a while

789
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,480
and report to the court.

790
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,200
I'll take my leave.

791
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,640
Your Highness.

792
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,640
Your Highness.
