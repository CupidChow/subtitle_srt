I'm afraid to ask.

What's your opinion?

There are a few books.

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,180
you can find them yourself.

65
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,580
Maybe you can find them again.

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,020

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,740
His Highness is afraid that you will be late.

77
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,860
He ordered me to report to the doctor.

78
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,620
So,

79
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,300
he isn't coming again?

80
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,180
His Majesty has been

81
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,820
talking about the witness

82
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,260

83
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,180
So, His Highness is too busy.

84
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,980
When His Highness is free,

85
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,380
prepare the first one to think about it.

86
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,500
You go.

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,020
Jin Shu.

89
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,420
It's all my fault.

90
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,860
I hurt his heart.

91
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,380
Initially,

92
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:21,740
I knew

93
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,580
she would forgive me

94
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,180
for the little Republican

95
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,420

96
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,380
Let's take a walk.

97
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,340
Do you forgive him?

98
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,340
Why not answer?

99
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,780
Your Highness,

100
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,900
no one is too much.

101
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,700
I can feel it.

102
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,860
I can't help but to say it.

103
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,060
You're really strange.

104
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,060
You did so much.

105
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,340
You didn't say anything when you saw me.

106
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,780
You knew I was talking about him.

107
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,060
But you still let me see him.

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I ask you to go.

109
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,060
You do as you want.

110
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,060
Your Highness is now only one idea.

111
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,340
How can one ever remember?

112
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,300
How can she be okay?

113
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,740
How about I beg your family

114
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860

115
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:27,060
and то instruction

116
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,940
but I can't feel

117
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,340
he and I are ever apart.

118
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,980
The world

119
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,220
is so very remarkable.

120
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,900
Wake up in good mood,

121
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,580
nobody seeks 100%,

122
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,380
when His Majesty finally

123
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,660
attains the floating starlight!

124
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,180
I go meet him,

125
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,780

126
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,820
Two brothers experiences David and commands David.

127
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,820
I'm relieved that you're saying it.

128
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,860
Your Highness, you've been in this world for a long time.

129
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,900
You can't be in trouble.

130
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,940
How can you be happy?

131
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,180
Why don't you open the palace

132
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,620
and beg for a peaceful life?

133
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,220
Let's go to the palace.

134
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,340
Yes.

135
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,700
Alright.

136
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,260
I'll go change.

137
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,380

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,300

Your Highness is back.

145
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,020
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

146
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,020
You're talking to the Crown Princess Consort.

147
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,340
I'm not disturbing you.

148
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,740
Qimei.

149
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,540
Why are you here?

150
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,780
Greetings to the Crown Princess Consort.

151
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,980
No one reported you before.

152
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,020
What's going on?

153
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,700
Why didn't you answer?

154
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,220
The Crown Princess Consort and her mother

155
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,620
were in the palace for a visit.

156
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,820
Now that the Crown Princess Consort is ill,

157
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,020
she often has a fever.

158
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,940
But her legs are not well.

159
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,140
So Qimei came to visit her.

160
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,180
I'm ill?

161
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,900
What's wrong with me?

162
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,780
The Crown Princess Consort and the Crown Princess Consort

163
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,740
have been married for a long time.

164
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,540
But they have no children.

165
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,060
Not only do they have a father,

166
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,020
but their parents have a long life.

167
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,340
Sister Zhang.

168
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,100
I've been a family member for years.

169
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,820
No matter how much I hate you or hate you,

170
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,260
I also treat you as the only one in the palace.

171
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,740
You're the only one I can trust.

172
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,060
But I'm helpless.

173
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,500
I can't be more tolerant of the Hu family.

174
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,140
You...

175
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
You brothers...

176
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,780
Why did you bring me to such a terrible end?

177
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,340
Why?

178
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,820
Speak!

179
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,260
Sister.

180
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,220
All of a sudden,

181
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,500
Her Highness just came over,

182
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,260
aware of her gone.

183
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,620
He's still thinking that I'm HOR mana's wife.

184
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:20,540
He wants to restrict았�

185
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,100
his own sister to his husband,

186
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,460
and to serve his own sister to his own mom.

187
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,620
Take this sword off.

188
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,340
Take it off for 30 times.

189
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
Get out of the palace.

190
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,460
Your Highness.

191
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:31,980
This...

192
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,020
Your Highness.

193
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,740
Your Highness.

194
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,580
Please spare me.

195
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,380
Your Highness.

196
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:36,940
Your Highness.

197
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,340
Your Highness.

198
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:37,820
Your Highness.

199
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,460
Your Highness.

200
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,020
Your Highness.

201
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,740
Your Highness.

202
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,540
Your Highness.

203
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,020
Please spare me.

204
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,380
I'm also your husband.

205
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,020
I'll follow you.

206
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,700
Jin Shu followed you since childhood.

207
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,820
But you're the closest maid.

208
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,540
In order to protect the Hu family,

209
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,620
I can betray

210
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,540
and hide the master's secret from you.

211
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,540
I won't keep it.

212
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,140
Take it out of the palace immediately.

213
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,460
From now on,

214
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,500
without my order,

215
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
no one in the Hu family

216
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,380
will be allowed to enter the palace.

217
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,140
Listen to me.

218
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,980
From now on,

219
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,060
I'll follow my own will.

220
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,300
Whether it's you

221
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,740
or father,

222
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,620
I'll do it now,

223
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,380
although I will follow it.

224
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,220
Sister Chuang.

225
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,380
Sister Sang...

226
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,720
She's not taking

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,280
a sickness Iлох.

228
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,000
enough topic.

229
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,500
If she's still

230
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,160
чисely beautiful,

231
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
she won't be able

232
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,800
in this palace.

233
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,400
Now,

234
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,560
it's like a princess.

235
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,320
Let's go.

236
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,480
I'll take you out of the palace.

237
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,440
Your Highness.

238
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,680
Your Highness.

239
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,920
Your Highness.

240
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,240
The Crown Princess is still waiting outside.

241
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,240
Her news will be on the news.

242
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,800
Yes, I know.

243
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,680
Wait.

244
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll go and ask the Crown Princess now.

245
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,520
Your Highness, I'll go over there.

246
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,000
Tell her

247
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,240
she's lost her mind.

248
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Ask her to clean up.

249
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,120
Your Highness, I know.

250
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,200
Go and tell her

251
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,320
I have something urgent to see you.

252
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,440
Crown Princess.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,640
You know her temperament.

254
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,160
The more you quarrel with her,

255
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,520
the more she gets angry.

256
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,560
How about this?

257
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,680
You go back first.

258
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,560
When she gets angry,

259
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
you'll come to her and tell her it's not her.

260
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,600
It's over.

261
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,720
Master, it's windy here.

262
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,240
Let's go back.

263
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,560
After toilet.

264
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,320
After the palace gate,

265
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,920
let's go to bed to them.

266
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,000
I have to find

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,120
nothing more than books.

268
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,960
How do you organize it?

269
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,800
Talk to me.

270
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm asking you.

271
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,280
Your Highness.

272
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,680
Are you asking me

273
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,680
or a slave?

274
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,840
What's the difference?

275
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,760
Your Highness is right.

276
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,760
I'm a slave.

277
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,640
What did you say?

278
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,400
I told you to meet the grand consort.

279
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,320
You'll feel the willpower in me.

280
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,040
I think you should know

281
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,200
that everything I've done for you

282
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,600
is not done by a slave.

283
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,400
You...

284
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
I'm sorry.

285
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,520
How could this be?

286
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,560
Don't bother.

287
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,320
What I've done for you

288
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,920
is for a woman

289
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,120
to marry a real man.

290
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,320
My tortuousiller

291
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,940
made us

292
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,880
to save the emojis

293
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,880
and hearts

294
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,040
and you meet the grand consort.

295
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,080
But you

296
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,120
decided

297
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,440
to break it

298
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,760
Your Highness, you didn't lose.

299
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,960
It's my heart.

300
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,200
How dare you talk to me like that?

301
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,480
Your Highness,

302
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
you treat me

303
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,440
in the way of treating my servant.

304
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,960
From now on,

305
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,480
I will treat you

306
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,400
in the way of treating my servant.

307
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,080
It's not my nature to clean up the book.

308
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,920
Your Highness, you shouldn't be dissatisfied.

309
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
But you are just being punished.

310
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,600
If you have any other orders,

311
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,680
I will take my leave.

312
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:12,960
Guess you are back.

313
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,360
What's wrong?

314
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,040
What did he say just now?

315
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,760
He...

316
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,120
He said he隨 me here for you.

317
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,640
He wants to treat his master

318
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,160
with His Majesty's way.

319
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,800
Let him come back.

320
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,520
Go away!

321
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,880
Hurry up!

322
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,240
I told you to get back here!

323
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,040
I told you to get back here!

324
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,840
You're so useless!

325
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,560
Your Highness.

326
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,200
I'll go get some water.

327
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,440
Why don't you use the incense stick

328
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,600
or the octopus?

329
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,600
No, no.

330
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,640
I've used it by myself.

331
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,000
What else can I use?

332
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,000
I have my own way.

333
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,600
Really?

334
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,520
Go ahead.

335
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,320
Go ahead.

336
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,720
Hurry up.

337
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,760
Go ahead.

338
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,080
Look.

339
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,560
Why is he adding strange smells?

340
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,520
Has he given up?

341
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,120
Have you arrived?

342
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,520
Coming!

343
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,340
Coming!

344
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,760
Coming!

345
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,440
Come on.

346
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,240
L motivated!

347
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,560
Yes.

348
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,800
Dr. Qin, please sit down.

349
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,120
Father,

350
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,800
I heard that you were sick,

351
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,680
could you call theiac for me,

352
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,040
and make me visit the wtedy?

353
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
My head hurts.

354
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,920
I... I...

355
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
My heart aches.

356
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,920
My whole body...

357
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,080
I'm having a checkup.

358
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,760
It just hurts.

359
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,800
Since you're sick,

360
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,160
you should take it easy.

361
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,600
If you need anything,

362
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,920
just tell me.

363
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,080
I will.

364
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,040
Calm down.

365
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,640
Do it now.

366
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,800
Okay.

367
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:53,840
Excuse me.

368
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,680
Please.

369
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,520
Lord劉?

370
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,800
No need to be so serious.

371
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,480
I am not here for work.

372
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,040
Lord劉, please come in.

373
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,720
I'm here to check on the list of the Group Attendants.

374
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,160
Didn't I attract too much attention?

375
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:33,800
utilizar of河

376
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,760
I'll take it.

377
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,720
The meat is delicious.

378
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,920
But it's not greasy.

379
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,680
The pork in the past

380
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
is completely different from the pork in the past.

381
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,360
The pork in the past

382
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,440
is the same as the pork in the past.

383
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,400
Your Majesty, you're right.

384
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,240
This kind of pork is made from forest.

385
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
It's made from natural natural resources.

386
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,760
It's made from wild animals and pine trees.

387
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,720
So the meat is pure and tender.

388
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,280
I think

389
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,760
the customers have never tasted

390
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,440
the taste of the land.

391
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,080
This is the pork in the past

392
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,560
made from the pork in the past.

393
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,040
This kind of pork

394
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,800
is not as delicious as it is

395
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,520
and will not disappoint others.

396
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,520
Good.

397
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,680
You're right.

398
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,320
In the world,

399
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,360
we're the only ones

400
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,560
who can find the taste of the land

401
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
with such a delicious pork.

402
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,480
Good.

403
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,520
Good.

404
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Elite

405
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,040
The Shanghuayuan Urbancesso

406
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,120
was held on the我的丹麃

407
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,320
to tip people to find the taste of the land.

408
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,480
luck is upon you,

409
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,600
but you are eating out from the gallows.

410
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,280
How can you use Fish Drying?

411
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,080
The metal ball is still on the whereabouts.

412
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,720
The color of food is far from ordinary.

413
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,880
Such a delicacy

414
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,760
is going to make you missing.

415
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,240
A innocent person.

416
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,560
Give way.

417
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,360
Do not Movement.

418
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Go to the tomb.

419
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
When he enters there,

420
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,280
he can feel volunteers.

421
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,680
Then why are youắping in?

422
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,240
When I was on my hometown,

423
00:25:53,240 --> 00:26:00,760
many people coming from Betel's first supply of chili

424
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,800
brought me the gold.

425
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,760
That must be here.

426
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,040
I'm a humble servant.

427
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
Please forgive me.

428
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,680
What's the matter?

429
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,720
Your Highness,

430
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,680
I'm sorry to have made you come here.

431
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,800
Please forgive me.

432
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,800
The military class is small.

433
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,560
It's important to have a private country.

434
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,680
I heard what you said.

435
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,800
Mo Fei is the king of the world.

436
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,520
Mo Fei is the king of the world.

437
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm from Qin,

438
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,440
but I still고 my grievances with the access chiefs.

439
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,800
I do more than 모르 it.

440
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,440
It's rare to contact their directors,

441
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,840
worn like a ficus and replaced by somebody.

442
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,640
It can't be jealous or ill-古.

443
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,640
Some places don't understand the knowledge

444
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,240
and give them fun and已 feel adorable.

445
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,800
For some places,

446
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,600
they were contaminated by fire傳,

447
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,380
so they can only eat them cool.

448
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,360
That will lead to dialysis

449
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,480
and balm.

450
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,560
There are some areas that don't know it.

451
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,080
And when the traitors' lives end,

452
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,860
We'll have to decided them all.

453
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,920
The

454
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:20,140
more of the

455
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,420
needy

456
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,080
stands outside the country.

457
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,700
Why would I make that?

458
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,980
Why should there be suchந

459
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,660
as it's not fair?

460
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,020
Just as theanha is quo

461
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:31,880
and the plague is

462
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,540
aggraded,

463
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,800
the recoil is a tradeunit,

464
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,960
How long in their care will they want my guidance?

465
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,880
Please have mercy on me.

466
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,200
These girls are of limited skill.

467
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,720
You've taught me

468
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,280
better thancourse within ten years.

469
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,560
Remember, from now on,

470
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,440
each of you

471
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
will have

472
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,960
a single worstystic.

473
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,360
Yes.

474
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm not sure.

475
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm not sure.

476
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm not sure.

477
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm not sure.

478
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm not sure.

479
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm not sure.

480
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm not sure.

481
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm not sure.

482
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm not sure.

483
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm not sure.

484
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm not sure.

485
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm not sure.

486
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm not sure.

487
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm not sure.

488
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm not sure.

489
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm not sure.

490
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I'm not sure.

491
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm not sure.

492
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I'm not sure.

493
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm not sure.

494
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I'm not sure.

495
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm not sure.

496
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I'm not sure.

497
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm not sure.

498
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm not sure.

499
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm not sure.

500
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm not sure.

501
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I'm not sure.

502
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm not sure.

503
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
I'm not sure.

504
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Let's go.

505
00:28:41,200 --> 00:29:02,160
Although the

506
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
why?

507
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Li Yi,

508
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
you're young too.

509
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
But Shengrie,

510
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,200
your wings were long

511
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,400
at the beginning.

512
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Evet.

513
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,200
which existed in Linyeong Town at the time.

514
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,540
Wucai Street

515
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,400
is in dire civilized state

516
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,840
as awert in a rare date.

517
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,540
It is part of the Qianzhou Palace

518
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,900
and it's also called the text texts.

519
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,000
I electrichi mined some different

520
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,860
dishes that were caught before.

521
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,640
Please accept the offer.

522
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,860
Why did you eat it?

523
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,760
Your Highness won't admit it.

524
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,440
Feng Didi

525
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,180
pointed at all dishware.

526
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,340
Taste it!

527
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,180
Fishing in a battle station

528
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,780
has a unique flavor.

529
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,880
It tastes

530
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,060
like sexual сам Courage'm

531
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,680

535
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,220
Fresh.

536
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
Your Highness, what do you think?

537
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,780
Check it again.

538
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,340
Check it again.

539
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,940
The atau want it.

540
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,460
It smells delicious.

541
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740
No need to work.

542
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:36,900
The ice wolf Wijong wins.

543
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,260
miss

544
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,940
Helped make a fool again

545
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,100
Sun serious.

546
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,180
It has a nice sweetness and it's sweet and has a savory taste when left in the room.

547
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,980
Use two of these two 얼굴

548
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,660
to make a unique taste.

549
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,220
Here is the first part.

550
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,060
Even though it tastes better,

551
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,620
the Danny taste offers Huh —

552
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,660
nutritional taste and good smell.

553
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,620
real serendipity?

554
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,460
Are you planning to marry someone?

555
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm sorry.

556
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:16,600
I'm afraid I'll die with your

557
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,100
transmission.

558
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:23,980
The second day.

559
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,860
I had an odor experiment done by Father

560
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:26,900
and it burned the latrine.

561
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:28,940
What?

562
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,860
You fell down?

563
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:31,780
Yes.

564
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,860
You must be a gangster.

565
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,780
What're you doing here?

566
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,060
I haven't been here many days for the old.

567
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,380
Come.

568
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,500
Why do you have to use стоит?

569
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,260
In your thoughts,

570
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,260
Gu Ren Yun

571
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,860
is supported by Peng Ziyuan

572
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
who is one of the few.

573
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,540
You should let the soldiers

574
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,540
behave according to rules in there.

575
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,740
But the residents of this kingdom

576
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,540
are the most precious people,

577
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,660
All the property on this land

578
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,660
is the treasure of the people of Shang Tian.

579
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
They are the most ordinary people.

580
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,660
And...

581
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Back then,

582
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
when Zhang Qian was in the Western Regions,

583
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
he brought back the ingredients you used today.

584
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
The precious seeds

585
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,660
were planted and sprouted in my big country of China.

586
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,660
After generations of cultivation,

587
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,660
they can make a delicious dish that can be made a thousand times.

588
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
I have already taken the woodpecker and covered it with a Qiong Yao.

589
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
I have prepared the meal list for the Shi Group.

590
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Besides the mountain needle and sea food,

591
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
you can also add these.

592
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
The rice we just ate

593
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
is very soft and delicious.

594
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
The rice in the mountains

595
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
is very rich in the natural disaster.

596
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,660
If we use this kind of rice

597
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,660
to the Shi Group,

598
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
the rich and rich people of the capital

599
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,660
will be able to chase after each other.

600
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,660
In this way,

601
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
the lives of the people will be much better.

602
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,660
It's just a little girl.

603
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,660
She has so much thought.

604
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
But she is lucky.

605
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,660
Why is she back?

606
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,660
Sir, please.

607
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,660
Please.

608
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
The cat eye stone

609
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
brought back from the Hulu Mosque

610
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,660
is a thousand miles away.

611
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Do you like it?

612
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
Thank you for your reward.

613
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,660
I am so grateful.

614
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,660
Miss Xiao,

615
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,660
didn't you always look for this

616
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Hang Hai's map before?

617
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
I brought it for you.

618
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
It's not useful.

619
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
I have never taken it.

620
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
It's not useful.

621
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
I have taken it all.

622
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Take it.

623
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,660
Thank you for your reward.

624
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,660
Okay.

625
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,660
Tell her

626
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
that one day,

627
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,660
our ship will bring back

628
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
not only the jewelry and spices,

629
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
but also the weapons

630
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,660
that will make the people of Zhonghua better.

631
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,660
Oh no.

632
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
You must forget about it.

633
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,660
Okay, let's go.

634
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Reward?

635
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,660
Is that what she said?

636
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,660
How dare I answer her?

637
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,660
Miss Yao said so.

638
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,660
Hurry up.

639
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,660
Hurry up.

640
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,660
Hurry up.

641
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,660
Hurry up.

642
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,660
Eunuch Yun.

643
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,660
Thank you.

644
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,660
Go in.

645
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,660
Go.

646
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,660
Go.

647
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,660
Open it.

648
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,660
You first.

649
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,660
Open it.

650
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
Open it.

651
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,660
Yes.

652
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,660
Did you make it today?

653
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,620
Please punish me.

654
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
What do you mean?

655
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,580
I'm sorry.

656
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,780
Please forgive me.

657
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,300
Get lost.

658
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,860
I'll take my leave.

659
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,300
Go and persuade her back.

660
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,380
If you can't persuade her back,

661
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,180
don't come back either.

662
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,620
Your Highness,

663
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,020
how can you do that?

664
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,740
She's acting weird.

665
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,860
Your Highness,

666
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,620
Miss Yao is not weird.

667
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,420
I'm the one who gave her the order.

668
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,060
I've been asking her for help.

669
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,340
I didn't think it through.

670
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,980
What's wrong with her?

671
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,460
What's wrong with her?

672
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,580
I've never brought her here.

673
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,220
Go.

674
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,100
Your Highness.

675
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,340
Look.

676
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,540

after this early morning.

681
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,460
When we exchange foryora with food,

682
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,780

683
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,780

Sect Clique is right downitt

697
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320

00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Jinya S add

699
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,220
Take a seat.

Thank you.

701
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:23,860
Step aside.

702
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,340
Be careful.

703
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,540
Continue when you get there.

704
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,480
Why not stop?

705
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,120
ResIST.

706
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,140
Xiao Jing.

00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:40,660
Come watch my lanterns.

708
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,400
Anything nice?

709
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,460
Commristo Meng!

710
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,500
Mr. Chen.

711
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,280
director Meng, thank you.

712
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,120
Thank God you don't deserve this.

713
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,700
I remember when my aunt liened as a maid in the Palace,

714
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,020
who were the burdenors

715
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,300
of Royal Descendant's responsibility.

716
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,740
He taught you the way you are on your own.

717
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,100
What time of the incidence

718
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,060
can Royal Descendant Wu appoint?

719
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,580
Within the内,

720
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,420
I went to Mrs. Yang

721
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,420
's Su Zhuo Highery

722
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,420
and we bought off Her Grace's impossible risk mesmop.

723
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,460
I made the room

724
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,140
where I wanted to go and you invited me back.

725
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:36,100
Status Banquet

726
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,180
How lucky you are that you also have this twenty year old wife!

727
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,660
We'll show you

728
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,540
I'll send someone to fetch it.

729
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,780
Okay.

730
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,940
Take care, Mr. Chen.

731
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,660
Goodbye.

732
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,340
Please forgive me, Minister Shang.

733
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,860
I'm afraid

734
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,500
I've wronged the good future of the Jin Dynasty.

735
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,900
What good future do you think of

736
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,060
in the world?

737
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,260
Young people don't know

738
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,340
that good things

739
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,300
can't be avoided.

740
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,020
There are rules in the palace.

741
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,780
The crown prince has the dignity of the crown prince.

742
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,780
If he's in the top ten in my court,

743
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,060
he'll be protected by me one day.

744
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,780
He won't have the right to take away the power.

745
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,420
If I do this again,

746
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,780
I won't let you down.

747
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,300
Yes.

748
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:43,100
很

749
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,740
Yes.

750
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,140
Your Highness.

751
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,180
Today's temperament is

752
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,420
the same as yesterday.

753
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,100
How could it be bad?

754
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,940
Give it a try.

755
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,780
It's cold.

756
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:08,860
Can't you taste it?

757
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,660
Please try it, Your Highness.

758
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:14,780
It's not the wrong dish.

759
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,460
It's the wrong mood.

760
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,460
Your Highness,

761
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,860
the same food

762
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,420
has different moods.

763
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,620
It tastes different.

764
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,340
I don't really want to favor outsiders.

765
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,340
I'm sorry.

766
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,340
