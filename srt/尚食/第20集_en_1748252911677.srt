1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The game is a little bit complicated

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The game is a little bit complicated

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
Okay, you can go now.

23
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,560
I won this round.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
You know my You Le Mei?

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
Milk tea, I love You Le Mei.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,960
The top protection is strong and natural.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,320
The second generation of Meizhan Chen Lan Zhen

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,240
will remind you of the exciting start.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,640
Episode 1

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,840
Zhaodan, you should go upstairs.

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,600
Let go of my hand.

32
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,920
Hurry up, let go of my hand.

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
Let go of my hand.

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
If you don't let go of my hand,

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,840
I'll cut off your head.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Let go of my hand.

37
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,040
Zijing, I'm fine.

38
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,640
Let go of my hand.

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,240
Your Highness.

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,360
Your Highness.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,080
Take a look.

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,240
The porridge you just made

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,000
stopped in the porridge.

44
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,920
To preserve the original taste of the porridge,

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
you gave up the regular food.

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,960
You used a special steel rod

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,200
to make one dish.

48
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,840
During this time,

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,280
you need to keep your hands

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,320
in a constant motion.

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,240
Not only this porridge,

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,120
all the good food here

53
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
need your hard work.

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,600
You need to save many people's lives.

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,480
But how could you be so bad?

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,840
You should do all these.

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
You can't do anything except

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,400
the food.

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,480
When you don't have time,

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,840
you can't work.

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,560
The army will be defeated

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,840
by the army.

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,200
If the food in the country is empty,

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,680
they will be saved by the town.

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,280
Without food,

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,360
the country will be in chaos.

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Moreover,

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,640
this is the royal crown prince

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,080
who has been

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
telling his descendants about the food.

71
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,480
Food is the most precious thing in the world.

72
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,520
Why must he

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,000
make the good food and cook the porridge?

74
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,240
Why must he

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,200
fight against the royal crown prince's order?

76
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,640
The royal crown prince said

77
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,840
everyone should think about the good food.

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,440
Only then can the world be peaceful.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,120
I dare to ask you something.

80
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
As the cook,

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,200
we are in the capital.

82
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,520
Can you also

83
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,960
beceeding in raising and saving

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,000
the enfants and you?

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,720
The empress is already

86
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
hundreds of children

87
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,400
at this age

88
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,120
from preמה vir bride to forester.

89
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
By now,

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,840
you won't say anything

91
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,320
even when the crown prince Thorne is released of the palace.

92
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,920
What about you?

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Nonsense!

94
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,320
No one dares

95
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,640
speak to me like this.

96
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,880
Forget it.

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,280
For all y minutiae,

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
theknown world

99
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,280
wrongdoings.

100
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,840
This is exactly why

101
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:50,500
I義

102
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,540
Kill him for me.

103
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,700
You can leave now.

104
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,460
It was so dangerous just now.

105
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,940
If the King of Wei really gets mad,

106
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,220
he'll cut off your head.

107
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,180
Fortunately, His Highness is here.

108
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,060
Do you think that

109
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,260
he'll be embarrassed

110
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,180
to show off his character

111
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,420
with the King of Wei?

112
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,540
Xiaoshi.

113
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,300
You've been sick all the time.

114
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Everyone praises you.

115
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,180
But what you did today

116
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,700
made him very disappointed.

117
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,820
You're the son of the Zhu family.

118
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,820
You're the King of Ming.

119
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,380
How could you be so generous?

120
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,940
Older Brother,

121
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,500
you don't even help me.

122
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,100
If you ever

123
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,060
get angry with me again,

124
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
you can avoid it.

125
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,300
Let's go.

126
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,180
Xiaoshi.

127
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,100
You have the right

128
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,740
to be cautious.

129
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,040
Because

130
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,020
ahí I have ben chips investigation received,

131
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,380
and that I would see it as

132
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,460
the truth,

133
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,460
I have been thinking about this immediately.

134
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,020
A little bit.

135
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:39,660
The word I said

136
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,260
means nothing.

137
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,340
Xiaoshi.

138
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,100
Drink warm liberally.

139
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,420
I'll also have your opinion of it.

140
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,140
Trying to ask me to protect Father

141
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,900
isn't a bad idea.

142
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,020
Would you like to film me by the way courtship?

143
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,820
Come on. Don't chase me.

144
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,340
Stop!

145
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,980
Your Highness,

146
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,820
you have always been a good-for-nothing farmer.

147
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,400
What's the meaning of it?

148
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,360
Stop!

149
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,020
Stop!

150
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,000
you will be착 dead.

151
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,340
Consort,

152
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,640
what is your name?

153
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,980
Mother.

154
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,500
Yu'er.

155
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,460
Yu'er.

156
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,460
Mother.

157
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,060
Your father is very good.

158
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,560
Ah Shan.

159
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,560
Young Master.

160
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Is Chen Zi the one who appointed the emperor?

161
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,960
The female official is the same.

162
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,060
Please tell me.

163
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,160
Is the person like you not worthy of being appointed?

164
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
The water is clear and there is no rain.

165
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,560
If you don't have the heart to do anything,

166
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
how can you not take the blame and love of His Majesty?

167
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,160
What about the status and power of the current emperor?

168
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,960
You saw the weak and impoverished Xia Chang in person.

169
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,560
Can't you really make it up?

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,660
Master Mo.

171
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,160
Zi Jin.

172
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,760
I hope that one day, you can become a master.

173
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,660
Look at me.

174
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,660
I will grow step by step

175
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,760
until you can stand up and become a master.

176
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,360
When Master Hu has lost the favor of the empress,

177
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,760
he can't compete with you.

178
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,960
I want to ask, what do you still want?

179
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,260
What do you want?

180
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,060
Hongwu's first-year official, Lv Guan,

181
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,660
served the central palace and taught her to be fair.

182
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,760
She is the most loyal to the palace.

183
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,960
She has also set up a great reputation and position

184
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,560
to be the world's most beautiful woman.

185
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,760
Since the late emperor's reign,

186
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,360
the Yan people have been greatly used.

187
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,160
The female officials have been using the power of the empress to take action.

188
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,560
My filial piety to the empress

189
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,360
is to restore the old position

190
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,660
and become the most loyal to the palace.

191
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,160
You...

192
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,760
I hope that the two machines that Fei Xin has made for you

193
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
will be able to hold on to me.

194
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,160
How is it? I can trust you.

195
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,760
In order to stay in the royal court,

196
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I don't have a second path to choose.

197
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,560
The emperor is busy with his new-born son, Li Zheng.

198
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,960
I have the most convenient way to use the good things.

199
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,360
The position of the royal court is

200
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
to be the best person in the world.

201
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,560
I will be the best person in the world.

202
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,160
I will be the best person in the world.

203
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
The position of the royal court

204
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
is always in the wrong.

205
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,760
Do you remember how the royal court defeated the light and the light?

206
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,560
Do you remember?

207
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,960
But I will return the favor to you

208
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,760
as the royal court's best person.

209
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,960
I will remember what you said.

210
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,160
Go.

211
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,360
Go.

212
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,160
My lord.

213
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,360
I said that you don't need to send these things here.

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,960
The room is not fit for you.

215
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,760
This knife is not as soft as my armor.

216
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
The world is just like this.

217
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,160
The royal court can't bear to wear it.

218
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,160
I brought it for you.

219
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,360
My lord, I want to see you.

220
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
According to the interrogation of the imperial guards,

221
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
the courtier admitted that Noble Consort Guo has hidden the illness of the King of Wei.

222
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,760
This is a serious matter.

223
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
It involves the King of Wei's health.

224
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,560
So I have to report it to my father.

225
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,760
Noble Consort Guo is the mother of the King of Wei.

226
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,760
She is the mother of the King of Wei.

227
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
She is the mother of the King of Wei.

228
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,760
She cares about the chaos and has another cause.

229
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
Please let me know.

230
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,160
Tea.

231
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960
Tea.

232
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,160
Tea.

233
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,760
Tea.

234
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,560
Your Majesty.

235
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,760
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

236
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,360
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

237
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,560
Your Majesty.

238
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,560
Your Majesty.

239
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,760
Your Majesty.

240
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,960
Your Majesty.

241
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,560
Your Majesty.

242
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,760
You.

243
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,760
Sh Moment.

244
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
I'm not going anywhere.

245
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
You don't have to send me anything.

246
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
You're so close to your father.

247
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
You're making me feel bad.

248
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Why do you say that?

249
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I don't blame you.

250
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
After all, you're your biological father.

251
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
I'm not your biological father.

252
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
I'm not your biological father.

253
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm not your biological father.

254
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I was left in the same place.

255
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
I was killed by you.

256
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
You found me.

257
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
You took me away

258
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
from the prison.

259
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
You refused to go back.

260
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
All these years,

261
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
my strategy of the martial arts and martial arts

262
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
is not your own.

263
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Who else

264
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
can be my father?

265
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Go.

266
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I promised you.

267
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
At first,

268
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
I just wanted to

269
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
help my second brother.

270
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Then I taught him.

271
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,960
You're a very talented person.

272
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
After all,

273
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
my two sons

274
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
are in the same family.

275
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
I'm not your biological father.

276
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
I'm your biological father.

277
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,960
I'm not your biological father.

278
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
I'm not your biological father.

279
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
I'm not your biological father.

280
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
I'm not your biological father.

281
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
After all,

282
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
my two sons

283
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
are weak and sick.

284
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
They are very weak.

285
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
They are very weak.

286
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
If they have half of your talent,

287
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Do you remember the year when you were 13?

288
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Did you take me to the hunting?

289
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
You escaped from the camp

290
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
while the wolf patrol was on the way.

291
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
But you didn't care about your own safety.

292
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
You saved me from the wolf.

293
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
You were seriously injured.

294
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Your grace

295
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
you are seriously injured.

296
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Father,

297
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
I don't know

298
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
when I can take care of you.

299
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
This time,

300
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
the Great Wall is dead.

301
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
The Great Fire is dead.

302
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
My big brother

303
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
is the land of great Wall and great evil.

304
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Ever since he ascended the throne,

305
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
he has been taking care of me

306
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
on the surface.

307
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
But in the dark,

308
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
he has been helping me to save Fan.

309
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
But when I arrived at Zhangde,

310
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
I couldn't use it for two years.

311
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,960
I couldn't escape from the end of the level of the Wuji.

312
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
I'm afraid we two

313
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
will meet again.

314
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Father,

315
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
how can I not know

316
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
how your son has been doing?

317
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
Don't worry.

318
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
I will help you

319
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
with one thing at last.

320
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
Good son.

321
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
I trust you.

322
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Where are you?

323
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
The gate is closed.

324
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Come down now.

325
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Go, go, my child.

326
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Go, go, go.

327
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
My child,

328
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,700
eka.

329
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,660
What are you doing?

330
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,120
Su Zi,

331
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,900
according to your orders,

332
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,140
just put the milk and beer in the cold Hosp Zhao's room.

333
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,480
Is there any more orders?

334
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,900
You take the evil powder and Prep that soup

335
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,980
and put it in the water and味 it.

336
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,140
I'll serve His Majesty.

337
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,180
Yes.

338
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,100
No need.

339
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,900
The palace in Nanjing is being renovated.

340
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,340
The official's food needs to be served.

341
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,860
The Guanglu Temple is about to be sold out.

342
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,260
Get ready.

343
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,620
Get up tomorrow.

344
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:35,820
Mo Shao Shi.

345
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,500
What wrong have I done?

346
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,900
You're going to take me to the other side.

347
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,100
The palace's official position is in demand.

348
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,460
You don't need to go there.

349
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,460
Are you getting melancholy

350
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,420
because you served the palace enemies?

351
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,660
Since you were beat to death by the還 ALLAN Swordsmen of the Majesty,

352
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,260
then you are used to being defended?

353
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,180
Mo Shao Shi.

354
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,740
You know clearly that

355
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,180
you gold fairest of no need to use your ears

356
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,460
to change the order of the royal's capital's government.

357
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,860
You are the SMography of Lord Chang's palace,

358
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,100
so how could you be so kind to treat such a patient like a servant?

359
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,500
You didn't once create a 키 Tipo for all of primal imperils in the world.

360
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,380
You just have to take advantage of studies in this world.

361
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,420
Regardless of one's professionalism,

362
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,980
you will keep it in mind.

363
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,300
If you want to pick the right one,

364
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,180
you don't deserve to enter the Imperial Kitchen.

365
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,100
Yes.

366
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,100
Mr. Meng.

367
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:21,580
I...

368
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,220
Eunuch Liu.

369
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,220
Eunuch Liu,

370
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,820
why are you here in person?

371
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,700
What is Your Majesty's order?

372
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,820
Miss Su,

373
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,540
why hasn't Your Majesty sent the milk skin

374
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,820
that you want?

375
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,820
Eunuch Liu,

376
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,820
I'm already doing it.

377
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,860
It's just...

378
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,900
Eunuch Liu,

379
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,820
alright,

380
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,420
we're going to take the position of Grand Tutor.

381
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,220
What can we do then?

382
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,220
Your Majesty.

383
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,500
Su Yuehua,

384
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,860
the official nickname of Run'e Department.

385
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,980
He should serve you all the time

386
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,740
to respect your basic skills.

387
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,380
Your Majesty, thank you.

388
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,700
To Michel Fine

389
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,500
The Rebirth Living Room

390
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,300
What a remote place!

391
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,860
Is it my first time in the palace?

392
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,940
Yes.

393
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,820
There's never any place like that.

394
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,740
There's never any place like that.

395
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,460
Father.

396
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,580
I sent someone to your palace to pick up Shan.

397
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,900
Why did you stop him?

398
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,820
I'm talking to you.

399
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,740
Father, I told you in person.

400
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,460
Shan is my brother.

401
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,420
I'll protect him.

402
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,060
You think I'll kill him?

403
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,340
Father, I know

404
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,780
that you're loyal to the school.

405
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,980
I'm the Crown Prince of the Ming State,

406
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,180
the Crown Prince of Chu.

407
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,140
Besides the reputation of the army,

408
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,180
I'm also a father.

409
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,820
I should be more loyal to my brother.

410
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,500
I'm a father.

411
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,860
I can't let a woman

412
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,100
who has a limited eye

413
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,340
teach me

414
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,420
how to guide my brother.

415
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,700
That will only harm him.

416
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
Your Majesty, it's time to eat.

417
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,380
You can sit down.

418
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,940
Thank you, Father.

419
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,460
I thirst.

420
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,340
It's so good.

421
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,500
Your Majesty loves tea.

422
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,740
This dessert is made like sweet tea.

423
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,860
Missing the spare tea.

424
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,860
I definitely did what I had to.

425
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,020
That old man

426
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,260
slept in all these houses just now...

427
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,960
I think

428
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,920

429
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,500
let me tell you

430
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,460
if I wanted to be free

431
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,060
Come and accompany me.

432
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,820
Yes.

433
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,780
Open the jade.

434
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,700
Okay.

435
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,980
Your Highness, it's been a long time.

436
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,380
Is there anything good?

437
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:28,740
Thanks.

438
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,100
Have you got anything?

439
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,420
What is this?

440
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,560
Please.

441
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,620
It's a protective edict

442
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,060
by hiring the advanced skilled

443
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,140

444
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,380
to get all the best exterior goods prepared.

445
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,780
Speaking of pressed costs,

446
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,580
should be considered as an parfum of your martial record.

447
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,260
Give yourself a laugh.

448
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,080
The local servants in theでは workers

449
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,700
Shellinsimободancho is directly inside theLocut

450
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,020
This will reduce landshot

451
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,460
and否ERE to avoid trouble

452
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,740
They entrusted their anti- illusions

453
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,680
Waiting to be learned

454
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,720
Who knows

455
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,840
where the troops will shoot

456
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,820
Destroying the dominate

457
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,220

Where's your husband,

469
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,320
Is he in the kitchen or provincial preaching?

470
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,060
His Majesty won't allow those who value the land

471
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,420
So

472
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,320
Mr.So,

473
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,720

I'm sincerely trying to help

475
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,480
God gives such a small gift

476
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,780
I'm really...

477
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,720

I need some coconut water.

481
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,720
and for the splendid scents.

482
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,840
His Majesty is going to make appealing scriptures

483
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,120
to assistants tomorrow.

484
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,720
Please count some ingredients as reverents.

485
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,120
Yes.

486
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,640
I won't leave you two alone

487
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,880

The lung condition is imminent.

498
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,440

Once you go from outside the windows

the common SUN will ignore efforts and strength

Father,

569
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,420
it's not good to be fat.

570
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,420
I want to eat too.

571
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
Yes.

572
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,420
As you said,

573
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,420
the so-called food is not good.

574
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
It's good for your health.

575
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,420
It's good for your health.

576
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,420
But it's not good for your health.

577
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
It's just right.

578
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,420
Why don't you try this soup?

579
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
Okay.

580
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Let's try it together.

581
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Come on.

582
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Yes.

583
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,420
Yes.

584
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
It's good.

585
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,420
It's good.

586
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
It's good.

587
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
The lamb I yearned for

588
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
was too heavy.

589
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
So the chef

590
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
was worried about the weight.

591
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
But this time,

592
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,420
it's not that bad.

593
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,420
Yes.

594
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Why?

595
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,420
I added the same kind of the surname.

596
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
No wonder.

597
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Thanks for your heart.

598
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,420
Why don't we use the soup

599
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,420
to make it on fire?

600
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:34,820
okay

601
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,420
inside

602
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,880
Cover your Kara

603
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,260
on the floor

604
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,480
with a loop

605
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,420
If you take clean without licking

606
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:52,980
The trouble relating to this play

607
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,640
was nothing

608
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,260
People used to

609
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,100
go as sä

610
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:57,560
to go back

611
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:58,740
As profiteers

612
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,120
and何

613
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,260
Now I'm a man

614
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,920
now we haven't seen a lady

615
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,800
Get out of the way.

616
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,720
Hurry up.

617
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,040
Get out of the way.

618
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,480
Get out of the way.

619
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,400
Get out.

620
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,400
You have over Sonny Xintong.

621
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,160
That puts him in a bad mood.

622
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,240
Yes.

623
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,240
Don't move.

624
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,840
Don't move.

625
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,080
Doctor,

626
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,680
why did you get a stroke?

627
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,440
Your Highness,

628
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,200
His Majesty is sick and sick.

629
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,320
His nose is red.

630
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,040
He has a lot of snakebite.

631
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,160
It's all because of the fire.

632
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,160
He should use

633
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,520
warm and cool food.

634
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,080
Father,

635
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,200
have you heard that?

636
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,320
The food that is sick and sick

637
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
is harmful to the body.

638
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,080
Don't eat it.

639
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,880

641
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,080
Let her in.

642
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,200
Yes, Your Highness.

643
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,200
I stay.

644
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,920
Your Majesty,

Good?

651
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,720
No, I don't see him sweeter.

652
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,920
Ma'am.

653
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,220
Is Father using his Sarcasm?

654
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,020
I insist.

655
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,300
它的ります is high to reduces consumers'β.

656
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,380
It vaccahuates excesses.

I was planning to fight this Sarsaary first.

this house has a gardengetic heart.

671
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,820
When the Prince of Wei

00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,680
keep saying it's the big deal,

673
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,280
he gave us permission to take it.

674
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,680
I didn't expect

675
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,240
he would send it.

676
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,400
Jiaogiu Antes embezzled it.

677
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,280
Xiao'e was quite impatient.

Xiao'e was most curious.

681
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,160
I don't know.

682
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,080

Wait.

Not actually.

688
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,360
Stand up. Stand up.

689
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,360
All of you, leave.

690
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Okay.

Your Highness, what are you doing?

700
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,360
Your Highness.

701
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
What are you doing?

702
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Do it.

703
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Your Highness, I beg you. No.

704
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360

I beg you.

706
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
Your Highness.

707
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
As a kitchen cook,

708
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
you don't know how to cook well.

709
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
You eat a lot all day.

710
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
You are so greedy.

711
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Your hands

712
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,360
can't be kept.

713
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
As long as you leave me,

714
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
I won't do anything.

715
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,360
I won't do anything.

716
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
I won't do anything.

717
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
I beg you, Your Highness.

718
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
As long as you leave me,

719
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
I won't do anything.

720
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
No, Your Highness.

721
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
I'm so bold.

Please forgive her, Your Highness.

723
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Don't be so mean.

724
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,360
Don't take the credit for being so rude.

725
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,360
It's none of your business.

726
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Your Highness.

727
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
You promised me.

728
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
If I help you

729
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
to see His Majesty again,

730
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
can you give me a wish?

731
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
I beg you.

732
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Please forgive her.

Your wish.

734
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
If you do this,

735
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
will you be wasted?

736
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
Your Highness.

737
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Su Sishan

738
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,360
has the most clever hands in the world.

739
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
You also admire

740
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
the way he looks in the picture.

741
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,360
Other than him,

742
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
no one else

743
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
can look at the picture

744
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
as cleverly as he does.

745
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
I'm sorry.

746
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Get out of my way.

747
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,360
Please follow my word.

748
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,360
I'll forgive her.

749
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Let's go.

750
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Why do you keep it?

751
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
Keep it?

752
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,360
I've been good to you.

753
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
But you only care about

754
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
the clothes and the kitchen.

755
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,360
I'm sorry.

756
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,360
I'm sorry.

757
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
I'm sorry.

758
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,360
I'm sorry.

759
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
I'm sorry.

760
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,360
I'm sorry.

761
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,360
I'm sorry.

762
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,360
You only care about

763
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,360
the silver bottle in the clothes and the kitchen.

764
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
What's so good about it?

765
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
I'm chasing after Master.

766
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
I want to practice my memory.

767
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,360
He's like you.

768
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,360
He's a worthless person.

769
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
He doesn't practice his body.

770
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
He's not good at it.

771
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,360
But whatever I ask for,

772
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
whatever I wish for,

773
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
it's all in the end.

774
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Why?

775
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Why?

776
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,360
Why?

777
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,360
Yuehua, no matter what,

778
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,360
I won't love you.

779
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,360
I've never asked you for help.

780
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,360
I'm not saving you.

781
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,360
It's your hands

782
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
that have been restored to the past.

783
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,360
Yuehua,

784
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
as a kitchen,

785
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
you must be on the battlefield to fight.

786
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
I forgot to tell you.

787
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,360
I've tried

788
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,360
the time for a little smoke.

789
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,360
What about you?

790
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,360
You've prepared a lot for Uncle Yin.

791
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,360
Uncle Yin.

792
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,360
I'm sorry.

793
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,360
I'm sorry.

794
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
I'm sorry.

795
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,360
I thought...
