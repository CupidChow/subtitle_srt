00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,700
those are unknown,

4
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,680
women of Huang's family

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,980
girls strange

6
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,800
a realL�

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
No matter you are Yao Zi Jin,

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,240
or Sun Shi,

9
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,280
I will never let you go.

10
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,760
I will love you more and care more about you.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,960
I will love you more and care more about you.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
The dish made by Yan Zhi Guo.

13
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,400
Yes.

14
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,000
The radish of Yan Zhi Guo is very tasty.

15
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
It's wrapped in golden eggs.

16
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,000
It's also made with green onion.

17
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
It's more delicious.

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
The soup is good.

19
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,200
Yes.

20
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
It's made with wood.

21
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,800
It absorbs the fragrance of rice and wood.

22
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,600
It's also made with a crispy pot.

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
The salty rice is very sweet.

24
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,800
It's a pity that the ordinary rice

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
is not shared with the ordinary people.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Why?

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I will make a promise.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
I will not make a promise.

29
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I am bold.

30
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,800
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
The place where the heaven and the mountain

32
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
are located is the place of the Jinsheng Mountain and the Xishan Street.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
If the people in the capital want to marry,

34
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,000
they will marry for hundreds of miles.

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,200
I know that the mountains and forests are full of wealth.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,600
The people and the people are together.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,800
It's not the imperial family's own wealth.

38
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,000
Your Majesty.

39
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,000
The military officials and the people of the East

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
are connected to the heaven and the mountain.

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,400
The mountains and forests are near the bridge.

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,600
In case the ancestors and the ancestors

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
come to the mountain and the other mountains

44
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
are open and close.

45
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,800
Yes.

46
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,400
Get up.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,400
No wonder Princess Consort often praises you.

49
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
She said that you are a humble and humble person.

50
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,600
In the future, you can remind me more.

51
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I am afraid.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
No need to apologize.

53
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,200
Is there anything else to say?

54
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,200
Your Majesty is in the difficult situation for the people.

55
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,600
It's the house of thousands of people.

56
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Someone is bullying me and making me do this.

57
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,000
I dare not disturb you.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
But Your Majesty, you should ask me.

59
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
I can't refuse.

60
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,600
Go ahead.

61
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,600
Guangluqin is very powerful.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,200
He is willing to help the people.

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
He is willing to help the people in the south.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Your Majesty.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Take them all away.

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Yes.

67
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Why did you come here to investigate?

68
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,400
I just want to think the rest.

69
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,400
What's going on?

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,600
Guangluqin is looking for help.

71
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
He's doing a minor administrative work.

72
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,600
He came here to visit his Majesty.

73
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,800
My spirit is ignorant of bad things.

74
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
How dare he offence the people because he is advisable?

75
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,200
When airs are out of control

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
from the government affairs, people are commonly gangster.

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,640
If the public misunderstands them,

78
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,800
As soon as he arrived,

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,620
he then tracked into Jing Quan gcl

80
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,440
and filed an angst off against it,

81
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,160
out of loyalty to self.

82
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,800
Convincing them was the biggest problem,

83
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,920
as石 perk definitely helped him.

84
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,600
And they welcomed us by C Ici Si.

85
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,620
You can't

86
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,420
disturb like this.

87
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,800
Do some work.

88
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,240
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,640
Yes, sir.

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Wei.

91
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Master.

92
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Yuehua.

93
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,240
I can teach you.

94
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,040
I've already taught you.

95
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,640
Remember.

96
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,640
You must practice with your family in the future.

97
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,440
Don't let your master down.

98
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Master.

99
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,640
Where are you, master?

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
Master.

101
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,240
The Ministry of Justice found out the account of the Shao Shi Bureau.

102
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,840
I've known about it.

103
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,440
Do you know

104
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
that Wang Sishan

105
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
has committed all the crimes in the Ministry of Justice?

106
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Wei Liao Hu is such a person.

107
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,240
Someone would be so filial to him.

108
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,040
Master, you know nothing about the Shao Shi Bureau.

109
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,240
No matter who goes to the Ministry of Justice,

110
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,240
the fault of the Shao Shi Bureau must be with him.

111
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,040
I believe he's innocent.

112
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,040
Then you should find out

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,840
the culprit behind it.

114
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,240
I know you told His Majesty about it.

115
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
You need to be careful.

116
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,840
Only you can help Wang Sishan.

117
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,440
Hu Shi helped Jingquan

118
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,200
to make the Ministry of Justice

119
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
to win the money.

120
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,440
Why should I help him?

121
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
I beg you.

122
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
Let him go.

123
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,040
Let him go.

124
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,240
You beg me?

125
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,040
Yes.

126
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
I beg you.

127
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,040
I beg you.

128
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Yuan Hua.

129
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,440
When I went to see the Crown Princess,

130
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,040
I made a decision.

131
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,440
I'll take all the blame for you.

132
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,240
It's because I protect my child

133
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
and I'm a mother.

134
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,440
But from now on,

135
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,440
I'll depend on you.

136
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Master.

137
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Master.

138
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
Master.

139
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Can you forgive me

140
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
for telling him a few words?

141
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
You're still in the palace.

142
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Don't forget the time.

143
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Master.

144
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Why did you do this for others?

145
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
I was 17 years old.

146
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,240
I met him.

147
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
At that time,

148
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,240
I was weak and sick.

149
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
I often suffered from a big hand.

150
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,240
Only he could protect me.

151
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
I knew he was not a kind person.

152
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
But I wanted to protect him.

153
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Because

154
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,840
he was the one I was looking for.

155
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,240
The only friend in the palace.

156
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,840
They said you were disloyal to the Crown Princess.

157
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Then I'll never see you again.

158
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,440
I just want to go back to my hometown.

159
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I want to see His Majesty forgive me.

160
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,240
From now on,

161
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,440
I won't be by your side.

162
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,240
You must take good care of yourself.

163
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,040
Do you understand?

164
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
It's time to go.

165
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
I won't cry.

166
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,640
I won't cry.

167
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,840
Master, I'm sorry.

168
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,240
But you don't deserve to be a god.

169
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,640
It's really meaningless.

170
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
If I'm a god,

171
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,240
I'll be sick.

172
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,640
I'll pay for everything I've done.

173
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,040
The King of the World

174
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
Zi Ji.

175
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,640
Look.

176
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
How is it?

177
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
It's hard to tell.

178
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,440
I've been waiting for a long time.

179
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Yin Ziping.

180
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,240
You can't do it well.

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,240
Why don't you do it?

182
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,640
No.

183
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
You're always like this.

184
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,240
If you can't do it, you can do it all at once.

185
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,840
It's also a matter of good and good.

186
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,240
Come again.

187
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,240
It's a good thing to know how to make a good painting.

188
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,040
It's not as good as it is.

189
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,240
Come again.

190
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,840
Ziping, give it to me.

191
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,440
The tide is as deep as the tide.

192
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,840
It's not as deep as the tide.

193
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Why are you standing here?

194
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,840
You're still practicing?

195
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm practicing.

196
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
I'm practicing.

197
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,840
I'm practicing.

198
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
I'm practicing.

199
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
I'm practicing.

200
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm practicing.

201
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
I'm practicing.

202
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,440
Yes.

203
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,840
Mo Xiangchi.

204
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,840
The rest of the food is sent to the private medicine bureau to cure the typhoid.

205
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,840
Don't waste it.

206
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,240
Yes.

207
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm not going to the medical office.

208
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,640
You'll have to take care of the road in the future.

209
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,040
It's not a big deal.

210
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,440
The time limit of the food bureau is 30 kilometers per year.

211
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,640
It can really be a good place to go.

212
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,240
The master will guide you.

213
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,840
The road is far away.

214
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,640
It's all about your skills.

215
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,640
I understand, Mo Xiangchi.

216
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,240
Don't waste your time.

217
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,040
The food is well-made and well-designed.

218
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,240
It's all well-designed.

219
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,440
The food can't be empty.

220
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,240
It needs to be well-designed.

221
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,840
It needs to be well-designed.

222
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,040
To know the food is well-designed.

223
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,040
The food is well-designed.

224
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,640
The food is well-designed.

225
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,640
When will others taste the food?

226
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,640
They won't ask who is the chef.

227
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,840
You're a chef.

228
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,240
But I'm a chef.

229
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
What's the highest level?

230
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,840
I can't ask you.

231
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,440
Go in.

232
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,840
Go in.

233
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,440
Guru, l das you the city master.

234
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,240
You are the mix ups of beggars

235
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,840
who want to be in charge of both innocent andенные.

236
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,520
if we won't make it this far.

237
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,640
What else can we expect?

238
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,080
Master Huo.

239
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,520
The person who can't rest assured

240
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,960
before he leaves is you.

241
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,100
I heard

242
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,100
that you've been никогда no где

243
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,240
of restored halls,

244
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,540
so that no one would feel早

245
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,120
when nobody arrived here?

246
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,300
possible glueogan

247
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,500
There is an avalanche

248
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,340
But the force is to be matched with the avalanche

249
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,940
Or all will form onsite

250
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,500
This is also not long

251
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,780
yeah

252
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,040
Their baby is just me and the dead ones too

253
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,960
Which means the dead ones aren't looking out for us

254
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,680
I won't leave this place

255
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,720
It cost me no time to look

256
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,080
Your Highness

257
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,220
Try the любite medicine.

258
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,320
So I'm really sick of it.

259
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,200
She does give birth to the Pleiadian OD.

260
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,360
So no?

261
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Just take rest.

262
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,480
Leave Chuan all the medals and want to stay.

263
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,040
Be back for the first time,

264
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,080
Baldy Pan

265
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,420
can't stay at home anymore.

266
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,160
But Da wei's family O'Hai uses the Wings of Weaving Colour.

267
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,340
Having a migraine

268
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
has been a terrible crime inän one month.

269
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,280
It's...

270
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Yue Shi?

271
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
It's Hua Mai.

272
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,400
Pan Siyou.

273
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,200
What nonsense are you talking about?

274
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,440
Did you figure it out?

275
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,360
Good to know.

276
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,920
�

277
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,320
My rudeness gave you the lesson afterällen.

278
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,920
But she is Hourian,

279
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,880
she is weak,

280
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,200
she is driving you insane.

281
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,240
Congratulations.

282
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,760
Long live Your Highness.

283
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,160
Well said,

284
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
Your Highness.

285
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,240
How is your temper?

286
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,400
Since they pleased us,

287
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,160
if they felt sad,

288
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,720
they left the listenedPULIM

289
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
and were tired of hollering around.

290
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,000
There was a knife screw

291
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,320
in a field

292
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,840
in fluff.

293
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,080
They becameher old men

294
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,520
with no confidence in one's aspirations.

295
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,440
You've been floating in the взять-the jade

296
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,920
to attended the t recently.

297
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,320
If you those royal postures

298
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,000
only use

299
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,380
Danmaku騙混

300
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,880
분经指血

301
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,560
half month

302
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,120
chance.

303
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,120
It's obviously a disease.

304
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
It can spread out to the West.

305
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
What kind of disaster

306
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
did the Imperial Physician

307
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
have to deal with?

308
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Your Highness.

309
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
Pan Siyao.

310
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Her Highness the Empress is in trouble.

311
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
How could she say that?

312
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
It's just a Chinese pulse.

313
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
You've been taking the medicine for half a year.

314
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
When did my diagnosis

315
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
come to your understanding?

316
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Pan Siyao said that

317
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
it's a disease.

318
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
It's a serious disease.

319
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
What's the difference

320
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
between the treatment and the treatment?

321
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
The court has said it's a pulse.

322
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
What else can you argue about?

323
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Now that Lord Hu said that,

324
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
you have no idea what you're thinking.

325
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Siyao is considered a top ten.

326
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm just a sixth-ranked female official.

327
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,120
I dare not call you a great person.

328
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
But as a female doctor,

329
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
I have a kind heart.

330
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,120
I don't have any symptoms of pulse.

331
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Even if His Majesty is in the capital,

332
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,120
I can't ask him to change his mind.

333
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
You...

334
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
Please forgive me, Lord Hu.

335
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
All right.

336
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Imperial Noble Consort Guo is not asking His Majesty for help.

337
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Please ask a female doctor

338
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,120
to help her grandmother to cure her illness.

339
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,120
I think Jiang Siyao is right.

340
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Yes.

341
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Please take good care of Her Highness the Empress

342
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
and please Lord Hu.

343
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
Lord Hu.

344
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
Why do you think Siyao is so proud?

345
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
In the West,

346
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
the female doctor is a top ten.

347
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
She is a top ten.

348
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Since then,

349
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
the imperial doctor has been a female doctor.

350
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
She has become a champion.

351
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Now, the female doctor of Siyao

352
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
is not a famous doctor

353
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,120
who is known for his hard-earned skills.

354
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
He is a family of the Immortals.

355
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
He has many different identities.

356
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
He is not a common doctor.

357
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
However,

358
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
the doctor who is known for his hard-earned skills

359
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
may not be able to see clearly

360
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
the things in the palace.

361
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Is it salty?

362
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
It's good.

363
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Demon's essence.

364
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Your Highness the Empress is pregnant.

365
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
The imperial doctor opened a river liver-dry soup

366
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
for you to warm up.

367
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
You need to take the medicine slowly.

368
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
From today on,

369
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
you will help Su Yuehua

370
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
to complete the operation of Kunning Palace.

371
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Lord Hu.

372
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Why don't you let me help Yuehua?

373
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
You have been in the imperial office for so long.

374
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Do you remember the first scroll that was important to her?

375
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
Can you remember the first scroll that was important to her?

376
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Can you remember the first scroll that was important to her?

377
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
Can you remember the first scroll that was important to her?

378
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,120
Can you remember the first scroll that was important to her?

379
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Can you remember the first scroll that was important to her?

380
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Just like you,

381
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
you still want to interfere with the royal family's food.

382
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
If you are sick,

383
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
take a rope and hang it to death.

384
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Don't get involved in the Imperial Office.

385
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Don't look at me like that.

386
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Everything in the Imperial Office

387
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
is done with kindness.

388
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
Yes.

389
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Today,

390
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
the sun is really coming out from the west.

391
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
First, Lord Hu is so shameless.

392
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
He insisted on taking you to the private private office

393
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
and being stopped by Lord Hu.

394
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,120
He turned around and took Su Yuehua to Kunning Palace

395
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
to suppress you in the middle of the night.

396
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Now, the Empress is so generous.

397
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
It's such a great thing.

398
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
How can you go to the palace to work?

399
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
Didn't Lord Hu's homework

400
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
and homework be completed?

401
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
I don't understand

402
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
the cloud and fog that the deep water drew.

403
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Go and teach me.

404
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Go and teach me.

405
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
Go.

406
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Go.

407
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
This is the prescription

408
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
for the Empress.

409
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
The Imperial Hospital

410
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,120
will send the medicine to the imperial office every day.

411
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
You are very kind.

412
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
You must treat it personally.

413
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
There is no need to rush me

414
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
to the imperial office.

415
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
Don't worry.

416
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
I will be very careful.

417
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
No.

418
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Everything is done with kindness.

419
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
You don't have to interfere.

420
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Your Highness,

421
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
the medicine that will cure the soup and lotus seed porridge

422
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
and the medicine that the imperial hospital prescribed

423
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
are all made by the Empress.

424
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Shut up.

425
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,120
I am sorry to be so rude to you.

426
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Go out and kneel.

427
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I will kneel.

428
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Mother,

429
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
I heard that the Imperial Hospital

430
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
has a new doctor.

431
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
As for the medical certificate

432
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
of the late emperor for years,

433
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
the medical skill is very good.

434
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Why don't you

435
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
invite him to take a look?

436
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
The Imperial Hospital has such a doctor.

437
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Why don't you come in early?

438
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
Your Highness,

439
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
the Imperial Hospital is a great medical certificate.

440
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
It was made for the late emperor.

441
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
But it has never been made

442
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
for the imperial harem.

443
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Why don't you invite the emperor

444
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
and then invite the Imperial Hospital?

445
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
Go.

446
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Is it really the Imperial Hospital?

447
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Yes.

448
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
The lotus seed porridge

449
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
that the late emperor prescribed

450
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
has been made into the Imperial Hospital.

451
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
All the medicines that were prescribed

452
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
were also replaced.

453
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
What's wrong?

454
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
The Imperial Hospital

455
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
can be used to calm down the anger

456
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,120
and cause bloodshed.

457
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
If the Empress

458
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
is really pregnant,

459
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
how can she be used

460
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
to cause bloodshed?

461
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
What about the medicine?

462
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
You mean

463
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
the Imperial Hospital

464
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
is a chance to be used?

465
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
Moreover,

466
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
that day,

467
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
I saw the Empress's illness

468
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
and the fetus.

469
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
It was not like a premonition.

470
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
That's the real cause

471
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
of the Imperial Hospital's

472
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
real illness.

473
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
That's why I dare to use the medicine.

474
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Yu Hua.

475
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
The Imperial Hospital doesn't open.

476
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
Don't think too much.

477
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Just do as I say.

478
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Yu Hua.

479
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Mr. Meng.

480
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Yin Ziping.

481
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Are you willing to do something for me?

482
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
Mr. Yue Wei is smiling.

483
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Maybe it's a small matter.

484
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
Don't be nervous.

485
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
You can help me

486
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
to run a business.

487
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
No need.

488
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
I'll do it.

489
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Help me run to Yongning Palace.

490
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
The main position of Yongning Palace

491
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
is

492
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
Noble Consort Guo.

493
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Yes.

494
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
His Majesty has ordered

495
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
to return the medicine.

496
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Mr. Yang has advised us

497
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
to do it.

498
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
I'm afraid it's too late.

499
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Your Highness.

500
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Your Highness.

501
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Are you all right?

502
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Your Highness.

503
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
Shiqi.

504
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
How is the war

505
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
in the capital?

506
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Your Majesty.

507
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
There is a great danger

508
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
in this matter.

509
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
There are many

510
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
people in the court

511
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
who are not loyal to the emperor.

512
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Nanjing

513
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
is the emperor's name

514
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
of the emperor.

515
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
He is the capital

516
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
of the emperor of the Ming Dynasty.

517
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Back then,

518
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
the emperor was worth 1,000 years.

519
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
Three major stores were destroyed.

520
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
This is the warning

521
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,120
of the god and the ancestors.

522
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
So,

523
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
the capital

524
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
is my

525
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
order to restore the country.

526
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
Your Majesty.

527
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
His Highness has arrived.

528
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Your Majesty.

529
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
You wait here.

530
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
Shiqi.

531
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
I'm here.

532
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
You are trying to

533
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
persuade me.

534
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
The Ministry of Revenue

535
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
may not want to give up the money.

536
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
I can promise

537
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
that I will only

538
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
do the repairs

539
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
to the main stores

540
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
and never waste

541
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
the money.

542
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Besides,

543
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
after the war,

544
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
the North and North Caves

545
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
will also save

546
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
a lot of money.

547
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Father.

548
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
I want you to wait.

549
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Shiqi.

550
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
What was I going to say?

551
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
The North and North Caves.

552
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
The North and North Caves.

553
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,120
The 200,000-dollar North and North Caves.

554
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,120
The people are not willing to pay.

555
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,120
They are just waiting for the money.

556
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
I'm afraid

557
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
they won't pay.

558
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Besides,

559
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
once the North and North Caves

560
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
are in the capital,

561
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
it will be dangerous.

562
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
So,

563
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
I'm

564
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
a general

565
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
who has been through

566
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,760
the deep and deep

567
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,120
affairs.

568
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
Your Majesty.

569
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
After the operation of the Cao River,

570
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
Cao Liang's operation

571
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
was solved.

572
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
The two cases of the conflict

573
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
were solved.

574
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
The people's personal weapons,

575
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
silk, tea and wood materials

576
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,120
were used in the north and south.

577
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
The common people

578
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
were the North and North Caves.

579
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
The emperor was personally captured.

580
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
The guards were their guards.

581
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Father, you can't just

582
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
watch the time and place.

583
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
You have to remember the long-term

584
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
for your descendants.

585
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,120
What are you going to say today?

586
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
I'm here today

587
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
to tell you that

588
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
we went out of the palace

589
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
to find a tomb

590
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
that the grandfather wanted.

591
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
It wasn't for

592
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
the officials of Lalong

593
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
who opposed Father's treason.

594
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Please don't send the imperial guards

595
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
to follow me.

596
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
You're defending me like this.

597
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
I'm not used to it.

598
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I'm not happy about it.

599
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
I'm asking the imperial guards to follow you

600
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
not to watch you

601
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
but to protect you.

602
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
Bu Zhanji,

603
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
how dare you

604
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
talk to your father like this?

605
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
You're so stubborn.

606
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
I don't like to listen to you.

607
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
I can't help it.

608
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
If I see the imperial guards again,

609
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,120
I won't care about

610
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,120
Father's reputation.

611
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
Please follow me.

612
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
I'm leaving.

613
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
Bu Zhanji,

614
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
how dare you

615
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
talk to your father like this?

616
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
How dare you

617
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
talk to your father like this?

618
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
I...

619
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I...

620
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
I...

621
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
I...

622
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Shiqi.

623
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

624
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,120
I didn't say anything

625
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
just now.

626
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
I'm telling you the truth.

627
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
I'll avenge you.

628
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
I will.

629
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
I will.

630
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
I'll take the imperial guards back.

631
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
I'll take my leave.

632
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Come out.

633
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,100
Ha.

634
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,100
Your Majesty.

635
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,720
I don't see anyone

636
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,440
that envies Peking Lu

637
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,920
even for

638
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,940
your Method of Ref Tu Feed.

639
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,720
It was stored like hell all the deal!

640
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,480
You're over dozen Donejians across the country

641
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,420
for dinner

642
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,220
and the li painful.

643
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,840
Your Majesty.

644
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,720
Sit.

645
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,680
Your Majesty.

646
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,040
Your Majesty.

647
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,480
I heard it just now.

648
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,920
The others said you were too broad-minded.

649
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,560
But I thought

650
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,080
you were no longer as soft

651
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,480
and broad-minded as you are.

652
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,800
Your Majesty.

653
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,320
You must be a good emperor.

654
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,360
I hope so.

655
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,880
I'm not as kind as you

656
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,480
and I'm not as fair as you.

657
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,320
I just want to

658
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,280
fight with you less

659
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,520
and to have less corruption.

660
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,840
So that my people

661
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,640
can live a peaceful and good life.

662
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,440
Your Majesty.

663
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,800
Your Majesty.

664
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,360
Your Majesty.

665
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,720
The imperial court reports

666
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,520
that Her Highness the Empress

667
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,800
has taken the medicine for the fetus.

668
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,400
It's suddenly not only effective.

669
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,280
Your Majesty, let me go.

670
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,040
Your Majesty.

671
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,200
Your Majesty.

672
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,760
I'm wronged.

673
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,080
Her Highness is not a prime minister.

674
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,520
If you keep it this way,

675
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,280
she will be dead in a few days.

676
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,240
Her Highness is not safe.

677
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,080
Your Majesty.

678
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,360
Your Majesty.

679
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,200
I'm wronged. Your Majesty.

680
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,280
Your Majesty.

681
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,640
In this way,

682
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,640
Her Highness will be dead in a few days.

683
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,800
Minister Hu,

684
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,480
will you still send the medicine?

685
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,880
Go back to Yantai's room

686
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,160
and do it again.

687
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,000
Yes.

688
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,680
Your Majesty.

689
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,000
Your Majesty.

690
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,600
Your Majesty.

691
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,660
Your Majesty.

692
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,120
Your Majesty.

693
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,400
I'm urgent.

694
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,760
Don't erred, Your Majesty.

695
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,160
Go seeнее.

696
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,360
Bai Zhe!

697
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,520
Zero.

698
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,160
Quiet.

699
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,180
what's wrong with you?

700
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,640
your depression is high

701
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,600
what are you doing?

702
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,960
it's been a few days

703
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,320
during the whole seven days

704
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,400
she refused to apply the concoction of med affiliate

705
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,540
every day he used走

706
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,900
he died in a fever

707
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,920
the queen pregnant isimes

708
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,980
if you just tell lies

709
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,100
Obviously it's not bloodshed.

710
00:36:47,840 --> 00:37:06,540
He Heavenly

711
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,540
What are you talking about?

712
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,420
Nothing

713
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,180
Go and deliver.

714
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Ziping, go!

715
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,180
Go, go, go!

716
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,180
Ziping, go, go, go!

717
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,180
Your Highness, I have a favor to ask.

718
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,180
I thought you didn't want to come to this school anymore.

719
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,180
I'm responsible for what I did.

720
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,180
I dare not push you away.

721
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,180
You hate me so much.

722
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
Why don't you just put some makeup on inside?

723
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,180
It's really a pity.

724
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,180
I can't tell.

725
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,180
You dare not let the whole family die with me.

726
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,180
You are really honest.

727
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
Yao Ziqian.

728
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,180
Your Highness, I'm Sun.

729
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,180
I don't know Sun.

730
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,180
I only know Yao Ziqian.

731
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
I know you.

732
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,180
I know you.

733
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,180
I know you.

734
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,180
I know you.

735
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,180
Your Highness,

736
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,180
why don't you care more about the Empress' illness?

737
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
Miss Yao,

738
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,180
the Empress is pregnant.

739
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,180
The Crown Prince is not helping.

740
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,180
You are so unreasonable.

741
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,180
Your Highness,

742
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,180
please forgive me.

743
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,180
Your Highness,

744
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:18,180
the Empress has been saying that she is not pregnant.

745
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,180
Don't you think it's strange?

746
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
The courtesan said

747
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
that the Empress is pregnant.

748
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,180
She will be in great danger and will be in trouble.

749
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,180
I haven't seen her in two days.

750
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,180
The Empress has four children.

751
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,180
She won't know the symptoms of pregnancy.

752
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,180
She has been suffering all day.

753
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,180
The imperial doctor has no choice but to take care of her.

754
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,180
What if the imperial doctor is right?

755
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,180
She is not pregnant?

756
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
The courtesan

757
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
will tell the imperial doctor every day.

758
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
Do you think she is wrong alone?

759
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Is everything wrong?

760
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
The one who sold the medicine

761
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
is the courtesan.

762
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Who dares to break her rule?

763
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
Moreover,

764
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,180
His Majesty has confirmed that the Empress is pregnant.

765
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
Who dares to betray the people?

766
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,180
The diagnosis of the disease

767
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
and the consequences are not good.

768
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
How dare you make a sound?

769
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,180
Your Highness,

770
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,180
the imperial doctor has given birth to thirty children.

771
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,180
He is willing to change his mouth.

772
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
Is he really not going to be alive?

773
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
No.

774
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
Because in the heart of the imperial doctor,

775
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,180
medical skills and the lives of the patient

776
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,180
are far from the personal life and death.

777
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
Similarly,

778
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,180
I am a female official of the Shang's Bureau.

779
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
But I personally met the imperial doctor.

780
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,180
I have to take responsibility

781
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,180
to send the patient to the hospital.

782
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,180
I am not a person who is responsible for the illness.

783
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,180
I am not a person who is a murderer.

784
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,180
You mean

785
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,180
it is father who did the wrong?

786
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,180
How dare you!

787
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,180
I am a humble person.

788
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
I don't dare to do anything.

789
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,180
But you are asking me,

790
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,180
I dare not to do anything.

791
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,180
Yao Zhangshan.

792
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Let him talk.

793
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,180
Your Highness,

794
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
in the heart of the emperor,

795
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
the father who has been married for twenty years

796
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,180
is no better than the one who has a child in the dance.

797
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,180
He is a child.

798
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,180
The empress is in a very bad mood now.

799
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
You are a child.

800
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
You can't be afraid of the birthday of me.

801
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
Your Highness,

802
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
it's late. Where are you going?

803
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
Eunuch Yuan.

804
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Miss Hua Ping.

805
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Is the crown prince in the mansion now?

806
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,180
Look,

807
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,180
what a coincidence.

808
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,180
The crown prince just left the palace.

809
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
What should we do?

810
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,180
What?

811
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
What's wrong?

812
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
Don't worry.

813
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,180
The rest is there.

814
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
I have already arranged it.

815
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,180
I will help you.

816
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,180
Yes.

817
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,180
You can go back now.

818
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,180
I'm going back.

819
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
I will go back.

820
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,180
I'll go back.

821
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,180
I'll go back.

822
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,180
I'm going back.

823
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,180
Your Highness.

824
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,180
Your Highness.

825
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,180
Be careful.

826
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,180
Your Highness.

827
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
Please come in.

828
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
I'm going back.

829
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,180
I'm going back.

830
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,180
I'm going back.

831
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,180
I'm going back.

832
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,180
I'm going back.

833
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
I'm going back.

834
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,180
Greetings, Your Highness.

835
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,620
Magic Spell

836
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,800
Sorry to bother you

837
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,880
to give me some milk skills.

838
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,720
No, I can't.

839
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,860
I can't give him any calm medication.

840
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,000
Give him a hand.

841
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,480
Yes,不了.

842
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,280
Come out.

843
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,180
He is human,

844
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:36,780
not a human.

845
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:38,700
Why?

846
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,140
Do you want me to invite him in person?

847
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

848
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,580
Your Highness.

849
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,860
Open the door.

850
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,540
Your Highness.

851
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,380
Let me see your skills.

852
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,940
Yes.

853
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,580
There are two firecrackers in the hall.

854
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,580
They have been blown away.

855
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,180
Your Highness, please.

856
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,180
Pre estim stink

857
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:31,280
Cut 220
