The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000

Go back to the palace.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mother.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Take back what you had.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you hear me?

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go. Go. Go.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
If you can't do it, you're sorry.

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000

00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry to myself.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You have no choice.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Zushan.

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm dead.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Zi Jin.

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What are you doing?

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you looking for the plum blossom?

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Crown Prince, it's too hard to serve.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The plum blossom hasn't been opened yet.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The plum blossom is half-cooked.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It smells good.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Isn't it the one who's been lost?

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,500
The plum blossom pairs great with your lemonade,

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
就是說

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It itself has thisait feeling.

74
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,960
Some scent that isBring some beauty.

75
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,440
I've taken away the plum.

76
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,160
The scent gets varmint sooner.

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,000
It's more fruitful if the ingredients are nutrient-intensive.

78
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Just now,

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,240
Hu Shanxiang came to Shu Zhai.

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,960
You went too far.

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,520
Why?

82
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,480
Your Highness,

83
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,440
I want to stay here for a lifetime

84
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,600
to taste Fengqing's dinner,

85
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,000
how have we ever been sent here?

86
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
These are your letters?

87
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
What's wrong?

88
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,240
Right.

89
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,160
Just send them here

90
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,620
for me.

91
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,720
On your behalf,

92
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,240
I want to knob away the tsongct Mythos of the trio.

93
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:32,840
Good girl,

94
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,000
I will stay in the Shang City.

95
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,360
Since then,

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,960
you don't have to have a good old friend.

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,720
I have a good life.

98
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,800
What did you say?

99
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
I want to be a woman.

100
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,520
I want to be a kitchen.

101
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,880
Have you ever

102
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,920
treated me sincerely?

103
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,520
If I didn't enter the palace,

104
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,800
will you still remember me?

105
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,320
Yes.

106
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,520
I won't deny it.

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,600
I don't remember you

108
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,320
being like this for ten years.

109
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,600
I even forgot you.

110
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,800
But at the beginning,

111
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,640
the wife of the Han clan

112
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,160
was the gift that the Zhang family gave me.

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
The origin of all these misfortunes

114
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,800
is the fault of the Zhang family's sister,

115
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,720
the father-in-law's stubbornness and doubt.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,880
You are not fair to me like this.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,240
His Majesty сделал a decree

118
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,960
to detainunda the Serve Cornetch here.

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,880
When a roughly geriatric修正

120
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,440
happened in the month of March,

121
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
how manyStepotherapy supplies

122
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,980
only went to pieces.

123
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,080
After young generations,

124
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,840
how many women

125
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,000
went to the very hands of the Han clan

126
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,320
and emissary those ones around.

127
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,840
They made everything

128
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,560
just for the fun of

129
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,400
I'm happy.

130
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,880
Your hands are clean and white.

131
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,520
But your fabric

132
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,520
is covered with blood.

133
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,240
In your eyes,

134
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,160
whether I know whether I love you or not,

135
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,840
I've never asked anyone for my opinion.

136
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,360
Just because I'm the grandson of the Crown Prince,

137
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
I'm the culprit.

138
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,600
So,

139
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,280
you'd rather stay at the funeral hall

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,360
than stay by my side.

141
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,120
You have a half-hearted mind.

142
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,240
Maybe,

143
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,320
please forgive me for being impolite.

144
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,120
Because

145
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,440
I don't want to be your concubine.

146
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,760
I don't want to live for you.

147
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
I don't want to be a puppet

148
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,160
that others can't see.

149
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,080
Please make your choice.

150
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Wei did you come back?

151
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,520
I didn't leave home getting a guest.

152
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,400
I ran into Lemon estava?

153
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
It fell from that room.

154
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,360
And I'm afraid

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,440
I might eat your food before me.

156
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,720
Blue하't?

157
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,880
Wei.

158
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
liers.

159
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,560
From now on, I don't want to see this woman again.

160
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,560
The Imperial Concubine

161
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,920
Greetings, Mother.

162
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,440
You're here.

163
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Have a seat.

164
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,600
Yes.

165
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,360
Yes, these are the ones.

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,720
Throw them away.

167
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,200
Mother,

168
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,880
aren't these all the old clothes

169
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,040
you sewed for the Emperor?

170
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
You sewed them in detail.

171
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,160
I don't know how many nights

172
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,240
you've been blushing.

173
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,200
You can't lose them.

174
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
He's the Emperor now.

175
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,280
He doesn't need these.

176
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,960
The clothes that the Imperial Concubine made

177
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,000
were always worn by His Lordship.

178
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,320
He never lost them.

179
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,640
I think these clothes are new.

180
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,920
It's useless.

181
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,640
If you don't love me,

182
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,240
then you can be my son.

183
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
I'll keep them in my heart.

184
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,840
If you like me,

185
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,600
I'll let the Imperial Concubine

186
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
sew them for you.

187
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,240
She's not good at sewing.

188
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,720
Don't say that it's a good clothes.

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,760
I'm afraid

190
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,800
you haven't even got a handkerchief.

191
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,760
This is your fault.

192
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,920
You're being so considerate.

193
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
You're not good at writing.

194
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,840
You don't like to work.

195
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
You can't talk to her

196
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,680
about poetry and love each other.

197
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,200
But she has a kind heart.

198
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,360
She knows how to understand others.

199
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,800
She's been doing something wrong.

200
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,120
You shouldn't have been so impulsive.

201
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,240
If you had told me earlier,

202
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
you wouldn't have been so considerate.

203
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,560
Mother,

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,800
why is it always my son's fault?

205
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,720
The mother-in-law of the people

206
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,160
will protect her if she wants to be a widow.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,040
That's how she'll be a widow.

208
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,280
She's a family.

209
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Moreover,

210
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,280
she's working hard.

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,440
If I don't protect her,

212
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,080
she'll feel wronged.

213
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,040
Who else can I tell her?

214
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,240
Sister,

215
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,600
she knows she's wrong.

216
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,480
Give her another chance.

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,600
Don't be like your father.

218
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,160
Please.

219
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,280
Here we are.

220
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,600
Write a characters word for me.

221
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,880
Yes.

222
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,360
As��, what does that mean?

223
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
Searching from the inside.

224
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,920
Ladies,

225
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,760
Your Lady.

226
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,920
Naturally,

227
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,160
calm down!

228
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,760
a clever student.

229
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,640
Sang Shii in the 손 your Majesty.

230
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,200
Sang Shii in the moment

231
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,760
think the scriptures and woman

232
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,080
are the zalige or the loyalty of people.

233
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,840
Is it?

234
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,160
Am I

235
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,640
that feared?

236
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,200
My lord,

237
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,640
my knowledge of fan is simple and simple.

238
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,080
I can be sure of it.

239
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,040
But Su Yuehua is born a noble family.

240
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,520
She follows Wang Sishan and treats Mingyao with great care.

241
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,280
I'm afraid that

242
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,880
she and I will not win.

243
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,360
In that case,

244
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,000
you don't have the determination to win.

245
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,000
Mr. Meng,

246
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,520
please let me try.

247
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,360
Yes.

248
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,560
You?

249
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,920
Yin Ziping,

250
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,480
you're just a female servant.

251
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,000
You're going to compete with Su Dianshan.

252
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,040
You can't keep going.

253
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll win the first game for you.

254
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,080
Can the empress win the first game?

255
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,320
If the first game fails,

256
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,800
the Grand Master of the Lake will only let Su Yuehua win.

257
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,760
It will stop us from fighting.

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,760
You have no confidence to win.

259
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,560
Do you want to be a person who is a self-proclaimed man

260
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,440
and compete with a noble person?

261
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,400
It's not easy to win.

262
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,760
It's okay.

263
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,000
Mr. Meng,

264
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,600
Kindred.

265
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,000
Ziping has struggled

266
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,040
and Karate skillful

267
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,120
in these ten days.

268
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,800
Look.

269
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,880
Do the birds' flowers from the flood

270
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,000
always pick flowers?

271
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,240
Please give Ziping a chance.

272
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,520
Please believe me.

273
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,760
Okay.

274
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,880
Let's do it.

275
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,760
Yes.

276
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,960
Thank you.

277
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,000
I've reminded you many times.

278
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,600
When you're free and willing to do so,

279
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
your friends will jumped to you for some stuff.

280
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,360
Otherwise,

281
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,520
you just thinks one person will인 a dream.

282
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,600
What would you do

283
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,920
if someone reprimands you

284
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,800
when testing you?

285
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,160
Myimmer lawsuits

286
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,320
were high- Covering station,

287
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,120
citing my place.

288
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,000
Why do youепame me?

289
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,560
But

290
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,240
stato naar Suyue Hua

291
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,280
isn't easy task for me.

292
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm not Worting you.

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm going to be a good girl.

295
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

296
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

297
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

298
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

299
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

300
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

301
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

302
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

303
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

304
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

305
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm not going to be a bad girl.

308
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

309
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm not going to be a good girl.

310
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Your Highness.

311
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Your Highness.

312
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
Did you hear Sister Zhang say that

313
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,000
you've taken the治 아파 Lid.

314
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's food for a mountain since a few days ago.

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes you should mention mother on every day.

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,500
If you like her.

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,480
What about you?

318
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,440
What about you?

319
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,800
How's my baby?

320
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,600
They are several days older than my child.

321
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,380
Your Royal Highness,

322
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,380
If anything happens to her,

323
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,580
you can go back first.

324
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,420
Yes.

325
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,260
Your Highness, you can't.

326
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,100
Ren Qi.

327
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,140
Your Highness.

328
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,980
Clean up.

329
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,940
Let's move back.

330
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,660
Yes.

331
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,140
Your Highness.

332
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,900
How can this work?

333
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,140
Very good.

334
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,380
It's early in the morning.

335
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,060
If you are far away from here,

336
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,900
you can see the far side of the mountain.

337
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,180
The lake is clear.

338
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,940
And the clouds are passing by.

339
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,620
The wind is blowing.

340
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,460
It's a great pleasure.

341
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,860
Let's go.

342
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:32,980
We're not going back to the palace.

343
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,060
We'll go now.

344
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,580
Your Highness, it's late.

345
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,620
I don't know how to write.

346
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,660
I can only write when I go.

347
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,500
If you have a mute temper,

348
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,540
I can invite the officials to come tomorrow.

349
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,740
It's better.

350
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,340
Forget it.

351
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,060
I'll go by myself.

352
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,860
You go back to the palace first.

353
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,860
Your Highness.

354
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,460
You still have a temper.

355
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,340
Your Highness.

356
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,100
Didn't you say you can sleep sitting here?

357
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,100
Go to sleep.

358
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,140
I think I can finish it before dawn.

359
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,860
I'll let you sleep.

360
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,300
It's late.

361
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,780
Even if you are a minister,

362
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,980
you shouldn't go out of your way.

363
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,900
Have you considered

364
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,740
my suggestion?

365
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,820
I refuse.

366
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,060
Fine.

367
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,620
Good.

368
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,340
Fine.

369
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,980
You are a hero and fireographer.

370
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,980
You're an jaardeer.

371
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,540
You won't say yes?

372
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,980
No.

373
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,060
You don't hate Hoshiiya?

374
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,620
No.

375
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,860
You think you can avoid him

376
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,700
if you hide in theariate.

377
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,620
I don't believe you.

378
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,260
I don't believe you.

379
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,140
What do you mean?

380
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,980
I don't believe that someone has been

381
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,140
so calm and peaceful for a long time.

382
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,180
I don't believe that you are more willing

383
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,420
to be alone than you are.

384
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,060
Why are you so calm?

385
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,780
I...

386
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,260
I have a death.

387
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,300
I can't die.

388
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,660
You and Qiu tengo are destined to

389
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
meet people only because of you.

390
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,800
So why do you give up?

391
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,680
Why are you so much worried about them?

392
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,520
A scoundrel such as me

393
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,380
is a beast in love with his weariness.

394
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,300
A dangerous beast who Vie好像 is trapped.

395
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,460
I'm going to make a promise.

396
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,460
For the first time I've been sent by a woman,

397
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm just a servant to inspect the Eastern Palace.

398
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,460
I don't want to talk about personal grudges.

399
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,300
I don't know what you and the Crown Prince are arguing about.

400
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,380
But it's common sense

401
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,180
that we can't get along well with each other.

402
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,540
You've been able to

403
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,260
take advantage of the Eastern Palace

404
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,140
and leave the family.

405
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,180
You're just a servant.

406
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,300
You still want to protect her?

407
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,180
It's a great fortune.

408
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,860
Taking advantage of her

409
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,100
is the life of an ordinary modern emperor.

410
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,140
Every man faryw trees.

411
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,100
Even an abandoned wife

412
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,180
deserves such kind affection.

413
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,700
It feels so rare!

414
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,300
It feels...

415
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,340
Sure.

416
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,540
You're your servant.

417
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,740
I'm your servant.

418
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,540
Let's do our work.

419
00:24:40,700 --> 00:25:08,740
I'll go

420
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,740
You're too good, Zi Jin.

421
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,740
What's wrong?

422
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,740
What are you looking at?

423
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,740
Nothing.

424
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
Is it good?

425
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
You can't see it.

426
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
You're right.

427
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
You're right.

428
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,740
Episode 1

429
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
What are you doing?

430
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,740
You scared me.

431
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,740
I put the painting here.

432
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,740
And I locked it up.

433
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
Now it's gone.

434
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,740
I'm looking for it.

435
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,740
I'm looking for it.

436
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,740
You go down.

437
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
I'll show you.

438
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
Where did it go?

439
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
Where did you put it?

440
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
I put it there.

441
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,740
Did you look for it?

442
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
Why can't you open it?

443
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,740
What are you doing?

444
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,740
Look at what you've done.

445
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
It's not important.

446
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
You're not here yet.

447
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
I said I'm not here.

448
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,740
You didn't look for it, did you?

449
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,740
I didn't see it.

450
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
This is the painting.

451
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
The painting is from the Qing Dynasty.

452
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,740
The Tang Dynasty was more powerful than the Qing Dynasty.

453
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
It was very powerful.

454
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,740
It was used to make goods,

455
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,740
to buy goods,

456
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,740
to sell goods,

457
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
to buy goods,

458
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
to buy goods,

459
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,740
to buy goods,

460
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,740
to buy goods,

461
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
to buy goods,

462
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
to buy goods,

463
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
to use the flower-colored cold plate

464
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,740
to re-reform the landscape in the spring.

465
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
Are you sure?

466
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,740
Although some of the landscape's materials

467
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,740
are still in the collection,

468
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,740
I'm already satisfied with it.

469
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
Okay.

470
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,740
From now on,

471
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
you must listen to

472
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,740
the tone of Su's painting.

473
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
Yes.

474
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
What are you doing?

475
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,740
You can't die.

476
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
Su Yuehua,

477
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,740
there's no internet painting in the palace.

478
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
Where did you get this painting?

479
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
As far as I know,

480
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
you only know how to recognize the technique.

481
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,740
You can't be so good at painting, right?

482
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
Of course I can't.

483
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
This is just

484
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
the work of the palace painter.

485
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
I'm here to take a look.

486
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
Is there anything I can't do?

487
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
Su Dianshan,

488
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
do you really plan to

489
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,740
re-reform the internet painting

490
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,740
with the flower-colored cold plate?

491
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
Who else

492
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,740
can do this except

493
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,740
Yuehua?

494
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
You?

495
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,740
This painting is clearly

496
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
what the emperor said.

497
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
I never thought

498
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,740
Su Dianshan

499
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,740
would do such a shameless thing.

500
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,740
He really makes people

501
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,740
open their eyes.

502
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
Yin Ziping,

503
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,740
you're so shameless.

504
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,740
Watch your tongue.

505
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
Su Dianshan,

506
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
re-reform the internet painting

507
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,740
not only in the form of

508
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,740
the flower-colored cold plate.

509
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,740
Re-reform the internet painting.

510
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
This is not an easy thing.

511
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
I'm looking forward to your products.

512
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Ziping.

513
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,740
Ziping.

514
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
Let's go.

515
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
Let's go.

516
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
I don't care what you think.

517
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
I only care about

518
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
the final result.

519
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
Yes.

520
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
It's clearly your

521
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,740
re-reform the internet painting.

522
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,740
Why don't you let me

523
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,740
take a look at it?

524
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,740
I've lost it.

525
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,740
If you just made a big deal

526
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,740
but didn't get any evidence,

527
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,740
I'm afraid

528
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
the minister of the fox

529
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
will turn you into a thief

530
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,740
and make you lose your right to compete.

531
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,740
I lose my right to compete?

532
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
He can't get away with it.

533
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
I thought I would do something bad.

534
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,740
I didn't expect

535
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,740
such a person

536
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,740
who is so generous

537
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,740
would be worse than me.

538
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,740
Yin Ziping.

539
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
You're still laughing?

540
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
You remember?

541
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
The more angry he is,

542
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,740
the more you can't get angry.

543
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Once you're angry,

544
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,740
you'll get into his trap.

545
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,740
I'm not angry.

546
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,740
I'm not at all.

547
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,740
But I'm still angry.

548
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
Ziping.

549
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
I'm a little bit shy.

550
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
I'm a little bit dizzy.

551
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,740
But I can't stand the enemy.

552
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,740
When I'm angry,

553
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,740
why should I be angry?

554
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
Suyuehua is a child.

555
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,740
Can't she be the same as Mingyao?

556
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,740
If you're the first to be on the same team,

557
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,740
we have to win.

558
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,740
You're so confident.

559
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,740
As long as I want to win,

560
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,740
I'll win.

561
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,740
Are you not angry?

562
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,260
וב

563
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,980
Unexpectedly

564
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,860
you can've done this too.

565
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,740
As long as it's precious,

566
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,220
the heart remains lorsquous.

567
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,180
But do you know

568
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,000
what kind of person I am?

569
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,740
But why do you do that?

570
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,900
One thing,

571
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,980
I have to fulfill my duty

572
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,780
even if my good news comes tousa.

573
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,420
Only if you have a knew magic will you win.

574
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,260
Notify Her Highness,

575
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,860
who wants to blame you for her fall down to the Candle Sky?

576
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,180
You work hard!

577
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,260
My good girl,

578
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,820
you've worked hard.

579
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,220
I can beat you to defeat you.

580
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,380
I'll remember him as soon as we meet.

581
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,020
Now,

582
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,260
A labor force PB Team

583
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:41,860
Here.

584
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,300
You embroidered it yourself?

585
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,780
Not bad.

586
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,620
It's so pretty.

587
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,340
Sit down.

588
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,060
You sit down too.

589
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,580
Tan Zifei, what are you doing?

590
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,180
What's this?

591
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,700
Your Highness,

592
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,940
Song dynasty

593
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,780
in the Qinchun drowsy intro

594
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,540
noted by EmpressPOS wanderer,

595
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,740
The Frostный Qiuju.

596
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,020
There was no more flower at any of these two,

597
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,620
why is it named after?

598
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,880
These 16 pebbles

599
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,580
have Long and plain forms,

600
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,540
and shall be famous as the mighty qiung.

601
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,460
It's a pity

602
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,780
that the lord of the somnести

603
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,220
went in and out Wednesday or April.

604
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,460
and Dr. Allery.

605
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,100
My hot pot is hidden underneath the popular- weeosh.

606
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,940
I wish it could be served from Buddha KGo God餐.

607
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:49,980
Well,

608
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,620
Young Lady vamp won't be reaching me with a fit decision.

609
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,460
The Empress of세 left Nian Rui Ward

610
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,620
to prepare meals for her.

611
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,860
She'll be 미끕煥之天下,

612
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,420
which is not川澇 put to bed.

613
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,620
How is that good?

614
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,860
How's her appearance?

615
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,340
And I tried that some days ago.

616
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,100
Then isn't Her Highness the Empress

617
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,760
all right for helping them?

618
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,560
Sheara...

619
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:33,900
rigid.

620
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,140
Empress்

621
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,180
So unpredictable

622
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Yet Ruofan learns to carry out things perfectly

623
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,380
That's impossible

624
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,420
What?

625
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,780
I guess the stones are cleaned

626
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,620
He just used this

627
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,880
Rub후 stones and matar

628
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,580
If I have yours, I'm sure I will

629
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,020
Black Fox.

630
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,100
Do you want to die without 정도로 living?

631
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,540
I think

632
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:25,760
going toyelling and drawing

633
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,080
is a bit legal for us,

634
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,480
to fool Public Administration 126.

635
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,080
What are you two doing?

636
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,760
Long Feng wanted some information,

637
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
and manages a good point.

638
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
What kind of goal is it?

639
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,680
Such a verbal meeting.

640
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
It was the first time he found

641
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
such a strange gift.

642
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,160
I'll give the gathering according to your orders.

643
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,480
What are they doing?

644
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
With that picture,

645
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,480
they are doing nothing.

646
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Why are you still not busy?

647
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,480
Where can I win this Soul Stone?

648
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
No, Zi Jin.

649
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Your shape is different.

650
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
How can you do that?

651
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
Zi Jin?

652
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
It's too late.

653
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,480
It's all too late.

654
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
It's a picture of the past.

655
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,480
Wang Mo Jie took it to the village during the New Year.

656
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
He often had friends to sing and dance.

657
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
They were happy to meet each other.

658
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
And they were fascinated by the picture.

659
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Look.

660
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
This is Hua Zigang.

661
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,480
The Seven Foxes.

662
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
This is a text from Wenxin.

663
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
It's a letter from Wenxin.

664
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
It's a letter from Wenxin.

665
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
It's from Wenxin.

666
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,480
It's a letter from Wenxin.

667
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
The Seven Foxes.

668
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,480
This is from Wenxin.

669
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
It's a new item.

670
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
That's right.

671
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
It's a picture from Wang.

672
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,480
Your Highness, you are so good at acting.

673
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,480
How can you act like

674
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,480
Wang Mo Jie's family?

675
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,480
I've never seen this kind of scene before.

676
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,480
Hua Zigang, Zhu Yi Yi,

677
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
The Seven Foxes.

678
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,480
They are just like the name

679
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
of the Five-Legend of the Immortal.

680
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Why did you say that?

681
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Why did you say that?

682
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,480
The most common fruit in the world is vegetables.

683
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
They are scattered in green and green water.

684
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
They are very juicy.

685
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Every cold plate

686
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,480
has the blood and silk of the kitchen.

687
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
It's really rare.

688
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Noble Consort Guo,

689
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,480
what do you think?

690
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,480
It's a great achievement.

691
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Since Noble Consort Guo said so,

692
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,480
do you need to keep comparing

693
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
the first game?

694
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
It's a pity.

695
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,480
There are some ingredients

696
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,480
that are not used.

697
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
The scenery is really great.

698
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,480
But the attitude of the person

699
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,480
is not suitable for the practical use.

700
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,480
The craftsmanship of this sculpture is really brilliant.

701
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,480
It's not even as good as the one with a hundred taels.

702
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,480
Look at this.

703
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
The silk is like spring rain.

704
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
I can't figure out

705
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,480
what ingredients it is.

706
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Noble Consort Guo,

707
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
this season is good for eating hot pot.

708
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,480
It's really good for eating hot pot.

709
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
It's really good for eating hot pot.

710
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,480

00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
It's really good for eating hot pot.

713
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,480
It's better to eat hot pot.

714
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,480
It's good for eating cold wind blowing.

715
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
I mean it.

716
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
You should try it.

717
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Miss Meng.

718
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Yes.

719
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,480
It's already done.

720
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
Let's go.

721
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480
I'm going to make a pot of hot pot.

You littleidad.

736
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,480
Okay.

737
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Have you got ready to taste?

738
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Ready to taste.

739
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,480
The soup from here should be an order.

740
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
cción.

741
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
This is good.

742
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,480
Housekeeper doesn't need to,

743
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,480
we Theatre Manager onti leads the way,

744
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
so she can eat the spring food.

745
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,720
Of course,

746
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,040
Here comes fresh mint and offal.

747
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:40,980
It's made from the fire master

748
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:50,040
and with the guitar and the fruit.

749
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,680
Spirit of what?

750
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,280
They're not just因為 20 elements of shakingjobs inlaid general.

751
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,660
In my opinion,

752
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,760
