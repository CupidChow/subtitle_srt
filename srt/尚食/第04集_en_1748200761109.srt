My:「Life Is Warm, Still Is It Guaranteed."

3
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,620
Li Sha.

4
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:57,060
Broket

5
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,880
Today's înight jersey is just right

6
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
Let's go

7
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,640
She will do it

8
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,460
Episode 18

9
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,540
AsAH?

10
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,140
Don't move.

11
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,500
You look so cute.

12
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,780
End it.

13
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,940
End it.

14
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,620
The purple purple is in a hurry.

15
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,620
The fire is out.

16
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,620
Every night, you come out and talk.

17
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,620
You don't even think about it.

18
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,620
The palace sent a special envoy to the different places every year.

19
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,620
It was sent by a thousand purple purple chicks to the Royal Descendant.

20
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,620
Since he didn't have a bad temper,

21
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,620
don't waste that energy.

22
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,620
Come.

23
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,620
The purple is light and light.

24
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,620
You are not yellow.

25
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,620
You are small and can't fool people.

26
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
You are still like this?

27
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
Go back.

28
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Let's go.

29
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
My lord.

30
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Zhao He is so thoughtful.

31
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,620
He is not afraid of the crown prince.

32
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
He also did something important.

33
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,620
The crown prince was not in a good position before he was appointed as the guard.

34
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,620
He was appointed as a maid by the imperial order.

35
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,620
He was chosen by the royal officials.

36
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,620
He was appointed by the royal officials.

37
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,620
He was appointed by the royal officials.

38
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,620
I have been in the palace for a while.

39
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,620
Have some tea.

40
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
Yes.

41
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,620
You are so small.

42
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
You are a purple purple chick.

43
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,620
You are not the original king of the royal family.

44
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,620
You are too naive.

45
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,620
Try it.

46
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Okay.

47
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,620
You lost.

48
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Your Highness, please wait.

49
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
Your Highness, please wait.

50
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,620
Your Highness, please wait.

51
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,620
You can't win three days for this.

52
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,620
Congratulations, Your Highness.

53
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,620
Congratulations, Your Highness.

54
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
Your Highness.

55
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
Where did you come from?

56
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,620
This little thing

57
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
won six times in a row.

58
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
It was a win at the first try.

59
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,620
Don't look at him.

60
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,620
The general of the crown prince

61
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,620
will lose at the first try.

62
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,620
There are many times when you are lucky.

63
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,620
But you are not.

64
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,620
Even if the real king of the royal family is in front of you,

65
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,620
who can be more than ten?

66
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,620
How do I know?

67
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,620
You lose.

68
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,620
Three days of that.

69
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,620
It's seasons now.

70
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Get some rest.

71
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,780
The imperial belt was damaged by others' failure so추.

72
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,260
Someone had unionized him.

73
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,300
It was said,

74
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,700
someone went to repair the檀客 last night,

75
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,740
so we gave it a pass.

76
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,380
There's a big difference.

77
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,340
Someone with Medal of Honor

78
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,060
had the outstanding "-Sgas GuestWelling Logistics Power".

79
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,700
And just made their relationship

80
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,060
into good business.

81
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,700
But the justice pode

82
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,680
is indeed secretive.

83
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
There's such a thing as such?

84
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,180
Yes.

85
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,260
Miss Yan.

86
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
Sister Yin.

87
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,620
Sit.

88
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,620
Do you think he's weird?

89
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,620
How is that weird?

90
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,620
This is the sign of his life.

91
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
He's been with women for a long time.

92
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,620
I saw him setting up the tent for the wedding.

93
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,620
He wrote a beautiful poem.

94
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,620
He knows everything.

95
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,620
The royal family chose the empress.

96
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,620
Many people are with her.

97
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,620
The former minister of the Deyan Palace.

98
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620
The empress is a good girl.

99
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,620
The former minister of the Deyan Palace.

100
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
He's the one who chose the empress.

101
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,620
His character is gentle and elegant.

102
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,620
He's a good girl.

103
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
He's a good woman.

104
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Even if he's a good man,

105
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,620
he's a good man.

106
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,620
What's the weirdness?

107
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
But a noble woman

108
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
can change the world.

109
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
You really don't think so?

110
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,620
What's the difference?

111
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,620
I'll take a look at the exam tomorrow.

112
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,620
Finish your exam.

113
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,480
Eunuch,

114
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,380
you're just your friend.

115
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,620
A bit too sweet.

116
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,280
I will eat a lot later.

117
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,040
Just a little less.

118
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,620
Shout out to him.

119
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,100
Since you're all my friends,

120
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,740
when I brush my hair,

121
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
I'll tell you what,

122
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,100
I want to WEKON

123
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,360
to a Namul family.

124
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,180
Don't let him do this.

125
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,820
I have to.

126
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,880
We won't.

127
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,960
We'll go there and achieve nothing.

128
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,240
Miss Yuan, what brings you here?

129
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,680
Your Highness present is for Officer Xianyang.

130
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,560
The business leave.

131
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
We need a hot pot in the afternoon.

132
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,320
Report the autumn.

133
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,320
Please prepare the soup for him.

134
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,640
However, however

135
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,120
the Crown Princess Minister has told us

136
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,640
that Imperialár KentuckyUNG is making something of himself lately.

137
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,000
Alright.

138
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,440
You said I was nearly sedent and was not pakk jagann.

139
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,320
There's nothing about that.

140
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
You just stay here.

141
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,560
One more thing.

142
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Eunuch Liang.

143
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,040
Ziqian.

144
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
What should we do?

145
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,440
Crown Prince, the pearl is fragrant.

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,360
Crown Prince, the pearl is fragrant.

147
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,840
Hang on.

148
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,400
What a happy Games.

149
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Yuanwhelg.

150
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,480
Your Highness.

151
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,840
Your Highness.

152
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,800
Your Highness.

153
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,240
I...

154
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,880
I really can't run.

155
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,120
Your Highness.

156
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,560
My crown prince.

157
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,080
What should we do?

158
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,520
You're

159
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
using a knife to

160
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,640
cut my neck.

161
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,360
I can't stand it.

162
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,920
You can't run?

163
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,880
Run.

164
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,360
Before I gave you my medicine,

165
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,480
why did you borrow

166
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
so many flowers and kill me?

167
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,920
Now our clans have got big

168
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,360
deep throat.

169
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,240
That's precisely what Master Yang told us.

170
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,080
I said that

171
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
to raise the emperor's spirit

172
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,200
and then to stop people from doing great things in the world.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,160
And to stop the world from doing great things in the world,

174
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm afraid that you will be a father.

175
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,400
Without a healthy body,

176
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,800
what kind of country

177
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,080
will you be in the school of the emperor?

178
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,360
Father, you're here.

179
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,360
Father.

180
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,800
I...

181
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,160
I want to have a meal with you.

182
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,800
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,920
Your Highness,

184
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,640
the crown princess is waiting for you to have a meal.

185
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,160
Are we going back?

186
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,520
He is the crown princess.

187
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
This chicken,

188
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,400

You destroy the family.

192
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,600
Remember to clap tears.

193
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Talking about,

194
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,360
Like the child,

195
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,040
he is still child.

196
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,200
Are you back?

197
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,560
I just arrived in the capital.

198
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,000
I've seen His Majesty.

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,920
That's good.

200
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,720
Father and the north are coming back.

201
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,320
I don't care.

202
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,560
But

203
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
the south and north of Zhili

204
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,840
are in the south of Shandong and Henan.

205
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
The water is very serious.

206
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,400
The people are suffering.

207
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,680
I'll inform the people

208
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,160
to stop the operation.

209
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560

surprise everyone

213
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,000
in three months.

214
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,640
If the Se Serpent Consort

215
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:11,840

216
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:22,160

I won't hurt you.

218
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,760
I won't blame you.

219
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,080
But if you insist,

220
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,960
the news in the Imperial Library

221
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,120
can't be spread to Qianqing Palace.

222
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,360
Why is father waiting for me?

223
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,720
Yes.

224
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,760
It's not a fire.

225
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,280
Your Highness.

226
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,040
The flowers are bright and clear.

227
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,000
The trees are dry.

228
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,680
Put it in a warm pot.

229
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Don't have any smell.

230
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,440
Your Highness.

231
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,040
The people at the mountain have left.

232
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,720
I know.

233
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
Now times are cold.

234
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,560
It's so hot.

235
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Yum.

236
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,280
Have a sip.

237
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,720
I'm pure scriptwriter.

238
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Sound is important.

239
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
The audience will recognize it.

240
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,080
I frequent

241
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480

As a yummy diversified foreign landbuffer,

245
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,360
no one should be like us.

246
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,220
Crown Prince,

247
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,920
last night Prince Han

248
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,340
wanted to give a word to His Majesty that

249
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,260
the已 dire harassment is not because we didn't do that.

250
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,720
We must relieve it

251
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,940
to avoid any causes.

252
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,120
Scum!

253
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,860

00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
I'm so grateful.

270
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
If you say that,

271
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
I'm so anxious.

272
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
I'll go find my father.

273
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Your Highness, you can't do that.

274
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Father, if you go now,

275
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
what if the emperor asks you

276
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,440
what you're eating at lunchtime?

277
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Who are you eating with?

278
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
What should you answer?

279
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Yes.

280
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Your Highness,

281
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
the emperor is very strict.

282
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
You should go there.

283
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
I'm afraid that the emperor will be angry

284
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
and the people will be angry.

285
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Are you talking about the fact?

286
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,440
I didn't mean to scare you.

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,440
You can't imagine the consequences.

288
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Is what he said so serious?

289
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Is it really so serious?

290
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
But the people are suffering.

291
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
I can't ignore it.

292
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
What?

293
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Is that so?

294
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
The emperor doesn't like to see me.

295
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
He doesn't want to listen to me.

296
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,440
Then why don't we find

297
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
someone who likes you

298
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
to persuade him?

299
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
What do you think?

300
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
I'm going to go to the palace.

301
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440

The superior bureau can't tell us.

00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Of course.

382
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300

383
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,300

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,300
His mother is a senior in the office.

396
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
My cooking is from the school.

397
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
She's the best cook.

398
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
I don't know anything.

399
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,300
I'm a master of the rules.

400
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Is there any?

401
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Someone will go to your service station to check on you.

402
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,300
Next.

He's from the Zhejiang Waterline.

406
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Who's she?

407
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
She seems to be not only a cook in Hangzhou.

408
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Your words.

409
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
When Su Dong broke into Hangzhou,

410
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
he was in a bad mood for a year.

411
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
He was in a bad mood.

412
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,300
He only knew how to live in low-key and pass the water well.

413
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
My ancestor,

414
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
the eldest son of Hangzhou,

415
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
sent the red-braised pork and bean paste soup.

416
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
The local team was full of light and fresh food.

417
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
They were soft and soft.

418
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
That's the bean paste soup.

419
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Later,

420
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
our family moved to the country.

421
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
We moved to the Ming City.

422
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
I followed my father all the time.

423
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
I went to Mingliu's mansion to eat vegetables.

424
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Lord You,

425
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I feel sorry for you.

426
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Please come and ask.

427
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
You come.

428
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,300
Yin Ziping,

429
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
he was 17 years old.

430
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
He was from Lisu City, Suzhou.

431
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
My grandfather was a monk.

432
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,300
He married into Zhongluo after he passed away.

433
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
What about you?

434
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Lord You,

435
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Zijin is the same age as me.

436
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
The taste of the food in the world

437
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
is not as good as his.

438
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
He is not as bad as Su Jia.

439
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
What's the point of being so long?

440
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Hurry up and make a team.

441
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,300
We will have dinner later.

442
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Lord You,

443
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,300
we have a lot of luck in the Ming and Huaxiang.

444
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
We have to go to the palace today.

445
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Let's go.

446
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Okay.

447
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
It really is a miracle.

448
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Lord, what are you suspicious of?

449
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,740
Her solder and attitude

450
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,860
is obviously

451
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,820
all because of her empress.

452
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,460
It's not a popular motto

453
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,340
as my mom's concern.

454
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,020
All she makes

455
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,900
it's neccessary.

456
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,380
As her roommate,

457
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,980
it is thanks to a qué become true to the entire country.

458
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,020
This...

459
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,980
In the einfep participar section

460
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,900
Can we get to Dong Poリo儿 really?

461
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,300
Go immediately to Su Zhou Mansion.

462
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,700
The introduction of hornets will bring…?

463
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,820
Who can send you to the palace

464
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,500
to get the news of it?

465
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:42,820
Yes, sir!

466
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,660
Are you at the optimal place?

467
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,140
Yes.

468
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:20,160
I'm at the optimal

469
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,600
outside.

470
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,660
How many of yourah poor lady!

471
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,660
臭 woman!

472
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,180
Your Highness never sounded ill.

473
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm Earned the cold these days.

474
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,480
If he didn't exist,

475
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,320
Yes.

476
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,560
Sit already.

477
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,900
Are you still not going to the tea cup?

478
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,860
Yes.

479
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,460
Send to the imperial physician.

480
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,980
I want him to do a doctorate.

481
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,300
Yes.

482
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,960
Don't worry, Your Highness.

483
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,940
Grand Lord Mu operators have strict rules here.

484
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,220
Otherwise, he would be worried out of the ordinary.

485
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,140
Our 보호 Royal Department

486
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,760
I only operate Coffee time and daily.

487
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,320
But Jinshu hasumn at siu like that.

488
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,860
We should invite Si out.

489
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,500
Please.

490
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,080
Yes.

491
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,900
Your Highness, you've forgotten.

492
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,480
My grandfather was a prince who looked so handsome to us.

493
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,040
When we were young, my body was election trail of weakness.

494
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,740
So I wanted to learn some trick and strategy.

495
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,320
This is wrong about me.

496
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,120
Si can treat me well or not.

497
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,300
Trust me.

498
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,200
Okay.

499
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Everything is up to you.

500
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,120
But if the illness is serious,

501
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,040
you can't force it.

502
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,360
Just do it now.

503
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,960
Thank you for your concern.

504
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,680
It's a bit early.

505
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,080
It's still warm.

506
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,560
Your Highness.

507
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,960
I used it.

508
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,880
If you want to use it,

509
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,880
take the blinds back.

510
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,080
Yu'an.

511
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,840
Do you remember

512
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,320
when you first entered the palace,

513
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,480
I asked you to marry Yu'an.

514
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
What was the meaning of it?

515
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,960
When my grandfather went to the battlefield,

516
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,800
my grandmother kept her hand in the north and the north.

517
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,480
She took you under her.

518
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,680
My grandmother personally went to the capital to fight.

519
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,440
She protected the back of my grandfather.

520
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,400
In that battle,

521
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,920
my grandfather tried his best

522
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,520
to defeat the king of the country.

523
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,160
Then she said,

524
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
when she was in the capital,

525
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,640
she thought of what my grandmother said.

526
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,360
No matter what,

527
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,840
she wanted to return.

528
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,800
Later, my grandfather became the emperor

529
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,600
and used the world as a beauty.

530
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,440
But she was angry.

531
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,560
The imperial court didn't have anyone to support her.

532
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,880
Only my grandmother could do that.

533
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,640
The so-called married couple

534
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,600
was a man who died in the middle of the world

535
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,880
and worked hard for the rest of his life.

536
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,360
Yu'an.

537
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,760
I'm willing to be with you for a lifetime.

538
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,560
I don't know what your heart is.

539
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,400
But I want to ask,

540
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,800
are you willing to be with me for the rest of your life?

541
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,680
Your Highness.

542
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,760
I...

543
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,760
Take care of your illness.

544
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,320
I'm leaving.

545
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,640
Your Highness.

546
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,680
You're leaving first?

547
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,600
Yes.

548
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,320
Your Highness.

549
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,960
Your Highness.

550
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,280
and a magic drink.

551
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,840
Was it the same to implementation of the legal plan I sent

552
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,120
to get the moving parties delivered?

553
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,380
你有 —

554
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,680
I didn't do anything to protect Coасти in your land.

555
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,920
I will clean up my lands,

556
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,840
and then talk to you now.

557
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,960
So...

558
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,400
I will just,

559
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,040
submit my wish to Imperial 18,

560
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,000
Still drink such care.

561
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,200
Put it back in theretched pot or

562
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,400
the corpse will be ?]

563
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,680
vaping off.

564
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,240
As for this sacred liquor,

565
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,680
glutinous rice 받아 weak.

566
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,120
They help cool down the wounds.

567
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,400
THE vinegar is also a perfume to kill monsters.

568
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,480
The塔首 has said that

569
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,240
it's the best for you.

570
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,840
Your Highness let me try it.

00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,780
There's love again.

573
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,460

Grandpa Huang.

579
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,040
What are you laughing at?

580
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,720
Hello, Your Majesty.

581
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,320
You didn't use her at all.

582
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,280
Well, you've survived

583
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,800
and went to worship with Her Majesty at the school.

584
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,560
You're well aware of that.

585
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
What's your name?

586
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,960
As a unit official of the country,

587
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,160
a father of four,

588
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,600
how about admiring ten clothes every day?

589
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,840
It makes you feel a little like一些女人

590
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,120
in her whole life.

591
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,800
Fine.

00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,360

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,520
It fits your outfit.

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,480
I'm on a trip

595
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,680
to show you the dress of officials.

596
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,880
If the officials know

597
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,840
the King of Asian War

598
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,320
deserves such a raise.

599
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,160
As an official,

600
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,760
I should take care of them.

601
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,080
Well,

602
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,200

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,700

604
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,420
How is it?

605
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:11,840
Father.

606
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,760

That's great,

611
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,540
that's nice.

612
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,560
You have to record a scene

613
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,320
on the rental spot

614
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:26,840
while you wait to make it official.

615
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,740

The world 64.

620
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,840
These total clashes

621
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,980
do not thank us.

622
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,040
I mean,

623
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,060

624
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:43,860

00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,640
I versed気 Spogna?

626
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,000
But they only gave me

627
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,280
a short look.

628
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,020
They also made me

629
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,840
long waited,

630
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,360
thinking of this for me.

631
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,200
Even I thought of it,

632
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,820
Five hundred and fifty percent.

633
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,380

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,840

last

639
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,880
three square miles

640
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,660
You all think

641
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,200
Customers

642
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,280

643
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,840
Wait until you get some rest.

644
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,840
What's wrong?

645
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:33,900
What's wrong?

646
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:34,580
I'm all right.

647
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,340
Come here.

648
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:35,680
Lord Guangyuan.

00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:36,820

650
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,540
But theetter he comes back,

651
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,020
Why not go abroad?

652
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,300
If I refuse to go back,

653
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,420
the 맛 of the palace will be faguous.

654
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,280
I took his life back.

655
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,080
He did everything for me,

656
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,920
and helped me deal with it.

657
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,880
But,

658
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,560
such a big thing,

659
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,080
can it still make the people laugh?

660
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,320
Get up.

661
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,120
Well,

662
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,640
I'll take my leave.

663
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,760
Grandpa, please use it.

664
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,280
Get up.

665
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,920
Go and appearance always.

666
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,600
What are you laughing on?

667
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,760
It's His Majesty's body.

668
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,240
Your Majesty.

669
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,360
Please keep it.

670
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,200
I'll give it to you.

671
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:56,920
Yes.

672
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,480
It's really poison.

673
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,720
Please take this medicine.

674
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,160
Your Highness.

675
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,040
I'm not sure

676
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
what poison you've used.

677
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,560
However,

678
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,320
a poison pilgrim

679
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,560
would be a real threat

680
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,040
if peopleadas find it.

681
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
Thank you.

682
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
You're a generous 어떤 who porax togra.

00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,800

00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,960
as soon as he's felt having warp.

685
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,960
Now that you take medicine,

686
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,800
no wäre.

687
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,200
I'll

688
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,840
ask you a question.

689
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,040
Are you an expert

690
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,880
in the du致花 valley

691
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,080
and you have ancient places?

692
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,000
Your Highness,

693
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,840
I'll go to the Imperial Court now

694
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,160
and get the person who poisoned him.

695
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,000
Stop.

696
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,560
Your Highness,

697
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,480
it must be the little maid of the Imperial Court.

698
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,560
I'll get her back

699
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,800
and ask the Imperial Guards

700
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,880
to interrogate her.

701
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,680
Don't worry.

702
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,440
Shut up.

703
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,800
Imperial Physician Shen,

704
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,920
if Grandpa Huang asks about this,

705
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,040
you'll say that the horse was bitten by a horse

706
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
and he came to get you.

707
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,600
Don't worry, Your Highness.

708
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,840
I understand.

709
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,160
Your Highness,

710
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,360
that little maid

711
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,200
is a treasured person.

712
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,120
She can't be tolerated.

713
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,840
Ask Chen Wu to give her the sera.

714
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,120
Yes.

715
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,000
A tiny attention-b Però.

716
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,000
The scratch is still in the tube?

717
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,480
Yep.

718
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,680
They've found out.

719
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,640
A person mentioned about the missing horse

720
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,200
came here because he want to survey the lethargue

721
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,680
in the same way as your Majesty.

722
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,720
Overestimant the traces!

723
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,880
Delicious?

724
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,080
They are smelly!

725
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,720
Sir.

726
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,360
That family was under construction hace.

727
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,300
They failed to作

728
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,560
moves in their majority period.

729
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,100
No wonder she unbiased the people!

730
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,560
Weren't they

731
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,400
the people's relatives and now the Angleries?

732
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,400
The Heaven's Mountain loaded a morstle

733
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,020
by Mediator House.

734
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,240
He was upset.

735
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,360
My family arrived in the village

736
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,520
and bought a morsel.

737
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,420
They would conduct an rounds of military service

738
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
to make it atем Dong's hotspot.

739
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,200
Don't claim that.

740
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,880
Atmosphere was induced by his work.

741
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,100
Their corneas

742
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,780
were guarded and acknowledged by on the family's girth.

743
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,340
and beat the enemies of the world?

744
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,420
What are you talking about?

745
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,340
Who said that?

746
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,220
Go on.

747
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,260
That little boy of theirs

748
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,300
is so naughty.

749
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,420
He ran away

750
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,060
by accident.

751
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,980
The news spread out early on.

752
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,100
The magistrate was in a hurry.

753
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,540
He could spare them.

754
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,140
The next morning,

755
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,060
I went to see him.

756
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,980
It was a disaster.

757
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,940
The woman was shot by a man.

758
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,100
Even that little boy

759
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,260
went with her.

760
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,100
There was a woman in this family?

761
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,020
Yes.

762
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,340
That girl was seven or eight years old.

763
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,660
I don't know how she...

764
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,300
She ran away.

765
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,340
When she was in a hurry,

766
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,780
she kneeled in front of her parents.

767
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,220
She cried so hard that no one could bear to leave her.

768
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,700
Then, she was taken away by someone.

769
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,740
Keep talking.

770
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Who did she go with?

771
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,740
Who else could she go with?

772
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,140
Where could she go?

773
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,380
Some of them

774
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,460
were taken away by the fishers.

775
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,580
They were taken away by the boat.

776
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,580
But

777
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,420
that little girl was lucky.

778
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,540
She was 7 or 8 years old.

779
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,860
She took the female body

780
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,740
immediately.

781
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,820
Then, she left immediately.

782
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,900
She'll be a lonely horse soon.

783
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,500
It must be an opportunity.

784
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,100
All跳cendants

785
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,420
and all

786
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,420
have no one to Ku어서

787
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,060
may be allies.

788
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,340
What are you guys about to say?

789
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,240
Jin Yiwei said

790
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,620
Suozhou people will pay for this visit.

791
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,080
What I like about her is

792
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
that her smile

793
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,720
He does look like him.

794
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,120
Sir,

795
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
do you really want to reward him?

796
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,320
Su Zhoufu has two servants in the palace.

797
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,320
You said both of them look alike.

798
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,760
Which one is it?

799
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,920
These 17 or 18-year-olds

800
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,240
all look like flowers.

801
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,840
If you let me see the real one,

802
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,160
I will recognize it.

803
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,400
Sir,

804
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
I have a test paper of Yao Zijin's inner school.

805
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,920
I also interrogated the teacher for the lesson.

806
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,200
He said that he was a good student,

807
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,880
and he didn't care about the money.

808
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,720
He was very careful when he was taught.

809
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,440
That's right.

810
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,920
Sir,

811
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,600
the image will be lost.

812
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,440
But the other witness will bring it.

813
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,760
Take him.

814
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,440
Yes.

815
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,920
It still hurts.

816
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,280
Hurry up.

817
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,040
Go take a rest.

818
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,000
Turn around.

819
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,320
Let me rub it for you.

820
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,840
Is it done?

821
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,040
Yes.

822
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,840
It's done.

823
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Let me pour you some water.

824
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,080
You see,

825
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,040
you are not feeling well.

826
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,720
You still need to get up.

827
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,200
Is the top-ranking person

828
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,440
really that important to you?

829
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,520
It's important.

830
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,200
It's very important.

831
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,160
Don't touch it.

832
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,760
How is he?

833
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,440
I treated you well.

834
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,240
Because of that,

835
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,600
You want to kill me?

836
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,440
Why are you so nice to me?

837
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
If you want to blame me, blame yourself!

838
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,440
You shouldn't be so kind and stupid!

839
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Kindness can't be without bottom line.

840
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,440
And can't be changed by the tiger.

841
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:23,440
You can't be a fool to treat a person who really loves you as a fool.

842
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,440
I beg you.

843
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,440
Don't.

844
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Don't.

845
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Don't.

846
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
Don't.

847
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
I want to see you.

848
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Look carefully. Is it her?

849
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,440
It's the same.

850
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
It's been more than ten years.

851
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,440
It's the same.

852
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,440
It's been more than ten years.

853
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,440
I can recognize it.

854
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,440
It seems like it.

855
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,440
I haven't seen it for more than ten years.

856
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,440
I can recognize it.

857
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,440
It seems like the charm of the reward is really big.

858
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Lord You, look at this.

859
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,440
Lord, I'm coming.

860
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
Bring it here.

861
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Lord, it's the same.

862
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,440
You can see clearly.

863
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,440
The girl who escaped from your house was it her?

864
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,440
Lord, I see three things.

865
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,320
You should look carefully.

866
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:11,840
My Lord.

867
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,720
That girl came to my house at the age of eight.

868
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,960
I taught her how to play the piano and sing.

869
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,880
But she was born with a strange temper.

870
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,360
She didn't know how to play the piano.

871
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,840
I spent money on buying her a new one.

872
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,760
I taught her how to do some chores.

873
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,920
But she escaped the moment she lost her mind.

874
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,560
I couldn't find the way out.

875
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,160
It's not hard to find the way out.

876
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,200
I'm afraid, my lady.

877
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,560
Please forgive me.

878
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,440
I'm waiting for you.

879
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
I'm waiting for you.

880
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,440
I'm waiting for you.

881
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,440
I'm waiting for you.

882
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
I'm waiting for you.

883
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,440
I'm waiting for you.

884
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,440
I'm waiting for you.

885
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,440
I'm waiting for you.

886
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,440
I'm waiting for you.

887
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,440
I'm waiting for you.

888
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,440
I'm waiting for you.

889
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,440

I'm waiting for you.

893
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,440
I'm waiting for you.

894
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,440
I'm waiting for you.

895
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,440
I'm waiting for you.

896
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,440
I'm waiting for you.

897
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
I'm waiting for you.

898
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,440
I'm waiting for you.

899
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,440
I'm waiting for you.

900
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
I'm waiting for you.

901
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
I'm waiting for you.

902
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,440
I'm waiting for you.

903
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,440
I'm waiting for you.

904
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,440
I'm waiting for you.

905
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
I'm waiting for you.

906
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,440
I'm waiting for you.

907
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,440
I'm waiting for you.

908
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,440
