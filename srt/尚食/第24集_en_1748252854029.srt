1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh yeah yes yeah yeah

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,940
denome

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's also a matter of self-sufficiency.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,800
If you really don't care about it,

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,400
why did you send the medicine?

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Who sent the medicine?

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
I've never been here before.

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
I've never sent any medicine.

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
If you keep talking nonsense, I'll be your witness.

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Episode 1

29
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,600
Your Highness, the perpetrator is a dead man who has been training hard.

30
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,400
He only left two alive.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,600
The patient is badly injured. There is only one left.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,800
The doctor is taking care of him.

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,200
As for the records of the attack on the day of the last day,

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
hundreds of classes, 500 million people,

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Ministry of Public Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs,

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,200
all of the soldiers,

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
totaled 643 people.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
The staff are registered on the side.

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,800
The tea is still in the room for 10 days.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
What do you think?

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,800
Your Highness, the real murderer is a dead man who has been trained hard.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
If His Majesty and Crown Prince

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
I dare to say one thing.

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I can't get rid of the two princes.

45
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
Enough.

46
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't always bring these things up to make you sick.

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Your Highness, the lunch is here.

48
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Where is he?

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
He is still outside.

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Your Highness, the hat.

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Minister Mei, the last time that happened,

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,400
I was so anxious to find a chance to apologize to you.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Did you personally make the meal for me?

54
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
I see.

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,200
The meal was made by mistake.

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I can't afford to save it.

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I hope you can forgive me.

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
These are enough.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Your Highness, you are not going to put more food in the soup.

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,400
If you don't put too much food in it, it will be too much.

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Minister Yao, how do you know that you are not sleeping well?

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,400
The lunch I sent over, you didn't finish it.

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
You only finished the soup of the He Zao Ren.

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
You are now doing it for the sake of peace and prosperity.

65
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Your Highness.

66
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Your Highness, you don't need to worry about the court affairs.

67
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
You should just rest and recuperate.

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Your Highness, I dare not to reveal these things.

69
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Minister Mei, please listen to me.

70
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
I just entered the door and I could smell a bloodstain.

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Your Highness, you are so pale.

72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Your voice is also much better than before.

73
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
You should not be so loud.

74
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Yes.

75
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
It seems that I can't go to visit my mother today.

76
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
So as not to be disappointed.

77
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
I feel good today.

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Come.

79
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Your Highness, do you have any dirty things on your face?

80
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,400
You are just like me. I will definitely misunderstand.

81
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Either I am a very strict and arrogant person today.

82
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Your Highness, you are finally smiling.

83
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
You always smile when you enter the door.

84
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Since you entered the door, you have not said anything.

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I thought that you were guilty.

86
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Young Master, are you married?

87
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Minister Mei.

88
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Let's go.

89
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Minister Mei.

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Let's go.

91
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Your Highness.

92
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
The imperial physician has already said that

93
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
he will not let you get up.

94
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
But you can't listen to him.

95
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
This is good.

96
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
The wound is open again.

97
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
In order not to make the Empress worry about the wound,

98
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
you even let others become the hero of the old family.

99
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
What's going on?

100
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,400
But where are those people who are so arrogant?

101
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Go and bring my books over.

102
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Your Highness.

103
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Your Highness, the imperial physician has come to deliver the snacks.

104
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
He asked for your instructions and brought them in.

105
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
When did I tell you?

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Let him in.

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Yes.

108
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Greetings to Your Highness, Your Highness.

109
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Your Highness, the lunch is almost ready.

110
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
I have some snacks for you in the dream.

111
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Your Highness.

112
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Your Highness.

113
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
The wait coming.

114
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Your Highness.

115
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Your Highness.

116
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Your Highness.

117
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
What is the news on this morning?

118
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
The things that are happening now.

119
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
I just want to inform you that

120
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,400
the army that sent me theダ både statusQu is very very special,

121
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
which is always involved in this situation.

122
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
So nice of you.

123
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
You will get scared otherwise.

124
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
I will protect you even if you leave before tomorrow.

125
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
OK.

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Or maybe it's ok.

127
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
I told you not to be too polite.

128
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
You're injured.

129
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

130
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,640
No.

131
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
I want to thank you.

132
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,320
I'm a servant of the Imperial Court.

133
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,040
I dare not take the crown prince's life as a thank you.

134
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,320
You've protected His Majesty for me.

135
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,240
You've taken the responsibility as a son.

136
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,680
You should thank me.

137
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,680
But...

138
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,400
I'm just a servant of the Imperial Court.

139
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
I've been punished.

140
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,960
I hope you'll forgive me.

141
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,960
If you're so kind,

142
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm not here to see you.

143
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm here to kill you.

144
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,640
I'll reframe this role.

145
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,720
Chu.

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
His Lordship.

147
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,320
Did His Majesty agree

148
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,680
that Your Highness would usesta confirm

149
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:08,380
and punish the gap of struggle for

150
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,120
ausa gene

151
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:12,960
?

152
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,960
The whole house

153
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm a father.

154
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,320
I can't bear to see you anymore.

155
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
But I came out to visit you

156
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,520
to see you.

157
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,200
Really?

158
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,920
Of course.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,760
Lord Liu.

160
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,720
Your Highness.

161
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,240
Forget it.

162
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,640
I'll talk to you later.

163
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,960
I'll see you off.

164
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,200
Why is Eunuch Liu here?

165
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,760
Lord Liu,

166
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,840
answer the call.

167
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Greetings to!

168
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,340
Your Majesty 어 throne Master you

169
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,580
are a mess.

170
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:11,860
Lord He,

171
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,700
I dare to make my announcement.

172
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
I'm afraid that you will be hurt.

173
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
I can't help you.

174
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Fengzhe, you go first.

175
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Congratulations to you, Lord You.

176
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,700
You got the blessing.

177
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
You won the gold medal.

178
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
I heard that even the crown prince is here to visit.

179
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
The emperor of the Crown Prince

180
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
has given a single iron fist to the palace court.

181
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Even if you are so evil, you will be punished.

182
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,700
But the emperor's reputation is well-known today.

183
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,700
Lord You's blood will not be left.

184
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Really?

185
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,700
I'm just kidding.

186
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Why are you angry?

187
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,700
The gold medal is kept by the emperor.

188
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,700
I forgot your promise.

189
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Don't worry.

190
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
It's not poison.

191
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
Go.

192
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
What's wrong?

193
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Don't move.

194
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,700
Don't do anything.

195
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
You are young and ignorant.

196
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
I always hope that I can meet

197
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
someone who can hurt me.

198
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
But I didn't expect that.

199
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Today,

200
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
I will take the blame for the accident.

201
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
I will be more lucky than you.

202
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
I will wait for you.

203
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Young master.

204
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
Young master, wake up.

205
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
There is a criminal woman in the palace.

206
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
She is the one who killed the emperor.

207
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Who is the criminal?

208
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Who is the criminal?

209
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Who is the criminal?

210
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
She is the criminal.

211
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Who is the criminal?

212
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
She is the criminal.

213
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,180
I've been dealing with a criminal.

214
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,900
As for what crime she committed,

215
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,540
why is she there?

216
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,980
How long will it take?

217
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,620
No one knows.

218
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,260
I'm curious

219
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,460
how someone would be involved in this.

220
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,140
And why she's so fond of it.

221
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,740
So I'm a little bit surprised.

222
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,540
I want to see

223
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,740
what kind of person she is.

224
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,340
I'm so happy to see you.

225
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,740
When I found out

226
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,180
there was such a fool in the world,

227
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,820
I thought

228
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,180
no matter what crime she committed,

229
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,420
I'd let her go.

230
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,360
What happened was losing

231
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:32,080
the murder of Zongz

232
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,220
I didn't believe you could believe me.

233
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
No.

234
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,980
It is beside the table.

235
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,420
Let's have lunch first.

236
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Lord Mei.

237
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Please.

238
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,220
Lord Mei.

239
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
Lord Mei.

240
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,580
Your Highness, I'm sorry to have made you wait.

241
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,660
I thought it was a joke.

242
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,460
I didn't expect you to be so considerate.

243
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
I'm the one who's prepared the food.

244
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,900
I'm not afraid of the food.

245
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Your Highness.

246
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,980
Is the news of the Grand Preceptor?

247
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,220
Your Highness.

248
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,820
Your Highness, then.

249
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,900
Your Highness.

250
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,620
You have dropping orders to send edict for Lord Mei.

251
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
He insidiously won't say a word.

252
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
Lord Mei.

253
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,820
I saw the news,

254
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,820
that one person was lovesick.

255
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,180
She wasn't coming back.

256
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,060
That person was!

257
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,140
I'm afraid.

258
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,220
It's really nothing.

259
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,340
not full.

260
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,900
Not when you pass them on secretly.

261
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,340
With fully mobilized content.

262
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,460
This dish is like nothing.

263
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,660
Lord Mei.

264
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,620
This is a squeezed lotus,

265
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,780
use jade salt,

266
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,060

267
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,820
and sealed.

268
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,020
Tilting up the Tina and~!

269
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,560
Ah.

270
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,060
Jesus?

271
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,860
에게 Alt turnerاء

272
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,020
I'm starving.

273
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,380
It's you.

274
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,180
What are you writing down?

275
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,700
What do you want to write about

276
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,220
intestine donation

277
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,340
sent by Eitherh Level?

278
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,260
The days ofaber

279
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,180
I should make 뚝兰

280
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,420
a large stream of blood.

281
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,100
During the whole days

282
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,340
Song Dynasty

283
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,580
has Jordanais

284
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,140
Let's go out.

285
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,140
Yes.

286
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Why are you standing there?

287
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,900
Go outside.

288
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,260
Put some on.

289
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:57,940
Take it out.

290
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,820
Slow down.

291
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,620
What dish is this?

292
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,380
This one.

293
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,580
This is the braised pork.

294
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,060
The braised pork can smell the meat of crab meat.

295
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,580
You have to talk to me.

296
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,100
Your Highness.

297
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,580
Have some hot tea.

298
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
Have some.

299
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
Lord Mei.

300
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,420
You must not make His Highness drink.

301
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
What?

302
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,580
Are you angry?

303
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,780
It's all my fault.

304
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,700
I was too hasty when I made the same dish.

305
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
By the way,

306
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,580
I heard that you are good at cooking.

307
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,180
I have something to tell you.

308
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,380
Lord Mei, you are serious.

309
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,660
Just tell me.

310
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
I...

311
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Your Highness.

312
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,740
His Highness has been ill recently.

313
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,540
How can he be in a daze?

314
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,500
Your Highness, let's hide in there.

315
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,940
Your Highness.

316
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,460
You are a good cook.

317
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,420
I think you are not well.

318
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
Lord Mei.

319
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,260
You are in a daze.

320
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,940
I remember there is something urgent.

321
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,340
Please tell His Highness that I am guilty.

322
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,340
I am leaving.

323
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,420
Lord Mei,

324
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,460
you are still not finished.

325
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,460
Come again tomorrow.

326
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,500
What are you doing?

327
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
Go inside.

328
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
Mount Fang.

329
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,860
Lord Mei, please wait.

330
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,660
Be careful.

331
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,460
Don't run.

332
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Catch him.

333
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
What are you doing?

334
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,940
Give it to him.

335
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,340
I heard that you are in the palace.

336
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,340
I have been carrying the money bag with me.

337
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,820
This is the palace that the Ninth House should give you.

338
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,340
You are too young to do that.

339
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,820
I am afraid that you will be useless and have a bad luck.

340
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,340
I have been helping you.

341
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,340
I am sorry.

342
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
I am sorry.

343
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
I am sorry.

344
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
I am sorry.

345
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
I am sorry.

346
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
I am sorry.

347
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I am sorry.

348
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
I am sorry.

349
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,740
I have been standing for you.

350
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,740
Now, you are safe.

351
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
I am leaving.

352
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,540
Your Highness, please have a meal.

353
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,340
He is still ugly.

354
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,740
In this state,

355
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,420
Prince Philos balloon

356
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,500
still loves me very much.

357
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,540
Give me a break.

358
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
Goodbye.

359
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
Goodbye.

360
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,140
I've never felt too much of it.

361
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,460
Yes, I forgot.

362
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
He's kind.

363
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,300
When you want to listen to the piano,

364
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,700
someone will play it for you.

365
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,860
Take him out.

366
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,260
Yes.

367
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,140
Deniu

368
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,740
S 만들is

369
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,240
Eunuch Chen.

370
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,580
What was His Highness going to help you with?

371
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,300
Lady Yao,

372
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,860
I don't want to esper a mom over you.

373
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,260
So I'd like to ask you

374
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,780
if you like the piano.

375
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,180
Xiaolian,

376
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,600
why are you still here?

377
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,100
That's brilliant.

378
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,360
How is it that your love for him keeps us under circulation?

379
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,320
So much love forott.

380
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,820
It belongs to me.

381
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,360
Your princess.

382
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,200
I氣 you.

383
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,240
Is she hurt?

384
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,960
Not at all.

385
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,400
How did she hurt?

386
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,420
Did I hurt your heart?

387
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,400
What did I do?

388
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,840
I've been on your side since childhood.

389
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,560
I'm sorry.

390
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,560
It's not my words.

391
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,080
You'd better change.

392
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,880
Your Highness, I've asked you

393
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,440
to send you back personally.

394
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,240
Please.

395
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,560
Eunuch Cheng,

396
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,120
what did I do?

397
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:24,880
Please.

398
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,760
From now,

399
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,200
I prefer to be respected

400
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,640
than be почsted by others.

401
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,120
As for me...

402
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,600
I won't stand for it.

403
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,720
Stop it.

404
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,440
Let me hug the standards.

405
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,840
Don't try to do it.

406
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,600
I feel lucky

407
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,600
because I won.

408
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,400
What is this?

409
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,080
Every day is an violate.

410
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,880
Imperial Physician Sheng will be in your care.

411
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,040
She will value the oppression.

412
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,880
I listened to my Queen Mother.

413
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,440
I'll go now.

414
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,920
I failed repair it as soon as time ago, but I've improved.

415
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,420
Give me back a hand!

416
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,300
Let's find a new buy...

417
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:00,320
So you're not先 cutting or cutting?

418
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,700
What are you talking about?

419
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,700
I will make a name for myself.

420
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:14,700
I will be the eldest son of the Ming dynasty.

421
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
You.

422
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
This word is used in the purple tree.

423
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
But it's not correct.

424
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
Please.

425
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Give it to me.

426
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I don't know how to draw.

427
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
But this painting is so detailed.

428
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
It can see the depth of the other person's love.

429
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Who can be touched?

430
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
I'm not touched.

431
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,700
You are a good iron master.

432
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,700
If it's me,

433
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,700
I will leave some red and green gems.

434
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,700
The mother and the cat.

435
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,700
So I won't leave any old stones.

436
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
What is this?

437
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
Ying Ziping.

438
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,700
This wallet is for men.

439
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
Whose is this?

440
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Zijin, give it back to me.

441
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Tell me.

442
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
Give it back to me first.

443
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
Who is this man?

444
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Give it back to me first.

445
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Tell me.

446
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,700
Give it back to you first.

447
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,700
Give it back to me first.

448
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
I will tell you.

449
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,700
Give it back to me.

450
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
Whose is this?

451
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
Give it back to me.

452
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Zijin.

453
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
Give it back to me.

454
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Okay, okay.

455
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,700
I will give it back to you.

456
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Whose is this?

457
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
Give it back to me first.

458
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,700
Okay, okay.

459
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Give it to you.

460
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Be gentle.

461
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,700
Give me your hand.

462
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,700
You are dead.

463
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,700
Then go home.

464
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,480
When they arrived,

465
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,120
they had come all the way here quickly.

466
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,460
But that man's figure was ill-fated.

467
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,160
Do you still remember it?

468
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,420
Earlier, when I was eight,

469
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:44,300
my grandfather personally took the lead for the bleed

470
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,980
into battle against 505.

471
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,640
So he was one of the還 Bangs.

472
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,560
Yet His Majesty believed so stern.

473
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,780
The same people had work with someone else and

474
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,780
had no right to exert their efforts,

475
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,100
saying evils in the pain of death.

476
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,340
Yes.

477
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,760
No problem.

478
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,520
Thank you.

479
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,460
Very nice.

480
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,700
Please have a meal.

481
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,120
after the news returned,

482
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,120
I'm sure.

483
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,840
Run as Ifsu förow Consensus.

484
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,780
Around two finalement Dou dánkaları

485
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,520
sent the policemen from

486
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,200
Red've poison

487
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,440
who are heavily injured.

488
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,100
Let's start first.

489
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,860
He is also a good man.

490
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,680
Qin Daduo also

491
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,400
wants to neden

492
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,380
control the вопросы of

493
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,900
to send her out.

494
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,860
Mقتian and Xinyan

495
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,340
brought her to Yufeng.

496
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,060
She must have different Zhou pourquoi.

497
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,540
She poetically wants the world the same

498
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,780
as the country.

499
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,020
Especially to the family.

500
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,660
It will go in vain.

501
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,340
You won't get used to it.

502
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,940
By the way,

503
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,660
I forget that

504
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,300
you are so good.

505
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,980
Why would she say you?

506
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,380
Your Highness,

507
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,380
what do you mean?

508
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
Aren't you leaving the palace?

509
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,380
You want to let me go?

510
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,380
But, Your Highness...

511
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,380
I have my own way.

512
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,380
It has nothing to do with others.

513
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,380
You didn't frame me.

514
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,380
But why?

515
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,380
I haven't seen you smile so happily for a long time.

516
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,380
At least, she can make you smile.

517
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,380
In the future,

518
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,380
you'll be rich and rich.

519
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
You'll be happy.

520
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,380
I wonder if you'll remember

521
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,380
this book.

522
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
Or will you remember me?

523
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,380
Who is the person

524
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,380
you're talking about?

525
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,380
Let's go.

526
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
Or I'll regret it.

527
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,380
You want to marry me out of the palace.

528
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,380
Even if you're a good person,

529
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,380
you're not my sweetheart.

530
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,380
Who is your sweetheart?

531
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,380
It's not true.

532
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
Your Highness,

533
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,380
the stone-cutting knife

534
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
is made of

535
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,380
the skin of the sword

536
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,380
and the skin of the fat.

537
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
The person who died

538
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
after the blood was cut

539
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
was the best.

540
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,380
I'm not a good person.

541
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
I'm the best.

542
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,380
I know you've been

543
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
in a bad mood recently.

544
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
You can use it.

545
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,380
It's good for your wound.

546
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,380
You still say you don't care about me?

547
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,380
Your Highness, you misunderstood.

548
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
It's the imperial physician's prescription.

549
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,380
We're just

550
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,380
taking care of the wound.

551
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,380
Your Highness, the imperial physician knows

552
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,380
that your wound is not healed.

553
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,380
He's already taken the medicine.

554
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,380
The effect is the best.

555
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,380
He's the one who sent the medicine today.

556
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,380
This medicine

557
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,380
is so old-fashioned.

558
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380
I told you to prepare the medicine.

559
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
But you asked me to give it to you again.

560
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,380
I'll take my leave.

561
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,380
Li.

562
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
You can leave.

563
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,380
Yes, Your Highness.

564
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
You don't want to say

565
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,380
I won't force you.

566
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
Anyway,

567
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,380
I can't resist you for a few days.

568
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
I'm going to go to Nanjing soon.

569
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,380
Your Highness.

570
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,380
Don't be too hard on me.

571
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,380
Don't be too hard on me.

572
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,380
This is my father's name.

573
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,380
It's the crown prince's fault.

574
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,380
It's obviously my father's intention to do this.

575
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,380
Why is it my fault?

576
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,380
You're in a good mood.

577
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
You should let go of the past

578
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
and show your sincerity to His Majesty.

579
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,380
You think I've never tried it?

580
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,380
But every time,

581
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,380
my father has rejected me for money and gifts.

582
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,380
Maybe

583
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,380
you've used the wrong method.

584
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,380
You did a good job.

585
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,380
Fang Nian Shan.

586
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
Can I go to Song's today with you?

587
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Yes.

588
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,380
You're so good at this.

589
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
A little bit of a good-looking man

590
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
would like to live in Qianqing Palace.

591
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Why don't you leave?

592
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,380
Su Su Shan.

593
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
I'm in a bad mood today.

594
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,380
I can't go to Qianqing Palace to deliver food.

595
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,380
I just want to help Fang Nian Shan.

596
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,380
It's time for delivery.

597
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,380
Here you are.

598
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,380
Your Majesty.

599
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,380
The dessert is from Nansong Lin'an City.

600
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,380
It's made of ginseng and sugar.

601
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,380
People often call it abalone.

602
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,380
So the dessert is called abalone.

603
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,380
It's really good.

604
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
It's so good.

605
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,380
It's really good.

606
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,380
I'm a chef of the dried quail eggs

607
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,380
in Huoshan.

608
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,380
It's refreshing and appetizing.

609
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Of course I know.

610
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
It's the flavor of the hometown.

611
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
The name of Nanjing Restaurant is

612
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
Ju Hua Nao.

613
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,380
It's used as a soup.

614
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,380
You've been

615
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,380
doing a lot of business lately.

616
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,380
You're so good.

617
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,380
Last time, I was reckless.

618
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,380
Please forgive me.

619
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,380
Father.

620
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,380
Your Majesty, be careful.

621
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,380
It's all my fault.

622
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,380
I won't blame you.

623
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,380
It's okay.

624
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Please forgive me.

625
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,380
I'm grateful.

626
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,380
I heard the doctor say

627
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,380
that you were injured from the hospital.

628
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,380
His Majesty was shocked.

629
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,380
He was dizzy all the time.

630
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,380
That's why he thought

631
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,380
that the dried quail eggs

632
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,380
could cause dizzy and headache.

633
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,380
That's why he was afraid of the doctor.

634
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,380
Did he scare you?

635
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,380
I was really scared.

636
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,380
I was hiding in the corner

637
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,380
and was shaking.

638
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,380
Then I saw Noble Consort

639
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,380
was also by her side.

640
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,380
That's why I gave her a breath.

641
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,380
Hurry up and save her.

642
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
Save her.

643
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,380
Go.

644
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,380
Your Majesty.

645
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,380
Your Majesty.

646
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,380
Your Majesty.

647
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,380
Noble Consort Guo wants to see you.

648
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,380
I'm not seeing you.

649
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,380
Yes.

650
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,380
It's time to go to the court.

651
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,380
Send the dinner there.

652
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,380
Send it there.

653
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,380
Yes.

654
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,380
Your Majesty.

655
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,380
You're going to the south capital, aren't you?

656
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,380
Why haven't you got ready?

657
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,380
I've prepared the dinner.

658
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,380
Let's have dinner together.

659
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,380
No need.

660
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,380
Your Majesty.

661
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,380
Your Majesty.

662
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,380
Who is it?

663
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,380
Crying and laughing for a lifetime.

664
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,380
I'm lost.

665
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,380
I'm looking forward to

666
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,380
the beautiful things in the legend.

667
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,380
The light in the dark night is like the moon.

668
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,380
The light in the night is like the moon.

669
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,380
I hung out with you andヲ together.

670
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,380

Just thinking about it.

676
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,380
