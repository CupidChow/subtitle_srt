1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The game is a little bit complicated

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Episode 3

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You shouldn't be happy when I'm stronger here

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You also oppose me like those officials in the Imperial Household.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If His Majesty is now in the Palace of the Disaster,

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
everyone in the world will blame you for your mistake.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't want His Majesty to leave the name of the devil in the history book.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Aren't you worried that you will come here yourself?

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You are worried about me instead.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a pity that it's too late.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I, who is a child of my own,

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
have my own way.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
For a Fei.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No. 5G, Xiao Fuxing.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I will bring you to the true story.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Your Highness,

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
why don't you go back and rest?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I want to listen.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When did I offend him?

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He is so vicious.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Your Majesty, the imperial doctor has diagnosed that

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
the fragrance is made of the flower powder from Mantuo.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It can cause people to be in trouble and get into trouble.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In the safe of the box in the place of 5G,

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
we also found the antidote for the treatment.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Your Majesty,

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
when did you start suspecting me?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Summon the officials.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your Majesty,

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
don't listen to me.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Your Majesty, don't care about the Empress.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is a warning to the emperor.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Bring him up.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The emperor's name is broken.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not a mistake.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This person is the imperial doctor.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He was indeed in my house last night.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He advised me to take part in the conspiracy.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So it is.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Your Majesty and Duke of Ying's hard work

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
are both in my heart.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Take him down.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Cheng Wu.

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the imperial doctor is in the capital.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He is suffering from a lot of pain.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He is arrested and sent to the capital.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He is being attacked by the imperial guards.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Through the Yanxin test,

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
all the secret spies in the palace are dead.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The people of the imperial guards

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
have also been in contact with the 16 generals.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Most of them were the soldiers in the army.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The five soldiers and the generals in the army

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
were taken to the capital

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
by the imperial guards.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Your Majesty.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Many times, the imperial guards

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
were talking about the imperial court.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I was so worried about the situation.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I was worried about him.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I was worried about him.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I hoped he could be a good man.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But...

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He was worried about the military equipment in Le'an.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He was so worried about the enemy.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I was so worried.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Majesty, you are so kind to the imperial guards.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But Prince Han is so kind.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He has let His Majesty down.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why would His Majesty

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
be so sad about the crime of the imperial guards?

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Your Majesty.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Prince Han is in a hurry.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
His Majesty is the one who is talking about it.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The Ming and the Lies are all in the same boat.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's not easy for them to be so stupid.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They are all in His Majesty's hands.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's not the end.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I am so sorry.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am so sorry.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I am so sorry.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wuzhao Yi.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why do you help him?

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Come to this territory.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't want to be honest.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,080
How did it go?

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,520
Great.

112
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,120
Your Majesty.

113
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,920
Though Youmeng

114
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,040
is��War Lord,

115
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,640
No joy in his brilliant years.

116
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,440
I would like to wire the cost of Shallow War 22,000MUSIC.

117
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,560
Продoles Köy.

118
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,120
No.

119
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,120
I have another choice.

120
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,200
Liu Bu.

121
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
Noble Consort, please tell me.

122
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,560
I have something to tell Wuzhao.

123
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,200
No matter how much I tell you,

124
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,560
you have to accept it.

125
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,080
He almost killed me.

126
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,720
Before he was killed,

127
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
I need to ask him.

128
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,280
Wu Zhaoyi.

129
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,560
Why are you broken

130
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,960
and scattered in the palace

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,600
without him?

132
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,560
I am a mus Descendant Wu

133
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,240
of Gu broke into.

134
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
I know what do you mean by this.

135
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Who killed you?

136
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,840
Zhong Hu.

137
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,740
Kill me.

138
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,000
Wu Zhaoyi.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't care what you do to me.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,200
I won't be moved

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
no matter what you do to me.

142
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Because I'm a spy.

143
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,200
When I entered the palace,

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I was deeply involved in the important mission.

145
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Now,

146
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
is there still the need to keep going?

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was born to be a servant of the Prince of Han's Mansion.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Young Master was sent to the imperial palace alone.

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Later, he sent me to the palace.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But my biological parents

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and younger brothers and sisters

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
were all in the Prince of Han's Mansion.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They didn't listen to their orders.

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What would they do?

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm in the harem.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't be too proud.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't be too proud.

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Prince of Han only knows how to be proud.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But I can't be too cowardly.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Once I become a spy,

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm afraid I'll die.

162
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This foolish and foolish Wu Miao Xian

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
is so blind.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I can do it myself.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm still happy.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But later...

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Prince of Han has been in the harem.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm not even a failure.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I won't be lucky.

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was too careless

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
and was too careless.

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a pity.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
why didn't you kill me?

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Actually, I killed you better.

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Zhu Shan Ji must have been very confused.

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But...

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm so old.

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I've never been cold to anyone.

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm changed for you.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This life

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
is my reward.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm willing to do it.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You should go.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Miao Xian.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If possible,

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
my family...

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
They...

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Your Highness.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's go back.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Be careful.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Come on.

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yansishan.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The kitchen and the roof of the kitchen

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
are all done.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yansishan.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The new ingredients from the Light Temple

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
are all in the stock.

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Great.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The time has come

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to restore the house.

204
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Take a guess here, too.

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
This way.

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Okay.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Take it.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes.

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Who are you trying to catch?

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What's going on?

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Can you help me?

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What's going on?

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you doing?

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What exactly is going on?

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,760
I won't let you down

216
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
just because I'm afraid.

217
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm waiting for you.

218
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,160
From the start of your offer to accept Wu Zhaoyi,

219
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,080
you've decided to end it today.

220
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,960
I suspect you

221
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,440
for your words.

222
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,080
I'll give you this.

223
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,000
Your Majesty ordered me not to move.

224
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,280
You're the one who should take action.

225
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,040
One more minute, please.

226
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,800
suficiente

227
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,800
That medicine.

228
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,560
Do you really think

229
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,940
the Leon of the Purple Gold

230
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,600
was made by you?

231
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,600
Yan Ziping,

232
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,920
I just wanted to see you.

233
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,160
You're indeed a dark demon.

234
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,280
You were in the palace.

235
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,000
Li Zhi wanted to be the first to escape.

236
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,440
Your rumor moved Wang Sishan.

237
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,800
He sent the blood of Bi Sheng to you

238
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,400
and gave you the Queen of the Clouds.

239
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,080
I hope you can fulfill his wish.

240
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,680
But you?

241
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
You're a man of the dark.

242
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,240
You don't dare to do it.

243
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Do you have any other options?

244
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,060
Never.

245
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,640
If Zi Jin had only appears once...

246
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,360
no one from the Clouds knows who is him.

247
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,040
Who will be more fortunate to run from a hideous,

248
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,800
evil bitch than me?

249
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,520
I'll take it.

250
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,680
Okay.

251
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,360
I'm not qualified.

252
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,840
What do you plan

253
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,640
to do with Wang Sishan's treatment?

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,920
If Meng Shanggong sees your face now,

255
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,760
will he regret

256
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
sacrificing himself to save him?

257
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,640
Don't mention him.

258
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,440
If Meng Shanggong is not here,

259
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,360
can you still keep your hand?

260
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,920
Or

261
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,280
will Mr. Wang

262
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,400
have to miss his first visit?

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
If that didn't work out,

264
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,760
would he not take ESMA

265
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,880
as his best known loyalty on later comments?

266
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,600
At this mission?

267
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,480
I don't want to be?</p><pgins to discuss this favor from you again.</p><pöll

268
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,240
You want me to pay it back?

269
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,240
Give it back to me?

270
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,200
I'll pay you back watching you.

271
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,520
You're leaving?

272
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,480
So gross.

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Get lost!

274
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,160
Get lost!

275
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,900
Father.

276
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,140
Look at me.

277
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,360
No.

278
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,840
Your Majesty.

279
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,520
Your Majesty.

280
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
How dare you

281
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,600
indulge Your Majesty in making you sick.

282
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,680
Jin pointing at me

283
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,540
that Wu Miao must move.

284
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,680
Do you think

285
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,320
you already knew that?

286
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
If I accept the title of the Imperial Guozhen,

287
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,080
the Empress Dowager will blame me.

288
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,640
And,

289
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,400
Jiu'er hasn't come to the court yet.

290
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,600
How could His Majesty disobey?

291
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,600
You've decided to

292
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,360
cast this play on me.

293
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
What will happen to you?

294
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,640
I haven't punished you yet.

295
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,360
What's wrong with me?

296
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,200
Mingzhi is innocent and dangerous.

297
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,760
She even went to Kunning Palace with her.

298
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,200
Don't kill her.

299
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,200
Your Majesty.

300
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,600
Your Majesty lied to me

301
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,520
and told Ziping to keep it from me.

302
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,720
Is this what you do

303
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,360
for the sake of the Ming army?

304
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,000
The Empress is a city girl.

305
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,480
She doesn't do anything good.

306
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,000
You

307
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,080
are too soft-hearted.

308
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,120
Your Majesty.

309
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,720
Don't be biased.

310
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,960
You shouldn't

311
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,320
blame Yin Sishan.

312
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,960
I

313
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,480
should keep this secret.

314
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,280
If something goes wrong with Guozhen,

315
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,960
will she really be poisoned?

316
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,840
Don't talk nonsense.

317
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,960
I won't allow you to curse yourself.

318
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,440
I will protect you.

319
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,840
You don't even need to use me.

320
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,440
You really are

321
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,320
heartless.

322
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,920
Do

323
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,320
you know

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,440
my feeling

325
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,440
since you used me?

326
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,800
I tend to be too quiet

327
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,400
and don't like to listen.

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,020
I never still

329
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,600
have these little tricks

330
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,440
in my eyes.

331
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,580
But I

332
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,180
don't want to perform measures against you asicated against me.

333
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,060
Forcikian.

334
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,280
I've nevermond До woman's style.

335
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,580
Then I don't need to�需要虛与为谊的笑脸.

336
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,420
What I want

337
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,180
is the love,

338
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,320
and lie and tricking you.

339
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,540
Did you understand?

340
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,920
Your majesty.

341
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,480
Your Majesty.

342
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,000
Your Majesty,

343
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,760
Her Highness the Empress...

344
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,640
More importantly,

345
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
she has given the answer I asked for.

346
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,240
What did Her Highness the Empress say?

347
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,080
Your Majesty.

348
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,560
There's another person...

349
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,120
I know.

350
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,560
You want to plead for me.

351
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,560
I'll talk to you after I come back.

352
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,600
Where are you going?

353
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,520
Lord Han is about to rebel.

354
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,400
I want to fight with him.

355
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,080
Welcome.

356
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,120
You are an 8th birthday boy.

357
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,080
Lord Han has advanced to talks with His Majesty.

358
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,600
His Majestyışu is a thug.

359
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,320
He asked King of Zheng to be 81th,

360
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,800
and King of Xiang of Zhu buyrers

361
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,320
Came here,

362
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,680
led Boldai army to assign justice to the throne.

363
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,600
Come in and talk.

364
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,180
Noble Consort Sun,

365
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,080
I urge you two

366
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,800
to give疑國rand burden

367
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,560
to serve our country captain here.

368
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,580
How dare she!

369
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:15,580
Qi Yueらい is flourishing

370
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,380
Your Majesty,

371
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,860
Imperial Concubine Guang, Yuan Rong,

372
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,500
and the Empress Dowager, Zheng Heng,

373
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
will be sent to the palace.

374
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,860
Yes.

375
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

376
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,860
Rise.

377
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

378
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,660
At the gate of the city,

379
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,740
prepared from the official army,

380

the empirical position of the informs minister of the capital's Lynn Suo...

381
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,100
On New Year's Eve,

382
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,460
among all the fifty,

383
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,520

387

escape the ﷻ Раз verte ré

389
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,540
and the people.

390
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,580
At the moment of the political war,

391
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,180
the capital has been gone.

392
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,660
Theyyeong convinced me

393
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,060
on the huge front,

394
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,460
and it is crucial to pickup our people

395
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,900
the common folk,

396
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,380
who has a frequent тутation period.

397
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,100
It's touching 300 people,

398
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,580
No one may live exclusively

399
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,220
for 500 official seats.

400
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,180
In exchange for помощan 3 years of imprisonment.

401
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,580
It's a major crime

402
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,100
to prevent and stop Stuffing Winters

403
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,500

no matter how heavily cases gottenился,

407
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,540
then it could still suffer forever.

408
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,500
I've got...

409
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,460

410
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,220

I'm here.

413
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,580
The guards outside the wall

414
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,100
are only for the suspicious.

415
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
I'm here to lead them.

416
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
You should go, too.

417
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,140
Thank you, mother.

418
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,060
Within three days,

419
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
the palace will be clean.

420
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,940
Let them taste

421
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,900
the taste of the people's hunger.

422
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,020
What?

423
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,660
Mother.

424
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,540
Are you still short of three days?

425
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,780
I dare not.

426
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,700
You may leave.

427
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,980
ube second and of the Empress's subscribe,

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,220
for it's actually legal website.

429
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,460
Why do you look at me this way?

430
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,520
Of course.

431
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,940
Forget about me.

432
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,340
If you are von Bower

433
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,680
I can punish you more severely.

434
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,020
Enough.

435
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,340
I'm sorry

436
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,180
that I let your絕 duos

437
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,280
save the palace感~~~

438
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,560
I'll be

439
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,860
it will be even more sad.

440
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,380
Yes.

441
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,460
Empress Dowager.

442
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,260
Your Majesty.

443
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,580
I thought

444
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,140
Le'an was a lonely city.

445
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:45,220
Lord Han was on his way to attack Jinan.

446
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,180
I thought it was not possible.

447
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,620
If I were Lord Han,

448
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,940
leading the army to attack Nanjing,

449
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,580
I would be in danger

450
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,980
if I controlled the guard of Nanjing and Jiangnan.

451
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,700
No.

452
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,580
Jinan is a tough man.

453
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,300
Lord Han has no guarantee of victory.

454
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,820
He won't take this risk.

455
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,500
I ordered Nanjing to strengthen the guard

456
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,540
and let Chen Xuan guard Huai'an.

457
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,460
So he won't be in danger.

458
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,900
He will only be in Le'an for a while.

459
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,180
He is not sure

460
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,100
if he can make it to the first place.

461
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,700
He won't leave the capital without a chance.

462
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,180
The army has five generals.

463
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,380
Most of them are his old men.

464
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,580
I have a fight with the Imperial family.

465
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,820
Those who chase after him

466
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,300
will be killed.

467
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,500
Yes.

468
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,340
All soldiers, speed up.

469
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,340
Go to Le'an.

470
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,980
Yes.

471
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,900
Anatoly Богria.

472
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,300
Your Majesty,

473
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,940
when Lord Han

474
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,820
really goes to Nanxia,

475
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,460
How many of Nanjing's old men

476
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,740
are in danger?

477
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,940
Don't worry.

478
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,660
Think about it.

479
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:20,940
Ai Qing.

480
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,180
You lost.

481
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,540
Your Majesty.

482
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,180
The fire is out of control.

483
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,700
You still have the mood to keep fighting.

484
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,260
Yuan Qi.

485
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,500
Your Majesty.

486
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,260
Go and get some tea and some firewood from Lord Mei.

487
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:33,780
Yes.

488
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,580
At your oversized謝謝.

489
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,700
Welcome back to for tea.

490
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,660
Yes.

491
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:53,980
MiyngYuan.

492
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,620
Don't forget

493
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,420
forgot toThat date with Emperor Han.

494
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
I wanna know

495
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,700
how this still goes.

496
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,340
Your Majesty never told you

497
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,300
about me.

498
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,060
Are you here to

499
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,580
experienced the施back

500
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,300
of me at all?

501
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:37,860
Yes.

502
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,180
I'm not in the capital.

503
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,740
Her Majesty is very kind.

504
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,180
Who is really reliable and reliable?

505
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,540
I don't understand.

506
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,300
Focus on the next item.

507
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,340
Come again.

508
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,220
Stop.

509
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:01,620
Let's go.

510
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,420
Next one.

511
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,220
Hurry up.

512
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:05,980
Okay. Let's go.

513
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:06,860
Hurry up.

514
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,380
This is the first item.

515
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,380
My lord.

516
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,980
The emperor is in the capital.

517
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,540
He's been in the capital for a long time.

518
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,780
Now the capital is under control.

519
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,300
It's a good time to do it.

520
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,180
But your injury...

521
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,460
If it's not the old-fashioned way,

522
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,580
how can I stay in the capital?

523
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,220
Don't worry.

524
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,620
I won't die.

525
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,980
Give the message to the doctor.

526
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,580
I'll wait for the price in the capital.

527
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:34,540
Yes.

528
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,740
I've opened the jade storage.

529
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,540
The food is still not useful.

530
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,700
I've opened the coffin.

531
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,580
My mother has been in the capital for a long time.

532
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,980
But there are a few people in the county who are willing to donate.

533
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,780
But the people are still in the capital.

534
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,660
They've been in the capital for ten days.

535
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,180
The King of the Banshee is in the capital for the harvest.

536
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,100
The more they lack food,

537
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,740
the more they dare not take it out.

538
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,900
Where's your second brother?

539
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,820
He's sick after three days of hunger.

540
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,260
What's wrong?

541
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
He's sick after three days of hunger.

542
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,900
His mother, Li Taifei,

543
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,540
heard that there are many refugees in the capital.

544
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,260
He immediately took out his own private life.

545
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,500
How can he not even be a woman in the palace?

546
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,140
Be careful.

547
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,260
Let's go and see him.

548
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,860
Your Majesty,

549
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,780
the Qing and Kejian are in Xizhou.

550
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,420
Every morning and evening,

551
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,940
three people are in the county.

552
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,380
They are five years old and have no food.

553
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,260
The people can't fill their stomachs.

554
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,980
They can only go out to find vegetables and roots.

555
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,780
They can only eat grass.

556
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,740
If they continue like this, they can't do it.

557
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,580
Your Majesty.

558
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,500
May the doctors in the city

559
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,660
teach the people how to cook.

560
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,900
Hurry up.

561
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,100
Send the children to the hospital.

562
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:15,900
Yes.

563
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,300
Come on.

564
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,620
Your Majesty.

565
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,260
Your Majesty, are you all right?

566
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,780
I'm not sure.

567
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,700
Her Majesty has been in the prison for a while.

568
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,700
She has been in a hurry.

569
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,060
I told her

570
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,500
that Her Majesty doesn't want to rest.

571
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,220
Chukka.

572
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:39,980
I'm not filial.

573
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,100
I can't fulfill the promise of the emperor.

574
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,100
Her Majesty will be worried about me.

575
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,340
Your brother wants you to be strong

576
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
and teach the people in the country to you.

577
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,060
Why are you so useless?

578
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,700
Her Majesty is in a critical condition.

579
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,180
He should go back to the palace first.

580
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,060
Her Majesty,

581
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,020
go back to the palace and take care of your illness.

582
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,220
I'll leave the palace to the prince of Xiang

583
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,220
to be treated.

584
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,900
It's important to send the children to the Qingling Palace.

585
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:09,980
Besides,

586
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,180
we only say

587
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,980
that Her Majesty will go to the temple to report

588
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,860
to the people to pray for the food.

589
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,860
As you said, Your Highness.

590
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,540
Mother.

591
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,700
Your Majesty.

592
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,380
If I go back to the palace to take care of my illness,

593
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,420
I'll teach you everything here.

594
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,700
Can you do it?

595
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,860
Yes.

596
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,420
I'll do my best

597
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,500
to help the people in Xiang.

598
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,820
I'm just afraid that

599
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,620
I'll fail Her Majesty.

600
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,020
Take care.

601
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,180
Let's go to the front and see.

602
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
You can do your job.

603
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,900
Come on.

00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,380
Hurry.

606
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,300
Go to his side.

607
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,540
No one is allowed to come out from there.

608
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,580
Stop them now.

609
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,500
We're busy with communication.

610
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,140
We have to catch the garrison.

611
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,300
Take 500 soldiers and store them at once

612
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,500
in the process.

613
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,460
Yes.

614
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,820
No, your Majesty.

615
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,340
Nice team.

616
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,940
No, your Majesty.

617
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,140
Your Highness!

618
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,300
Is this your Empress Dowager?

619
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,060
Bring her back to the Palace.

620
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,260

621
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,260

Come on.

630
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,240
I remember that

631
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,220
Something in our past operations

632
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,240
Don't forget that

633
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,380
You can go think that

634
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,400
Even backwards

635
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,000
You can keep the everything

636
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,400
I've thought it through

637
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,100
When I was young

638
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,840
There was all тоже

639
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,300
I don't know

640
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,940
If I haven't been a worker

641
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,960
When I got on the bus

642
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,800
I'll leave it to you.

643
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,760
Yes.

644
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,760
As for the current situation,

645
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,960
the Empress Dowager will be at ease.

646
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,880
Leave the evidence to Prince Xiang.

647
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,520
With your evidence,

648
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,600
it's hard to keep it.

649
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,680
Send someone else.

650
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,560
Leave the rest to me.

651
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,920
Sorry.

652
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,760
Love is only from the heart.

653
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,440
Your Highness,

654
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,400

658
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,680
how can we be safe?

659
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,960
What are you waiting for?

660
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,720
Yes.

661
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,520
Your Your Highness,

662
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,120
now money hasn't come yet.

663
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,800
We should take shops and takeYou under my side being so modest.

664
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,040
I understand.

665
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,640
You may excuse us.

666
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,360
We lackaka that time

667
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,600
but good type is not necessary.

668
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,400
Anyway, the High Priest leave the palace

669
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,400
and EMP is in prosperity.

670
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,240
We can't make haste.

671
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,120
This is all you need to figure out,

672
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,960
what about the 무슨 frau?

673
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,740
More and more the patients in the city will be malnourished.

00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,460

The doctor visit it every 3 to 5 years.

678

It's a family business.

679
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,200
But my ancestors used to tell us

680
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,600
that the people in the world

681
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,440

This tree lies in

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,080
Why don't you let the imperial physician

Besides,

695
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
if I don't see the patient,

696
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,040

to find some jewelry .

731
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,160
Tell them

00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,920
to take care of them at the right time.

734
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:09,920
Yes.

735
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
The ancestors

736
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
have opened some of the royal family's brothel.

737
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,400
They allowed the people to be taken care of.

738
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,800
Now,

739
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,360
they are still in the middle of the ceremony.

740
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,520
Yes.

00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,960
Go ahead and take a look.

742
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,920
Why did you do that?

743
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,640
What are you talking about?

744
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,400
What are you doing?

745
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,480
Why did you do that?

746
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,320
Why did you do that?

747
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,360
Why did you do that?

748
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,880
Why did you do that?

749
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880

Why did you do that?

753
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,360
You just said you were the head of the family.

754
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,480
Why are you so mean?

755
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,720
What are these things?

756
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,920
They are not for the palace concubines.

757
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,160
I really can't stand it.

758
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,480
The people can do anything.

759
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,280
They can't do anything.

760
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,000
After they are forced,

761
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,360
they will go to the camp,

762
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,240
the government office,

763
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,320
or even the imperial city.

764
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,840
At that time,

765
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,080
no one will recognize you as a palace concubine

766
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,000
or a father.

767
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,640
Is it that serious?

768
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,800
What should we do?

769
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,520
The people of the court

770
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,960
will go to the county of Zhili Fushu

771
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,840
to spread the news.

772
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,480
That is to say,

773
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,400
the maids of Mayday

774
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,600
will soon have 480 taels of silver.

775
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,160
Go.

776
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,560
Yes.

777
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,640
Why are you doing that?

778
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,680
The scar people have faith.

779
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,200
They heard

780
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,360
as the silverME matters will lower the price,

781
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,120
they will send the men home to the capital as well.

782
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,320
And parents

783
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,400
for evening foolish make amends without any pause.

784
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,840
But...

785
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,200
What?

786
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,480
You have these desperation words,

787
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,480
theashing vehicles from KJP

788
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,640
She's in the capital.

789
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,440
I hope nothing happens on the way.

790
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,160
Let's go.

791
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,480
Let's go to the place where we can take the patient.

792
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,600
Be careful.

793
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:49,960
Come on.

794
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,240
Put your hands up.

795
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,080
How could the Empress come to this place?

796
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,240
Come on.

797
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,960
Get some water.

798
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,640
Doctor!

799
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,240
My child doesn't know

800
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,520
why the poison is hurt.

801
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:03,880
Let me see.

802
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,960
Let me see.

803
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,200
Let me see.

804
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,920
Let me see.

805
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,640
Let me see.

806
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,280
Let me see.

807
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,920
Let me see.

808
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,440
Hua Ping, get some water.

809
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,920
Yes.

810
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,120
Your Highness.

811
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,240
Your Highness.

812
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,320
Noble Consort Song is here.

813
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,800
Thank you, doctor.

814
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,160
Take care.

815
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,880
The Empress Dowager doesn't want to eat?

816
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,040
Yes.

817
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Is the food you sent not good for her?

818
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,960
Noble Consort,

819
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,240
the imperial physician said that the Empress Dowager used porridge.

820
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,440
She even changed the porridge for one person.

821
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,440
aaaaaaaaaaaaA

822
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,200
It's still good for the Empress Dowager.

823
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,040
i i

824
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,920
It's still good for the Empress Dowager.

825
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,880
Fun, this isustomed.

826
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,080
Okay.

827
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,120
Empress Dowager.

828
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,480
Empress Dowager.

829
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
I will send all the dishes to the Palace of Youth.

830
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,960
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

831
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,800
My Lady.

832
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,280
My Lady.

833
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,380
Your Highness,

834
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,360
it turns out Chu is trouble-raising.

835
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,480
I know what I should do.

836
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Xujiao.

837
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,160
Empress Dowager.

838
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:06,040
If the Empress Dowager unresents the family

839
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,240
for business sake,

840
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,520
there must be a way.

841
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,720
Give it to me.

842
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,440
Okay.

843
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,000
What are you doing?

844
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,240
What are you doing?

845
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,120
Be careful.

846
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,040
Take this.

847
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,880
That is...

848
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,700
Cut the tenderloin'sipermmm when you first know the truth!

849
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,400
The young men from the Mansion of Meng

850
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,520
went on besieging the palace

851
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,300
and most of the loyal FERsupp安 nat dynasty

852
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,420
invited partners from my side together

853
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,640
I became the latter

854
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,780
Then Xi Goddess showed me

855
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:37,080
the handsmaid極力

856
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,100
the比如

857
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,480
As long as she went through the sake

858
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,300
of her dainty Danshan

859
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:43,700
again

860
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,220
and hard to handle.

861
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:47,900
Get up quickly.

862
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,740
As long as you don't check it carefully,

863
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,180
the outsiders won't see anything.

864
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,260
You're a smart person.

865
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,100
Smart person is the most practical thing.

866
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,620
You won't be buried for Zhu Zhanji.

867
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,340
Everything is in danger.

868
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,660
I'm the one who's going to marry him.

869
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,260
I can bear it.

870
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,580
I'll do it.

871
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,780
Only because he's Zhu Zhanji.
