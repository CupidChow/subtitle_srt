How could you do that?

You should be on your own.

57
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,140
You should be at least the Crown Prince's office every day.

Your Highness, I'm the one who tried to scare you.

137
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,400
If you were a senior at the sight of the chamber,

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:24,980

My Lord.

142
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,040
My Lord.

143
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,560
You.

144
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,240
Who do you want to pay the fine?

145
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,920

But it's an inner chamber.

153
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,120
You're not allowed to attend here.

154
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,320
You better go back to your original position first.

Who are you?

156
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,400

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,600
My Lord.

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
You made a mistake.

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,080
Please punish the courtesan.

162
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,680

My Lord.

164
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,640
My Lord.

165
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,400
The Crown Prince was angry.

166
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,480
He wanted to punish the palace maid.

167
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,240
The Empress of Xiaoci is afraid of being angry.

168
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,000
He wants to take the palace maid away.

169
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,320
The Empress of Xiaoci is so kind.

170
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,160
If you want to take the palace maid away,

171
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
you must be punished and punished.

172
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,480
You are the emperor.

173
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,760
You should be punished.

174
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,640
My Lord.

175
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,720
He said...

176
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,520
I...

177
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,400
I was afraid that his bangle may break my mouth.

178
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,880
What's matter with your neck?

179
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,560
It's worth miser it.

180
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,160
It is likely not to be so.

181
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,680
There are thousands of avalanches in the world.

182
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,680
There are not many rules that can be ruled.

183
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,600
If you continue to make an tame-damage,

184
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,800
go to the world kingdom.

185
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,080
Lord Yuhi,

187
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,880
you are in a serious crisis.

188
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,480
My Lord.

189
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,640
Lord Yuhi is less talented,

190
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,660
not a ruler.

191
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,560
It is the formality of the音INGING Table with teng Fu фаwуnal.

192
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,280
His Majesty ak慎 as a man of cheer.

193
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,960
What a true mistake!

194
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,720
He went to the Palace Police Service with a close friend.

195
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,240
And they met him in person.

196
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,000
We should have stayed humble and meddled.

197
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,040
Show them.

198
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,140
Eldest kind of

199
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,680
bait and

200
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:36,080
cure you with None

201
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,240
and you did

202
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,560
will tu

203
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,300
such a

204
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,760
poetic

205
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,200
and the food.

206
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,120
You took away all of them.

207
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,280
The crown prince's dinner today,

208
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,200
are you here to cook?

209
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,040
Lord You,

210
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,640
it seems that you can only take one person away today.

211
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,080
Okay.

212
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,280
I'll just watch here

213
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,400
how you two respect each other.

214
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,280
But I have to say that

215
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,800
the crown prince's dinner

216
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,000
is not for marriage.

217
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,920
If he dares to do anything against you,

218
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,040
I'm afraid he'll be too late to take it.

219
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,680
Your Highness.

220
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,680
I'll take it.

221
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,520
Your Highness, it's me.

222
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
What spices did you use?

223
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I know you don't like the smell of marinated water.

224
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,800
I chose the Mo Lihua scent of qianya.

225
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,760
Did you change it?

226
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,640
Don't you like it?

227
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,600
Yes, Your Highness.

228
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,880
Wait for me here. I'll be back in a while.

229
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,320
Your hair.

230
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,680
I don't even use any of the expensive oil.

231
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
This is the rose I picked myself.

232
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,200
It's fragrant and soft. It's not bad.

233
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,280
You don't like it?

234
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,320
I'll go and have a meal.

235
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,920
Don't leave me alone.

236
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,440
You must wait for me here.

237
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Excuse me, my cast.

238
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,200
Let's eat Genau.

239
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,200
Sorry, I left it on the way.

240
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,920
Your Highness,

241
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,080
have a bite. It's from Yun Fei.

242
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
Who's dealing with all these?

243
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,360
The first battle fighting.

244
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,560
The battle will begin.

245
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,120
Beauty Chen

246
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960

Lord You

249
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,020
What's the meaning of this?

250
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,560
Say it.

251
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,320
They just do it in a bad way.

252
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,680
If all the officials help the crown monk,

253
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,080
wouldn't they FERS him?

254
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,840
Why not leave it to me

255
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,120
to take the exclusive cuny back home?

256
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Enough!

257
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,360
Xiao Xiao.

258
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,640
Here's the full title of this charge.

259
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,560
I'll go.

260
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,640
As a kitchen cook,

261
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,400
even if you're a family member of the Dao family,

262
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,080
don't forget your duty.

263
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,360
From now on,

264
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,120
we'll prepare the food for you

265
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,640
as well as the dinner for the crown prince.

266
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,960
I'll do it.

267
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,600
Yuehua, you can't do it.

268
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,040
All right.

269
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
I'll leave it to you.

270
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760

271
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400

272
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
No.

273
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,320
Okay.

274
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,560
These will be recommended by the two families.

275
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Win them all up.

276
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,680
Yes.

277
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,600

280
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,660
Didn't I pass the exam on the brink of depression?

281
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,920
I'll punish you myself

282
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,200
if you can't wait for the justice.

283
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,720
What will happen

284
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:25,960
to us

285
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,000
if we fail?

286
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,840
Today is the day of the speed battle.

287
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,280
I'll come to you.

288
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,720

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
The noodles.

387
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
the noodles.

388
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
The noodles.

389
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
The noodles.

390
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
The noodles.

391
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
The noodles.

392
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
The noodles.

393
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
The noodles.

394
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
The noodles.

395
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,440
Sorry, chief.

396
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,680
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,020
Walk,

398
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,780
don't forget to have eyes.

399
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:24,600
Your Majesty,

400
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,600
I must talk to this young man.

401
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,920
My daughter can'tMm.

403
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,120
This way.

404
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,420
How imagine she could listen

405
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:39,980
to yourangeness!

406
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,680
And then,

407
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,160
she can't move on from her side!

408
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,080
I don't mean that.

409
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,800
But07

410
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,720
What?

411
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,580
What?

412
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

413
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,400
Just move.

414
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,620
A retreat?

415
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,120
L Control me, I'll let you do it 就此去

416
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,880
Aren't I still...

417
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,040
Knowing it's useless here

418
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,020
coming from this

419
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,520
alone place

420
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,820
才 Life Without Deception

421
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,720
This….

422
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,860
This, I would say, my truth

423
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
This is made in the East Palace, right?

424
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,860
Your Highness, try this.

425
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,380
Okay.

426
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,540
I haven't had such a delicious home-cooked meal for a long time.

427
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
Take your time.

428
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,700
How did you get in touch with him?

429
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,100
Your Highness,

430
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,380
I used a skin-to-face brush to stick on the skin of the peanuts.

431
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,900
I used an egg skin to make it soft and smooth.

432
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,940
The tail of the shrimp is a carrot.

433
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,900
Look at the shrimp.

434
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,900
There's also a flower-like smell.

435
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:10,780
Your Highness,

436
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,100
the flower-like smell of the shrimp is made of the skin of the shredded peanuts

437
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,140
and the black and white sesame seeds.

438
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,700
Finally, the ingredients are separated and circulation is perfect.

439
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,460
What a carefully-made Cars, Your Highness.

440
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:24,940
Your Highness,

441
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,420
it's not easy for him to keep such a heart.

442
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
You should reward me.

443
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,620
Reward...

444
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,500
Here, have a try.

445
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,580
Where is the doctor?

446
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,740
Where is he?

447
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,780
Eunuch Yuan, why are you here?

448
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,660
Where is he?

449
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,300
I'm on my way to see him off.

450
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,700
Eunuch, what is the order from Royal Descendant?

451
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,220
Who went to the funeral today?

452
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,700
I sent him off today.

453
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,900
Eunuch, what happened?

454
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,420
Nothing.

455
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,580
You're lucky to be here.

456
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,100
Come with me.

457
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,740
She must be the person you thought.

458
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,660
He should leave.

459
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,000
You still won't leave?

460
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,860
Lord Weiyu.

461
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,100
You're not going to remove it?

462
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,700
Your Highness,

463
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,140
it's the water from the ginseng mountain

464
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,460
that came here last year.

465
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,020
How dare you!

466
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,620
How dare you!

467
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,900
It's true.

468
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,140
The water hasn't been washed by the dead yet.

469
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,060
It's still very heavy.

470
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,220
It needs to be kept for a few months

471
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,660
before it can be used to make tea.

472
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,220
When I sent the snacks today,

473
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,740
I saw Your Highness's painting and birthday house

474
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,420
were all in one place.

475
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,820
Your Highness, please forgive me.

476
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,180
His Highness, he's mechanism speedy.

477
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,100
We don't have any

478
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,500
sacrificing place for you.

479
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,420
What do you guys want to do?

480
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:58,700
My Lord.

481
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,540
The one in the crown is Numpa.

482
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,740
This food really is tasty.

483
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,300
Andろ魂.

484
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,060
What's less masihlu?

485
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,820
What can we use here?

486
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,140
It's just the soup we often use.

487
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,940
Do you really want me to take off my clothes?

488
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,260
What kind of soup do you use?

489
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,340
Ziping has a habit.

490
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,780
He collects the leftover ingredients.

491
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,020
Especially the bones of chicken, duck, pork, and meat.

492
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,900
Even the head of the shrimp.

493
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,740
He collects the leftover ingredients and makes them into soups.

494
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,100
It's just the white water noodles.

495
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,820
It's also very delicious.

496
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,020
Yin Ziping.

497
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,180
I have a saying.

498
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,260
If you are impolite,

499
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,820
you should be punished.

500
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,700
Take it.

501
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,940
My Lord.

502
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,500
My Lord, are you not investigating clearly?

503
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,340
My Lord.

504
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,180
This is the soup of water.

505
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,820
There is no fresh soup.

506
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,540
Ziping.

507
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,620
My Lord.

508
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,380
The white water noodles are the main noodles of water.

509
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,900
There is no fresh soup.

510
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,580
You misunderstood.

511
00:33:42,380 --> 00:34:08,820
Your scalar strategy

512
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,460
ですね.

513
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,980
Go to the Palace of the bamboo tree.

514
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,940
Come on.

515
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,420
Your Highness.

516
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,140
I was wronged.

517
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,020
Your Highness.

518
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,740
Your Highness.

519
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,140
I was wronged.

520
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:20,980
Your Highness.

521
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,340
I was wronged.

522
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,460
Your Highness.

523
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,500
Your Highness.

524
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,100
My Lord.

525
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,540
You are...

526
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,900
A person who has been treated well.

527
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,180
He is heartbroken.

528
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,380
He is punished.

529
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:33,980
You are back.

530
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,300
Your Highness.

531
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,420
Every field in Changlin

532
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,820
with every Archive

533
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,020
will be fed there

534
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,100
to see the property

535
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,340
so they don't go without orders.

536
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,860
Your Highness Engineer Yuzhu is just right.

537
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,540
He short notice much on his own.

538
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,300
He is a lay Marine andvéins.

539
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,900
If you don't go there,

540
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,300
after coming too much there,

541
00:34:54,300 --> 00:35:06,000
the fire won't

542
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,780
happen to you.

543
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,960
A cuestion in the middle of the box

544
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,480
and run to the capital in thousands of miles.

545
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,560
The capital is still in its place for two years.

546
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,120
There must be some people who don't know the secret.

547
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,440
The palace is full of people.

548
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,160
It's not a secret.

549
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,520
But it's bold to take the risk.

550
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,560
Shouldn't it be revealed?

551
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,000
Your Highness.

552
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,000
I have no idea.

553
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,800
I was wrong.

554
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,200
I'll go to the imperial court now.

555
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,120
Wait.

556
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,640
Your Highness.

557
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,400
What else do you want?

558
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,280
Forget it.

559
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,920
Let's go.

560
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,480
Let's go.

561
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,080
I'll go to the imperial court now.

562
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,280
Your Highness.

563
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,680
Don't say that.

564
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,760
Maybe...

565
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,840
someone will use it.

566
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,120
How did you come up with the idea of a soup?

567
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,280
Your Highness.

568
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,280
I've been living in the middle of the road.

569
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,440
I've got the ingredients for the food in the ninth floor.

570
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,560
I've collected them all.

571
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,200
Then I found that

572
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,600
different ingredients

573
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,120
have different flavors

574
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
and different styles.

575
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,040
Then...

576
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,800
why did you change the name of the soup?

577
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,440
Your Excellency.

578
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,120
The soup is fresh every day.

579
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,240
It's hard to get used to it.

580
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,280
I used the name of the soup

581
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,120
to think that

582
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,600
the emperor's last name

583
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,040
would soon be understood.

584
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,440
How could it be difficult for us to get on the market?

585
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,440
You've been in the palace for a long time.

586
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,640
You seem to know the crown prince very well.

587
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,080
The emperor went on a expedition.

588
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,280
The crown prince was a spy.

589
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,920
He was sleeping and resting for a while.

590
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
The crown prince's fame

591
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,160
has spread across the country.

592
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,360
Who knows

593
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,480
who will be the next one?

594
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Your Excellency.

595
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,360
Thank you for taking the blame today.

596
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,160
Can you not take him away?

597
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
Your Excellency.

598
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,360
Zi Jin is so clever.

599
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,320
If he really took him to the imperial court,

600
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,680
it would be a pity.

601
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,960
From now on,

602
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,720
you can stay in the Shang's Bureau

603
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,440
and study the cooking.

604
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,000
Yes, Your Excellency.

605
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,760
Thank you, Your Excellency.

606
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,760
To be honest,

607
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,560
Qing Shui's main noodle is right.

608
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,200
But the noodle

609
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,720
is the fish noodle made by the horse mackerel

610
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,760
sent by my ex-wife.

611
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,880
Although it has no fish flavor,

612
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,200
it is very delicious.

613
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,600
I added green onion and ginger seasoning

614
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,520
to cover the original flavor of the fish.

615
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,800
How could they find out?

616
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,160
But I didn't see you.

617
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:29,140
Who's talking, Ming цел

618
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,960
This noodle tastes like flat noodles.

619
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,120
but I was too tired to bear it.

620
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,560
I've heard

621
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,480
that the Emperor doesn't bring the Crown Prince with him.

622
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,920
He even drinks a sip of tea in the Eastern Palace.

623
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,840
It's a great fight.

624
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,080
It's annoying.

625
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,880
Be quiet.

626
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,840
Let me see.

627
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,800
No need.

628
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,560
You taught me to read.

629
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,520
I'll keep it for you.

630
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,880
It's a fair deal.

631
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,920
We'll meet each other.

632
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,680
Why didn't I beg you to help me?

633
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,440
Okay.

634
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,160
Does it hurt?

635
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Tong Zhiruo asked me to draw it for you.

636
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,520
Come here.

637
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Be gentle.

638
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
It hurts.

639
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,160
Don't draw it.

640
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,200
I suddenly remembered.

641
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,400
I have something to do.

642
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,320
I'm leaving.

643
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,320
It's so late.

644
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,200
What are you doing?

645
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,560
I...

646
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,360
I'll get the medicine back.

647
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,920
Send it in.

648
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,840
I shall rove you to his challenge!

649
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,360
I can't fight him if I don't answer the questions.

650
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,480
What I can't do is…

651
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,120
I'll wait for him for a while.

652
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,800
Then you

653
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,960
shall kommt in.

654
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,920
I was a ad agent

655
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,780
Go to your room.

656
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,760
Minister of הח replicated the emissaries.

657
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,460
but изolder

658
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,200
better

659
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Our Li

660
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,920
Thus at his game

661
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,560
Hahahahaha

662
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,600
If your emperor

663
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,040
Do not

664
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,360
you

665
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,980
To

666
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:53,900
You

667
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,080
From

668
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,120
열심히做巫一个丝尾某面又不 bones o Yep, a size that has no carrots to touch

669
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,560
Do not like that

670
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,680
The emperor refused to look at

671
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,480
what this bland pastager is

672
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,680
disappeared

673
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,840
What is aLess

674
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,720
or maybe

675
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,220
good

676
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,240
It's so good

677
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,160
It was caused by the deep need of this

678
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,880
Small

679
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
The two top-ranking officials have been removed from the palace.

680
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,880
There are two top-ranking officials in the palace.

681
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,880
The top-ranking officials are the officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Culture.

682
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
They are the officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Culture.

683
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,880
The rest of the officials are the officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Culture.

684
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,880
This year, we have a special event.

685
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,880
The new officials will be able to participate in the new official's exam.

686
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,880
I will also take this opportunity to select a disciple of the enemy.

687
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,880
I will teach him the way to be a student.

688
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,880
Okay, that's it.

689
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
Disperse.

690
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
Yes.

691
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
Zijin.

692
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Don't disappoint me.

693
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,880
Your Highness.

694
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,880
A clever and clever person who has long been a good person.

695
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,880
Are you really not curious?

696
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,880
I'm not.

697
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,880
I haven't sent my memorials to you.

698
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
Go and ask.

699
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
Yes.

700
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,880
I think I've missed something.

701
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,880
I think I've missed something.

702
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
I think I've missed something.

703
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,880
I think I've missed something.

704
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,880
Wait for this

705
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,880
Don't leave the fire rain

706
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,880
And dream a long time to meet

707
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,880
The happiness in my dreams is not broken

708
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,880
Someone will remember

709
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,880
I think

710
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,880
Wait for this

711
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,880
Don't leave the fire rain

712
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
And dream a long time to meet

713
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,880
The happiness in my dreams is not broken

714
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Someone will remember

715
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,880
I think

716
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,880
I think

717
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,880
I've missed something.

718
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,880
I think I've missed something.

719
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,880
I think I've missed something.

720
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,880
I think I've missed something.

721
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,880
I think I've missed something.

722
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,880
I think I've missed something.

723
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,880
I think I've missed something.

724
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,880
I think I've missed something.

725
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,880
I think I've missed something.

726
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,880
I think I've missed something.

727
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,880
I think I've missed something.

728
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,880
I think I've missed something.

729
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,880
I think I've missed something.
