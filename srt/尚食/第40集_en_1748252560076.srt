00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The first episode of the show is about the real life of the low-tech.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Please watch it for a while.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Episode 14

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The most true thing of the smart man is that

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
you will not be buried in the bamboo tent.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You will not be buried in the bamboo tent.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Everything is in danger.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I am the one who will marry you.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I can endure it. I will endure it.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Because that man is the bamboo tent.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's all.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Episode 15

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Wake up!

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Retreat!

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Retreat!

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Retreat!

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Uncle.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Did Yifan tell you that

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
when he controlled the capital city,

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
he found an excuse to trick the king of Han

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and made you go to the capital city?

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sun.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He told me that

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you were taken to the capital city.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
As long as I go back to the capital city,

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
he will kill the queen mother and put her on your head.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
By then,

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will become the king of the Qing army.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
When the king of Han goes to the capital city,

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
he will kill the king of Han and marry you.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then, he will restore his identity

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and become the real winner.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You two are just his pawns.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yifan.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is this true?

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You are a useless and useless person!

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How did I treat you before you forgot?

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How dare you betray me today?

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yifan treated me well.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He saved me from the wolf group.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He saved me in a special way.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He was alone in the capital city.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I am so proud of your kindness.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Your Majesty.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I...

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I was written by him.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He planned it all.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I was forced to do it

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to make a big mistake.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Your Majesty.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Your Majesty, save me, Your Majesty.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your Majesty.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your Majesty, save me, Your Majesty.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are a bastard!

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You planned all this

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
to revenge your biological father, right?

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You are really my good son.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Do you know that if I become the emperor,

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you will be the future emperor!

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You have caused so much trouble

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
to the future.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are so ungrateful!

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You let all of us

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
destroy the world together.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Revenge.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Revenge.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Liu Yifan.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Zhu Zhanli let Her Highness go.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Zhu Zhanli?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are me.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Will you let go?

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Your Majesty, be careful!

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Your Highness.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Your Highness.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Zhanli.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are you all right?

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm fine.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Send Her Highness back.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Your Majesty.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Shoot.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Wait.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I want to live.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Your Majesty.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Your Majesty.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Zhu Zhanli.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You and I are bloodline.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We are all grandfathers.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You have been favored since you were born.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I went to Lü Ci to save her life.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But she still treats me as a martial artist.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why?

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If it's about the martial arts of the literature,

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and the new strategy,

118
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
what can I do for you?

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can be a wise emperor

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and be supported by thousands.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You can be a wise emperor

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and be supported by thousands.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to be a hero.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have to be a good warrior.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why?

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The people in the north are hard-working.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The people in the capital are hard-working.

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The people in the capital are even more hard-working.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The public business is very important.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They are very close to each other.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And they,

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
as the descendants of the Zhu family,

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
are all hard-working.

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They are all hard-working.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But some people have said that

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
she is only trying to save the throne

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
for the sake of the imperial family.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
She is greedy and brave.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
She is a foodie.

140
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But she is not a royal family.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why?

142
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Your Highness,

143
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you are doing this on your own.

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't you want to be a prince

145
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
who is a prince without any worries?

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's just that Mo Wei is a man.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He will make the people feel safe.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He is a man with no worries.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He is a man with no worries.

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He is a man with no worries.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He is a man with no worries.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He is a man with no worries.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He is a man with no worries.

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Your Highness, you must keep

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
your words and actions.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You are seeking the power of the world.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Everyone in the world can misunderstand him.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We are the only ones who can't do it.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
As for the royal family,

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I will not let you do it.

161
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Your Highness.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your Highness.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Why?

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I want to keep you.

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There are many people who know the emperor.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He wants peace in the sea.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He wants to be peaceful in the world.

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I want to keep your eyes on the sword.

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Prince Li.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Your Excellency.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There is someone here.

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Your Highness.

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's Qi Zhi.

174
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,080
who is a slave

175
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,160
of the Shang Qi'sthur?

176
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,520
Which criminal

177
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,440
is the man of her father?

178
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,580
There is norol in the mountain.

179
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,140
There is no mercy.

180
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,160
The traitors are invisible.

181
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,400
There are no Earned Buying?

182
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,200
This is the prog product of my dream.

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,840
I promise you

184
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
I will not be in danger.

185
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
My name is Ming.

186
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,720
I will follow your order.

187
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,040
Zhu Shanxi.

188
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,480
I will keep your promise today.

189
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,920
Don't let him leave you alone.

190
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,480
Be a good soldier.

191
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,920
I will keep my myself.

192
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,800
Iчитia.

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:48,160
Aunt, maybe I've met rapist Ah

194
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Thank you.

195
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,660
You can also get it from the front.

196
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Go ahead.

197
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,660
If it's not enough, you can come back.

198
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,660
Thank you.

199
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,660
Be careful.

200
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,660
Recently, the number of teams in Linzhou is decreasing.

201
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,660
Here.

202
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Here.

203
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,660
Go ahead.

204
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,160
You're back.

205
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I already know.

206
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,660
Thank you.

207
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,660
I have something to tell you.

208
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,160
For many years, I've been a model of the company.

209
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,660
I've always wanted to be a top-class.

210
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,660
I've always been loving you.

211
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,660
I've never forgotten you.

212
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,660
But those things that I've done,

213
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,660
are the promises I need to keep for my whole life.

214
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,160
This promise is related to many people's lives.

215
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
So I won't go to the top.

216
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
I'll bear the pain.

217
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,660
I don't want you to confess.

218
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,660
Although I'm just a humble lady,

219
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,660
I also need to do what I have to do.

220
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Now, everyone knows about this secret.

221
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
I also want to tell you

222
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,160
that I don't regret it anymore.

223
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Thank you.

224
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
I'm willing to finish my words.

225
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Then,

226
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I'll take my leave.

227
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Here.

228
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Move the food.

229
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Put the food on the floor.

230
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Don't eat.

231
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Put the food on the floor.

232
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Put the food on the floor.

233
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
This way. This way.

234
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Cover this.

235
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Come on.

236
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Hurry up.

237
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
This way.

238
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
This way.

239
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
There's another one.

240
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Take it over there.

241
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Come on.

242
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Come on.

243
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
Get up.

244
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
The palace is so big.

245
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Empress Dowager

246
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
is willing to give you the position.

247
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
But

248
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
you need to do something else.

249
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
It's a pity.

250
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
What?

251
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
She asked you to send me off?

252
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
Empress Dowager said

253
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
I was a good teacher.

254
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
I asked her to send me off.

255
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Then I could be in charge of the position.

256
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
She even wants to improve my quality.

257
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
But

258
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
the only top-ranked female official.

259
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
I remember when mother was still alive.

260
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
The third brother of our brothers

261
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
liked to eat

262
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
the food mother cooked.

263
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
She made people miss

264
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
the mountain and sea.

265
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
In my life,

266
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
I was a good teacher.

267
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
I was a good teacher.

268
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
I tried my best

269
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
to get the position for my father.

270
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
But she did it for her baby grandson.

271
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
She made me happy.

272
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Maybe

273
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,160
she knew the status of the war.

274
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
But she bought this

275
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
to my brother.

276
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
And you?

277
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,160
I've been waiting for you for so many years.

278
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,160
But I came here to drink this wine.

279
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
You're so funny.

280
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,160
In my life,

281
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
I've been a good teacher.

282
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,160
The only top-ranked female official.

283
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
You're welcome.

284
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Ziyun.

285
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Ziyun.

286
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
In my life,

287
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
I've been a good teacher.

288
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,160
I've been a top-ranked female official.

289
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,160
I've completed the quality of my life.

290
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
I've spent my whole life

291
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,160
to earn money.

292
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,160
I've spent my whole life to earn money.

293
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
How do you feel?

294
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm much better than you.

295
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
But how can you...

296
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Thank you.

297
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Thank you for your help.

298
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm a good teacher.

299
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,160
I'm sorry.

300
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,160
I should have done a lot of things.

301
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm sorry.

303
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,160
I can finally leave with you.

304
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,160
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

305
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

306
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:59,860
I'm sure your

307
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,360
The eens in baw work may even independence

308
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,660
Maybe I'll feel hurt someday.

309
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,160
task forces say

310
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Send her to psychiatrists.

311
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,160
Go it.

312
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,580
Let's go father.

313
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,200
Get yourself up.

314
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,440
Father.

315
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,020
Mother.

316
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,660
That's right.

317
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,020
Mother, listen to me.

318
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,740
It is an order joining the gang,

319
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,960
not speaking for as a weapon.

320
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,700
Mom.

321
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,560
Mom, I'm so sorry.

322
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,440
I'm sorry.

323
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,300
I'm sorry, Mother.

324
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,980
Sorry.

325
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,560
Nanny Jin voska is dead.

326
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,600
The bize at the moment is sober,

327
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,240
and am sounding her louder.

328
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,560

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
It's so nice.

332
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,000
It's so nice.

333
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,680
It's so nice.

334
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,440
Yes, it is.

335
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,160
Ziping,

336
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,240
please rest in peace.

337
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,560
It's so nice.

338
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,400
It's so nice.

339
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,360
Mr. Yin.

340
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Please rest in peace.

341
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Mr. Yin.

342
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,440
Mrs. White

343
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,760
2nd part

344
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,640
Master Yin said

345
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,560
he works very hard to be able to relax

346
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,120

347
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,440
from honorيتheals

348
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,040
I wish you success too.

349
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,980
Ziping,

350
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,000
she did a good job.

351
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,200
But now, she tried to succeed.

352
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,940
Minister Yishi,

353
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,280
she's right.

354
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,800
A man нужен for baking,

355
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
he may be considerate,

356
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,580
but he can't meet his wishes.

357
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,980
Her majesty really understands,

358
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,480
he deserves to be an angel.

359
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,300
Otherwise,

360
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,580

whom has passed the past

363
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,060
I should say good-bye to her

364
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,000
and be tickled by her

365
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,940
Zi Jin, you said

366
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,240
there is someone outside

367
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,040
besides you

368
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,240
to the world,

369
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,520
to be able to keep up with the power

370
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,280
and to achieve the wish.

371
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,960
From now on,

372
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,560
the world is in a good mood.

373
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
I'll take you there.

374
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,080
I'll take you

375
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,320
to the road you've never taken.

376
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,960
I'll do

377
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,480
everything you can to achieve it.

378
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,400
One day,

379
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,160
Ziping

380
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600

You are the emperor of the Ming Dynasty.

00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,720
The wife of the emperor.

482
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,640
Of course, you are the empress.

483
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,000
What do you mean?

484
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,040

when it comes to your own治 for someone.

494
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,200
Their hair Suchu has a lock of conscience,

495
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,760
being mortals is a act of loving one.

496
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,320
His concern about himself is given by others,

497
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,100
which is why the dowry

498
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,020
is so humble at hand.

499
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,480

501
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:36,800

00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,160
How can I do RWF?

503
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,200

512
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,560

What about me?

528
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,120
If His Majesty doesn't want me,

529
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,280
I'll leave, too.

530
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,680
Don't you think so?

00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,720
The will of God

574
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,240
was only needed.

575
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,400
This is a complement.

576
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,240
Her Highness,

577
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,360
Are you scolding me for someone else?

578
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:30,440
Youpara favor me

579
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:32,780
so that I

580
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,740
avoid punishment of someone's

581
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,040
naíniness.

582
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,720
I convert you to something else,

583
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,860
but you doing it kind of

584
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,160
doesn't please me.

585
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,100
Your Highness.

586
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,240
I love you, Your Highness.

587
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,120
You didn't like it when Ziping left

588
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,380
짝ly inside I am eliminated.

589
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,480
I don't know when we'll meet again.

590
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,040
I'll keep you here.

591
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
Will you be willing to be with me?

592
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,560
Will you...

593
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,160
Will you blame me?

594
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,040
Your Majesty, you never thought

595
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,600
I'll be with you every day.

596
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,040
If you're willing to be with me,

597
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,680
you'll be grateful.

598
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,040
Then I must be careful.

599
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,040
I'm willing to be with you every day.

600
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,520
I'll be grateful.

601
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:33,760
Your Majesty,

602
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,280
I'm willing to be with you every day.

603
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,240
I'm willing to be with you every day.

604
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,240
I want to be with you in the darkness.

605
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
The moonlight is more beautiful than the moon.

606
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,040
I want to spend time with you.

607
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,920
Waiting for this moment.

608
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,960
I'll leave the firefly.

609
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
I'll meet you in my dream.

610
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,200
I'll be with you in my dreams.

611
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,160
I'll be with you forever.

612
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,640
I thought...

613
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Waiting for this moment.

614
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,240
I'll leave the firefly.

615
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,600
I'll meet you in my dream.

616
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,560
I'll be with you forever.

617
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,320
I thought...

618
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,520
I'll be with you forever.
