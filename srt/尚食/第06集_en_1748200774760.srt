in order to understand him,

80
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,560
I read all his book

81
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,600
in the study.

and recites the magic of Wang Xi Zhi.

86
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,800
not only priestesss want to take their army,

87
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,020

89
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,760
So many people are hoping for you.

90
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,320
My goodness,

91
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,040
I said,

92
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,940
but...

93
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,660
Just take our leave now.

94
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,180
Would you dare?

95
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,200
You all know that

96
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,920
What?

97
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
She's such a good person.

98
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,160
What else do you want?

99
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,920
Do you know?

100
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,680
She was wearing a cotton pad last night.

101
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,560
I was afraid that she'd get cold and give her a cold.

102
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,800
She grabbed my hand today.

103
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
She told me...

104
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,880
She told me...

105
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,920
Chen Wu.

106
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,640
Please forgive me.

107
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,640
Chen Wu.

108
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,800
Your Highness.

109
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,360
Your Highness.

110
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,240
You're so thin.

111
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,120
Why are you sleeping on the bamboo mat?

112
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,760
There are a bunch of things here.

113
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
You'll see them in the middle of the night.

114
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,160
Did you look around?

115
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,120
No. Absolutely not.

116
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm afraid that you'll catch a cold.

117
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,180
Mr.

118
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Thank you.

119
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,600
Oh, my bad.

120
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,360
Tell me.

121
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,640
Why is she staring at me?

122
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,800
Aren't you asleep?

123
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
I understand.

124
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,160
Just tell us.

125
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,200
With my pretty baby boy,

126
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,080
I don't get to guess what I'm thinking about.

127
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,400
I doubt that you like Mr. Heng.

128
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,840
This is quietly

129
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,060
dating in the Bamboo Nile

130
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,340
with a happy ending.

131
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,020
Did you ask for this?

132
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,620
Your Highness,

133
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,340
according to this painting,

134
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,840
there are also 300 pieces according to the title of it.

135
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,020
According to what they said,

136
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,180
today, Duan MiSal went nuts.

137
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,140
Sees the odd ones themselves.

138
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
Wait.

139
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,140
Mr. Meng,

140
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,140
the scoreboard of the top is

141
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
as you said.

142
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,140
The scoreboard is in the top.

143
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,140
No need.

144
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,140
I have plans today.

145
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Wang Sishan.

146
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Today, the Crown Princess Consort

147
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,140
is at the Palace of the Cure.

148
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,140
She will personally take the exam.

149
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,140
You must do your best

150
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,140
to prevent the reputation of the Shang's Bureau.

151
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Yes.

152
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,140
My son is very reliable.

153
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,140
He is not good at taking care of the Crown Prince.

154
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
He has to live in the Cure.

155
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
It's also because of you that he is so tolerant.

156
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,140
He can still care about his coldness.

157
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,140
I am very relieved to be his mother.

158
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,140
I am very grateful to you.

159
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,140
I have been very kind to you.

160
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,140
I will be more confident

161
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,140
to take care of you.

162
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
Why are you laughing?

163
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
The Crown Princess Consort is still young.

164
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,140
She can't hear the Crown Princess Consort's words.

165
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,140
She is not asking you to take care of her.

166
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,140
She is asking you to be her son.

167
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,140
No wonder Your Majesty loves you.

168
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,140
You are really kind and kind.

169
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
My son is

170
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,140
smart and kind.

171
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
He is very considerate.

172
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,140
He can't make any mistakes in his marriage.

173
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,140
If he can be a grandson

174
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,140
for His Majesty one day earlier,

175
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,140
that will be a great blessing.

176
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
It's not just the Crown Princess Consort.

177
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
I will try my best, too.

178
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,140
I will never fail you.

179
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
Okay.

180
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,140
Have you heard that

181
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,140
the Crown Princess Consort and the Wucairen

182
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,140
have said that?

183
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
You can't be too generous.

184
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Yes.

185
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,140
They are like wood.

186
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,140
They don't know how to make His Majesty happy.

187
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,140
No one can see them.

188
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,140
Besides,

189
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
His Majesty loves that bookshop.

190
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
It's always there.

191
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,140
I will go to serve him.

192
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,140
He is still in a fight.

193
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,140
If you want to force His Majesty to come back,

194
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,140
why don't you take off that bookshop first?

195
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,140
The nine-letter Wucairen loves to be friendly.

196
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,140
It's not easy to get along with the people

197
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,140
who are in love with him.

198
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,140
I'm afraid that Your Highness

199
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,140
will be scolded by you.

200
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,140
The Imperial Concubine Yu always talks fast.

201
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,140
Please don't mind her.

202
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
His Majesty hates you the most.

203
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,140
Today, the Crown Princess Consort

204
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
invites you to have dinner.

205
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,140
Her Highness

206
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,140
brings us together

207
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
to celebrate the wedding.

208
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,140
You are an elder.

209
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,140
How can you talk to the Crown Prince?

210
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
I can smell the fragrance of your clothes.

211
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,140
I can smell it when I stop.

212
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,140
No wonder they call you a scumbag.

213
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
His Highness said I was too fragrant.

214
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
But every time I see him,

215
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,140
I want to smell it several times.

216
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
He still hates me.

217
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,140
What kind of nose is he?

218
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
I can smell it every day.

219
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
It smells so good.

220
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,140
Today, I invite you to have dinner

221
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,140
and have a feast.

222
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Let's have a good meal.

223
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
Mr. Meng.

224
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,140
Please ask the Crown Princess Consort to come out.

225
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,140
When His Majesty is here,

226
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
we should have breakfast and dinner

227
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
and have a meal.

228
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,140
It's a long-term effort.

229
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,140
Let's have a meal

230
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
and have a meal.

231
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
Yes.

232
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,140
Please forgive me.

233
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,140
I'm late.

234
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,140
Sister, look at you.

235
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,140
You are not even calling me

236
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,140
for the wedding.

237
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
I said I'm not.

238
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
I can't be bothered.

239
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Since you are here,

240
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
you can sit down.

241
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
Mr. Meng.

242
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,140
About this competition,

243
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
Sister,

244
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,140
since you have been in charge of the palace affairs,

245
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,140
you have been eating and drinking

246
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,140
every day.

247
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,140
Why did you

248
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,140
finally set up a banquet?

249
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
You even made such a small fight.

250
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
Mr. Meng.

251
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,140
I'm sorry.

252
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,140
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,140
Mr. Meng.

255
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,140
I heard from the Crown Prince

256
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,140
that you have made a new batch of seafood

257
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
from the Zhejiang Sea Gate.

258
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,140
Today, I'm the one who's the main chef.

259
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,140
We'll use the fish as the main dish

260
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
to make you all

261
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,140
look like gods.

262
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,140
We'll make sure you all eat well.

263
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,140
How about it?

264
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,140
Go and do it.

265
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,140
Yes.

266
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,140
The white tiger flag is coming.

267
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Send it to the kitchen as soon as possible.

268
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,140
I'll do it myself.

269
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
Yes.

270
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,140
It's been weird for a long time.

271
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,140
It's been so long.

272
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
I can't keep it.

273
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,140
Your Highness.

274
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,140
Your Highness.

275
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,140
Your Highness, what a coincidence.

276
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,140
The Crown Prince is in Liangting to make a small banquet.

277
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
His Highness has arrived.

278
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
He's not in the mood to sit down.

279
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Don't move.

280
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
Your Highness.

281
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
Yuanqi.

282
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
The iron line is blue.

283
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,140
The black powder is rich in black.

284
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,140
The smoke is so strong.

285
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,140
It's very rare.

286
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,140
Have you seen it?

287
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,140
I have.

288
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
There's poison in the body.

289
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,140
Your Highness.

290
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
It must be the one who's got the smell of the food.

291
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,140
It's a bit of a secret.

292
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,140
Wucai, don't move.

293
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
If you get the wings,

294
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
you'll be hurt.

295
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
You'll be hurt.

296
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Your Highness,

297
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
the wings are so weak.

298
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,140
Don't panic.

299
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
Wait for me.

300
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
I'll go to the doctor.

301
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,140
Your Highness, go back.

302
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,140
Go back.

303
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,140
They're afraid.

304
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
Wait for me.

305
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,140
Okay. I won't move.

306
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
Your Highness.

307
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,140
You're trying to fool Wucai again.

308
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
What do you know?

309
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,140
If you get caught,

310
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,140
you can't do anything.

311
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
Let's go.

312
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Wucai.

313
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
Why are you here alone?

314
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
The Crown Prince is trying to find you everywhere.

315
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,140
Where is he?

316
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,140
He's far away.

317
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,140
Your Highness, play with the new game.

318
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,140
I'll play with you.

319
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
Go back.

320
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,140
Today's game is a big one.

321
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,140
It's a game of fish.

322
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
Let's start.

323
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
I want this.

324
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
Here.

325
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,140
Tofu.

326
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,140
When I saw the little crown prince

327
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
bringing the pot of potato into the kitchen,

328
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,140
I asked Changqing to ask him.

329
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,140
Then I knew

330
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,140
that tofu is the theme of the Crown Prince.

331
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Lin Ziping.

332
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,140
You...

333
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,140
Don't tell anyone.

334
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
I'm not telling anyone.

335
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,140
I'm telling you.

336
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,140
I'm telling you.

337
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,140
I'm telling you.

338
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
I'm telling you.

339
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm telling you.

340
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
I'm telling you.

341
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,140
I'm telling you.

342
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,140
I'm telling you.

343
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
I'm telling you.

344
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
I'm telling you.

345
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
I'm telling you.

346
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
I'm telling you.

347
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,140
I'm telling you.

348
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,140
I'm telling you.

349
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,140
I'm telling you.

350
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,140
I'm telling you.

351
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,140
I'm telling you.

352
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,140
I'm telling you.

353
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,140
I'm telling you.

354
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,140
I'm telling you.

355
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,140
I'm telling you.

356
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,140
I'm telling you.

357
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
I'm telling you.

358
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,140
I'm telling you.

359
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,140
I'm telling you.

360
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,140
I'm telling you.

361
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,140
I'm telling you.

362
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,140
I'm telling you.

363
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,140
I'm telling you.

364
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,140
I'm telling you.

365
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
I'm telling you.

366
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,140
I'm telling you.

367
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,140
I'm telling you.

368
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,140
I'm telling you.

369
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
I'm telling you.

370
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,140
I'm telling you.

371
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,140
I'm telling you.

372
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
I'm telling you.

373
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,140
I'm telling you.

374
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,140
I'm telling you.

375
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
I'm telling you.

376
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
I'm telling you.

377
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,140

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
I'm telling you.

385
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,140
I'm telling you.

386
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
I'm telling you.

387
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
I'm telling you.

388
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,140
I'm telling you.

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
I'm telling you.

390
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,140
I'm telling you.

391
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,020
I'm telling you.

392
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,700
Meanwhile,

395
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
I'm going out.

396
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,380
it was delicious lean fish.

397
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,380
This is...

398
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,060
In Miss Hui's case,

399
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,500
this is fava fish.

400
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,940
It is lean fish with armors

401
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,620
plus the neck and beginning strings.

402
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,380
It's Halibutous influenced.

403
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,220
I will use it as fine as possible

404
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,780
and slim in weight compactness.

405
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,820
It really tastes so good with light meat.

406
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,620
The Airses are tastier

407
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,620
and more attractive.

408
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,020
It's strange.

409
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
My tongue is full of itch.

410
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,700
I don't know how to feel

411
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,820
the taste of the mountain and the sea.

412
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,980
But I've never felt the taste of the world.

413
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Consort Zhuang

414
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,500
has a unique insight into food.

415
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
How can you touch

416
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,100
the food in the mortal world?

417
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,620
This is the most tender bamboo shoots

418
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,860
I've ever had this year.

419
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,060
This is a bamboo shoot

420
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,820
that I cut into a piece of winter bamboo shoot.

421
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,380
It's made of the freshest bamboo shoots.

422
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,580
Let's go.

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,020

426
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,620
It's a luxury tael of shimmer.

427
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,620
Nar Union does it.

428
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,380
It's nice to have partners in our households.

429
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,020
They're welcome.

430
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,500
What is theGERS?

431
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,620
Your Highness,

432
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,860
I think

433
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,100
the difference between the Three Splendid Horses

434
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,220
was raised by me.

435
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,260
Aren't you theaire from the former mausoleum?

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,600
You are not willing to take care of

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,400
as her father.

440
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,700
Go after her.

441
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:14,980
Don't worry.

442
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,880
Fish aren't limitations,

443
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:29,440
but it's a major goes

444
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,580
to include the stomach.

445
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,900
Okay.

446
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,180
Okay.

447
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,420
The general is a hundred-man general.

448
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,820
He is a hundred-man general.

449
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,940
I've tasted a thousand kinds of sauce.

450
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,300
It's hard to forget when I'm a soy sauce.

451
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,900
Try it.

452
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,620

Nice.

463
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,740
The women

464
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,880
must want to relage the мест

465
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,460
and seek the魚,

466
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,740

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,580
quality at that time

468
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,860
costs their life

469
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,940

470
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,980

to serve the people.

474
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,660
So I'm trying to

475
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,020
add越 nut into the liqueur

476
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,460
to mix them up the rice together.

477
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,380
So they can filmed the rice

in between Lotta and Cicicice.

485
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,720
The queen Stop

486
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,540
from the throne.

487
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,880
The queen

I swear

493
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,740
to you

494
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,940
You have the urgency

495
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,420
to converse with Fahrer

496
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,160
and hire an officer to give her a great appreciation.

497
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,720
The beauty you haven't seen for years

498
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,080
is now a crown prince's mother.

499
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,680
You're too mean.

500
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,160
Concubine Guo.

501
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,160
Your Highness,

502
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,240
the first step is to make the ingredients.

503
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,320
The second is to heat the oil.

504
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,480
The third is to use salt.

505
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,720
The vegetable that was used to make the oil and salt

506
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,040
is acupuncturized.

507
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,240
You all undergo judicial 거ards

508
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,720
to let their printing go,

509
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
and to leave the resume.

510
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,160
Your Highness,

511
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,720
that's a superb comparison.

512
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,880
It's eclipse comparison

513
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
with both er kinetic and magneticmail!

514
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,560
Acupuncture is not too long,

515
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,200
but it's easy to make glue.

516
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,520
It's as Technological's test.

517
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,360
It's about the quality of the turbine

518
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,720
and not the structure of the spherical loaf.

519
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,960
Concubine Guo.

520
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
Don't be too suspicious.

521
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,440
Of course.

522
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,560
The tongue is what Chang Jiayao uses.

523
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,720
The tongue is more mature than the heart.

524
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,240
Fine, fine.

525
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,040
I heard you say that my head hurts.

526
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,360
Consort Zhuang,

527
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,160
Crown Princess,

528
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,280
I'll take your leave.

529
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,960
You won.

530
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,160
Wait.

531
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:32,520
Hoo,

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,720

00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,840
You areAh.

534
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,440
I'm Xiyin.

535
00:29:50,320 --> 00:30:01,080
F여 H steet

536
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,720
I hope they can be free and continue to suffer for the people.

537
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,840
This is a good thing.

538
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,200
The Crown Princess Consort is not strict.

539
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,520
We should do the same.

540
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,720
After I go back,

541
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
how can I deal with

542
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,560
the business of the sister Zhong?

543
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,440
Don't worry.

544
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,360
I'll mention the death sentence.

545
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,040
I thank Your Highness the Consort for her kindness.

546
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
The secret recipe is called

547
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,200
not to eat, not to eat,

548
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
but to do it in a good way.

549
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,160
Whereas this is aught-ago

550
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,520
in the country,

551
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,080
as people live in a safer place,

552
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,820
we want not to be

553
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,520
numeric in內 to stand out to the public.

554
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,300
Bloss consort will no doubt

555
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,960
turn their heads in love and environment.

556
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,320
We humans walk in politely,

557
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,640
we are notaha

558
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,360
but we do выз得

559
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,880
to be observable,

560
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,760
do my little prayer.

561
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,800
I am here to happen the clothes not for a beauty.

562
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,120
What's more,

563
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,960
I promised myself

564
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,200
to make this tofu fish

565
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,600
the most unforgettable taste.

566
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

567
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,600
That Guo Shi

568
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,120
is so kind to you.

569
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,320
He didn't touch your food.

570
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,800
What a pity.

571
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,840
But as a good cook,

572
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,680
I will take good care of you.

573
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,480
Let's go.

574
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,840
You feel empty.

575
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,280
Let's light a stamp encountered.

576
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,780
I don't think so.

577
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,920
It's an honor.

578
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,240
If you just listen to me,

579
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,120
I'll do it for you.

580
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,360
A rare chance for me

581
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,320
to be called hak Об

582
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,800
in another of your life.

583
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,640
That's right, That's right.

584
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,320
I mean it.

585
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,720
He is born into a nun.

586
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,560
Yes.

587
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
The Crown Princess of the Dream has been reported.

588
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
The Crown Prince's Bureau

589
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,680
is still lacking a good-looking man.

590
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,400
Yao Zijin.

591
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,280
You'll be the one to make it up.

592
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,240
I don't think so.

593
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,200
I don't think so.

594
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
I don't think so.

595
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,040
I don't think so.

596
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,640
I don't think so.

597
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
I don't think so.

598
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,240
Ziping.

599
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,880
Ziping.

600
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,960
The dishes were prepared by the Lord of the Night.

601
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,480
Consort Zhu didn't show up.

602
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,120
Only the scented fish and silk

603
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,680
can be used for a while.

604
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,240
The Empress has ordered

605
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,680
that the dishes will be served in time.

606
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,440
These are the rewards for Your Highness.

607
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,680
You can take care of them.

608
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,440
Yes.

609
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,960
Thank you for your reward.

610
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,160
Yes.

611
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,880
Wang Sishan.

612
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,720
The winner is Ziping.

613
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,920
Why did you bring him here?

614
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,520
You mean

615
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,800
you want to make it up to me?

616
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,160
I want to make it up to you?

617
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,960
You don't want to fight for the crown prince's throne

618
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,840
and you don't want to marry the Crown Princess.

619
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,760
You want to make it up to me?

620
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,800
Because Ziping found out

621
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,480
I shouldn't have been the one to make it up to you.

622
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
It's unfair.

623
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,120
If you don't want to make it up to him,

624
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,040
you shouldn't have let him participate in the beginning.

625
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,120
It's so annoying.

626
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,680
Isn't it too hurtful?

627
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,480
How dare you!

628
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,080
Forgive me.

629
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,560
Ziping

630
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,400
has changed his mind.

631
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,160
But he has to beg for it.

632
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,320
I want to make the crown prince

633
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
a chance to make a new person for him.

634
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,360
You're so kind-hearted.

635
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,320
But

636
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,160
your Guozhen will not be here.

637
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,920
But

638
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,440
you're late.

639
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:04,560
Please have a seat.

640
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,560
Do you know

641
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,580
the date is

642
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,280
back at the Grand襲 August Festival.

643
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,480
What a shame.

644
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,000
You look risks matte.

645
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,400
Did I say I should?

646
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,920
Yes!

647
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,560
His kindness

648
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,400
went outside it but he Lamb ran out.

649
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,800
accessible.

650
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,240
How could they recognize him if he doesn't continue to act so formally?

651
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,900
Sincerew

652
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,680
the Yu written by Su Shun.

653
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,580
Happy occasion, take your time to look at your expression.

654
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,040
Teach me a poem.

655
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,600
I always read that word when I'm reading.

656
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,320
Well, go ahead.

657
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,200
You're such a greedy boy.

658
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,040
patterns of taste?

659
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,020
Thank you, knock on.

660
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,020
How can you win

661
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,020
if you only care about the whole game?

662
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
Well...

663
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,020
Your Highness,

664
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,020
what he said

665
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,020
makes sense.

666
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
You've said it.

667
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,220
Yeah.

668
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,020
Court Lady.

Go in.

Go in.

687
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,440
You're out.

You're out.

Go in.

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,160

What happened then?

695
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,520
This's a message from minister.

696
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,520
It was from Imperial Beauty.

697
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,600
Theべur מסoh,

698
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,640

He's too kind.

700
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,360
If he's offended by the beauty,

701
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,760
he'll be punished by the crown prince.

702

You're busy with the affairs of the court.

Your Highness,

764
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,400
Take my cloth first and send it to my father.

765
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,840
Don't mention my presence.

766
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,680
It's just that my grandfather asked him to send the poison.

767
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,520
He will be happy.

768
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,000
Yes.

769
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,040
Han Xing.

770
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,440
Your Highness.

771
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,240
Han Xing.

772
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,160
Your Highness.

773
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,720
Please save me.

774
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,560
Come back.

775
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,640
Your Highness.

776
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,840
Your Highness.

777
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,600
Don't touch me.

778
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
Please save me.

779
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,280
Okay.

780
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,080
Your Highness.

781
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,800
Your Highness.

782
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,440
Your Highness.

783
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,120
Your Highness.

784
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,080
What happened in the palace?

785
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,320
I'll help you find it out.

786
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,680
Go.

787
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,640
Your Highness.

788
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,200
Your Highness.

789
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,880
Your Highness.

790
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,520
Your Highness.

791
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,240
Your Highness.

792
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,040
Fortunately, His Majesty was well-off.

793
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,560
His Majesty was alert and alert.

794
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:45,920
His Highness...

795
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,560
Your Highness.

796
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,480
Something happened.

797
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,560
His Highness was in a hurry.

798
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,760
The jade seal was in the jade.

799
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,880
It implanted many concubines.

800
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,920
They were kidnapped by the jade seal.

801
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,600
They were rushed to Yongning Palace

802
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,680
because of the jade seal.

803
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,720
They took Li Zhao Yi away.

804
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Even Consort Zhuang was killed.

805
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,520
Your Highness.

806
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,600
Li Zhao Yi was really involved.

807
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,000
His Majesty loves Consort Zhuang so much.

808
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,800
How could he even kill her?

809
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,760
What a beauty.

810
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,520
She killed her husband.

811
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,920
If she didn't have the jade seal,

812
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,920
who would believe her?

813
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't know how many innocent people

814
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,840
are going to be implicated this time.

815
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,520
As of today,

816
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,880
prepare to be buried.

817
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,480
If anyone asks,

818
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,520
they will be denied.

819
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:33,920
Yes.

820
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,480
Don't worry.

821
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,520
Let's take a look at this thing

822
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,120
so that Consort Zhuang might be death.

823
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,840
Looks like they lost their bourgeoisie.

824
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,760
We can't compare.

825
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,200
Where could the empress be hiding?

826
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,340
with the Marvin Palace Duke's

827
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,200
It seems Prince forex hurtona would bear witness.

828
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,320
You must set the law.

829
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,000
No matter how much you keep it,

830
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,680
I'm afraid that you can't wait for the imperial court

831
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,200
to starve to death in Yongning Palace.

832
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,080
Who dare to go inside?

833
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,080
It's useless.

834
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,280
I'll go.

835
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,720
Mr. Meng, please allow me to try.

836
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,180
Little Brother Zai.

837
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
Little Brotherocation!

838
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,400
Little Brother Zai,

839
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,680
I'm happy for a second.

840
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,640
Zai,

841
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,440
you've suddenly recovered.

842
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,720
What,

843
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,880
is this medical guidanceTalking me about it?

844
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,880
But I have a heart that can't be suppressed.

845
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,880
How can we go in?

846
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
You can't get in when you are in time.

847
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,880
This way.

848
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,880
Go. This way.

849
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
Grandpa Huang.

850
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
You are here.

851
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,880
I heard that you have established a military base

852
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,880
for the soldiers of the world.

853
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
Good job.

854
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Grandpa Huang.

855
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,880
I have something to say.

856
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
Do you want to tell me

857
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,880
that the city is now searching for the thief

858
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,880
in the palace?

859
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Yes, grandpa.

860
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,880
I respect them.

861
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,880
You don't think they are people?

862
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
I think

863
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,880
the city is too secure

864
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
because of the situation.

865
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,880
I am a commoner in the imperial family.

866
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,880
I am not filial.

867
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,880
I am self-sufficient.

868
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,880
The people are hard to understand.

869
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
I order them to check the officials.

870
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,880
Then they will go to the farm

871
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,880
and get the oil and grass in the field.

872
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Then someone will be greedy and take the money.

873
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,880
The master is independent.

874
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,880
Someone will be against the people.

875
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,880
The people will be named

876
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,880
on the road.

877
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,880
I am a commoner in the imperial family.

878
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,880
