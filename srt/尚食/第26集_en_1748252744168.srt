1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm a little bit tired

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm a little bit tired

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm a little bit tired

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm a little bit tired

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm a little bit tired

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm a little bit tired

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm a little bit tired

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm a little bit tired

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm a little bit tired

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm a little bit tired

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm a little bit tired

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm a little bit tired

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm a little bit tired

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm a little bit tired

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm a little bit tired

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm a little bit tired

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm a little bit tired

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm all in dreams

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:56,520
Worldth

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,940
Your Highness.

21
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,480
My lady,

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,320
I had a restaurant

23
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,300
at your house

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,640
in order to conduct decision making.

25
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,480
I couldn't crack it easily.

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,040
You have already pointed out

27
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,040
all of things.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
I have been heart- Toad拜拜 for thirty times.

29
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,480
Toad and Chilly genaer.

30
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,880
I think

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,480
it is better to appoint our Bey.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,840
You have to lock her up often

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,840
and let her

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
be around the wor?​

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,880
And properly serve her

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,420
Father

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,080
Since you value her

38
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,520
we should leave her at the precinct

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,080
and gain her your concern

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,520
Even If Your Majesty make any Wil

41
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,340
His Majesty asked you to watch the child

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,460
You see

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,060
he is

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,820
the great nobleman of dice

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,800
who served his��니 for the well epis

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,840
It's him!

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,600
Mother,

49
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,080
you promised me before.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,480
Your Majesty, you finally remembered it.

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,000
In fact,

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,920
I should have reported it to you earlier.

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,200
But the kid is so stubborn.

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,680
I thought

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,800
I should have let him practice more in the upper court.

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,960
I was wrong about the cause.

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,400
I was wrong about him.

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:21,920
Your Majesty,

59
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,400
you can't be rude in front of me.

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,160
I never lack people.

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,480
I should choose him.

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
I should choose him myself.

63
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,480
Besides,

64
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,160
I don't like him.

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,480
Zhan Ji,

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,560
the late emperor always loves you.

67
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,920
You don't respect the late emperor's order.

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,640
He is the one who has been praised.

69
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,200
Is there anything wrong?

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,480
Good.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
Well said.

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,920
This is the destiny of the heaven.

73
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Good!

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,520
I hardly can be

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
screened.

76
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:00,960
Well,

77
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,360
you should hole up

78
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,760
on time first.

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

80
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,280
I can't do that.

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,400
Speaking of that,

82
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,760
let's have bet.

83
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,520
I will.

84
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,440
Father.

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,160
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,960
Your Majesty.

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,960
You're in a bad mood.

88
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,000
Even if I go back now,

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,520
I can't rest assured.

90
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,360
Let me go to the market.

91
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,800
Congratulations, sister.

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,760
You may all leave.

93
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,720
Mother.

94
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,920
You promised me

95
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,440
that you wouldn't mention it again.

96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
Why did you want to save Chongtian again?

97
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,080
Are you well?

98
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,120
Do you really not believe what he said?

99
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
You fell for something?

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,040
Are you going to kill him

101
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,160
so that he may sense something about freedom?

102
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,560
Sweet talk about your retention

103
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,120
is selfish.

104
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,560
But your family members

105
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,600
have their mind blank.

106
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,640
Their plans were לה groups

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,040
just because they were late.

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
You're not as healthy as before.

109
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,960
You should be worried about yourself.

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
Do you have the courage to serve him?

111
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,400
I'll take my leave.

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,920
Nothing can save the heroine.

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,600
As anything he wishes for,

114
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
when he personally speaks,

115
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,960
when he has just one look,

116
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,000
no one dares to accept the cure,

117
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,880
kneeling,

118
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,080
giving his foot to take care of him.

119
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,760
Don't forget

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,040
the things we do

121
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,880
for love and our own happiness.

122
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Don't הב assured andness take over.

123
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
It's nothing like

124
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,120
a stop-force for us.

125
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,280
When did he start to say

126
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,320
something like that?

127
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
about what happened in the palace today.

128
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,960
Take the secret letter to Le Anzhou.

129
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,800
Yes.

130
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,000
You can leave first.

131
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,200
Yes.

132
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,760
I've already asked you to do what I did.

133
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,000
His Majesty is in a hurry now.

134
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
This is a big crime of the Zhu Jiu Clan.

135
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,680
If His Majesty is ill,

136
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,120
the news of the Crown Prince's departure is spread to Le Anzhou.

137
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,840
What do you think

138
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,160
the wild and wild prince will do?

139
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,000
You want to rebel?

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,520
Sorry.

141
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,680
It's because the prince of the prince of the prince is rebel.

142
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,280
Rebellion?

143
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,160
What does it have to do with you?

144
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,080
What?

145
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,520
Are you afraid?

146
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,480
In this capital,

147
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,560
the only person who has ever cared about me is no longer here.

148
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,680
This can't be compared with both of them.

149
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,560
What does it have to do with me?

150
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,360
It's just that I don't understand.

151
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,080
During the long다, you're still executehighly called

152
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,240
and His Majesty would功 Nikki's trust in you.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,560
What do you actually want?

154
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,040
You mean

155
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,640
you wanted tookay the people

156
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,840
as the King of the dead as the soul of your life?

157
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
I'm afraid that he can't make it

158
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,200
well in the war.

159
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
my life.

160
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,100
Cheers

161
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,740
Music

162
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,240
salty flour

163
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:48,840
percarbonation

164
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,020
May I?

165
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,440
Your honor

166
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,600
Your honor

167
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,360
Take it

168
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,000
ack

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,180
Expose it.

170
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,560
Ying Zicheng.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,440
and the dumplings and noodles.

172
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,240
I've never heard of

173
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,000
sending you the medicine.

174
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
You're not eating it?

175
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm not eating it.

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,560
Recently,

177
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,320
my mother once said

178
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,000
her future has failed because the inherent potential is covered in nonsense.

179
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,520
The future of the world begins with the need for jewelry.

180
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,880
Then what's so sought after?

181
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,640
I have a saying,

182
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,040
that when all things are six feet,

183
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
don't start with the jeweled heart every day.

184
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
My mother once said

185
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,960
I heard someone say so much.

186
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,000
Ten words.

187
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,720
Stop spouting nonsense.

188
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,120
I know you don't understand.

189
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,160
Ziping.

190
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,360
It's like what I said.

191
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,240
I'm going to be the one who is going to be the consort of the grand consort.

192
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,440
That's the heaven's will.

193
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Later, they said that the consort of the grand consort is someone else.

194
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't have the responsibility behind it.

195
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,400
I don't care about it.

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I don't care about it.

197
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I don't care about it.

198
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,280
But I don't care about it.

199
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Even if I get the chance to be the one who is destined to die,

200
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,480
I'm thinking if I can fight with my life.

201
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Moreover,

202
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,280
the world is big and people are all together.

203
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,840
I'm the only one who is not afraid of the world.

204
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,920
I need to grow up in the heaven.

205
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,600
I can't be the one who is destined to die.

206
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,200
Then I'll go to the place where I can go.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,520
Do what I can do.

208
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,520
You're still thinking about the consort of the grand consort.

209
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,320
Don't think about it. Don't touch it.

210
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,920
That's the will.

211
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,800
Who said that the will can't change?

212
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,600
You're just a small Crown Prince.

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Who said that I can only be a Crown Prince in my life?

214
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,560
You...

215
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,160
Ziping.

216
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
Someone said that I can't hide from it.

217
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,240
I can't avoid it.

218
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,800
Fine, I won't hide from it.

219
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
The Nichen family who was abandoned

220
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,760
was released.

221
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,720
There's nothing to be afraid of.

222
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,160
You can be the confident and sure to provide Hayne's assistance.

223
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,840
Hold it.

224
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:43,840
Your Highness.

225
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,680
Don't worry, Your Highness.

226
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,560
The wound

227
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,200
ots up very well by há governments for a few days.

228
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,440
Yi.

229
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,780
It must be the amidst realm.

230
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,160
Find me toゆ% for him tomorrow.

231
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,720
Well...

232
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,180
Just leave.

233
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,820
Yes, Your Highness.

234
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,320
Your Highness.

235
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,060
While I left, there's no use.

236
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,920
His Majesty gave me great credit.

237
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,300
He won't embarrass me.

238
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,780
In order to save your health,

239
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,300
His Majesty wouldn't be so cruel.

240
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,180
It's not for that.

241
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,180
I...

242
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,340
I've been drunk

243
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,780
and had a talk with Tong Liao.

244
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,900
I don't know how

245
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,580
I got to know the emperor of the Donggong Palace.

246
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,220
Father has always been generous.

247
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,860
He rarely touched me.

248
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,980
What did you say?

249
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,340
Let me be honest with you.

250
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,100
Just look at him

251
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,220
and結 first.

252
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,500
This sickness for a millions of years

253
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,540
will lead to internal hardships.

254
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,660
Just think of it.

255
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,140
It reminds me of

256
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,200
your friend,

257
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,700
who lied to you in public.

258
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Besides,

259
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,660
since you've喊

260
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,140
the emperor's name on his way,

261
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,100
you're ashamed of it!

262
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:21,720
Let go.

263
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Your Highness, it's late. You should go out.

264
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,040
You can leave now.

265
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
Your Majesty doesn't want to see me.

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,640
I don't know what I did wrong.

267
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I'm sorry.

278
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
You always think about the magic plan.

281
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Why don't you talk now?

282
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Your Highness,

283
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,640
it's not the time to worry about the emperor.

284
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,640
The real disaster has been revealed.

285
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
You mean...

286
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
It's impossible.

287
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,640
His Majesty is in charge of the top of the world.

288
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
He will be back to the palace soon.

289
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Your Highness,

290
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,640
the emperor's aura is not good today.

291
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
How is he?

292
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,640
He is in good health and is in good health.

293
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
You are so smart.

294
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
You need to remind me.

295
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Your Majesty.

296
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
I hope you can rest in peace

297
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
and be kind to Your Highness.

298
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
If not,

299
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Your Highness,

300
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
please have a seat.

301
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Your Highness.

302
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Your Highness.

303
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Your Highness.

304
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Your Highness.

305
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Your Highness.

306
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Your Highness.

307
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Your Highness.

308
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
Here is the gift of the emperor.

309
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
Your Highness.

310
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Your Highness.

311
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Your Highness.

312
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,640
Your Highness.

313
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Your Highness.

314
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Your Highness.

315
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,880
This palanquin

316
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,360
will be on itsان

317
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,000
for...

318
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Xianshijiu

319
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,760
is an immortal

320
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,120
from world to man.

321
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,120
Unlike likely to be a virgin long ago,

322
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,480
Yichun is right.

323
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,080
If the Heaven Guards

324
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,520
were on the side of the earth,

325
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,080
you could not be one of them.

326
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,200
xeshiji

327
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,800
Prince Consort,

328
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,680
it doesn't make sense.

329
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,320
Q spaces 10

330
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,360
Xianshiji

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,640
Qin specially trained

332
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,000
in front of you.

333
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,640
curator

334
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,240
Qin,

335
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
基本.

336
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,840
I won't celebrate

337
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,960
with Hundred Feet of Jins.

338
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Because it is not enough

339
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,000
for the butterelse king

340
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,200
to come back from today,

341
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,400
he didn't do

342
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,720
as I had hoped.

343
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,040
Your majesty,

344
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,800
what are you doing?

345
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,440
Why did you turn your head

346
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,880
suddenly?

347
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,360
It is said that

348
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,840
the letter

349
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,400
I'm a sister of the Yi family.

350
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,960
I don't need to be so polite.

351
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,200
The court is tired.

352
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,800
Go back and rest.

353
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,120
You

354
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,720
must take good care of Crown Prince.

355
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,400
Yes.

356
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,800
How do you feel?

357
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,960
What must I have done to deserve this?

358
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,040
I'll have great pleasure in my life.

359
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,720
Good.

360
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,160
More than that?

361
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,240
No, thanks.

362
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,640
Don't worry.

363
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,800
Thank you.

364
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,000
Isn't it sent by His Highness

365
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm waiting for you in the hall.

366
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,080
Your Highness.

367
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,720
Your Highness.

368
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,720
What's wrong?

369
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,160
Your Highness, where are you going?

370
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,560
The crown prince is still waiting.

371
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,680
Your Highness.

372
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,880
Where are you going?

373
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,240
The crown prince is still waiting.

374
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,020
Don't send me up!

375
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,300
What's all this mental awaiting?

376
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,040
Done.

377
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,280
Not funny.

378
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,320
You held too hard.

379
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,040
Very weakum.

380
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,680
If you lay down at here,

381
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,040
it'll happen that

382
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,320
you can't keep your clothes still.

383
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,760
Why is Your Highness here?

384
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
It's been so long.

385
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,280
Why don't you let me be your friend?

386
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,400
Your Highness, you can't drink.

387
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,480
You still have a wound.

388
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,440
People say that

389
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,720
the wine is a bit too much for a drunkard.

390
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,720
It's better to drink alone.

391
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,600
But it's rare to meet a commoner.

392
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,400
I like it.

393
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,040
Your Highness, you can't drink today.

394
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,920
I am Fanzhou.

395
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,860
All right.

396
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,040
Fanzhou,

397
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,240
I saw a dancers on the smoked ensemble.

398
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,560
You're so beautiful.

399
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,560
Pre kills me.

400
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,120
Your Highness.

401
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,560
I refuse to do so.

402
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,400
Take cover in the air.

403
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,880
Intro

404
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,080
Once again

405
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,760
Come.

406
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,000
I've seen your move.

407
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,440
How dare you!

408
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,120
Your Highness,

409
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,560
you're injured again.

410
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,840
What should we do?

411
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,080
I'm innocent.

412
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,200
I'm sorry for your loss.

413
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,560
It's just a mistake.

414
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,480
I'm not guilty.

415
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,400
How could I blame you?

416
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,200
Get up.

417
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Your Highness, you're generous.

418
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,760
I'm grateful.

419
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,920
But you just said...

420
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
I've seen your move.

421
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,320
Since I got here,

422
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,240
you've been in many moves

423
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,760
for the sake of His Highness and His Majesty.

424
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,640
Whether it's Yan Zheng,

425
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,800
Cao Yun,

426
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,760
Shui Fa,

427
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,400
the navy and military forces

428
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,160
are all involved.

429
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,040
And they're all in the same boat.

430
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
They're all in the same boat.

431
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,440
It's a pity

432
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,600
that they've been thrown aside.

433
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,160
No one is serious about it.

434
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,920
Look at the two of us.

435
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,680
We're not even in the same boat.

436
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,760
When you're fully recovered,

437
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,120
we'll fight again.

438
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,520
Yes.

439
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,160
Your Highness,

440
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,240
you've lost weight?

441
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,440
Is your arm hurt?

442
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,400
Your Highness.

443
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,560
Your Highness.

444
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,280
Volatilizing.

445
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
The King of the City wants to help you.

446
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Please take a look at the official news.

447
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,960
My Lord, it's so late.

448
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Where are we going?

449
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,800
Let's go out.

450
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,480
Eunuch Chen,

451
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,400
why are you late?

452
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,120
Please tell the Crown Prince

453
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,560
that you are in a bad mood.

454
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,440
You are in a bad mood.

455
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,360
You are in a bad mood.

456
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,880
I'm afraid you can't come.

457
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,320
Please take care of yourself.

458
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,880
Crown Prince,

459
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,240
you can't do that.

460
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,480
Don't worry.

461
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,360
His Highness will be back soon.

462
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,160
Your Majesty,

463
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,000
you are always filial.

464
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,200
You are always in a bad mood.

465
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,760
Now,

466
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,920
you are in a bad mood.

467
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,360
The Crown Prince won't come.

468
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,520
You should go back and rest.

469
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,400
I said I won't let you fight.

470
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,000
You are not to fight.

471
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,680
The Imperial Physician has already taken care of it.

472
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,640
You can't fight until you get the chance.

473
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,640
You are still drinking.

474
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,320
Imperial Physician Sheng,

475
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,480
are you all right?

476
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,760
Your Highness, you are well.

477
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,480
You need to rest for a while.

478
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,160
You are so loud.

479
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,200
I'm telling you, Your Highness,

480
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,800
he knows you are in a bad mood.

481
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,120
He wants to compete with you.

482
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,960
After His Highness returns,

483
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,320
I will report to His Highness

484
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
that he is guilty.

485
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,920
That's right.

486
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,920
I'll take my leave.

487
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,960
Your Highness,

488
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,680
or you should rest doing your lunch now.

489
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,560
Raise it already.

490
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,080
It's late at night.

491
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,880
Your Highness,

492
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,200
I have been ill.

493
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,400
Did it upset you?

494
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,400
No.

495
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,120
Did you say anything?

496
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
No.

497
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,240
You didn't say anything?

498
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,360
Your Highness,

499
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,320
the Crown Prince's ceremony was a mess.

500
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,360
He was tortured for a few days.

501
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,520
He was tortured for a few days.

502
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,960
He was waiting for you tonight.

503
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,360
I'm afraid he couldn't bear it.

504
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,640
He's taking a rest now.

505
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,240
What do you know?

506
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,640
Don't talk nonsense.

507
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,640
His Highness hasn't returned.

508
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,120
He'll be waiting for tomorrow.

509
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,160
He'll be waiting for tomorrow.

510
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,240
He'll be waiting for tomorrow.

511
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,120
Your Highness.

512
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
Your Highness.

513
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,680
Your Highness.

514
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,040
Go on.

515
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
I thought you were cold-hearted.

516
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
I didn't expect

517
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,440
you didn't even look at me.

518
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,760
What are you thinking?

519
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,160
Please go upstairs quickly.

520
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,520
Okay.

521
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,360
Why do you keep looking at me?

522
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,360
is the best thing that happened last night.

523
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,560
Last night?

524
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,520
Now, in the Eastern Palace,

525
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
except for the Crown Princess Consort,

526
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,960
you are the highest.

527
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,880
Other people come to visit you.

528
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,920
I have already ordered the Imperial Court

529
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,000
to prepare the banquet.

530
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,720
Jin.

531
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,360
You used to be the old lady by Consort Zhuang's side.

532
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,000
Now, the Empress asks you to serve me.

533
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,520
Don't you feel wronged?

534
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,360
The game of the Emperor You four batter.

535
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,560
OF BYZ PяNE——

536
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,040
When my husband asked for a house in the sweep,

537
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,960
wouldn't it be you take it out for yourself?

538
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,680
They are fearful that they can't move anywhere.

539
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,360
Thus I, servant, am far away from mourning.

540
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,480
The Empress is going to welcome me in the Eastern Palace this morning.

541
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,440
I'll do that in progress.

542
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,040
If you have done anything wrong,

543
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,400
I will cut positive from the harshness.

544
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,320
material and formal.

545
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,880
It's too early.

546
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,320
Just prepare this visit.

547
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,360
I'm afraid it's not as good as your will.

548
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,640
It's okay. You go.

549
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,120
Yes.

550
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,560
Ah Jun.

551
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,720
Prince Ping.

552
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,360
Are you ready?

553
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,200
Ah Jin.

554
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,760
Yes.

555
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,160
Leaving first.

556
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,080
Yes.

557
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,080
Yourras.

558
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,320
He is right.

559
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
You're more practical than that.

560
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:05,960
If you see him here,

561
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,560
you will be glad

562
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,560
for him.

563
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,280
I'm sorry.

564
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,040
I'll leave it to you.

565
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,200
You're welcome.

566
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
If you want to,

567
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,320
I can't turn down your family's opinion.

568
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,600
You need to strategize.

569
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,760
Why won't you abandon yourself?

570
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
This letter indicating

571
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,440
what Xitong said

572
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,040
why did you bring it over there?

573
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,220
I agreed to it and

574
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,680
He hasn't come here.

575
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,160
He hasn't come here?

576
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,280
How come?

577
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,120
He hasn't come to see you.

578
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,480
You haven't gone to see him?

579
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,960
You haven't been together yet?

580
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,520
I know.

581
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,080
What's the matter, Jin Da?

582
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,080
The Empress of the court

583
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,480
forced you to enter the palace.

584
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,680
Even the crown prince was sick and hated you.

585
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,600
That's why you agreed to marry him.

586
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,920
You should torture him

587
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,040
for a lifetime.

588
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,720
Right?

589
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
I can't sit here.

590
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,880
I'll be so rude

591
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,840
to you later.

592
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,560
I'm not like you.

593
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,400
Let's go.

594
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,500
Your Highness.

595
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
Today...

596
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,520
Stay at your senses.

597
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,920
Today you are gone with me.

598
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,960
How dare they require you to please me?

599
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,520
It's weird.

600
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,440
You have a blow

601
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,160
and you've burnt out.

602
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm sorry.

603
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,000
You created all theseonds for me.

604
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,720
Good.

605
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,200
A royal gift is pretty much like that,

606
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,760
only taken by Could Ji.

607
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,320
If you are using this as a military edict,

608
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,520
then do as Royal Noble Consort Ma said,

609
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,300
well then,

610
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,600
don't ever approach me with this Lukwaova method again.

611
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,700
Nothing.

612
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,240
I should ratherチ儿子听 than make foot tour videos.

613
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,440
I need your advice.

614
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,260
You know,

615
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,180
I'll use the soup of the golden flower soup.

616
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,540
And the vegetables and the marigolds.

617
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,500
You usually bring the servants to eat together.

618
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,020
You can't change the mood.

619
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,420
It's easy to get into the courtyard.

620
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,820
When I'm not around,

621
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,020
be careful of the flowers.

622
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,940
I don't need to worry about you.

623
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,420
You're the one who should

624
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,660
think of a way to make the Crown Prince happy.

625
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,340
If you want to stay in the Eastern Palace for a long time,

626
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,140
you can't let anyone

627
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,020
to protect you.

628
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,940
But...

629
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,620
Crown Princess Consort,

630
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,380
they don't seem to be in love with you.

631
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,140
Miao Xian,

632
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,460
you haven't gone to visit the Crown Prince today?

633
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,740
Crown Princess Consort,

634
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,460
Yuan Shuai is going to follow the new rule

635
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,100
to be in love with the Crown Prince.

636
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,620
It's just that

637
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,220
the sunset is very tender.

638
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,860
Miao Xian,

639
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
tomorrow morning,

640
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,820
I'll go to the Crown Prince to apologize.

641
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,780
Did you hear that?

642
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,660
Crown Princess Consort,

643
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,500
I didn't mean to force you.

644
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,980
He really doesn't smell

645
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,460
the firewood on the mountain.

646
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,100
What firewood?

647
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,220
The city is burning with firewood.

648
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,340
It's burning with firewood.

649
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,660
Who dares to enter his body?

650
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,460
Maybe the Crown Prince is not satisfied with it.

651
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,460
He's not even satisfied with the wind.

652
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,620
Your Majesty.

653
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,500
I'm sorry for···

654
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,220
I'm sorry?

655
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,340
It's okay, Your Majesty.

656
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,460
Be honest.

657
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,060
Crown Prince is in the Crown Prince's plenty?

658
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,260
Is that true?

659
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,340
Before His Majesty and Her Majesty

660
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,500
would offer him mercy.

661
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,500
such a person

662
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,420
speaking so fragrantly of you.

663
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,300
Basically,

664
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,700
I didn't have lots to ulterior for.

665
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,380
Not because of

666
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,620
that,

667
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,700
it is better for you to

668
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,500
take Control Einstein.

669
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:12,180
It will make you feel more relieved,

670
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,460
with some cozy constructing on the��

671
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,460
is too promising to prove stupid vires.

672
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,740
You still have the art of doing that?

673
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,420
I'll ask to perform cultural bosom miejsce the next day.

674
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,620
You say that isn't the remnant of Crown Prince ,

675
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,620
so we'll go and make a offer.

676
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,300
I've taken it.

677
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,980
You've taken it?

678
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,140
What did you say?

679
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,380
What else can I say?

680
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,020
It must be a great thank you.

681
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,260
I didn't see it.

682
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,060
You didn't see it either?

683
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,220
Well,

684
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,300
the crown prince rewarded the crown prince.

685
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,060
That's why he protected him.

686
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,500
If the crown prince knows,

687
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,020
it must be a great thank you.

688
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,460
But I was not lucky when I went there.

689
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,420
I was afraid that His Highness would be anxious.

690
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,780
So I rushed back to my life.

691
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,220
But if the crown prince is so lucky,

692
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,420
he will definitely come to thank him.

693
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,220
Crown prince,

694
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,580
you haven't been out to thank me.

695
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,500
It's not a rule.

696
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,140
If His Highness knows,

697
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,900
he will...

698
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,700
He will...

699
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:46,100
take me to the palace again.

700
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,620
It's been an hour.

701
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,100
The palace guards have been looking for me.

702
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:54,020
Once they are out,

703
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,180
it's not a big deal.

704
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,620
No wonder

705
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,140
the reward is not the right time.

706
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,540
I'm not the right time.

707
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:08,860
Your Highness.

708
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:09,660
Jin.

709
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:10,700
Your Highness.

710
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,260
Yes.

711
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:11,860
Get out.

712
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:12,900
Don't touch me.

713
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,700
Yes.

714
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,180
Jin.

715
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,460
Your Highness.

716
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,980
Please wait outside.

717
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,780
I'll be back soon.

718
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,060
I have something to ask.

719
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,020
I'll leave after I finish.

720
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,620
What do you want to ask?

721
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,220
Your Highness.

722
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,260
I don't want to ask anything now.

723
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,540
Jin.

724
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:38,500
I want to stay.

725
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,780
Go get ready.

726
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,180
Jin.

727
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:44,700
Jin.

728
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,460
Jin.

729
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,540
His Highness is unwell.

730
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,580
The imperial physician has ordered you to rest well.

731
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,220
If I let His Highness stay tonight,

732
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,340
he will be taken away by Her Highness the Empress tomorrow.

733
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,500
Don't worry.

734
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,540
I won't blame you.

735
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,500
I hope you can be my friend.

736
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,980
I'll be back soon.

737
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,020
I'll be back.

738
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,940
I'll be back.

739
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,940
I'll be back.

740
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,900
I'll be back.

741
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,940
I'll be back.

742
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,940
I'll be back.

743
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,940
I'll be back.

744
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,940
I'll be back.

745
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:26,940
I'll be back.

746
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,940
I'll be back.

747
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,940
I'll be back.

748
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:29,940
I'll be back.

749
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,940
I'll be back.

750
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,940
I'll be back.

751
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
I'll be back.

752
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,940
I'll be back.

753
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,940
I'll be back.

754
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,940
I'll be back.

755
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,940
I'll be back.

756
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,940
I'll be back.

757
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,940
I'll be back.

758
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,940
I'll be back.

759
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,940
