When Li Yuchi spoke of His Majesty,

111
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,900
His Majesty was furious.

112
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,180
He was killed by the military affairs.

113
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,700
He was lucky to die.

114
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,780
Now he's in the Imperial Court.

115
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,340
No one will dare to mention this matter again.

116
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,540
I'm afraid that His Highness will be worried.

117
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,820
What did he say?

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,380

125
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,380
His Majesty wasn't poisoned.

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,860

won't be allowed to pretend.

144
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,460
It must be he who will remember

145
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,860
such turn off.

146
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,820
We don't need him.

147
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,060

153
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,460
collective rage,

154
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,580
Wang Zihui, the second child,

155
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,780
attacked the palace from the east gate

156
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,420
and secretly byライ voux to arrest Li Sh Acho.

157
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,620
From the East Gate,

158
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,300
I saw it once again

159
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,380
and realized it.

160
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,500
Do you know what you did to Taotian?

161
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,500
Didn't you hear what His Highness said?

162

You always came to me.

you can only say two words

166
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,380
when you see the crown prince.

167
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,260
Your Highness.

168
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,740

I just

177
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,620

It's too much.

186
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,420
It's a loyal official.

187
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,980
What about the memorial?

188
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,500
His Majesty was furious.

189
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,660
He burned the fire.

197
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,020
No documents were read.

198
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:25,880
There are a lot of public�� reporting

199
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,580
in the palace.

200
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,540
As you should know,

201
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,980

202
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,060

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,780

the you canít do it.

206
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,400
There are three more

207

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,740
It islerini who will

209
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,120
die.

210
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,140
For example,

211
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,660
I portrait a piece of my death

212
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,740
Your Highness.

213
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,820
Foreman Zuo,

214
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,420

215
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,500
I assume

216
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,900
you haven't you had the same condition.

217
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,500
You are breaking down.

218
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,660
It doesn't matter were I going.

219
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,540
You go.

220
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,060
There is no one to warm up.

221
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,860
That's great.

222
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
Be careful!

223
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
Such a great method.

224
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,860
You're still young.

225
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,860
Your Highness, His Highness is going to free Noble Consort Guo from the state affairs.

226
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
Noble Consort.

227
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Your Highness, His Highness has freed you from the funeral.

228
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,860

The reviews of the shares of all the things you want to do.

231
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Then you use the ummine and categorical parts of the analysis set.

232
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Like patrol of acquaintances and acquaintances.

233
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,860
Hello to you by my husband my wife and my life depending on you.

234
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,860
It's so beautiful.

235
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,860
It's like a blue-blue rose.

236
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,860
It's so good.

237
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,860
It tastes exactly like the one my grandmother made.

238
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,860
It's so good.

239
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Your Highness.

240
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,860
You're thinking of Lady of the Silver Kingdom?

241
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,860
What Lady of the Silver Kingdom?

242
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
Since I was pregnant,

243
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,860
I was exposed to the sword and the hair.

244
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,860
I was killed by the evil.

245
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Then, the Guo family lost their lives.

246
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,860
He had more than ten wives and sons.

247
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,860
My father was weak and unwell.

248
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
No one cared about us.

249
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Once, my father was seriously ill.

250
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,860
I was in the house for two days.

251
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,860
Then, my grandmother carried me back.

252
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,860
My grandmother ordered him to change clothes in winter.

253
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,860
He gave my father a medicine.

254
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,860
At night, I saw my grandmother crying alone.

255
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,860
Do you know why?

256
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,860
Because she cut her hair long and long.

257
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,860
She didn't want anyone else.

258
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,860
Because she lost her hair for the sake of the old man.

259
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,860
She cried and cut her hair.

260
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,860
She couldn't save her son's life.

261
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,860
Then, I started to enter the Eastern Palace.

262
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,860
The Qi family was in the 20th year of the Ying family.

263
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
I didn't want the Guo family to have a long life.

264
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,860
I only wanted my grandmother to be safe and sound.

265
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
I wanted them to remember that

266
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,860
their wealth and wealth

267
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,860
were all my money.

268
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,860
I wanted them to share my grandmother's wealth.

269
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,860
I wanted everyone to see the miracle.

270
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,860
I wanted them to bow down to me.

271
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Twenty years.

272
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,860
Twenty years.

273
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,860
Only one step.

274
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Only one step.

275
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
Your Highness.

276
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,860
Your Highness, Your Highness Wei Young is kneeling outside for a whole day.

277
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Your Highness the Crown Prince asked her to rest.

278
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,860
She will come to the White Sword tomorrow.

279
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,860
You two can finally be together.

280
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Why did you help me?

281
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,860
It's a terrible fate.

282
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,860
It's not a good thing to be apart.

283
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
It's a good thing to be apart.

284
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
You are a kind person.

285
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
You are smart.

286
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,860
Remember.

287
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
The road ahead is long.

288
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,860
You must live well.

289
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,860
Your Highness the Noble Consort.

290
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,860
You should rest early.

291
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I will come to the White Sword tomorrow.

292
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,860
Your Highness.

293
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
The White Sword.

294
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,860
Crown Prince Pin.

295
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Isn't that your servant?

296
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,460
You're the one who came out of Kunning Palace.

297
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,700
Why would I be a bad person?

298
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
Your Highness,

299
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,020
I came out of Kunning Palace

300
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,020
but I never hurt you.

301
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,940
I'm afraid of being implicated.

302
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,980
I'm just afraid.

303
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Your Highness,

304
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,100
you've promised to kill Noble Consort Guo.

305
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,940
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

306
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,100
Keep on reading.

307
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
Your Highness,

308
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,340
Noble Consort Guo

309
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,340
has gone to the battle with Liang.

310
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,640
Maybe I will come more often.

311
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,620
I must go.

312
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,300
Don't be afraid.

313
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,300
Song Xiao of Kunning.

314
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,680
These biographies

315
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,900
and Rhodic Drums

316
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,700
are all freshly baked.

317
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,020
I'll cook them as soon as possible.

318
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,540
affectionate lesions.

319
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,460
Why is it that my mother has been disfigured?

320
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,980
Why?

321
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,820
Brother Yu is not well.

322
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,580
Brother Yu, what should I do?

323
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,300
My parents and mother are gone.

324
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,860
What should I do?

325
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,540
Don't worry.

326
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,900
Is my brother still here?

327
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,380
As long as brother is here, no one will hurt you.

328
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,180
Send him back to the palace.

329
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,020
Yes.

330
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Let's go, Your Highness.

331
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,100
Your Highness, your decree has been sent to Qingning Palace.

332
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Why is it that Noble Consort Gu is here?

333
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:46,900
The Emperor's Residence

334
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
In June, the Emperor's Residence,

335
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,900
the Empress Dowager Zhu,

336
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
and the Emperor's Imperial Noble Consort

337
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
were all granted to the Emperor.

338
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
The Empress Dowager Zun Zhang

339
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
was the Empress Dowager.

340
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,900
She was the Empress Dowager Li,

341
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
and the Empress Dowager Hu.

342
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,900
The Emperor was the Emperor of Ming.

343
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:23,300
The Empress Dowager Zun Zhang

344
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Long live the Emperor!

345
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Long live the Emperor!

346
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,160
Chenellin.

347
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,940
In other words,

348
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,440
Xiao Ya's and her master are carrying death spies.

349
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,200
The paintings must be lifted at Nie's and Guang's levels.

350
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,040
and estão to be concubines.

351
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,800
The other mitä

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,920

353
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,800

357
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,400
best.

358
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,520
His Majesty's position

359
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,000
is not Knight簡 quickly.

360
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,040
His superpower

361
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,640
I also want to ask Mother to decide with His Majesty.

362
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,200
I also know what Mother means.

363
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,720
My dear viewers,

364
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,040
what else do you want to say?

365
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,640
His Majesty has ascended the throne.

366
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,960
Lord Han and King Zhao

367
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,280
used to come to the palace to congratulate him.

368
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,840
His Majesty has rewarded them

369
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,960
for their wealth and wealth.

370
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,040
The wealth of Ewen

371
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,720
is also wisdom.

372
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,280
Now Lord Han

373
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,480
worships so many people of An State

374
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,360
that His Majesty is going to nård his messenger again.

375
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,880
With the acknowledgements in his heart,

376
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,920
he is going to abandon this.

377
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,280
Your Majesty,

378
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,800
what's wrong with his嘲 when he does such a deed?

379
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,440
The citizens of Yu

380
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,400
figure out all of it.

381
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,800
He is always snowy-skinned

382
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,080
and is in despair.

383
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,760
ונd he isuestas

384
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,680
to say that it's useful for the people of the country.

385
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,500
I'm willing to do whatever I want.

386
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,680
Please listen,

387
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,120
myprint testemple

388
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
and me

389
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,280
have the same tendency

390
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
to be a skills TT,

391
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,380
but it's difficult not to deliver

392
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,340
using contempt and resentment

393
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,400
for her.

394
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,220
But now both of us

395
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,260
is finally doing well!

396
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,080
We don't need to talk so much about

397
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
her age,

398
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:52,940
in the future,

399
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,660
in my opinion,

400
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,220
No one is allowed to mention it.

401
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,260
Your Majesty is wise.

402
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,380
Senior Brother.

403
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,620
Senior Brother.

404
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,140
I'm concerned about Prince Han's situation.

405
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,140
I have something to tell you.

406
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,660
You must remind His Majesty

407
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,260
that I'm the spy of Prince Han.

408
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,060
Yes.

409
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,180
Why are you hiding behind?

410
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,140
Come and talk to me.

411
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,700
Sorry, I'm old-fashioned.

412
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,140
You've seen

413
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,700
the beautiful face His Majesty drew.

414
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,380
The nose is sharp and the chest is sharp.

415
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,260
There is a way.

416
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,460
He will understand

417
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,060
what you should say.

418
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,620
Yes.

419
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,220
Don't worry.

420
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,620
You're a man.

421
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,140
Let's go.

422
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,620
Let's go.

423
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,500
Prime Minister.

424
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,740
Your Highness.

425
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,660
Your Highness.

426
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,780
Greetings, Han.

427
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,820
Greetings, Han.

428
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,580
How have you been all of these years?

429
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
What do you think of yourself?

430
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,860
When I read the court officials'

431
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,020
condition of His Highness,

432
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,020
His Majesty didn't recognize him.

433
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,260
Instead, he isasters Hannah,

434
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,820
who liked the books and your great enormous kindness.

435
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,220
Even the fact that he saw the same emperor as her

436
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,100
segued his breath in beautiful scenery and 10 degrees-heated view

437
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,100
After all, Lord Han is his uncle.

438
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,100
I wonder where he is.

439
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,300
Please tell me.

440
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,500
You're right.

441
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,100
His Majesty is trying to get him to know this.

442
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,300
Zhang Deye is here.

443
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
Please show me your hand.

444
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,500
I understand.

445
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,500
Lord Han wants to take a group of soldiers.

446
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
What did Father say?

447
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,140
His Majesty doesn't want to see me

448
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,700
and order me to go to the capital

449
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,100
to find your opinion.

450
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,900
Promise him.

451
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Then, I...

452
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,100
Zhu Zhanji is the emperor.

453
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,700
The court is on the surface.

454
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,700
He's using the court.

455
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
To me,

456
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,900
this is a good time to start a rebellion.

457
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Tell me.

458
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,300
Don't worry about the winter wind.

459
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,900
Yes.

460
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

461
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,700
The Empress Dowager has been following me.

462
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Father's martial arts is old-fashioned.

463
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
He ordered me to lead the whole palace.

464
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,300
I want to help the Empress Dowager to re-establish the palace rules.

465
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
So, I can't manage the imperial court.

466
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,300
Everything here is a matter of...

467
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,300
temporarily...

468
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,500
Emperor.

469
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,500
Crown Prince.

470
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Crown Prince.

471
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,900
Open the coffin.

472
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,500
Second Young�.

473
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,500
Prince FONIP Ginger.

474
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,260
White girlbird.

475
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,700
I'm like this after I'm in the room.

476
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,620
Now, I'll get prepared.

477
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,020
She's here.

478
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,120
You're dressed the right way.

479
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,680
Out of this cut,

480
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,600
we'll wait for

481
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,980
Team jobbar quirky,

482
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,140
such as hero or hope who

483
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,660
denies he wants to be.

484
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,060
Wu Bu had to be sent to the palace first and then executed.

485
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,900
Now our dream palace is in the sixth grade.

486
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,060
No.

487
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,460
It should be the most dangerous woman in the whole of the capital.

488
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,900
Every time you come to my house, you're always looking so scary.

489
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,620
Am I that scary?

490
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,140
Empress Dowager misunderstood.

491
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,260
Do you think

492
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,260
I'm the one who forced Noble Consort Guo to be buried?

493
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,980
Empress Dowager asked me.

494
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,980
The house is also very quiet.

495
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,940
Noble Consort Guo

496
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,140
has always been in the heart of the mother and the daughter-in-law.

497
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,660
Their relationship is very deep.

498
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,620
That day,

499
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
when my wife entered the palace,

500
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,940
she would be killed

501
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,940
if she went to the cold peach.

502
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,300
You've already taken over the power.

503
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,900
Why do you have to force yourself?

504
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,860
She is the most beloved woman in the late emperor.

505
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,340
She also brought the most fatal harm to the late emperor.

506
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,940
So,

507
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,220
I sent her to accompany her.

508
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,740
Then will Empress Dowager really let Guo Shi

509
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,980
bury the body?

510
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,060
Will her body be buried in the jade forest?

511
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,620
I have no right to ask Empress Dowager to forgive Guo Shi.

512
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,580
But you can let her leave the palace

513
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
and guard the forest.

514
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,100
Even if she committed suicide,

515
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,500
it's not that she forced her to bury it.

516
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,020
It's all a matter of death.

517
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,340
It's already a tragedy

518
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,300
to bury the dead body.

519
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,180
Everything is now fated to be buried,

520
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,500
so no textmie even wondered in the manor.

521
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,100
Now when they opened theUSS and took over the height,

522
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,940
though your location is fated to be detected,

523
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,060
it's fair to serve.....

524
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,060
Youray is emperor's eldest,

525
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,340
ユヾヱユネ當卖不用看着

526
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,260
you copy thehes tasty life.

527
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,740
Guo Shi rend his concubine's芯  venny and poured his healing-dego poems to the court.

528
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,820
The chief, King Tang and rumors of King Western premium Records state are realization.

529
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,240
Now that he is leaving,

530
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,080
What about His Majesty?

531
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,600
He would feel sad.

532
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,440
Look at your eyes.

533
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,360
You are still hiding it.

534
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,580
If you wanna♥

535
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,680
merch out then.

536
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,580
female.

537
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,580
You...

538
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,980
I dare not.

539
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,540
A long time ago,

540
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,220
I guarded my husband,

541
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,780
my son

542
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,980
and the imperial harem,

543
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,700
but I can't

544
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:31,940
protect the bunu

545
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,540
and the citizens of this life.

546
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,380
His Majesty, your son

547
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,100
and you.

548
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,860
And

549
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,980
most of the women in the palace.

550
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,100
Even if you have the right to do anything,

551
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
you still have to

552
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,700
be a family member.

553
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,500
Fine.

554
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,380
You can't do anything.

555
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,380
So,

556
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,540
as long as I'm alive,

557
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,820
I have nothing to say to you.

558
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,420
OK.

559
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,620
Next week.

560
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,660
It's so disappointing.

561
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,060
Actually,

562
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,540
literally,

563
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,540
So you shouldn't have let down your hope.

564
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,540
From now on, you shouldn't have any thoughts.

565
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Are you angry?

566
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,540
I was hurt by others.

567
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,540
I have the right to be the one who destroyed others.

568
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
Why?

569
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,540
I have decided that we can only live one person.

570
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,540
Where is the root cause?

571
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,540
The ancestral letter from the Crown Prince's emperor

572
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,540
has been written on the seal of the funeral.

573
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,540
But the royal family is in a different state.

574
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,540
They are in a different family.

575
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,540
How many innocent people will be buried in this world?

576
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,540
How can they be so innocent?

577
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,540
Do you think you can change this?

578
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Not yet.

579
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Now?

580
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
Yes.

581
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
Hua Ping.

582
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
Your Highness.

583
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Look.

584
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
There's someone who wants to make you his own.

585
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
Master.

586
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,540
Life is slow.

587
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
How can it be so smooth?

588
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,540
But I don't know how to make up my mind.

589
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
I can do it myself.

590
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,540
I can sell my weapon from the beginning.

591
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
Master.

592
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
Master.

593
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Are you done?

594
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,540
Yes.

595
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,540
It's not right.

596
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
Your Majesty.

597
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
What's wrong?

598
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,540
It's not right everywhere.

599
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
Come and help me.

600
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,540
Guiling Mother.

601
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
Guilin Mistress.

Is it finished?

615
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,180
Your Majesty, don't move

616
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,820
You can't draw well.

617
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,260
Your Majesty.

618
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,580
Take a look.

619
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,340
Do you look like

620
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,460
she is vibrant!

621
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,460
And she is good and brave,

whether she is beautiful or communicate with people.

623
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,040
If you can draw like this,

624
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,320
what outside may make you attractive?

625
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,380
This one's meaningless.

626
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,860
I like it.

627
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,900

Thank you, Your Majesty.

633
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,740
Maybe I can be more humble.

634
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
I'll make a manor for you.

00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900

Greetings to Your Majesty.

663
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,780
His Majesty wishes to relocate Agreed Empress Consort Sun.

664
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,280
Sure.

665
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,900
At that year, demand the crown мой Minister Almighty

666
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,900
to appoint Crown Princess Consort Sun before you came.

667
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,900
the courier of His Majesty,

668
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
insisted not杵位 into state under the civil blow themselves.

669
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,900
it's such a pity that you were portions of special power with his majesty.

670
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,020
After she married off

671
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,860
the two of them for various reasons.

672
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,260
Is

673
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,660
Sun Family having a grudge with her?

674
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,380
Mother, you know I'm not mistaken.

675
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,140
Our son

676
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,820
has no grudge with Sun family,

677
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,140
but his ownüss.

678
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,820
On Gauzhai's condition,

679
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,500
I should announce

680
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,220
the newly appointed guest to marry off her.

681
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,540
First,

682
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,940
I'll consider this matter.

683
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,900
Why?

684
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
You're not happy?

685
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Mother,

686
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,900
I have nothing to do with it.

687
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Please wait a moment.

688
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,900
I heard that in the concubines of the Sixth Palace,

689
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
you have been very kind to your grandson.

690
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
You're not a kind person.

691
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
Isn't that so?

692
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
My grandson is kind and kind.

693
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
He has a lot of potential.

694
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
I can't let him

695
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,900
be too generous.

696
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,900
But I won't let him

697
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,900
be too impulsive

698
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,900
and make trouble.

699
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Mother, don't worry.

700
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
The concubines of the Sixth Palace

701
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
are not ordinary people.

702
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,900
They are ordinary people.

703
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,900
My grandson is

704
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,900
a natural person.

705
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,900
Zi Jin is here.

706
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Let him in.

707
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Your Majesty.

708
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,900
Your Majesty.

709
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,900
Get up.

710
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

711
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,900
His Majesty is very kind.

712
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,900
I won't keep you.

713
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
Let Zi Jin stay

714
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,900
and talk to me.

715
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
You may go.

716
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,900
Yes, Mother.

717
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
I'll take my leave.

718
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,900
Mom.

719
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
Your Majesty.

720
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,900
Your Majesty.

721
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Mother.

722
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
His Majesty asks you to have breakfast with me.

723
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
Please take me back to Your Majesty.

724
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
After all,

725
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
I'm a little ugly.

726
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,900
I'm not gentle.

727
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,900
I won't be able to see Your Majesty's eyes.

728
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,900
And,

729
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,900
let Your Majesty

730
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,900
take other sisters.

731
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
Anyway, the women in the harem are the same.

732
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,900
You're a traitor.

733
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,900
Master, look.

734
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,900
The fresh meat, white meat,

735
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,900
five people,

736
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,900
egg yolk, lotus root,

737
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,900
and other things are all prepared.

738
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Are you going to

739
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,900
send them to Qianqing Palace now?

740
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,900
I won't send them.

741
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,900
In the past years,

742
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,900
the masters of the harem

743
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,900
will send the members of the Qianqing Palace to the group.

744
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,900
What are you doing?

745
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,900
I'm just going to send them to the group.

746
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,900
I'm just going to send them to the group.

747
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,900
I'm just going to send them to the group.

748
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
What are you doing?

749
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,900
Which one is better?

750
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,900
The ten-pointed autumn

751
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,900
is the best for the red-colored wedding.

752
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,900
You're going to send them to the group.

753
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,900
I'm going to send them to the group.

754
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Here you are.

755
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,900
Thank you, sister.

756
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
How is it? Do you like it?

757
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,900
I like it.

758
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,900
Sister,

759
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,900
how did you

760
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,900
embroider

761
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,900
the flowers' edges?

762
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,900
This is made with gold threads.

763
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:04,900
If you like it,

764
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,900
I will teach you next time, okay?

765
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,900
Okay.

766
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,600
I will treat you to some traditional clothing.

767
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,780
Sure.

768
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,080
My dear.

769
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,100
Shall we send someone to send the dukes to Qianqing Palace?

770
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,640
Isn't that person the sweetest gesture of the burden?

771
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,340
Even if my hand is on the allowed-nail bridge,

772
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,080
it's not better than them.

773
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,360
Why should we waste our time on it?

774
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,620
or this one?
