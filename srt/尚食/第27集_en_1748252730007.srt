1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The world is full of light and light

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The whole world is full of light

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The whole world is full of light

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The game is a bit short and boring

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The game is a bit short and boring

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The game is a bit short and boring

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a bit short and boring

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The game is a bit short and boring

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The game is a bit short and boring

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a bit short and boring

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The game is a bit short and boring

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The game is a bit short and boring

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The game is a bit short and boring

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The game is a bit short and boring

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Section 5

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Section 6

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,580
At the showroom there is a road

19
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,000
At the showroom there is a road

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,640
I petals you

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,480
Cut me one pickle

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,980
Your Highness, I would not dare

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,460
Talking about the

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,560
Honey,

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,160
it's over.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,760
Over the god,

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,960
what each person has right now

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,160
will

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,040
allow

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,720
him to be poisoned.

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,880
Ü記得

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,800
He is Hikaru contacting my boss

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,040
Your Highness, you're a person.

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,480
You won't blame me.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,320
You can't let Liu Yan

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
hurt His Highness's reputation.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
After all,

38
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,040
if His Highness's injury is recovered,

39
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,240
His Majesty will surely urge His Highness

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,560
to go to Nanjing.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,200
You know a lot.

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,160
I'm fully committed

43
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,400
to your interests.

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Are you angry?

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,720
All right.

46
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,240
Jin.

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,920
Keep talking.

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,760
His Highness will be in a hurry tonight.

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,080
Yes.

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,920
Stop.

51
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,520
Crown Prince,

52
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,520
have a good rest.

53
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,800
I'll go back now.

54
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,720
Your Highness,

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,560
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,760
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,200
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,200
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,400
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,400
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Your Highness.

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,800
Your Highness.

84
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
Noble Consort Guo has been in the Palace for three days.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,600
His Majesty is finally soft-hearted.

86
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
Good news.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,600
Your Highness, the banquet this year

88
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,000
is due to His Majesty's illness.

89
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
Your Highness, please do the prefectural office.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,200
Noble Consort Guo is going to

91
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
prepare the banquet for you personally.

92
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,800
What do you think she meant?

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Your Highness.

94
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,000
Your Highness.

95
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Your Highness.

96
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,200
Your Highness.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,200
Your Highness.

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,200
Your Highness.

99
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Your Highness.

100
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Your Highness.

101
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,200
Your Highness.

102
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Your Highness.

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,200
Your Highness.

104
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Your Highness.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,200
Your Highness.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
Your Highness.

107
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,200
Your Highness.

108
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,200
Your Highness.

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,200
Your Highness.

110
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,200
Your Highness.

111
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,200
Your Highness.

112
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,200
Your Highness.

113
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,200
Your Highness.

114
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,200
Your Highness.

115
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Your Highness.

116
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
Your Highness.

117
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Your Highness.

118
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Your Highness.

119
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
Your Highness.

120
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,200
Your Highness.

121
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Your Highness.

122
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
What's wrong with these two?

123
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,200
They're all empty in the room.

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Are they going to the garden to enjoy the flowers?

125
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
How come they can't even see the ghost?

126
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Master.

127
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,000
I sent someone to watch them.

128
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,000
I found...

129
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,000
Here.

130
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,840
Here.

131
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
They've farmed up.

132
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
The Crown Princess Consort wasted so much luck

133
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,800
on herying her sinister death.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,200
She should noggin here.

135
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,120
But you know, Princess Dowager

136
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,200
loves to do which is a灣 so much.

137
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,200
She won't do nothing for your highness.

138
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,360
She has kept in touch with them

139
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,320
I like to be quiet.

140
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,640
I love to be warm.

141
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,640
I don't like to be high and low.

142
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,880
I can do whatever I want.

143
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,320
I don't know what to do.

144
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,520
Crown Prince,

145
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,560
come and have a look.

146
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,400
No need to be polite.

147
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,400
Sit down.

148
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,120
Zhao Cai Ren.

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,520
Look.

150
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
Let me see.

151
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
Try this line.

152
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,960
This spot.

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,280
This spot can need less side lines.

154
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,920
Come.

155
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,880
What's wrong?

156
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,900
Crown Prince, as I knew,

157
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,400
everybody says the嚴 Families are sweet.

158
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,400
They love eating dalgona.

159
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,400
Come over.

160
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,540
Come on over.

161
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,480
If I could come on a ode to you,

162
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,680
of course I can come

163
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,360
Come on

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
Can't wait to see you

165
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,360
It's like a new home in the town.

166
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,760
Wu Cai Ran,

167
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
you said it yourself.

168
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,600
You won't be in the Crown Prince's shoes.

169
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,000
And you won't forget Yan You.

170
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,680
Am I that kind of person?

171
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
A thief with a good home

172
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,360
is worth buying me?

173
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
The fox lives in the fox's house.

174
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,520
He's so sweet to me.

175
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,400
He sees that I like this scent.

176
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,600
He'll be mad at me next time.

177
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,160
I won't be mad at you.

178
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,360
Let's go.

179
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
You mean

180
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,680
Noble Consort Guo wants to take care of the Empress' birthday?

181
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,160
Yes.

182
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,000
You're right.

183
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,560
Noble Consort Guo has always been in love with His Majesty.

184
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,120
She won't let the Empress in.

185
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Now she's in a bad mood.

186
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
Oh, no.

187
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,600
The cold is cold.

188
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,960
It's not a day's cold.

189
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,960
When the forest is gone,

190
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,720
it's hard to get back to the old love.

191
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Besides,

192
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,080
Yongning Palace and Kunning Palace

193
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,400
have never had any old love.

194
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,680
Some people

195
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,960
are destined to be together.

196
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,320
Your Highness,

197
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,560
although the Empress ordered to avoid the birthday celebration,

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,240
you can't just give it to her.

199
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,480
When will you give her the gift?

200
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,800
What do you think

201
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,800
she'll give you?

202
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll go and ask.

203
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
You don't need to go.

204
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,120
Someone will go.

205
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,560
Crown Prince Ping,

206
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,600
the Wuca people are here.

207
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,000
Let him in.

208
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,960
Crown Prince Ping.

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,440
Be careful.

210
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,120
You're so clumsy.

211
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,040
Crown Prince Ping, what are you doing?

212
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,280
He likes the dried orange scent yesterday.

213
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,720
I called him the scent.

214
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,040
Crown Prince Ping, don't be weird.

215
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm reminding you.

216
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,680
His Highness doesn't like the scent of the dried orange.

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,400
Usually, girls like the scent of the powder.

218
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,760
He'll be unhappy.

219
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,600
But I like it.

220
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,960
It's because the Eastern Palace is not as good as yours.

221
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,600
It's because you like it.

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,280
This is my residence.

223
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,760
I'm burning my favorite scent.

224
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,120
His Highness doesn't like it.

225
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's go back to his study.

226
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,920
Jin.

227
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,600
You try it yourself.

228
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,480
I'll go there.

229
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Why are you here?

230
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,480
I...

231
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,480
This is my house.

232
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,000
It's the autumn of Her Highness's empress.

233
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
Although Her Highness has been free from the help,

234
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,120
we want to go in.

235
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,600
So you're here to show your kindness.

236
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,520
Are you going to sign the coronation?

237
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,800
Mo Mo.

238
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,400
Crown Prince Ping, the imperial doctor told me

239
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,040
that you're not good at using force

240
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,480
to cure the illness.

241
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,520
It's good that you're here.

242
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,600
Don't forget what you said in front of Crown Prince Ping.

243
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,520
You've been trying to change the whole thing.

244
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,920
If you're so stubborn,

245
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,080
I'll do anything for you.

246
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,200
What's the point of playing the piano?

247
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,880
When you're in a good mood,

248
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,520
you can also play the piano.

249
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,360
Most of the time, you're just standing in your own palace.

250
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,240
You can play the piano in the hall.

251
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,760
Jin.

252
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,000
There's no need to appreciate the people.

253
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,000
As for us,

254
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,920
we can go anywhere.

255
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,880
We can sit in the warm room,

256
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,200
listen to them talk,

257
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,080
play the piano.

258
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
It's so interesting.

259
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,920
Maybe we can be lucky

260
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,800
to have the chance to see His Highness.

261
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,760
What about His Highness?

262
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,920
Look at your appearance.

263
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,720
By the way,

264
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,680
Crown Prince Ping is kind and kind.

265
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,080
Do you treat him well?

266
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,440
He's just a traitor.

267
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,960
His Highness likes to play the bird and water.

268
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,480
He doesn't care about anyone else.

269
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,400
Does he?

270
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,040
I'm happy for him.

271
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,400
He even eats the head of a tiger.

272
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
His Highness doesn't like to be in a hurry.

273
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,240
He doesn't like to be too strong.

274
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
He said that women are always

275
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,520
in the palace and don't like to be in the palace.

276
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,440
Especially, the women are noisy.

277
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,800
They always have a lot of trouble.

278
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,040
His Highness doesn't like to be in a hurry.

279
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,560
He did everything for himself.

280
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,080
Let's wait and see.

281
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,160
He'll regret it.

282
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,080
Wucairen.

283
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,040
Wucairen.

284
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,760
You didn't pay attention to him.

285
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,720
You want to take me back now.

286
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,400
No need.

287
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,280
Don't you like the scent of the orange?

288
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,360
Isn't it the orange?

289
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,200
Is there no one in the room?

290
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,080
He's a trouble maker.

291
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,720
He's the one who forced you to like it.

292
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,520
He sent the orange from the orange box

293
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,440
and made it out.

294
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,920
I sent it here.

295
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,720
You...

296
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,480
I'll take my leave.

297
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,160
Master, where are you going?

298
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,960
They're going to send Wu Dan Tuo to the Empress.

299
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,360
They can't let them do what they want.

300
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,280
Go and get Cai Zifei.

301
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Your Highness is in a difficult situation.

302
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm worried.

303
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,240
I thought that the one who sent the message

304
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,240
to the family would give you a prescription.

305
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,160
Eunuch Chen.

306
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,480
The prescription was sent out

307
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,160
only after the Crown Princess was taken three nights.

308
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,360
The prescription is special.

309
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,040
It needs to be used for a long time.

310
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,600
Once the medicine is gone,

311
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,880
the medicine will be gone.

312
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,680
Who's new?

313
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,480
Make the medicine to the specialist Jang.

314
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,080
You're a risk killer now.

315
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,480
If you could use the prescription again tomorrow,

316
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,520
I'll come later.

317
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,640
Never mind.

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,840
Use the medicine I've done to your wound.

319
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,320
Doctor Sheng is kind of a perilous person.

320
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,160
But the family has his own kind.

321
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,600
My grandfather came from abroad

322
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,440
I have no choice in her.

323
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,600
I always force myself to walk away

324
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,080
and avoid the wind.

325
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,280
Much better now.

326
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,960
Yes.

327
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,960
Any other storm?

328
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
Mother mountains Autumn in the next month.

329
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,600
But herSecret father is ill.

330
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,680
refuses to hold around such matter.

331
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,200
And needs no concubinemade in the palace

332
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,960
to give gifts to His Majesty.

333
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,320
I originally thought

334
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,960
I should teach a person to crafts beige

335
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,080
or run hot emperors.

336
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,200
This really trêsnh the becoming of my mother

337
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,560
like that.

338
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,000
However...

339
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,700
After what happened before,

340
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,600
His Majesty misunderstood me

341
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,040
but now Sun remains a piece of paper.

342
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,200
Those unpleasant things

343
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,920
has finally beenHz used their innocence.

344
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,120
But now,

345
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,200
heMy Holy Treasures

346
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,880
hold my Mother's handwrit.

347
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,320
I'm afraid that she's filial to her family

348
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,200
and has been against the mother's will.

349
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,520
Why don't you go and persuade her?

350
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,240
She'll be fine as long as she's with her.

351
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,000
Look at you.

352
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
Is your sister still blaming you?

353
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,440
Yes.

354
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,600
If anyone has such a memory,

355
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,200
it's hard to get rid of her.

356
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,720
Your Highness, don't worry.

357
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,280
You're always the one who's growing up.

358
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,920
You're always so carefree and carefree.

359
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,120
You should be more considerate

360
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,160
and give her more time.

361
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,120
Your Highness,

362
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,840
if you want to see Crown Prince Ping,

363
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,080
I'll go and do something else.

364
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,480
Why don't you go there?

365
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,120
He never tells me the truth.

366
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,320
Your Highness,

367
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,240
that's a person from the Cao family.

368
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,720
He probably didn't see you.

369
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,760
If he saw you,

370
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,080
he would have come to see you.

371
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:11,960
Let's go.

372
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,600
The red lotus is so pretty.

373
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,560
No,

374
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,160
it's better that Crown Prince Ping drew it.

375
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,280
It's so pretty and fresh.

376
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,480
It's so beautiful.

377
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,800
The color of the leaves is too bright.

378
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,680
It's too sweet to be true.

379
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,320
It's all your fault.

380
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,080
You have to use this color.

381
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,640
It's a good painting.

382
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,440
What's wrong with you?

383
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,160
You're standing here.

384
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,480
They can't see it.

385
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,880
Look.

386
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,080
Mr. Wu.

387
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,600
Don't.

388
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,600
Mr. Wu.

389
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,320
I'll save you.

390
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,560
Have you seen it?

391
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,600
Since Crown Prince Ping entered the Eastern Palace,

392
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,000
they've been to his shop all day.

393
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
They're always making trouble

394
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,000
when they're talking about female workers.

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,120
There's no rule.

396
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,640
Your Highness.

397
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,040
They're calling for you.

398
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,520
You're not doing this for him?

399
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,280
I...

400
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,240
I just want to see

401
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
what kind of rules they can make.

402
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,960
Your Highness.

403
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,360
Just take care of them.

404
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,160
Your Highness.

405
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,400
Master.

406
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,560
You seem to be in a hurry.

407
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,720
What should we do?

408
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,240
It's better if you're in a hurry.

409
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,360
His Highness is not in a hurry.

410
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,720
Take him back

411
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
and take care of him.

412
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,040
Okay.

413
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,800
Sure.

414
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,040
Yantan.

415
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,000
Why are you here?

416
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,800
Come in.

417
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,360
Your Highness.

418
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,880
Your Highness.

419
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,120
Your Highness.

420
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,920
Your Highness.

421
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,360
Your Highness.

422
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,320
It's okay.

423
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,560
Close your eyes.

424
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,640
Hurry up.

425
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,720
Close your eyes.

426
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,160
Your Highness.

427
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,160
I'll give it to you personally.

428
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,800
Don't give it back to me

429
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,480
for the rest of your life.

430
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,520
I...

431
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,080
I don't know how you truly feel for me,

432
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,720
but I've never felt

433
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,320
any bad feelings for you.

434
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,640
I don't expect you to have the same heart as me.

435
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,440
I hope that one day,

436
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,880
you'll be able to be with me forever.

437
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,440
Your Excellency.

438
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,640
Where have you been?

439
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,200
I've been looking everywhere for you.

440
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,200
I have a report from the south.

441
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,240
Court Lady Supervisor

442
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,920
For something so important,

443
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,240
won't we share your result?

444
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,960
Now?

445
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,200
Yes,

446
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,480
now!

447
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,040
Yes.

448
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,120
Your Highness,

449
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,320
I need your help

450
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,760
for one thing.

451
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,040
You need my help?

452
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,960
I'm helping you.

453
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,440
I'm sorry.

454
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,640
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,160
I'm sorry.

456
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,440
Your Highness.

457
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:35,960
Your Highness.

458
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,360
Your Highness.

459
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,760
Come in.

460
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,200
Your Highness.

461
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,680
Your Highness.

462
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,680
The news just arrived

463
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,840
in this我aayese.

464
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,480
The emperor has a plan to summon�

465
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,440
Let's go to the construction office.

466
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,040
But your wound...

467
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,760
Don't go.

468
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,560
Your Highness.

469
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,560
Go.

470
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,360
Zi Jin.

471
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,080
I'll tell the state

472
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,600
about what you said.

473
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,240
Don't worry.

474
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,080
Greetings.

475
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,180
Let's go.

476
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,020
His Highness hasn't come back

477
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,420
this late at night.

478
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,220
Please stay here tonight.

479
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,520
Yes.

480
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,720
Zhuzi,

481
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,840
thisSurely will be left to you by Her right.

482
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,840
Ai Kazuya,

483
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,120
you can go fetch it.

484
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,320
Yes.

485
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,360
Miss 옮

486
00:25:47,360 --> 00:26:10,100
White Black

487
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Every group has a life of its own.

488
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Little helper, please take a look at the top 10.

489
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
The King of the Crown Prince

490
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
Episode 1

491
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,480
I wonder if the Crown Prince is in the south.

492
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Sister Fang,

493
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
are you concerned about the safety of the Crown Prince

494
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,480
or are you worried about Mr. Chen's safety?

495
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
Don't talk nonsense.

496
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,480
The official office is responsible for the unregistered letter to the officials.

497
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
One of them is the official official of the Majesty's position.

498
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
He specially ordered us to prepare it for him.

499
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Are you ready?

500
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
I'll find the official official.

501
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
I'll leave now.

502
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Here.

503
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,480
You two go and cook the new rice.

504
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
One more.

505
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Have you prepared the birthday banquet

506
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
for the Empress?

507
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
Yes.

508
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
You finally finished it.

509
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
I didn't have to work hard to make the rice.

510
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I was tired and tired from the work.

511
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
You're good.

512
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
You can make the rice with your own effort.

513
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
You can make two more.

514
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
Sister Wu, you're here.

515
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
It's a strange saying that

516
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
the great master is loyal to the new source.

517
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
At the same time, the Yanli Mudan

518
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
is really different from the different painters.

519
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
It's really a different story.

520
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Someone said that the skill of making the rice

521
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
is really good.

522
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Okay, I'm sorry.

523
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Stop it.

524
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Look.

525
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,480
Three pearls were put in the white Mudan.

526
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,480
The color is bright and the brightness is outstanding.

527
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
This is my chance.

528
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
I have my chance.

529
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
Be careful.

530
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
This is the birthday gift

531
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
I want to thank the Empress.

532
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
What are you doing?

533
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
Go.

534
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,480
I'll go see the crown princess.

535
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
Let her have her way.

536
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Let go of me.

537
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
You're so stubborn.

538
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
You only talked about it.

539
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
That's why you're so stubborn.

540
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
You're responsible for it.

541
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
You and the others are all responsible for it.

542
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Why are you blaming me for it?

543
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Crown Prince, look.

544
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
The gold ring.

545
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Beautiful.

546
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,480
Here is your contracts.

547
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Last night, I've sorted it out.

548
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
There's nothing we can find.

549
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
The Mudan will be destroyed.

550
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,480
What will happen in the front yard

551
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
after the Empress doubles the birthday pleasure?

552
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Princess.

553
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
It's too quossipful to take it today.

554
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,480
You're solly and elegant.

555
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Surely I'm not smart, right?

556
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,240
You...

557
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,240
какое?

558
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,360
Aren't you going to eat something?

559
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Smell it.

560
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,500
Your Highness.

561
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,880
I wish the Empress a joyful and happy life.

562
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,100
Here.

563
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,540
Sit.

564
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,400
Mistress,

565
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,380
this is the portrait Prof. Magu handwritten by a concubine

566
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,680
by Her Highness,

567
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,980
Songhertziu Teaching Xiupandat in Nanyang.

568
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,300
and enjoy your life.

569
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,420
Okay.

570
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,940

He doesn't give himself any credit.

703
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,840
So,

704
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,440

What do you mean?

726

I was young and ignorant.

727
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,680
I was impolite.

728
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680

I dare not forget Your Highness's forgiveness.

743
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,680
Yesterday, His Majesty signed the decree

760
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,680
I'm sorry.

761
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,680
I'm sorry.

762
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680
I'm sorry.

763
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,680
Your Highness,

764
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,680
I'm sorry.

765
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,680
I'm sorry.

766
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,680
I'm sorry.

767
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,680
I'm sorry.

768
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,680
I'm sorry.

769
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680
You're so pitiful.

770
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
Your Majesty,

771
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,680
why are you here with Sheng Nu?

772
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,680
That bastard Li Shi Mian

773
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
is a traitor.

774
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680
He's just a traitor.

775
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
It's just a cup of wine.

776
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
It's just a cup of wine.

777
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
It's just a cup of wine.

778
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
You're so pitiful.

779
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
Your Majesty.

780
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,680
Your Majesty.

781
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
Your Majesty.

782
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
Crown Prince Pin,

783
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
what happened?

784
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
That's the imperial guards.

785
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
Your Majesty.

786
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
Your Majesty.

787
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
Hurry.

788
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,680
Hurry, Crown Prince.

789
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,680
You know the wind is blowing.

790
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,680
Why are you panicking?

791
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,680
Crown Prince.

792
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,680
Please.

793
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,680
Eunuch Liu.

794
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
You even handled the court affairs.

795
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,680
Why did you go to Yongning Palace

796
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
and come back?

797
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
Your Majesty, you need to rest in peace.

798
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
How can you be so upset?

799
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,680
The morning dance was played by Li Yushan.

800
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,680
His face was so pale

801
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,680
as he was angry.

802
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Stop.

803
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,680
I have to go and serve him.

804
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,680
I'll see you later.

805
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,680
Who is it?

806
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
I'm sorry.

807
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
I'm sorry.

808
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,680
I'm sorry.

809
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,680
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

832
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,680
I'm sorry.

833
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,680

00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,680
いいquality.

866
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,680
Why is it so scary?

867
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,680
Brother Xiao.

868
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,680
Jiang Xiao Fang.

Let's go back to the room.

My dream will last forever

873
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,600
