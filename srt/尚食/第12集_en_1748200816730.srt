1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The game is a little bit complicated

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The game is a little bit complicated

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The game is a little bit complicated

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The game is a little bit complicated

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The game is a little bit complicated

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The game is a little bit complicated

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The game is a little bit complicated

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,760
Just don't skeptick

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,240
Vegetable rava is as young as the moon

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,180
Anything would rather beixi

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,200
Father, move forward

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,220
Jiaxli, you have to care more about him

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,320
Walk past him with pleasure

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why are you so late?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Master Meng.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Your Highness.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Please have a seat.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Master Meng, you are...

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why are you confused?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Why do you still call me Master?

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let me help you.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The vegetables you sent today

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
are not fresh.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How could you forget?

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You said it yourself.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Fresh vegetables

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
can't be harvested and brewed for an hour.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sometimes, they are not dried yet.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But look.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry for making you suffer.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll get another one.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Miss Wen, this...

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Miss Wen, this...

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This...

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't cut it.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's go.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Miss Wen is bullying Master Meng again.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're not allowed to go.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll get this.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When you're holding a wedding,

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
why do you need someone to come to the wedding?

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We'll work hard.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let me do it.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You have a sharp eye.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're not allowed to separate.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yuehua.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
When you meet him again,

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
don't be so rude.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hu Sishan is now in charge of the Young Master.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's too late to celebrate the birthday.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why do you care about the people who are not related?

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Miss Yao, you're here.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Please wait a moment.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, I'll wait.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Lord Yang.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is your Highness still in the room?

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What is the pattern of the Ministry of Revenue?

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't know.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Your Highness,

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
where did you get the message from?

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's from the Imperial Physician.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The Imperial Physician is involved.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think it's not their fault.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The Imperial Physician is involved.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It seems like they didn't do it on purpose.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In case of an accident,

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it seems like they didn't do it on purpose.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They didn't do it on purpose.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't know.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,400
I guess they didn't do it.

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,200
It'sなるほど when you heared.

94
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,700
They're afraid their names

95
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,160
might hide something that they think.

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,120
But your port would end it abruptly.

97
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,040
It is.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Miss 가� snail

99
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,160
If you can't wake up

100
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,800
I'll have to get you some room

101
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,320
over a long period

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,680
My Lord.

103
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,480
We'll meet again.

104
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,360
My Lord.

105
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,040
Thanks for your help.

106
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,560
Your Highness.

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I'mوب곡 evening.

108
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
Please forgive me.

109
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
You were loitering at work,

110
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,920
and you only allow me

111
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
to sleep in a morning报ée.

112
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,700
It is not nice season for Blizzard.,

113
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,300
Go out.

114
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,620
Twenty.

115
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,140
Your Highness.

116
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,500
Your Highness.

117
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,980
Don't worry.

118
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,500
Look carefully.

119
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:20,860
This is the way

120
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,220
you treat me.

121
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,300
Your daughter.

122
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,860
Her Highness.

123
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,860
She is a girl.

124
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,740
She proposed to this person.

125
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,140
Why is she so Su levarious?

126
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,620
But we don't need to hear from this person.

127
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:57,980
I really don't wish for the sliding

128
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,140
is so complicated.

129
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,060
It is harder to behave like the girl

130
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,260
being jumped down here.

131
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,500
Its waiting is confusing.

132
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,820
How can the hair they are like the girl

133
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,380
come up as the hair is left lying in the woods.

134
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,180
Why did you fall asleep?

135
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,300
I...

136
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,420
Tell me the truth.

137
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,180
I didn't say anything

138
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,420
for the sake of the Chu Xi Yan.

139
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,860
The whole Shang Shi Bureau is like this.

140
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,100
You worked so hard.

141
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,460
I'll send you here to take the debt.

142
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,620
No.

143
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,740
I'm afraid.

144
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,380
Your Highness, please allow me

145
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,700
to stay in Shang Shi Bureau.

146
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,060
Okay.

147
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,700
Chu Fen, promise me one thing.

148
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,940
From now on,

149
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,180
you can't say that you're a slave.

150
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,740
And tell me,

151
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,860
why do you like to be a chef?

152
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,980
Your Highness,

153
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,580
my mother has a high expectations for me.

154
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,860
She asked me to teach her a lesson.

155
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,300
I can't remember the story.

156
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,100
I'm afraid of her.

157
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,580
I'm afraid of her.

158
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,660
I'm afraid of her.

159
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,740
At that time,

160
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,260
the only place I could avoid was the escape route.

161
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,740
Because it's narrow and too much for me.

162
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,620
It's inconvenient to open the route.

163
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,180
In Shang Shi Bureau,

164
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,060
it's the most relaxing and happiest time in my life.

165
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,260
It's there.

166
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,420
I got the first recognition from others

167
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,220
and found the meaning of my existence.

168
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:36,980
Your Highness,

169
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,740
let this time be longer.

170
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:45,980
I thought

171
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,420
your happiest time was in the bookshop.

172
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,620
It seems that I've thought too much.

173
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,580
Your Highness,

174
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,540
that's completely different.

175
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,100
When Your Highness was dealing with the affairs,

176
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,220
when you were leading the war,

177
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,940
you were satisfied with yourMA?

178
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,820
っと and delighted with boaty care?

179
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,740
Alright.

180
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,220
Let's go in.

181
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,740
Yes.

182
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,640
Mi Yuzheng

183
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,200
Wait here.

184
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,920
You were detained into the greying wartime with the moon the whole night.

185
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,780
Whom are you proud of in here?

186
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,880
Your Highness.

187
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm back.

188
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,780
I Toge泽 came here.

189
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,660
I'm your concubine holding the gingoh of Jin arg !

190
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,480
¡¡

191
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,720

194
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,320

195
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,360
What kind of misfortune is that?

196
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,500

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,460

198
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,060
He's been pretending for a long time.

199
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,060
He didn't think about it to reassure me.

You can cook such a delicious food.

234
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,420
You are definitely going to be a distracted and careless girl.

235

245
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:45,420
おBid-

246
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,320
When I was young,

247
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,880
my parents gave me

248
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,240
both a kind and gentle��,

249
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,000
which spared no inspiration

250
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,480
for me.

251
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,280
Hu refugees,

252
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,440
What's the purpose of this young girl?

253
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,720
I don't know.

254
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,420
Such kind and kind girl,

255
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,060
will be born with a close heart.

256
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,140
What about Royal Descendant?

257
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,620
Imperial Descendant.

258
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,100
Do you really want him to be the crown prince?

259
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,860
Now that someone can make you happy,

260
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,100
you're at my fault.

261
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,940
Read that poem again.

262
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,900

263
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,780

264
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,260
you don't need to be so stubborn.

265
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,140
You just need to understand the great will.

266
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,340
I don't need to go to the exam.

267
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,460
The Great Wall of the Moon and the Sun

268
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,300
will be delivered by the three-year-old.

269
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,580
Look at you.

270
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,860
You've wronged a few words.

271
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,300
It's the moon, not the sun.

272
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,340
It's the sun, not the moon.

273
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,780
Brother,

274
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,980

Look.

276
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,260
There's a blind spot here.

277
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,740

The emperor is not in Qianqing Palace.

289
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,420
Everyone is looking for him here.

290
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,220
Why do you know where I am?

291
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,500

has been fighting for 11 years.

293
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,980

He's not sick.

296
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,220

00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Come on.

382
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,900
You're so good.

383
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Come on.

384
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
Go.

385
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
They're not important.

386
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,900
Come with me.

387
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,900
Come here.

388
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
Ziping.

389
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
The Crown Princess is pregnant.

390
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Don't do that.

391
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
No matter who she is,

392
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
she will win.

393
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
No one can...

394
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Don't do that.

395
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,900
She's full of temper.

396
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,900
You go to the court and let her go.

397
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Remember that.

398
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,900
I'll teach you.

399
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,900
Come here.

400
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,900
Go.

401
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Go.

402
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Give it to me.

403
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
This way.

404
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Give it to me.

405
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
Miss Yao.

406
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
Did you see Concubine Zhuang?

407
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Concubine Zhuang?

408
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
Here.

409
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
She...

410
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,900
I've searched everywhere.

411
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
No one is here.

412
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Can you find me?

413
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,900
Don't look for her.

414
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
Yes.

415
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
Come with me.

416
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,900
Come on.

417
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
This way.

418
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,900
Come with me.

419
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Come on.

420
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
Hold on.

421
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Hold on.

422
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Go on.

423
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Come on.

424
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Hurry up.

425
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Hurry up.

426
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Hurry up.

427
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Hurry up.

428
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Concubine Zhuang.

429
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Come on.

430
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Come on.

431
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Young Master is here.

432
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I...

433
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Your Highness.

434
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
Jin is looking for you.

435
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Thanks.

436
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
I'm here.

437
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,620
Didn't I tell you I love you?

438
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,220
I really love you.

439
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,420
You'll live well for another half-life.

440
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,020
Lady.

441
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,420
Please come over here.

442
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,300
Let's go.

443
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,340
Be careful.

444
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,620
from His Majesty?

445
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,400
Why shouldn't we forgive him?

446
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,300
He's not a mother.

447
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,140
Chief Elder,

448
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,820
a daughter from always

449
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,820
wants to see you.

450
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,860
What did you do, missing gold yuan?

451
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,860
That staff

452
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,820
There's a day off.

453
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,620
You can come out to see the celebration.

454
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,300
Why is Lord You here?

455
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,220
As a royal family,

456
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,740
there's no need to do anything.

457
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,460
It's more important to guard the emperor's health.

458
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,580
Every person in the palace

459
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,380
is crying for the concubine.

460
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,940
And you,

461
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,460
a secret official,

462
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,500
are making a lot of mistakes.

463
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,900
So,

464
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,700
don't make mistakes.

465
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,500
Lord.

466
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,580
Have you met before?

467
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:27,940
Of course not.

468
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,500
Why are you standing here?

469
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,940
Hurry up.

470
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,260
Be careful.

471
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,540
Be careful.

472
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,740
Hold on.

473
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,780
Here.

474
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,380
Hurry up.

475
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,860
Here.

476
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,140
Pass it over.

477
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,540
Yes.

478
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,500
Here.

479
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,660
Here.

480
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,020
Stop it.

481
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,300
Take a seat.

482
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,780
Hold on.

483
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,420
Come on.

484
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,240
Next.

485
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,980
Take this one, surely.

486
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,140
Here.

487
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,580
There's закрыuses in the hall.

488
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,700
Your Highness,

489
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,180
Why don't you come with me.

490
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,660
Come on.

491
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
Watch your hands.

492
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,020
I'll go and have a look.

493
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,540
Don't waste time.

494
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:33,980
Give it to me.

495
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:41,980
This way.

496
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,540
He's a kind and kind person.

497
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,860
He's a kind and kind person.

498
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,060
He's a kind and kind person.

499
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,220
He's a kind and kind person.

500
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,340
He's a kind and kind person.

501
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,660
He's a kind and kind person.

502
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,580
Mother, why are you so stubborn?

503
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,260
In the world,

504
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,460
who would choose a better girl than me?

505
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,100
You've seen her.

506
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,500
Even His Majesty

507
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,860
agreed to the marriage.

508
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,420
She's a good person.

509
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,620
She's really a good person.

510
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,780
Who knows that His Majesty

511
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,220
has heard the word of the way

512
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,820
and changed her

513
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,180
from a man to a woman.

514
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,060
She's been married for so long.

515
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,140
She hasn't had a child.

516
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,060
She's a good person.

517
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,060
She's a good person.

518
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,140
She's not as good as you.

519
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,780
Mother.

520
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,580
Let's go.

521
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,340
Give me the bag.

522
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:41,820
Let's go.

523
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,500
I'm right here.

524
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,380
Mother!

525
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,180
Your Highness.

526
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,340
Your Majesty

527
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,500
These contracts to greet you

528
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,580
have been soaking up.

529
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,060
I'm curious if Your Highness

530
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,980
type of person

531
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,580
will solve your problems serving you well.

532
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,260
Your Highness,

533
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,260
it's Dong Min MBA day.

534
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
Girls have gone to meet your Baltimore.

535
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,500
Miss Yao is still in wait.

536
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,260
Look.

537
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,100
What did I say?

538
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,300
You didn't come?

539
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:27,900
Your Highness.

540
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,220
Your Highness.

541
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,820
Brother Hu Jun, come here.

542
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,180
Great!

543
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,740
Look, he's so great.

544
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,580
Great!

545
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:47,740
Great!

546
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,180
Look over there.

547
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,780
Great!

548
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,220
Come on, come on.

549
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,140
Great!

550
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
Great!

551
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Great!

552
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Great!

553
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Great!

554
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,140
Great!

555
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:30,700
될bit

556
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,660
Your Highness.

557
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,180
I feel he really likes you.

558
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,020
I've made so many love真的很

559
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,460
particular with him.

560
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
It's alsoiksm

561
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,820
I gave him a good time to comb his hair.

562
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,980
But he took me to the coldest place.

563
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,500
And it's colder day by day.

564
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,780
Your Highness, you love him so much.

565
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,900
I'm sure

566
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
he doesn't like a kind of kindness.

567
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,380
You're not a Yan Tai.

568
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,500
How do you know?

569
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,860
In my opinion,

570
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,220
he's not kind.

571
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,100
I know.

572
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,620
How do you know?

573
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,260
Do you know

574
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,860
Yan Tai is a slave?

575
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,780
I'm Li, too.

576
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,140
I heard that the people's children

577
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,180
will meet each other

578
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,380
to grow up.

579
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,220
You're so nice.

580
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,860
Your Highness,

581
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,580
I'm going back.

582
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,100
I'm leaving the capital.

583
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,540
I'm from the capital, Beijing.

584
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,380
I'll return to Tonghe

585
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,780
for the North and South Liang.

586
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,420
But the land

587
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,460
is ruined every year.

588
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,620
I'm burdened with heavy burden.

589
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,020
This time, His Lordship asked me to check the river.

590
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,820
I don't know when I can return to the capital.

591
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,700
Go with me.

592
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,900
Your Highness,

593
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,460
I'll wait for you here.

594
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,400
Your Highness,

595
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,020
I will wait for you here.

596
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,700
Your Highness,

597
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,180
I'll go too.

598
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,140
He doesn't like me.

599
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,460
He's afraid I might accidentally

600
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,380
see him.

601
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,540
He'll probably feel terrible.

602
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,340
Sooner or later,

603
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,820
I'll inform him

604
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,940
he's leaving the capital

605
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,020
or not having the safe home.

606
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,400
So he's briefly

607
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,220
comparing the Gngos to put an end to a broken home.

608
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,180
Do you still remember

609
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,340
some of the effet about that?

610
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:14,900
Your Highness,

611
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,340
I 테I t ea s i n g a l d b i s o r e s h a r g g n l t i n g i n e.

612
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,660
Go. Go.

613
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,220
I'm going, Your Highness.

614
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
Who is it?

615
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,220
Ziping?

616
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,100
What's wrong?

617
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,260
What's wrong here?

618
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,340
Ziping?

619
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,820
Ziping?

620
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,340
Ziping.

621
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,340
I've been asking you everywhere,

622
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,020
but you didn't let me.

623
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,340
You asked me to come here

624
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,660
and ask someone to come to me.

625
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,820
I've been looking for you for 30 times.

626
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,860
I'm listening.

627
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,620
Don't make trouble or give up.

628
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,660
But these noble people

629
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,340
don't treat us as people at all.

630
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,060
I'm not happy.

631
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,180
I'm so unhappy.

632
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,340
No matter what will happen to me,

633
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,660
I'll

634
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,140
take what I know.

635
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,460
As long as you love me more,

636
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,820
I'll tie you up.

637
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,060
Take it.

638
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,180
Your Highness,

639
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,180
why are you thinking about

640
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,740
such a sort of thing?

641
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,740
Doesn't look like it.

642
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,860
Don't look like it?

643
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,060
How can it be true?

644
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,360
Your Highness, is your hand

645
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,140
golden-eyed?

646
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,840
What are those?

647
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,540
F hangs over bird's recognised festival?

648
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,520
Daring mountains with magistrates?

649
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,300
So they all look like one chamado himself.

650
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,660
How can they not look like him?

651
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,860
Just a Jack of all art.

652
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,420
And you, завety,

653
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,940

to send Li Feng Zhi to Zhihe City.

662
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,200
That's the place.

663
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,880
From now on,

664
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,240
Ji Zhou River will be spread all over the country.

665
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,360
This is the part

666
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,400
that was flooded by the flood.

667
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,320
It's used to save the Yun Dynasty.

668
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,360
Look.

The line needed help.

672
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,680
The Joker is on the way.

673
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,080
It's okay.

We have many professional teams.

735
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,720

If he took the Trans sleeping primera?

742
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,160
It would be

743
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,320
the battle between twenty sealed civilians.

744
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:03,840
Father,

745
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,600

I'm going to kill him.

764
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,480
It's no use to be all-round.

765
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,480
You still want to surpass his family.

766

Close our eyes

The light of the river flows away

809
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,200
We onceowered to each other

810
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,200
