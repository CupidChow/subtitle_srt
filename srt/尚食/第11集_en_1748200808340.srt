00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,620
Sorry for not being good.

156
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,720
I'd like to...

157
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,260
Couple with other thicknesses

158
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,040
It tastes good.

159
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,900
Right.

160
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
being opened by ridge,

161
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,180
it seems that

162
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,820
I have taken advantage of this merit.

163
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,180
Chain?

164
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,060
Yes.

165
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,880
The Currant Land

166
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,840
and fresh food.

167
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Only the village head can

168
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,920
be as good as the whole family.

169
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,960
But now,

170
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,600
it's not the best season to eat crab.

171
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,200
It can't make the taste of the soup

172
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,240
perfect.

173
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,040
I'll use crab cake

174
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
to make tofu cake.

175
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
Combine the lightest

176
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,200

177
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,960
in the world.

178
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,400
With the lightest tofu,

179
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,800
it can neutralize the freshness of the crab.

180
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,000
It can make it taste better.

181
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
There's still so much to eat.

182
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,240
It's not a normal crab paste.

183
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,680
The most delicious

184
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,160
and the most delicious crab chutney.

185
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,800
The crab meat is no use.

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,520
Except for crab cake and crab butter.

187
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,920
Fresh oil made with下去.

188
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,080
S genre of thời stecz zi?

189
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,880
Is the taste very similar to crab paste?

190
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,800
Also,

191
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,240
make it open in the pros.

192
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,600
It's difficult.

193
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,040
You need morale and easier minutes

194
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,640
just to use the bitter tea.

195
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,880
Then you can taste the new

196
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,040

197
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,560
Zi Jian.

198
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
You're really amazing.

199
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,680
We're in a hurry.

200
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
What's the first game?

201
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,640
They won the first game.

202
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,280
They won.

203
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,000
What's the second game?

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
What's the second game?

205
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,560
I don't know.

206
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,480
Why did the wind and wind come back?

207
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,880
Princess Han is filial.

208
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,320
She's not a child.

209
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,880
She's not allowed to marry Princess Han.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,320
So she's been rejected.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,520
What did you say?

212
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,880
Say it again.

213
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,520
So what if you get rejected?

214
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,920
Okay.

215
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,760
Princess Han.

216
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,640
Xiu Zhen.

217
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,680
Palace Consort.

218
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,120
Our palace consort.

219
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,280
What happened?

220
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,680
mic bater, what happened?

221
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,840
It was Fiwasi offenders.

They suspect gu้a and him.

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,260
They used Fiwasi's lái.

224
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,180
No.

225
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,260
You did it for Suji?

226
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,920
Summon the medicines! Summon the medicines!

227
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,020
Dism compost.

228
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,700
Slow your drag.

229
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,520
Stop her.

230
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:10,920
Father,

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,820

232
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,980
Don't worry.

233
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,500
I want to summon the imperial physician to check on her.

234
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,700
Mother.

235
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,580
Take her to your palace first.

236
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,660
Ask the Minister of Justice to come.

237
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,100
Please follow me.

238
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,820
Let's go.

239
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,620
My Lord.

240
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,420
Leave first.

241
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,380
Father.

242
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,340
What's the meaning of this?

243
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,140
Bring her up.

244
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,940
Go.

245
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,060
Hurry.

246
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,180
Go.

247
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,700
Scram.

248
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,420
Your Majesty,

249
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,500
General Meng Xian,

250
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,800
and the Imperial Guards of Boxu

251
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,720
perform an imperial suAKE

252
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
at Wang Secheng's Lanong.

253
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,660
That lord Yang is so rebellious

254
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,860
that he would take his ponerage.

255
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,740
What seeking the rebel?

256
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,420
Grandpa.

257
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,940
At Wang Secheng's Lanong,

258
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,660
Meng Xian said he may not be useful at all,

259
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,100
he will become another prince.

260
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,600
He assisted Yan Hui into increasing the �arine

261
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,240
so as to alleys with the psycho.

262
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,200
Mangling of Warega is protective and blessable at Car SprinkledHis Highness's title.

263
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,900
He's now flourishing into hisabord.

264
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,920
Which is quite hard for him.

265
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,480
I found a fakeariute slave,

266
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,640
which could bring the왕 crown prince victimized

267
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,020
his kungfu and grab a drink.

268
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,560
exoperate with his Nissitian power.

269
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,420
It really is

270
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,320
my original son.

271
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,960
I just

272
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,800
bother him.

273
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,780
How come we knew

274
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,220
Longyi and his brother's head.

275
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,940
Third Brother.

276
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,420
Third Brother.

277
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,500
Wake up.

278
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,060
Third Brother.

279
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,780
Third Brother.

280
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,140
You really colluded with people

281
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,060
to poison Father and kill the throne?

282
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,420
I'm greedy, Brother.

283
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,500
What are you talking about?

284
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
What are you talking about?

285
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,380
What's wrong with you?

286
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,100
Why did you say that?

287
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm loyal to Father.

288
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,260
The world can be seen in the sun and moon.

289
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,860
How could I collude with people to do evil?

290
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,580
Who said that?

291
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,860
Is it you?

292
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,260
Who told you to frame me?

293
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:49,900
Shut up.

294
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,140
Get out.

295
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,340
Yes.

296
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,060
Yes.

297
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,580
Third Brother.

298
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,340
Changshan is your guard.

299
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,860
Who else can you control?

300
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,860
You're under arrest.

301
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
You're still a hostage.

302
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:20,620
No.

303
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,380
Father.

304
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,940
I was just having a sleepover.

305
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,660
I don't know what happened.

306
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,140
But

307
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,740
someone must have caused the crime.

308
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,140
It's not easy to get rid of me.

309
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,460
Father.

310
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,500
Let her have it.

311
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,300
Your Majesty.

312
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,300
Go.

313
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,640
That should be fine.

314
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,540
The Highness is so چ+.

315
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,820
I have wise words.

316
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,140
What in goshаery.

317
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,220
Be it a case,

318
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,220
I'll show them

319
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,720

Xie Denver in my time,

322
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,420
but

323
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,960
he refused his ie

324
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,300
I got impressed

325
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,940
how good Xie Gun-go showed

326
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:22,820
ibat

327
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,780
Your Highness,

328
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,980
the officials in the court

329
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,300
are not just a Crown Prince.

330
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,620
Father.

331
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,220
I'm wronged, Father.

332
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,420
All right.

333
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,660
Stop talking.

334
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,220
Father,

335
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,860
I'm willing to drink

336
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,660
the wine today.

337
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
But before drinking,

338
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,300
I must swear to God

339
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,460
that I will never do anything wrong.

340
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,780
Today,

341
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,420
someone must be framed

342
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,700
and someone must be

343
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,100
to act in the rear.

344
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,380
Father,

345
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,100
if you insist on

346
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,300
using this wine to prove your innocence,

347
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,700
I'm willing to drink it.

348
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,220
Father.

349
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,740
I'm sorry, Father.

350
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,820
I'm always a humble man.

351
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,620
I've never been impulsive.

352
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,860
This time,

353
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,180
I'm sure I'm wronged.

354
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,780
If

355
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,980
this is a crime,

356
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,700
I'm willing to take it.

357
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,380
I'm here to...

358
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,460
Father.

359
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,020
I'm here to...

360
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,740
Father.

361
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,420
Third Brother.

362
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,220
Father.

363
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:50,820
Third Brother.

364
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,420
Father.

365
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:51,940
Enough.

366
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,020
You want to drink the wine to prove your innocence.

367
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,180
You dare not do it alone?

368
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,300
I'm also innocent.

369
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,900
Give it to me.

370
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:58,980
Stop.

371
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,380
Enough.

372
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,060
What are you thus doing?

373
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,780
I'm just большuing on this مت.

374
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:18,700
Zhou prosecuted him.

375
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,820
If I'm not mistaken here,

376
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,460
Zuoependan is the most brilliant and most excellent

377
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,420
ever confidant you,

378
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,180
and you liked every inch of dragon痴

379
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,340
and your sharp chains in day and night.

380
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,700
You believe?

381
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,060
We weren't going to pass the test.

382
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,040
I'm seeing what you think is wrong.

383
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:49,700
configures can be quite frightened.

384
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,720
Okay.

385
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,520
It's over

386
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,020
now.

387
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,480
You are so happy, rightนะ?

388
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,120
Ms. Charming

389
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,960
Watch out.

390
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,120
Guangxue is party-wrestling with a high profile.

391
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,120
Zhu Qi and disciplines the Nation Plan.

392
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,720
With our clan agenda tightened.

393
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,080
Your attention.

394
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,560
My two servants...

395
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,120
King Zhao will execute here.

396
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,080
Yeah.

397
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,480
And you

398
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,680
heated theOS for me at my mine.

399
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,840
謝謝, Royal euausquat.

400
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,520
Very well.

401
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,480
Lord Han is here.

402
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,040
Dad.

403
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,320
Mom,

404
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,280
Eldest Imperial Consort Han has lost her body.

405
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,720
Why didn't you ask the sick

406
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,600
to stay in Feng Di to properly聞?

407
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,640
The eight maple leaves in the shangshan sword

408
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,680
where the chef made it.

409
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,480
That is Gathering Heavenly Jud imagery.

410
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,040
You need to use that areal日叙胖调

411
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
to clarify who mentioned you.

412
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,800
Gathering Heavenly Jud perform?

413
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,920
The Imperial Consort of the Han Dynasty has an old skill.

414
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,400
She wants to use water to increase her body.

415
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,800
That person in the stone pond is a snake.

416
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,280
She's used the technique to kill the snake.

417
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,720
It's her.

418
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,560
Mother.

419
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,720
Trust me. I didn't do anything.

420
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,760
I don't know the Imperial Consort of the Han Dynasty.

421
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,520
I don't know if she has a concubine.

422
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,840
Trust me.

423
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,840
You don't want to harm the Imperial Consort of the Han Dynasty.

424
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,760
You just want to frame me.

425
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,280
No.

426
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,880
I'm not making excuses.

427
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,400
What are you saying?

428
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,120
You knew that

429
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,880
the Imperial Consort of Han has collected old skills and turned to old wanna.

430
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,420
It was a great loss from the imperial

431
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,400
county of Shao Da Dec。」

432
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,160
Herewith, I heard about thefficient doings that have been taken by Xu Yigou.

433
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
Thevasive....

434
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,400
No.

435
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,840
So, the reason you're angry

436
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,960
Who are you? Tell me.

437
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,520
Tell me.

438
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,600
Who is supporting you?

439
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,520
No one is supporting me.

440
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I did it.

441
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,280
I did it.

442
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,720
You are the head of the Shao Shi Bureau.

443
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,600
You can't get away

444
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,080
from the fate of the night.

445
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,080
I'm so anxious.

446
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
I just want to see

447
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,080
how you are doing.

448
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,280
Look at your woman

449
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,880
and how she will end up.

450
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,760
I did everything.

451
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,840
I did everything.

452
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,360
You are satisfied?

453
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,560
You are too disappointed in me.

454
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,840
Your Highness,

455
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
the Crown Princess is not in the way.

456
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,960
Stay out of it.

457
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,960
Your Highness.

458
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
The imperial interrogation

459
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,320
found out and countered by Zhao Shu

460
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,680
was just a trick.

461
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,680
TERO daWasastian

462
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,340
Xing Shi has been a cursed human

463
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,280
who means차k doing this

464
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,960
is going to

465
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,120
the Qin tech Others should be listed as lucrative.

466
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
On the other hand,

467
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,640
without the royal clan

468
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,800
the ones who are to blame

469
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,120
Actually, it's just that

470
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,180
I don't want to be alone either.

471
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,900
The emperor, Longyi, won't have anyone else.

472
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,980
You two uncle

473
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,460
because of me,

474
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,300
you arepoints are too many.

475
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:50,580
If we跟 the interior

476
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,100
?

477
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:51,900
?

478
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,800
Who sent you to scare them?

479
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,300
?

480
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,080
Childe Wang

481
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,400
you're killing them?

482
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,340
I'm just vain.

483
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,780
Sun Er has never ago been wronged.

484
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,660
A person might running inbeeping

485
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,760
searching for excuses

486
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,660
and easy to encounter the trouble.

487
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,340
It's making him

488
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,420
exchange violence forcibly.

489
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,360
You think

490
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:21,880
hill.

491
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,500
Follow me.

492
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,220
Come back.

493
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,620
Too far.

494
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,260
Stay there.

495
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,500
Done?

496
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,740
Just now,

497
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,860
my grandfather gave us his leg.

498
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,080
When he was under the hunting war,

499
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:46,280
he was towards the

500
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,500
crouching 아니면 Freddon.

501
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,580
and a country.

502
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,900
It's fine to be a good man

503
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,340
and be kind to others.

504
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,180
But for the emperor,

505
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,260
it's only a peaceful emperor

506
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,500
who will be the one who will stick to the path of justice.

507
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,540
What do you think is the good emperor?

508
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,260
For the people,

509
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,500
for the country,

510
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,860
people are so humble and humble.

511
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,260
They can be easily abandoned.

512
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,460
But at the same time,

513
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,940
they have to be punished by the people.

514
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,420
To stick to the path of justice

515
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,340
and protect the people and the land,

516
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:35,100
this is the perfect

517
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,140
Here comes a poison.

518
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,060
It's trash

519
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,940
and qis paul.

520
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,660
Come on.

521
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,700
Walk with grandpa.

522
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

523
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,500
You don't want to be the one to blame yourself?

524
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,700
I'm a humble person.

525
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,900
I have to rely on you to protect me.

526
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
That's why I have to do this today.

527
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,900
I should have been the one to repay you.

528
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Chu Xi Yan and I have been in a daze for a while.

529
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,900
I'm afraid that I'll be in a hurry.

530
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
I'll be in a hurry.

531
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
I'll be in a hurry.

532
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
I'll be in a hurry.

533
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
I'll be in a hurry.

534
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,900
I'll be in a hurry.

535
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,900
Who is this person?

536
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,700
What's the point of being so formal with you?

537
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,700
Senior Meng, who are you talking about?

538
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
A person who knows how to be polite.

539
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,300
You should understand that

540
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,500
the person who is a gentleman and a father

541
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
should be the one to blame.

542
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,500
You won't be the one to blame and the person who is the one to blame.

543
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,100
I'm not strict with anyone.

544
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,700
I'm not as tolerant.

545
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700
I'm not as tolerant as anyone.

546
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,300
I'm not as tolerant as anyone.

547
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,100
Senior Meng.

548
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,500
Hu Si Shan.

549
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
I've let you down.

550
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
I forgot to keep the secret.

551
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,700
I haven't checked the time list again.

552
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,700
As for the chance to be in a hurry,

553
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,700
it's my mistake.

554
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
I'm too much.

555
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
I'm just deeply grateful.

556
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
I have to be honest.

557
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,700
A person who can easily betray the superior

558
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,300
is not worthy of trust.

559
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
How can I stay by your side?

560
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,100
The imperial physician thinks that the queen is not accurate.

561
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,100
He said that he was too hasty.

562
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,900
He didn't have the courage to come here often.

563
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,700
He was only in a hurry to return to the heaven.

564
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,900
The time list of the imperial physician is not wrong.

565
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,700
The superior is not a big mistake.

566
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,300
Moreover, His Majesty is very much in a hurry to try that Xie Geng.

567
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,900
Before the superior is in a hurry,

568
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,100
he should return to the superior.

569
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,900
If the superior is in a hurry to go against the queen,

570
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,500
why?

571
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Someone is reporting.

572
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,700
You are sending news to the King of Han.

573
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,500
Do you admit your crime?

574
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,900
This is a false accusation.

575
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,100
Hu Si Shan,

576
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,100
being so ungrateful, how dare you speak in front of me?

577
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,900
Greetings to Your Highness.

578
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,500
That day, in Qianqing Palace,

579
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Lord Yuan was poisoned and was expelled from the palace.

580
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,300
When I was in the palace,

581
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,900
His Majesty was taking the medicine and was in a hurry to return to the heaven.

582
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,500
Moreover, he said that the world in the palace has changed.

583
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
I was thinking about it.

584
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,900
I was afraid that I would be exposed.

585
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,900
Your Highness,

586
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,300
if it weren't for the news of the King of Han,

587
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,500
how would you know that the world in the palace has changed?

588
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,100
If you keep your heart, you will be able to see the danger.

589
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,900
Your Highness,

590
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,500
I have already made my statement.

591
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,700
The queen of the palace is a female official.

592
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,500
She should not interfere in the affairs of the palace.

593
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,500
When I was dreaming, I was wronged by His Majesty.

594
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,100
The theory is still spreading news to the King of Han.

595
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,300
Moreover, he once violated your order

596
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,500
to repay the King of Han.

597
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,300
Your Highness,

598
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,700
Fan Si wrote a letter to share the news.

599
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,300
The writer and the writer are both involved.

600
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,700
As a superior in the palace, you know your fault.

601
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,700
What crime should you take?

602
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,700
There is no such thing as a crime in the Yuzi family.

603
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,900
Your Highness, you are wise and wise.

604
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,100
Do you also believe in this trick?

605
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Do you suspect my loyalty?

606
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,700
For years, you have been the emperor.

607
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,300
You have been the head of the Shang's Bureau.

608
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,700
You have done your best.

609
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,900
Your Highness,

610
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,700
you have been the head of the Bureau.

611
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,500
You are indeed a criminal.

612
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,100
You are not allowed to be a criminal.

613
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
You are a noble official.

614
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,700
You have been the head of the Bureau.

615
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,700
You are the head of the Bureau.

616
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,700
You should be the head of the Bureau.

617
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,100
I will take my leave.

618
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,700
I hope that the Crown Princess will take care of herself.

619
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
Congratulations.

620
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,100
Minister Meng.

621
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,900
It is no longer the Minister of Shang.

622
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,900
How will you be called by your name?

623
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,700
I am curious.

624
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,100
I have such a strong faith in you.

625
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,500
Why do you trust him?

626
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,300
Since I was a young child, we were just strangers.

627
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
Later, we entered the Shang's Bureau.

628
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,500
You are a good person and you are loyal.

629
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,100
You are not suitable for the new one to be punished and be punished.

630
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,500
We have been acting against you to avoid your eyes.

631
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,900
Ten years?

632
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,500
You have been acting against me for ten years.

633
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,500
That is great.

634
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,900
Wei.

635
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,500
Don't be so soft.

636
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I know.

637
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:50,100
He is a good person and he is a good person.

638
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,700
But as long as he is around, I will never be able to get out of here.

639
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:58,100
For ten years, he has been doing things for nothing.

640
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,500
We are obviously the best friends.

641
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,900
We have to keep pretending to be good friends.

642
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,100
Isn't it hard to live?

643
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,100
From now on, we don't need him anymore.

644
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,100
After Lian How to Learn from A'ZYA's Xueись,

645
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,300
A'ZYA's Wife A'ZYA is your wife now.

646
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,900
Get up!

647
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,020
I'm so scared.

648
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,020
What's going on?

649
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,700
Are you still going to pursue responsibility?

650
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,060
Please go그� Cup.

651
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,700
lord工 addid Olyweit

652
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,700
The body is healthy, the outside world is good,

00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,700
the heart is strong, everything is smooth.

654
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Hurry up.

655
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Hurry up.

656
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
Come.

657
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,700
Come.

658
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
Come.

659
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
Thank you.

660
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Be careful.

661
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,700
Be careful.

662
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Be careful.

663
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
Come.

664
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Be careful.

665
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Be careful.

666
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Be careful.

667
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
Be careful.

668
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Be careful.

669
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
Be careful.

670
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Be careful.

671
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,700
Be careful.

672
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,700
Take it.

673
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,700
Come.

674
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,700
Take it.

675
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Be careful.

676
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,700
Come.

677
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,700
Be careful.

00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,700
Be careful.

679
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
Be careful.

680
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Be careful.

681
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
The heart is healthy, the outside world is good,

682
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,700
the heart is strong, everything is smooth.

683

The heart is strong, the outside world is good,

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:52,700
the outside world is good,

685
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,700
the outside world is good,

686
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:02,700
the outside world is good.

687
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
I'm looking for you.

688
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
Thank you, your Highness.

689
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,700
All the fortune in the capital is in this bowl of rice.

690
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,700
I'll eat it first.

691
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Your Highness, I'm worried.

692
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
There are some things

693
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,700
that I'm worried about the city and people.

694
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
But there are some things

695
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,700
that I haven't tried

696
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,700
and don't know how to deal with them.

697
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,700
Your Highness,

698
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,700
you don't have a husband?

699
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,700
You're like a wild fox.

700
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
My husband and I were the biggest couple

701
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,700
when I was with him.

702
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
It's you.

703
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Why did you frame me?

704
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,700
We're innocent.

705
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,700
What's wrong with you?

706
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,700
It's fair trade.

707
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,700
You did something for me.

708
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,700
And I got the list of the mountain swords for you.

709
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Do you know

710
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,700
that because you and I became the murderers,

711
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,700
it's all your fault?

712
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,700
Don't come here.

713
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,700
Go away.

714
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,700
Who hurt you?

715
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
What's wrong?

716
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
You're looking for the pain, aren't you?

717
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
You're like your mother.

718
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,700
My mother didn't kill anyone.

719
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,700
You're a woman with a husband.

720
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
How dare you talk back?

721
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
I'll beat you up.

722
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,700
Come here.

723
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,700
I'll beat you up.

724
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
I'll beat you up.

725
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,700
I didn't kill anyone.

726
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
I didn't kill anyone.

727
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
I'll beat you up.

728
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
You're still a murderer?

729
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,700
You're right.

730
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,700
I didn't do anything wrong

731
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,700
and I didn't know anything.

732
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,700
I just want to know

733
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,700
if I'm standing idle

734
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,700
and if anyone would notice.

735
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
I always think that

736
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,700
if I did something wrong,

737
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,700
if anyone would remember me,

738
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,700
even if I was alone,

739
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,700
I just didn't know

740
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,700
that this mistake

741
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
would lead to death.

742
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,700
This is my choice.

743
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
It has nothing to do with others.

744
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,700
You can go.

745
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,700
You can love me.

746
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,700
You can love me as you please.

747
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
But don't

748
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,700
take others as your hope

749
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,700
in life.

750
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,700
I'm not your bride.

751
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,700
Have you been helpful

752
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,700
to Gangsters before we release you?

753
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,700
This is all we have

754
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,700
now.

755
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,140
Yuehua hasn't come back yet.

756
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,420
You don't care about her.

757
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,380
Dongzi, hurry up and go in.

758
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,640
Keep the secret,

759
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,740
I'll make sure it dies.

760
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,880
the Thats all you have.

761
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,620
I've done

762
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,200
...

763
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,580
that for with no use unless you try?

764
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,680
...

765
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,020
Who dares to attack on the princess.

766
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,980
я

767
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,440
said

768
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,860
No one will fail in this time.

769
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,560
If she is going to hold it for long,

770
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,460
then what will she think?

771
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,380
This time,

772
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,940
I'll kill you all!

773
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,540
When I leave for my parents,

774
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,740
I'll stay with them.

775
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,180
I become like an ancient horse.

776
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,900
I never wandered in the desert,

777
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,760
but then I found myself living in eulogy

778
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,820
in Northwest Fowling Festival.

779
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,520
I became the Tsinghua Queen

780
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,020
when I was almost moonlit.

781
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,680
I fell in love with her

782
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,340
and I fell in love with some woman in a forest.

783
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,740
This should be learn from that girl we talked about.

784
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,180
Control yourself.

785
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,340
My father's education program, you must remember.

786
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,940
He has my official skills.

787
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,020
Please make the decision.

788
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,340
I will spend it together

789
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,340
Waiting for this

790
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,340
I am lonely and I feel the fire

791
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,340
I have a dream and I will meet it

792
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,340
My heart is not broken

793
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,340
I will meet someone

794
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,340
I thought

795
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,340
Waiting for this

796
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,340
I am lonely and I feel the fire

797
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,340
I have a dream and I will meet it

798
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,340
My heart is not broken

799
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,340
I will meet someone

800
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,340
I thought
