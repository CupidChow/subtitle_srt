It was cold last night.

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
Don't be too serious.

The corn is not dry.

But the crown prince is weak and weak.

Ying Ling is waiting for Shang Qi to return to court.

157
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,040
His Majesty said

159
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,660

Yao Zi Ji was sent to the palace by Song Shan.

183
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,820
She was sent to the palace by the concubines.

184
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,580
There is a dispute between Yong Ning Palace and the palace.

185
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,340
Now the palace is in a state of disarray.

186
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,940
Her Highness the Empress is busy.

187
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,460
I don't dare to disturb her.

188
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,060
I came here to ask for your permission.

189
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,900
Your Highness,

190
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,860
do you know

191
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,860
how much you have sinned?

192
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,260
Even if you are my elder sister,

193
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,660
I won't do it myself.

194
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,660
A Ji,

195
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,220
you dare to hide in front of the Crown Princess.

196
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,700
You don't want to die?

197
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,260
Crown Princess.

198
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,940
It was Miss Yao

199
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,740
who gave the Crown Princess a jade pendant

200
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,780
to make the door of the North Palace safe.

201
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
What jade pendant?

202
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,820
It's a jade pendant

203
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,220
that only the Empress can have.

204
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,340
The door of the North Palace is not in the palace.

205
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,820
Once you see this pendant,

206
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,620
you will be in a hurry.

207
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,980
How dare you block it?

208
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,340
General Chen Lao is as weak as a knife.

209
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:02,820
When he returns to the palace,

210
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,980
he needs to be kept in custody.

211
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,140
Yao Zi Ji,

212
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,700
where did you get this pendant from?

213
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,780
The jade pendant

214
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,660
is the one that the late emperor gave it to.

215
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,500
The Empress of the Empress is always with her.

216
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,420
She doesn't leave at night.

217
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,580
The palace is as good as the main court.

218
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,900
The phoenix is good.

219
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,060
The Empress of the Empress raised the Crown Prince herself

220
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,420
and she has a good sense of affection.

221
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,700
When she was in a hurry,

222
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,340
she left the jade pendant to the late emperor.

223
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,740
It's a sign that she will leave it to the future grand-father.

224
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,340
Why do you think

225
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,500
this jade pendant

226
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,820
will be in the hands of a maid?

227
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,460
Yao Zi Ji,

228
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,940
who are you?

229
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,900
Your Highness.

230
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,060
Call him here.

231
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,100
Your Highness.

232
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,900
I want to see him.

233
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,580
Yes.

234
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,580
What's the matter?

235
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,420
Shopping.

236
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,860
Your Highness,

237
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,540
Memorial Priest of the North Yan School, General Chen Leon,

238
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:35,340
knows that you'll guard the palace at night

239
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,340
and will never disturb your performance.

240
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,120
Xun An.

241
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,840
Soul Master.

242
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,660
What are you doing here?

243
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,000
Yaozijin.

244
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,360
His Majesty

245
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,620
milked His Highness the Esteemed Consort.

246
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,720
Madam,

247
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,820
一下 vostra to do

248
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,680
First consort did the 1962

249
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,780
her transition.

250
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,020
She turns ten at any age

251
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,440
and comes here to see Lord Fencheng.

252
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,920
The ladies from now on

253
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,980
depend on her for maintenance.

254
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,100
Going out of the palace after being promoted for half a year

255
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,460
will be'?

256
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,820
Only Dai Ming still has the fortune to marry clouds.

257
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,900
Don't you know that the late emperor

258
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,100
gets ill for lacking integrity

259
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,660
while he's just been rebuked for doing harm?

260
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,700
I like to promote requireailance.

261
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,580
and she's not happy with it.

262
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,060
No one will mention her

263
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,740
from now on.

264
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,420
Your Highness, I've said

265
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,620
you're kind-hearted.

266
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,220
Have you seen it?

267
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,100
You're already blinded by these evil women.

268
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,060
She's hiding her identity

269
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,300
and is serving you.

270
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,100
What's your purpose?

271
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,260
Don't be so self-conscious.

272
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,860
Mr. Hu,

273
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,220
we've been together for a long time.

274
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,620
I've done something evil.

275
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,020
Did you hurt someone?

276
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,580
You dare to say

277
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,700
you're hiding your identity

278
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,660
and are not doing anything wrong?

279
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,860
Your Highness,

280
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,980
this woman is a living hell.

281
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,140
She can't be disobeyed.

282
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,340
I know you're not being careful.

283
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,020
So I'm here to take care of her.

284
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,340
Guards!

285
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,620
Are you really going to kill me?

286
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,680
Mr. Hu!

287
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,900
Mr. Hu!

288
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,860
Mr. Hu!

289
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,860
theatrically burada you.

290
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,780
You tried to murder the concubine.

291
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,160
While grand assistant didn't apologise,

292
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,360
and still have to take revenge on myself.

293
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,680
Your Highness.

294
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
The evidence is here.

295
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,240
Your Highness.

296
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,080
Qianqian.

297
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,480
You want to hide from me.

298
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,000
Now you're lying.

299
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,800
You're ruining my life.

300
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,600
I've always thought you're a kind person.

301
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,920
But you're still trying to take revenge on yourself.

302
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,480
You must turn your back on Qianqian.

303
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,160
Have you lost your memory?

304
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,600
No.

305
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,960
Qianqian.

306
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,040
No.

307
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,400
He can't be a concubine.

308
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,720
We must kill him.

309
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,040
Qianqian.

310
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,960
Qianqian.

311
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,280
Qianqian.

312
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
Qianqian.

313
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,240
Qianqian.

314
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,160
After entering the palace,

315
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,400
I lost a sister.

316
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,560
When I saw you,

317
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,200
I felt so proud.

318
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
Before yesterday,

319
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I was still thinking

320
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,760
that you're such a smart girl.

321
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,680
You can't be defeated.

322
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,480
In the future,

323
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,840
I should leave the Yi-Bai to you.

324
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,200
So...

325
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,040
But

326
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,840
you've given me a operates trick,

327
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
so you've threatenedemp stars.

328
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,040
I have no choice.

329
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Do you think I can get you punished

330
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,360
for Layer Prince's sin today?

331
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,120
Be careful.

332
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,640
You're so stupid.

333
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,680
It's not good for a woman to be in the palace.

334
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,560
It's not good for her to be a nun.

335
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,920
I did all this for you.

336
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,840
Even if you don't do it for yourself,

337
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,840
you should consider it for your own good.

338
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,200
What are you doing?

339
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,960
Zi Jin, come here.

340
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,240
Are you okay?

341
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,360
Zi Jin.

342
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,520
Your Highness.

343
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,240
Take her away.

344
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,760
Your Highness.

345
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,240
Zi Jin.

346
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,040
If I didn't send someone to watch the Qingying Palace,

347
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,800
would you have kept me from doing this for the rest of my life?

348
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,120
Your Highness, don't worry.

349
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,120
Miss Yao is just too sick.

350
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,040
She's unwell.

351
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,920
She'll be here soon.

352
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,160
You may leave.

353
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,160
Yes.

354
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,480
I'll take my leave.

355
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,800
Your Highness.

356
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:22,960
Your Highness.

357
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,960
Your Highness.

358
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,840
Your Highness.

359
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,520
Your Highness.

360
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,240
Your Highness.

361
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,960
Your Highness.

362
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,840
Your Highness.

363
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,560
Your Highness.

364
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,240
Your Highness.

365
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,160
Your Highness.

366
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,800
Your Highness.

367
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,440
Your Highness.

368
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,080
Your Highness.

369
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,640
Your Highness.

370
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,160
Your Highness.

371
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,760
Your Highness.

372
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,440
Your Highness.

373
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:34,960
Your Highness.

374
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,640
Your Highness.

375
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,160
Your Highness.

376
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,800
Your Highness.

377
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,320
Your Highness.

378
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,000
Your Highness.

379
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,560
Your Highness.

380
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,160
Your Highness.

381
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,680
Your Highness.

382
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,160
Your Highness.

383
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,680
Your Highness.

384
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,280
Your Highness.

385
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:41,680
Your Highness.

386
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,160
Your Highness.

387
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,480
Your Highness.

388
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:42,960
Your Highness.

389
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,760
Your Highness.

390
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,480
Your Highness.

391
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:44,960
Your Highness.

392
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,960
Your Highness.

393
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,760
Your Highness.

394
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,760
Your Highness.

395
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,960
Your Highness.

396
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,560
Your Highness.

397
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,720
I have no explanation.

398
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,840
I'll leave now.

399
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,680
Yao Zi Jin.

400
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:56,800
No.

401
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,520
I forgot your surname is Yao.

402
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,200
Is it fake?

403
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,600
Your Highness is so noble.

404
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,760
When I saw you,

405
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,000
you were only ten years old.

406
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,400
Yes.

407
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,000
First time in the palace.

408
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,520
First time in the past.

409
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,280
How many years have passed?

410
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,080
Don't mention it.

411
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Who else remembers me in the palace?

412
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,280
The grandmother of the family

413
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,440
helped you to enter the palace.

414
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,480
Right?

415
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
Do you have the right to seek my servant's punishment?

416
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,560
I said

417
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,600
you can't call yourself a servant.

418
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm not a servant now.

419
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,640
Who else?

420
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,480
You entered the palace on purpose

421
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,640
to approach me.

422
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
What do you want?

423
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,920
Your Highness.

424
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,080
That year,

425
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,920
I went to the Buddha with my mother.

426
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,000
I met Madam Peng Cheng Bo in the palace.

427
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,000
After that,

428
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,520
she often entered the Sun's House.

429
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,280
And she was more strict

430
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,480
about my teaching.

431
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,920
Later, I found out

432
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,720
that she was trying to

433
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,480
protect the family's power.

434
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,880
She was also a girl

435
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:25,560
who was in the

436
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,680
Sun's House.

437
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,840
Eventually,

438
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,240
she picked me up.

439
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,840
Your Highness,

440
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,040
don't you like

441
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,480
playing chess with me?

442
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Do you want to play it with me?

443
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,600
Besides playing chess,

444
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm afraid of being in danger.

445
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I'm afraid of being in trouble.

446
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,040
I'm afraid of being in trouble.

447
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,200
I want to learn the essence

448
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,200
of what you like.

449
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,600
If not,

450
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
I'll be in trouble.

451
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm afraid that

452
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,880
living for you

453
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,400
is the only meaning

454
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,560
in my life.

455
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,080
I don't know about that.

456
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,120
Yes.

457
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,440
Such a trivial matter

458
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,960
can't be compared to your son.

459
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,560
You won't know

460
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,840
what happened

461
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
before I entered the palace.

462
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm afraid that

463
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,760
since I taught you

464
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,040
to be a good teacher

465
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,880
for the power of the Sun's House,

466
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,360
why did she...

467
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,120
She's not my mother.

468
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,520
She's my biological mother.

469
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,480
When I was little,

470
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,640
she was my mother.

471
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,040
But I never taught her once.

472
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,480
Because of her

473
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,880
and her status,

474
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,640
because of her beautiful and pure body,

475
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,960
we got along well.

476
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,040
She taught me to read,

477
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,720
write,

478
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,120
and play chess.

479
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,960
But she didn't let me teach her a lesson.

480
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,880
I had to take a break from it

481
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
and I didn't dare to do it.

482
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,280
She died.

483
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,200
She died for me.

484
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,440
As a person who is a grandchild,

485
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,000
how can I let others know

486
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
that her mother was born in a month?

487
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,800
She's a very proud person.

488
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,480
She never gave up.

489
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,760
But she did.

490
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,120
For my future,

491
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,440
for the sake of letting me

492
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,120
have a child who is not sick enough,

493
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,720
she learned to be herself.

494
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,200
Your Highness,

495
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,200
it's not just another person

496
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,480
who is sick and tired of you.

497
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,080
It's me.

498
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,160
It means my life is full of sacrifice.

499
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,800
It means her death is meaningless.

500
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,920
I don't want it.

501
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,360
I don't want to be a grandchild.

502
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
I just hope she can live.

503
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,880
I'm wrong.

504
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,440
The last thing I regret

505
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,240
is that when she was alive,

506
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
I didn't call her mother.

507
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,480
Zeyu.

509
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,640
Your Highness asked me

510
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,840
why I went to the palace.

511
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,480
Although Xu Shi was not my birth mother,

512
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,400
she was like my mother.

513
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,400
She treated me like a child.

514
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,760
She was sick and tired of me.

515
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,120
She was still angry.

516
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,960
She wanted to see me go out of the house in a hurry.

517
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,280
But in the end,

518
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,640
she waited for such news.

519
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,120
Your Highness,

520
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,840
because of this marriage,

521
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,240
I lost the most important person in my life.

522
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,640
So I have to go to the palace.

523
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,640
I have to see it in person.

524
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,800
How good she is

525
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,160
to replace me.

526
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,960
I want to ask you personally.

527
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,400
Where did I go wrong?

528
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,960
You're not wrong.

529
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,960
Everything is not your fault.

530
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,040
I promise

531
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,040
that I won't hurt you

532
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,200
from now on.

533
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,720
I promise.

534
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,760
Your Highness.

535
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,280
Your Highness.

536
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,640
Your Highness.

537
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,720
Don't worry, Your Highness.

538
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,440
You were going to punish the minister of the Hu family.

539
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,920
But Miss Yao said

540
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,080
that after the marriage,

541
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,400
I would like to ask you to be kind.

542
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,400
Your Highness ordered the minister of the Hu family

543
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,640
to go to the capital.

544
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,520
But if you do it again,

545
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,440
next time,

546
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,880
Your Highness,

547
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,000
I'll send you back to the palace.

548
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,360
Take care of yourself.

549
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,760
Yes.

550
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,120
You insulted her plainly.

551
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,960
You've Harmed Her Highness at the madon.

552
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,560
Now, you are satisfied that you've done it?

553
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,040
You're bearing the grudge with me.

554
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,100
Yeah.

555
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,800
Chief's bare face is awful.

556
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,920
Your Highness, please calm down.

557
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,240
Are you satisfied now?

558
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,920
I've never been so calm

559
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
to accompany someone.

560
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,600
Now I'm very scared to kill her.

561
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,000
It's for no one else.

562
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,120
You're still not replying.

563
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,360
Although she really has a marriage contract with Your Highness,

564
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,600
but now she's been married for ten years,

565
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,960
am I that heartless?

566
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,200
Can I tolerate the beauty of the harem?

567
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,880
Can't I tolerate her alone?

568
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,040
What are you laughing at?

569
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm asking you.

570
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,160
Why are you not meholding it?

571
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,280
The royal prince is in the siege of血 and

572
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,960
ezarak rule in His Majesty's bizт.

573
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,440
The prince啊 is now queen and

574
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,640
a general from a thoughtful wealthy family.

575
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,640
These women without family status

576
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,320
who are not even esaited

577
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,840
can have minimal care

578
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,000
if they are provided by His Majesty.

579
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,800
The royal prince and the Empress of Nebling

580
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
are Um �ено, Xu Huang and.."Th creation of power.

581
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,040
She washey not alone with her husband.

582
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,440
Forming a troop with love

583
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,640
had her deadly boomer.

584
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,880
To me,

585
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,840
even if a grand prince modelled himself

586
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,400
isn'tissy to your princess,

587
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,960
a couple is as enthusiastic as Leto played.

588
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,480
Your Highness,

589
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
let me tell you what.

590
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,960
The relationship between you and Leto

591
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,680
is not that great.

592
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,280
Your Highness, you're delussing with me,

593
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,160
yet Have you everən mind about Prince Qi of minorities,

594
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,000
But...

595
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,800
he's not like that.

596
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,120
Qi.

597
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,040
Don't forget that you were in pain.

598
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,080
You were hurt by the Crown Prince.

599
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,760
And you have a father-in-law.

600
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,560
Think about it.

601
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,760
I'm not lucky enough to be a father-in-law.

602
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,280
The Crown Prince will definitely

603
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,960
give birth to an infinite guilt and pity.

604
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,240
The only thing you should be lucky with

605
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,360
is your scores of fighting the ancestral huntsman beasts.

606
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,280
Otherwise it's ihnen reinforcement

607
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,200
who could have freestyle as your own talent.

608
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,160
Stop talking about it.

609
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,680
Among the latteraber,

610
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
they're constantly differing,

611
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,480
giving each other the time or session.

612
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:08,960
Now Empress Zhang

613
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,040

Eligible什麼就他的威囊。

617
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,760
But in this latteraber,

618
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,880
there's a great mayor

619
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
who is the Lord of theOffering Town,

620
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,440
He was young, beautiful and nervous,

621
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,300
so he also brought three princes to the palace.

622
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,040
After゜ literature, his majesty has now ein И lectures with atmosphere.

623
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,480
What the Empress is dreadful for?

624
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,160
Is shehir's compassion orジャ装's mercy?

625
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,720
You are shehir's rebellion than Empress.

626
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,080

You should wake up!

628
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,680
You would understand your situation in the Eastern Palace,

629
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,680
but my relationship lasted for the whole day.

630
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,360
Aren't you afraid that I'll do as you please?

631
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,320

married the CSF three times

716
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,320
As if itphemously

717
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,600
From now on we are more meagre

718
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:59,320
than prince

719
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,000
Master Qin

00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,360
you had promised me

721
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,280
Just mean everything to me.

722
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,040
How can we get Prince Her Majesty

723
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,320
to see the person

724
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,200
who even marry Empress?

725
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,640
I don't know.

726
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,800
Minister Jin,

727
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,480
it is not easy for you to make things happen.

728
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,720
Since he was lead of the female children,

729
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,320
his завzo đến here has granted many posts.

730
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,760
If we change additional ranks

731
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,200
before we know it,

732
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,280
we will be agitated.

733
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,120
You threaten me?

734
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,440
I dare not.

735
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,880
Just keep it a secret.

736
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,880
I told you earlier,

737
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,040
Jingquan is greedy and shameless.

738
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,840
You shouldn't have gone too far with him.

739
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,440
I was just taking the head of the royal family.

740
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,240
If I hadn't done something good to him,

741
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,720
how could I have recognized him so quickly?

742
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,720
The royal family is a person.

743
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,360
You shouldn't have done anything bad.

744
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,480
As a scapegoat,

745
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,160
you are a criminal for a few thoughts.

746
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,840
You are a criminal for being a criminal for others.

747
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,280
What right do you have to do that?

748
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,160
Wei,

749
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,560
you were not like this before.

750
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,600
I remember you said

751
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,200
there are many challenges,

752
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,440
but you won't forget the bottom line of being a person.

753
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,960
Do you still remember

754
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,560
what you said before?

755
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,280
The bottom line?

756
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,480
A person should step out of the first step.

757
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
If you step out of the bottom line,

758
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,280
it will be a matter of time.

759
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,080
But don't worry.

760
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,840
If something really happens,

761
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,600
I will bear it alone.

762
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,600
I won't hold you back.

763
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
This is Xiao Qi.

764
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,040
Please forgive me.

765
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,640
Please forgive me.

766
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,720
His Highness has always been

767
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,000
a fan of Fan Wen Ruji.

768
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,120
But

769
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,680
if he knew that

770
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,520
his father was in the capital

771
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
and was in a good mood,

772
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,880
he would be happy.

773
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,040
You are not talking.

774
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,600
It seems

775
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,600
you really hate me.

776
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,840
You think so?

777
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,240
This决定

778
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,920
is better being three-ARRATOR?

779
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,280
You want to go宫

780
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,400
where as the maximize

781
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,680
is not ready,

782
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,960
but can go to the same place

783
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,160
to shake off the control.

784
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,520
Take every condom

785
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,040
for should be 4

786
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,440
But I'll also find new talent

787
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,180
that'll save you from chewy blood for good.

788
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:10,780
Does that mean

789
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,520
you have anything else else to go on for?

790
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,580
Your Highness,

791
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,740
I would simply be there

792
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,780
to save myself.

793
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,700
I just wanted...

794
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,140
It's impossible for a woman

795
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,620
to marry someone else.

796
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,140
Get out of the house.

797
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
I have no reason

798
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,100
to die.

799
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,380
Listen to me.

800
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,380
It's impossible.

801
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,100
I won't let you go.

802
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,340
I don't care if you're Yao Zi Jin.

803
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,020
I don't care what you do.

804
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,820
I won't let you go.

805
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,380
Yun Qi.

806
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,860
Yun Qi.

807
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,180
Your Highness.

808
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,140
Take the rouge.

809
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:23,940
Yes.

810
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,020
Bye!

811
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:46,820
Don't did it.

812
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,860
I won't eat.

813
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,100
You don't say hello to me so greedily,

814
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,140
then you don't disobey me.

815
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,260
It's excuse.

816
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,980
What's wrong?

817
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,060
How could your heart be so shabby?

818
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,580
I don't even dare to say the truth.

819
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:00,980
Yes.

820
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,300
What?

821
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,620
It's all a lie.

822
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,140
I am a servant of His Highness.

823
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,860
I am a servant of the palace.

824
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,740
I brought all the bad luck to me.

825
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,300
Your Highness.

826
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,180
I hate you.

827
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,260
If His Highness doesn't kill me,

828
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,460
I will leave.

829
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:48,900
Yintan.

830
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,140
I am sorry.

831
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,860
I scared you.

832
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,620
Eat more.

833
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,380
Are you angry?

834
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,260
All right.

835
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,380
What a coincidence.

836
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,540
We meet again.

837
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
His Majesty is in the capital

838
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,500
at the school.

839
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,900
You are so rude.

840
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:17,140
This is the Crown Prince's token.

841
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,380
How can you punish him?

842
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,020
The emperor is in the capital.

843
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,020
How can the Crown Prince be rude?

844
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,740
Give it to me.

845
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,820
Your Excellency.

846
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,780
The bird flies in the sky,

847
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,900
the fish swim in the front.

848
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,180
These are all common things in the world.

849
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,820
Why didn't you go to the imperial court?

850
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,020
You forced the tiger to eat the food.

851
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,940
Your Highness, you helped Consort Zhu to get to the new court.

852
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,700
You borrowed the Crown Prince's hand

853
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,980
and passed the southern gate smoothly.

854
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:52,580
What a good method.

855
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,580
Too dependant

856
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,020
it's only a bad thing toExcuse me.

857
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,860
These newLaughing probability

858
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:58,780

00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:16,680
's view on the order però

860
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,320

861
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:19,720

864
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,700
I don't know how he's doing.

865
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,060
You have more secrets than I do.

866
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,100
Can you work with

867
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,980
the two secret people?

868
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:36,940
I'm kidding.

869
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,740
I can't do anything

870
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,180
for the sake of the throne.

871
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:42,860
You're not good at dealing with enemies.

872
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,580
I'm afraid you might lose your life

873
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,700
for Zhan Wenjiao and Bian Xian.

874
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,620
Think about it.

875
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:49,260
I'll wait for your answer.

876
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,340
Master Chou,

877
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,020
you are quick-witted.

878
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,420
Your empress will make you suffer

879
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,500
and make you suffer.

880
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,100
You were so loyal to Xiao Kuxing

881
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,820
when you cried.

882
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:15,700
You're dumb.

883
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,460
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

884
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:57,460
I'm afraid I'll be able to see you again.

885
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,460
