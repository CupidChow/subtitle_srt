take care of yourself.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I will go back first.

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Guard theא�Mour convert

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,040
Send him

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,360
go

35
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,200
From now on, I promise to cook by myself

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,460
Mang Shaoshi

37
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,220
What's there to do

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,560
iciiel?

39
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,340
Mauser has handed me

40
00:02:47,340 --> 00:03:01,420
theEMgy on a special줵

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,240
Why did Wu Yuan and Wu Gu suddenly not let me meet?

42
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,640
My Lord.

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,200
Someone stole the empress's spirit ring just now.

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,960
The secret king was locked up.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
Qin Yin Wei's barrier is more important than the royal family.

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,240
Is something wrong in the palace?

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,880
I've known the royal family's situation.

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,920
You go first.

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Go.

50
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,880
Go.

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,200
I'm sorry to tell the king of Han

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,440
that His Majesty is in danger.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
He knows what to do.

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,120
Yes.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,320
My Lord.

56
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,680
His Highness has saved Fan Zhang De.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,720
Is that true?

58
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,160
My Lord.

59
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,760
My Lord.

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,120
Found it.

61
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,080
Crown Prince Ping.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,320
Crown Prince Ping.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,560
His Highness said

64
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,600
if Crown Prince Ping comes,

65
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,760
he will keep you.

66
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,840
The addition of the celestial ring should be legal, right?

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,360
Had I state maintenance it in consideration,

68
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,480
I think we would build a talked world.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,480
Right.

70
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,240
I've done the laundry here.

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,360
Is this whatever the Empress said?

72
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,040
Aactors can be praticked good with regards to one person.

73
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,400
He owns this.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,520
I'll take care of it as well.

75
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,280
The plush-earth at the cuidado room

76
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,480
is deserted.

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,360
There is no place

78
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,320
If I can help,

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,920
she'll live for the honor to be my favorite beauty.

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
Don't you think?

81
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,320
Wait a minute.

82
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
You're asking me clearly

83
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,720
for an excuse.

84
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
I agree with you.

85
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,520
But last night,

86
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,120
you met your fiance on he 不要跑出去.

87
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,400
Taking her away is an excuse.

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
It's not for me.

89
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,240
I was just hiding a bit when many people came to see you.

90
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,640
Speaking of this,

91
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Hurry and catch him.

92
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
I got it.

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
You can leave now.

94
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Your Highness really loves the face.

95
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
You're so mysterious.

96
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
I'm afraid that no one will laugh at you.

97
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
It's a bit different.

98
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
What's wrong, Master?

99
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
This way.

100
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
The crown prince is going to be in trouble.

101
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
After the drama set,

102
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
forgotten for a day.

103
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
What if he does hit you?

104
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
What's wrong, bureaucracy?

105
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Everything is OK.

106
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
But I'm afraid I won't ruin your wedding

107
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
if I'm wrong.

108
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
It's not the same haha.

109
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,440
I've already sent you to the study.

110
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
Your Highness,

111
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
I went to the study to get some tea.

112
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,920
But I remember that

113
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
I made ten of them.

114
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,160
I only had nine of them left.

115
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,280
I didn't have half of them.

116
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,960
I don't know which one to steal.

117
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
I should hit him.

118
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,760
You should hit him

119
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,840
when you're still running in front of Master.

120
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,400
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,680
I'm just a part of it.

122
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,520
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

123
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,360
Little maid,

124
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,520
how dare you hide yourself here?

125
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,000
Hurry up and come out and apologize.

126
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,040
Master,

127
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,240
why don't we ask the official to come here?

128
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,640
What's the need for a little maid to be afraid of?

129
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,640
I'll go catch her.

130
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,360
Your Highness,

131
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
many people are asking about His Majesty's illness.

132
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,480
I...

133
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,160
I can only try to cover it up.

134
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,800
I can keep it for a while,

135
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,080
but it's not a long-term plan.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Before the Crown Prince returns to the capital,

137
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,760
the news must be leaked.

138
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
But now that the news is out,

139
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,480
the temperature is rising.

140
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,200
The news is still hot.

141
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,160
The news is still hot.

142
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,080
The news is still hot.

143
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
The news is still hot.

144
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
The news is still hot.

145
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
The news is still hot.

146
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
The news is still hot.

147
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
The news is still hot.

148
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm afraid.

149
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,240
Your Highness,

150
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,200
the news is ready.

151
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,000
Go.

152
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,960
and when will you end up with the Old Madam?

153
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,560
Yes.

154
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,080
I will go back to the city with you after I die.

155
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,640
I will wait

156
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,200
for my mother in BI.

157
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,080
I don't mean,

158
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,040
do not force me into doing this.

159
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,120
When you are dead,

160
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,760
worry for me.

161
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,560
Don't worry about me.

162
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,320
I understand.

163
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,400
I understand.

164
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,080
Your Highness,

165
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,000
you weren't heading directly to there this time.

166
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,360
Since it's already very late

167
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,880
I have to say something to her.

168
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,360
I have to tell your Highness that

169
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,640
she left me alone at the宮 for four days.

170
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:46,780
I told

171
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,120
Ming to wait for me

172
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Once His Majesty's news of the collapse of the family is leaked,

173
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
I...

174
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Eunuch Liu.

175
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
Make sure Yang Shiqi comes to the palace.

176
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Yes.

177
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Your Majesty.

178
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
You must help me.

179
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
Help your son.

180
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
No matter what,

181
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
you must wait for him to return safely.

182
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Is it true?

183
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Your Majesty is still fine.

184
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Why are you so sudden?

185
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Tell me.

186
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
What happened to Yonglinggong?

187
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Speak.

188
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Speak.

189
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Speak.

190
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Please help me.

191
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Please help me.

192
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
Tell me the truth.

193
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
I tell you.

194
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
I will tell you everything.

195
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Your Majesty.

196
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
Your Majesty.

197
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Your Majesty!

198
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Hurry and get someone!

199
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Physician.

200
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Hurry and get the doctor!

201
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Doctor.

202
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
Hurry and get the doctor!

203
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
Your Majesty.

204
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
Your Majesty.

205
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
You dare to touch His Majesty!

206
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Hurry and get him!

207
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Your Majesty.

208
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Your Majesty.

209
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,720
Your Majesty, you're so naive.

210
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,240
How could I poison her?

211
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,960
She was the one who sent the new emperor.

212
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,720
The queen killed me herself.

213
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,680
You shouldn't have escaped

214
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,000
if you poisoned her.

215
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,680
She's the queen.

216
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,440
She said every word she said.

217
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,120
I didn't have any chance to poison her.

218
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,680
Why did she die?

219
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,920
I was so confused.

220
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,560
I was so confused.

221
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,600
I...

222
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,280
I was so confused.

223
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,880
I was so confused.

224
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm like the crown prince.

225
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,480
But the future emperor

226
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,960
can only save me.

227
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,880
Only he can save me.

228
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,600
I know.

229
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,760
You may not believe what I said.

230
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,680
But I swear to you.

231
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,880
I didn't...

232
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
I didn't kill His Majesty.

233
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
I didn't kill His Majesty.

234
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,880
I'm not.

235
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,280
The queen

236
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,000
didn't die.

237
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,360
Did His Majesty

238
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,640
hit you or hurt you?

239
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,480
Noble Consort.

240
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,560
Nanny�도.

241
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,280
She kept her from catching me because of me.

242
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,720
Forced her to try to get some another person.

243
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,120
Save me.

244
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,160
Queen,

245
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,280
your maid

246
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,160
is already dead.

247
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,260
I hope you can come home early.

248
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,040
Otherwise, only a give-away form

249
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,160
will clear the world.

250
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,620
Kindaushing men!

251
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,080
Your Highness.

252
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,040
Your Highness.

253
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,080
Your Highness.

254
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,360
Listen to me.

255
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,760
I'll ask someone else to bring the clothes over.

256
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
Don't leave the study.

257
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
So nice.

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,720
Hurry.

259
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,160
Here I am!

260
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,400
I must ask my palace lover for any informant.

261
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,080
Keep at it.

262
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,780
Let's get the blame off you in the future.

263
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,160
My Lady,

264
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,160
does this need Imperial Noble Consort Guo to help you?

265
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,000
Your Majesty.

266
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,760
His Majesty is talking about those things.

267
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,480
She is right.

268
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,000
You are a man.

269
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
Your 니ension cares nothing about the truth.

270
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,520
But,

271
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,560
she listen to this bravado.

272
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,920
Your Highness,

273
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,120
please let the Empress know

274
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
how affectionate I must be.

275
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,940
You were still worried about His Highness, right?

276
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,840
His Majesty is a perfect heir.

277
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,660
After him setting a pulpit

278
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,780
we don't know how grand the motive will be for the first fewaticished carrier demands.

279
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,880
Compared with my father's fuckin immortal,

280
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,040
I resources my vomit.

281
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,400
The White River Clone's Mausoleum

282
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,920
used to use burning교 window characters

283
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,000
toி ar seasonal clothing on the themes of ovens.

284
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,120
connections allow him to escape.

285
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,520
But he must not stay in danger

286
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,560
whichever way he個ame.

287
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,880
Handle him more.

288
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,360
Yes.

289
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,680
Your Highness, the Minister of Pe cooking urgent report.

290
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,800

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Go! Go! Go!

292
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000

293
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000

295
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000

297
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Go! Go!

298
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Protect His Highness!

299
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Go!

300
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Go!

301
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Go!

302
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Go!

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Go!

304
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Go!

305
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Go!

306
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Go!

307
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Go!

308
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Go!

309
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Go!

310
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Your Highness!

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

312
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The Crown Princess is here.

313
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hurry and pack up.

314
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Why is the Crown Princess here?

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The tree branches used to be all the same.

316
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
After you came here,

317
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
you have a chance to grow up.

318
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Jin,

319
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
bring the Crown Princess tea.

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No need.

321
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Father and son are in harmony.

322
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I invited you to the Palace of Peace in the first place.

323
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's why you came here so often.

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Are you not happy

325
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that you are not even close to the person in your palace?

326
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Your Highness, before you leave the palace,

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
don't worry about the grass and the animals.

328
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I will come here often to take care of the tree branches and take care of the heart.

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't believe

330
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
that you have never found the meaning of the palace.

331
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You are still hiding something from me.

332
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This tree branch

333
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
except for a blue leaf,

334
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
three branches,

335
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
only the tree branches in this world

336
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
have nothing to hide.

337
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is that so?

338
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You really can't hide the Crown Princess.

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
His Majesty is ill.

340
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
This matter is important.

341
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't make any wrong decisions.

342
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

343
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If not,

344
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
you can go to Qianqing Palace to investigate.

345
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Don't you dare?

346
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then go to the Imperial Physician's Court to ask the Imperial Physician.

347
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Greetings, Crown Princess.

348
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Your Highness the Noble Consort.

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
If you didn't fight just now,

350
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
who would notice a face with a sharp nose?

351
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
A'Jing.

352
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Xiaojian.

353
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You can't take it anymore.

354
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Go back to the Palace immediately.

355
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's okay.

356
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's okay. It's okay.

357
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hurry.

358
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You two stay here.

359
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes.

360
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'll go to the Imperial Physician's Court.

361
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yes.

362
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Your Majesty is ill.

363
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll go in alone.

364
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You two stay outside.

365
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes.

366
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Your Majesty.

367
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Your Highness the Noble Consort.

368
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Continue.

369
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Your Highness the Empress.

370
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The mountain is very cold and the land is very humid.

371
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's very cold and severe.

372
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's time to go to bed.

373
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
The people are sad.

374
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We can start the operation.

375
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
We'll go to bed and cool down.

376
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Your Highness the Empress.

377
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Can you make some time to

378
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
bring the Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of Public Affairs

379
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
to get a report?

380
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
When they get a specific report,

381
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
the local people will be starving to death.

382
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What?

383
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Lord Yang doesn't agree?

384
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
When the Crown Prince returns,

385
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll call you back.

386
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Get ready to report.

387
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Lord Yang is here to report to you.

388
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You can leave after you finish.

389
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Your Highness the Empress.

390
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Lord Han and Lord Zhao

391
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and all the ministers of the court

392
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
have entered the palace.

393
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Your Highness.

394
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Isn't Lord Han in the wild?

395
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Why did he get the news so soon?

396
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Lord Han is here.

397
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Lord Han is here.

398
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Lord Han is here.

399
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Lord Han is here.

400
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Lord Han is here.

401
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Lord Han is really here.

402
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
heim.

403
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I beg that you rest in peace.

404
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Ride on.

405
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Lord Han can't treat you so well.

406
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
You can't do that.

407
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
General Day makes a great deal of achievements.

408
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Name the전.

409
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
Long time no see.

410
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,320
Please watch the official live show.

411
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,800
Why is it so scary?

412
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,760
Greetings, Sister-in-law.

413
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,960
I heard that there was a big event in the palace.

414
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,680
So I came back at night.

415
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,960
Now,

416
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,160
I don't know what's wrong with brother Huang's condition.

417
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,360
His Majesty's body is more cooked than cooked.

418
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,520
You both are crown prince.

419
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,020
Why did Wei Jing scary by studying,

420
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
leaving the Snow Manor after downfall?

421
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
My son-in-law will be arrested.

422
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,760
Let's call me your Majesty's successor.

423
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
It all will be realized.

424
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,760
Everything will be all right,

425
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,280
if any Symp Mongols destroyed the empire.

426
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,600
The prince Dollar BetaShizhu

427
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,080
señaled who shall be the heir.

428
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,400
I can never predict him to be back.

429
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Now, all the places are covered in rumors.

430
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Did you hear anything?

431
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,400
What rumors?

432
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Sister-in-law,

433
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,400
the capital is heavily affected by the rumors of His Majesty.

434
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
The crown prince is in Nanjing.

435
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
The imperial court is in the hands of the imperial court.

436
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
We are afraid that the rumors will be exposed

437
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
if we rush back.

438
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
The country will be in danger.

439
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Yes, Your Highness.

440
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,400
His Majesty is well-informed.

441
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Is he going back to the capital with the crown prince?

442
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Why can't we see His Majesty for days?

443
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
His Majesty is in the capital.

444
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
How could he be in the capital?

445
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,400
His Majesty just took the medicine.

446
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
He is already asleep.

447
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
The two brothers are in a hurry.

448
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
He must be tired.

449
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Why don't you go back and rest?

450
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
We will see you again.

451
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Sister-in-law,

452
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
look at my blood.

453
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,400
When I thought about the situation of the imperial brother,

454
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
I was so anxious.

455
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
I was so anxious that I couldn't stop myself.

456
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
I was so anxious that I couldn't stop myself.

457
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I was so anxious that I couldn't stop myself.

458
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,400
Yes, sister-in-law.

459
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,400
If you are afraid that so many people will go in and disturb His Majesty,

460
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
you can let us in.

461
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400
We can't just sit around and talk about it.

462
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Go back.

463
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Sister-in-law,

464
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,400
all of you are important officials of the imperial brother.

465
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
You are important officials of the imperial brother.

466
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
You are the third and fourth.

467
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
You don't want to see His Majesty.

468
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Is there any other reason?

469
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I want to see the imperial brother immediately.

470
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
If he is not here,

471
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,400
I am willing to punish him.

472
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,400
His Majesty needs to rest in peace.

473
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Who dares to be in the court again

474
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
and act according to the imperial brother's rules?

475
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
There is no brother in the world

476
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,400
who can't see his brother in front of the door.

477
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
You are so late.

478
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Aren't you afraid that if you go out,

479
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
people will not follow your orders

480
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,400
and you will be the only one to be in the court?

481
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,400
Zhu Gaoxu,

482
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
you are young and skilled.

483
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
You are the first one to be in the court.

484
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,400
You are young and skilled.

485
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
You are afraid of being rejected by the imperial brother.

486
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,400
You are afraid of being rejected by the imperial brother.

487
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
If I didn't plead for you,

488
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,400
your bones would have been broken by the whip.

489
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Third brother.

490
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Good morning.

491
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
You were a judge before.

492
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,400
If you didn't plead for your name,

493
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,400
I'm afraid you are not here today.

494
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
People say that you are as old as your mother.

495
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,400
When will you two be laughing at me?

496
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
The Eastern Palace is on the way back.

497
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
You can go to the capital in three or five days.

498
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Even if His Majesty is not recovered,

499
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
you can go to the Eastern Palace to see him.

500
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
You can rest assured.

501
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
You can go to the court again.

502
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
You are so stubborn.

503
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Who dares to be so bold?

504
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,400
Mr. Meng.

505
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Come here.

506
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Tell me clearly.

507
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,400
How is His Majesty?

508
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,400
His Majesty has entered the half-dried medicine porridge of God An.

509
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
He is indeed a little bit.

510
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
He is a little bit.

511
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Your Highness, please take the porridge.

512
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
Imperial Physician Sheng.

513
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Your Highness.

514
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
His Majesty has been ill for so long.

515
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Why is the medical case here?

516
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
The medical case is here.

517
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,400
The medical case is here.

518
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
The medical case is here.

519
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
If you go now,

520
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
you will be fine.

521
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
As long as you don't talk,

522
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
you will be fine.

523
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
As long as you don't talk,

524
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
you will be fine.

525
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
You are really...

526
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
You are really a little bit.

527
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Your Highness, please take the porridge.

528
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,400
I want to go back to the Imperial Physician.

529
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
I have an important thing to do.

530
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
I have an important matter to attend to.

531
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Please go.

532
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Thank you.

533
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
Please go back to the Imperial Physician.

534
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Thank you.

535
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,120
At night,

536
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,680
she won't go out.

537
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,120
Even better,

538
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,760
she won't go out.

539
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,080
Since the Fourth Moon is becoming shadow,

540
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,120
to be attacked by assassins.

541
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,800
What?

542
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,920
What's going on?

543
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,720
The Crown Prince is in trouble.

544
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,680
Lady Kun.

545
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,240
The phoenix body of Kongqing

546
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,320
is still not looking good.

547
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,480
My Lord.

548
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,560
This...

549
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,480
these are His Highnesses.

550
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,320
Mother.

551
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,000
How is it possible

552
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm not a good person.

553
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,320
This body is just a assassin.

554
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,480
Don't worry.

555
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,160
I'll take care of it.

556
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,360
Good boy.

557
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,160
I know you'll come back sooner or later.

558
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,600
Your Highness has returned to the palace.

559
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,600
You've taken the body to the palace

560
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,800
to make the Queen of the City suffer.

561
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,680
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

562
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,520
What's going on?

563
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,520
You really met an assassin on your way back?

564
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,000
Are you all right?

565
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,080
Are you hurt?

566
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,760
Did anyone find out who the Queen of the City is?

567
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
I'm willing to make a big mistake.

568
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,480
I've changed the route.

569
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,640
But the assassin is still in a hurry.

570
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,760
I'll just take care of it.

571
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,360
This...

572
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,440
Your Highness.

573
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Why are you looking at me like that?

574
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,200
I'm happy.

575
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,080
I'm happy to be able to speak.

576
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,160
The Crown Prince is brave and brave.

577
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,360
He should be able to control the people.

578
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,560
He's a good man.

579
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,680
Good.

580
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:35,920
Good.

581
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,840
Greetings, Crown Prince.

582
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,840
His Majesty!

583
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,220
Your Majesty!

584
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,640
Is it real!

585
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,960
My brother!

586
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,280
Your Majesty!

587
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,880
Your Majesty!

588
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:11,960
Your Majesty!

589
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,520
Where is the Crown Prince?

590
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,120
He's arrived.

591
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,960
He's coming.

592
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,060
before I acted on my own.

593
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,260
Father.

594
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,980
I have come.

595
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,180
Your Majesty!

596
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,760
those who will spare

597
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,800
the General's life

598
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,940
must be to be sacrificed.

599
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,620
His Majesty will take care of it.

600
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,240
Your Excellency,

601
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,680
您 have a look.

602
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,040
There's a wedding.

603
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,660
You go now.

604
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,500
Flower bounded in water.

605
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,120
As Your Majesty ordered,

606
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,400
handed over the Four Emperors of Feide's way,

607
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,200
manyeter such as Mr. Hong,

608
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,240
and others

609
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,080
will be conquered even before Han keep it.

610
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,880
As I have the royal palaces of the Grand Zong Emperor,

611
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,760
we will climb into Produce Palace's

612
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,600
stadt and

613
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,560
transfer in front ofignty

614
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,360
to Provhe marks to the future.

615
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,520
We don't need to waste any efforts

616
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,120
to be beaten by people on Не.

617
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,480
Minister and great Temple,

618
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,740
virtues,

619
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,440
embroiderers from suddenly to the late.

620
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,080
Lee Poems must not be spared in the mid-term too.

621
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,640
We must have a lord know how to send our Khais before bamboo l throughout the whole Luanbu city.

622
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,480
Zhang Zi returned to the imperial court

623
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,360
and visited several empress officials.

624
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:15,760
The alltsåusbas offered many eyebrows and기른

625
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:29,080
of the две

626
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:42,380
for the rest of his life.

627
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,800
I think

628
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,840
we should begin.

629
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,160
Next time I'll clean the house today.

630
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,720
I order that

631
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,080
while the乾 was still alive outside

632
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,800
Your Majesty.

633
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,320
Your Majesty.

634
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,960
Consort Jing's grandfather,

635
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,200
King of Zhongwu, Zhang Yu,

636
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,600
was the prime minister of the country.

637
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,640
Fengtian was in a difficult situation at that time.

638
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,880
He was the first to be promoted.

639
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,760
Consort Jing's father,

640
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,720
Zhang Fu,

641
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,400
was the prime minister of the country.

642
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,960
He was the daughter of the former emperor.

643
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,240
He was allowed to be promoted.

644
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,800
Yes.

645
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,000
Mother.

646
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,560
The daughter of the former emperor

647
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,040
is the daughter of the former emperor.

648
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,520
It's not necessary

649
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,640
to give birth to three children for my father.

650
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,840
The daughter of the former emperor

651
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,400
should be with you.

652
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,000
Why?

653
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,040
Mother.

654
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,960
Please tell me

655
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,200
why you didn't give birth to three children.

656
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,240
You're overthinking.

657
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,400
Your Majesty.

658
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,480
Your Majesty.

659
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,080
Your Majesty.

660
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,480
Your Majesty.

661
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,120
Your Majesty.

662
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,400
Your Majesty.

663
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,200
Come here.

664
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,760
Come here.

665
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,440
Your Majesty.

666
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,720
Father

667
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,640
loves the Noble Consort.

668
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,560
She has been

669
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,840
raising Zhang Yu

670
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,960
for a lifetime.

671
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,040
How could you

672
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,400
give your father

673
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,880
the poisoned wine?

674
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,280
Noble Consort Guo gave it to Mother.

675
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,840
She gave the poisoned wine

676
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,200
to Mother herself.

677
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,760
Go.

678
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:44,960
Master,

679
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,500
light the kitchen.

680
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,180
It's time to mail it

681
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,760
from Consort Dong.

682
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,900
Isn't it free enough

683
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,940
for you to stay at home?

684
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,280
You should celebrate

685
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,600
the new palace in the future.

686
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
You can still be so happy.

687
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:55,600
Why not?

688
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,600
Tell me.

689
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,720
Where has the former Babe

690
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,800
been?

691
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,920
The Mansion has been destroyed.

692
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,040
They're lost

693
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,360
at their families.

694
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
That's why

695
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,920
they're hurt.

696
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,920
The family has rewards and rewards.

697
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,840
They are not welcome here.

698
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,720
Then...

699
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,120
Where are they going?

700
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,640
I have something urgent.

701
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,720
You don't say I won't let them.

702
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,760
You know who they are.

703
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,320
Then...

704
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,520
I'm the one.

705
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,820
I'm afraid some people ما

706
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,500
are going to do something stupid.

707
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,240
Please don't make a promise.

708
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,400
The

709
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,720
Fair Lady is the only one who got killed.

710
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,440
You should be careful.

711
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:02,780
Gu Solin.

712
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,040
I beg you,

713
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,340
don't be flustered, ok?

714
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,620
Since she was handheldly murdered by the B

715
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,620
but a living person is hiding in the warm-hearted room.

716
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,620
We can't really find out what's going on.

717
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,620
It's just that the harem is not safe.

718
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,620
Who would be so unscrupulous if there's no revenge?

719
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,620
The Crown Prince has said that he's going to beg for mercy and find a way.

720
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,620
Perhaps, our friendship can save Noble Consort's life.

721
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,620
Ungrateful!

722
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,620
Let go of her!

723
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,620
Sister Wu!

724
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,620
Let her go!

725
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,620
Noble Consort Yan's wedding day is not your day!

726
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,620
I don't care anymore!

727
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
I don't care anymore!

728
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,620
Noble Consort Yan's wedding day is not your day!

729
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
It's you! Please help me!

730
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,620
Help me to get the Crown Prince's brother!

731
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,620
Don't let me have the heart to do the test!

732
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,620
I'm not good to you! It's my fault!

733
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,620
Please help me!

734
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:51,620
Help me!

735
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,620
The Crown Prince is in a bad mood.

736
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,620
I beg you!

737
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,620
Please don't!

738
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,620
I beg you!

739
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,620
I beg you!

740
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,620
Please help me!

741
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,620
I beg you!

742
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,620
I beg you!

743
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,620
I beg you!

744
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,620
I beg you!

745
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
Please help me!

746
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,620
Please help me!

747
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,620
I've been kneeling for the whole day.

748
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,620
I beg you!

749
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,620
I beg you!

750
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,620
You're not a humble person.

751
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,620
I beg you!

752
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,620
Besides, this is the order of the Empress.

753
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,620
Please help me!

754
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,620
Lord You,

755
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,620
I have a favor to ask you.

756
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,620
The sun has come out from the west.

757
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,620
You're asking for something?

758
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,620
It's not something. It's a request.

759
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,620
The new emperor is in a hurry.

760
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,620
Lord You, please bear with it.

761
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,620
You're just a slave.

762
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Please give it to me.

763
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,620
Please help me!

764
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,620
Help me!

765
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,620
Such a good thing.

766
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,620
You really miss me.

767
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,620
Tell me.

768
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,620
Please help me!

769
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,620
Help me!

770
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,620
Tell me the truth.

771
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,620
Please help me!

772
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,620
Help me!

773
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,620
Help me!

774
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,620
Please help me!

775
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,620
Please help me!

776
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,620
I'll protect you by my own hands.

777
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,620
I'll keep you safe.

778
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,620
Don't let me suffer.

779
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:54,620
That's your first time, right?

780
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,620
If you want to die together with me,

781
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,620
I should bear your humiliation.

782
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,620
This late!

783
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,620
Let's cook this meal to your liking.

784
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,620
Let's support the emperor with 6 Oxels!

785
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,620
I thought

786
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:17,620
I was waiting for this moment to leave the fire rain

787
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,620
I dream of you for a long time

788
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,620
I don't want to follow your heart

789
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:27,620
I thought

790
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,620
I will always be with you

791
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,620
I will always be with you

792
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,620
I will always be with you

793
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,620
I will always be with you

794
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,620
I will always be with you

795
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,620
I will always be with you

796
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,620
I will always be with you

797
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,620
I will always be with you

798
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,620
I will always be with you

799
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,620
I will always be with you

800
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,620
I will always be with you

801
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,620
I will always be with you

802
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,620
I will always be with you

803
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,620
I will always be with you

804
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,620
I will always be with you

805
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,620
I will always be with you

806
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,620
I will always be with you

807
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:26,620
I will always be with you

808
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,620
I will always be with you
