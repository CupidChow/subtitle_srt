The world is full of love and passion

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The whole world is full of love and passion

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The game is a little bit complicated

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The game is a little bit complicated

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The game is a little bit complicated

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The game is a little bit complicated

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The game is a little bit complicated

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The game is a little bit complicated

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The game is a little bit complicated

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The game is a little bit complicated

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The game is a little bit complicated

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The game is a little bit complicated

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The game is a little bit complicated

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The game is a little bit complicated

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Today is a special stage touchdown

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
May you have a look at the game

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,340
Production & EP hertz

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,980
Now afterALL we can't compare with those 有谁不动搗

23
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,900
Your Highness can see, it'll be tearful at that moment!

24
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,020
Am I supposed to call you a man with a bad posture?

25
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,100
What twisty thing to learn, Yan Qi...

26
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,240
Do I really let my guard down?

27
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,020
I'm always laid back...

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,700
added by the 1200s

29
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,140
The filming season is about to start

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,780
Yaodi, celebrated in her PMV 2018

31
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,340
Over 200 km from here

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,460
Yaodi is going to deliver you into today's content

33
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,820
Your Majesty

34
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,880
But I will be alone.

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,980
Help myself.

36
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,100
Xia Xing,

37
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,640
watch out.

38
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,240
My lady,

39
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Long live Your Majesty.

40
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,620
Why did Your Majesty know that I'm here?

41
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,820
Because you don't like Yongning Palace.

42
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,260
What do you mean?

43
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,260
Because I don't like it either.

44
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,940
Then I'm kind of

45
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,700
to find out the truth for Your Majesty.

46
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,740
Why would Your Majesty

47
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
be so nice?

48
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,740
Nonsense.

49
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,060
I'm just a child.

50
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,660
If you do this,

51
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,380
I'll think

52
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,180
you're willing to

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,700
give her the heaven poison.

54
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,180
I'm afraid Your Majesty will be confused.

55
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,940
I think you're just

56
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,900
a child of the same kind.

57
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,700
Isn't that the same for you?

58
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,060
What's wrong with me?

59
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,100
Your Majesty promised me

60
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,940
that you wouldn't treat me as a servant.

61
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,580
So,

62
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,860
I'm just being affectionate.

63
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,540
It seems that in your heart,

64
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,940
I'm not as good as that jar.

65
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,900
I'm just...

66
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

67
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,980
The emperor's law of the emperor

68
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,180
is not fair to the harem.

69
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,300
Your Majesty doesn't allow anyone to be a servant.

70
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,980
If you agree to the Empress Dowager's advice,

71
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,100
you may listen to it.

72
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,060
As for the rest,

73
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,580
it's time to learn from her.

74
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,500
Right?

75
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,460
How dare you!

76
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,340
Your Majesty wants to hear me tell the truth.

77
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,180
But you're the master of the Ninth and Fifth Sect.

78
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,980
You're the master of the world.

79
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,420
I can't even

80
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,620
say the truth

81
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,700
in front of you.

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,980
Why?

83
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,660
Your Majesty is looking at me.

84
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,380
You can't be affectionate

85
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,620
even if you're a flower.

86
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,580
If you have a chance,

87
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,340
you'll be in trouble

88
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
if you cry.

89
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,660
You've been busy

90
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,420
with the palace and the high-ranking officials.

91
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,260
But I did

92
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,660
the little thing myself.

93
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,020
Your Majesty,

94
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,540
I always hope I can treat you sincerely.

95
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,260
But I said what I wanted to say

96
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,580
and what I wanted to do.

97
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,980
You're so generous.

98
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,140
It's so hard to call you that.

99
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,020
What do you think?

100
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,980
Besides this book,

101
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,820
I'm a good person.

102
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,580
But here,

103
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,340
you're the one.

104
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,700
I'm the one.

105
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,140
You're like a dream.

106
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,060
In my opinion,

107
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,580
as a concubine who is loved by the pet,

108
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,500
I have no choice.

109
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,180
Isn't that right?

110
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,340
Your Majesty,

111
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,100
many people have taught me

112
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,420
in the past years

113
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,500
how to be honest and patient,

114
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,540
how to be happy with Your Majesty.

115
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,860
But in the day of the High Court,

116
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,300
I realized

117
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,140
I'm a person.

118
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,220
Everyone has their own opinions and ideas.

119
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,660
Maybe they'll be ashamed of you

120
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,300
and even offend you.

121
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,220
But I like myself like this.

122
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,260
Even if Your Majesty wants me to go back,

123
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,860
I can't.

124
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,700
But this is me.

125
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,820
You have to understand.

126
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,380
If you treat me equally,

127
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,460
I'll be different

128
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,980
from your requirements.

129
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,500
I'm afraid...

130
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,340
I'm afraid you'll be too embarrassed

131
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,100
to take some responsibility.

132
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,900
Or I'll become invisible.

133
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,380
Tell me these edifyingasy words.

134
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,620
Your Majesty.

135
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,020
You good.

136
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
It receives the sneeze pattern.

137
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:23,940
OK.

138
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:34,900
Good work.

139
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,900
His weeping sounds.

140
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,780
I've no better words than him.

141
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,100
masters and pediatrics.

142
00:09:43,100 --> 00:10:07,500
Did you take such a luck Create the disrupted

143
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:08,760
of function

144
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,500
to protect the eternal

145
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,820
Everyone is locked up in the palace.

146
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,580
They are crying and sad.

147
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,300
But when I tried to talk to her during the day,

148
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,380
she never remembered what happened.

149
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,300
Why didn't she report it earlier?

150
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,540
Your Highness,

151
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,500
how can such a thing spread out?

152
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,220
I should be punished to death.

153
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,940
How can you be so stubborn?

154
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,660
Did I force her too hard?

155
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,900
Your Highness,

156
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,500
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

157
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,300
Let me filter it out.

158
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,940
Fine.

159
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,900
My son is a famous bystander here,

00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,380

Let's meet.

186
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,240
Once upon a time,

187
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,040
there was sunshine that flew all over the world.

188
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,560
Whatever happened during treatment throughout treatment,

189
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,920

Let's go.

192
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,360
School shall be the first,

193
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,120
the honorable and re-educated school shall be held

194
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,680
and to be welcomed in by everyone.

195
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,120
She goes and makes a decision.

196
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,960
Imperial Noble Consort.

197
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,400
You're pushing forward so much before winding it up.

198
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,480
It's下imeth کی.

199
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,080
Imperial Noble Consort,

200
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,760
just stop acting like you don't have enough indoors.

201
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,720
What if I do?

202
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,560
Imperial Noble Consort!

203
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,400
It's curfew!

204
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,760
Get up.

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,800
Your Highness,

206
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,120
you're really not to blame.

207
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
It's good that you're not to blame.

208
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,360
Get up.

209
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Noble Consort,

210
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,880
can you still come to your palace often

211
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,000
to forgive me?

212
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,720
You bring your skin and fat.

213
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,680
Come here with me.

214
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,640
Last time, our song

215
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,680
hasn't been finished yet.

216
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,720
I'll come again tomorrow.

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,240
Tomorrow is not enough.

218
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,240
Her Highness the Empress is ill.

219
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,240
We should visit her.

220
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,480
Her Highness the Empress is ill?

221
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,840
Noble Consort?

222
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,020
In the second night

223
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,600
out of nowhere,

224
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,140
we were meeting with the Prince of GuJack.

225
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Give me some clothes.

226
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
Noble Consort,

227
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,920
place the veil around that

228
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,960
redeem the veil.

229
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,380
You're like a witch that

230
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,060
retains truth.

231
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,440
Her Highness the Empress,

232
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,940
she's extremely upset

233
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,600
about that other thing.

234
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,520
Noble Consort,

235
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,120
If you take the wrong direction,

236
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
you'll be in trouble.

237
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,560
But Fu Jiang

238
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,480
is the only one who is afraid of being lost.

239
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,760
Don't be biased against them.

240
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,000
Think about it.

241
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
Just like the flowers in the garden,

242
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,800
if you don't give water to the wet concubines,

243
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,720
the human heart will cry.

244
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,840
You must have the heart of the unloved,

245
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
the heart of the tolerant,

246
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,720
and the light of the pure heart.

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
They will also report to you like flowers.

248
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,920
Do you understand?

249
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,960
You are so good to anyone.

250
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,920
But the human heart is the hardest to predict.

251
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
If you want to visit the empress,

252
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,120
we can't just stand there.

253
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,640
Yes.

254
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,360
Jin.

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
What are you doing?

256
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,520
You are fat and cold.

257
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,520
This way.

258
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,120
Please drink the river water.

259
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,040
Go on.

260
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,040
Your Majesty.

261
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,520
我

262
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,040
60, 60 ordinary students,

263
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,960
45 who aren'tocracy students

264
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,200
winds down their careers amok.

265
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,680
According to court orders,

266
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,640
DevOps and values should be discussed.

267
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,880
We raise our people as foundation.

268
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,800
The entire court

269
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,320
records those in fact lines.

270
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,520
There are hundreds of fewer than Python and (*dwałingen jarction*)

271
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:36,840
the number of drunken andbé outnumbered겠어요c яes

272
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,320
the changes in the version of the countries.

273
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,560
No more than 70 or 90 are taken.

274
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,120
The palace staff around all states

275
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,920
are tortured from being isolated and laid down.

276
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
The guards here

277
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,960
aren'tession,

278
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,760
but Two-TemptWeaver system

279
00:16:47,760 --> 00:17:08,800
perhaps we should relay some

280
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,960
another report.

281
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,900
An ophysiac,…

282
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,460
Before I waste the coins,

283
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
let Xu An and Ancha Si

284
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,380
conduct a investigation.

285
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,140
If you encounter any trouble,

286
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,660
you don't have to wait for the third investigation.

287
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,660
Just investigate it.

288
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,660
Yes.

289
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,300
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

290
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,660
Forget it.

291
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,500
You're not used to

292
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,140
this kind of work.

293
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,260
Call Yuanqi here.

294
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,380
I thank you for your kindness.

295
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,940
Why are you looking at me like that?

296
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,980
According to Your Majesty's temperament,

297
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,140
I've already brought

298
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,620
the official of the Ministry of Rites here.

299
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,220
Besides,

300
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,860
Eunuch Yuan has been kneeling for several days.

301
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,100
His Majesty doesn't want to set him up.

302
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,020
What's the good thing about it?

303
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,220
His Majesty is so happy.

304
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,180
What?

305
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,100
Did I wash the fish?

306
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,780
No.

307
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,300
I'll tell you.

308
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,060
You're not that old.

309
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,300
You're not good at acting.

310
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,620
Go on.

311
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:17,980
Yes.

312
00:18:42,260 --> 00:19:04,580
Takehearted

313
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,400
graduates

314
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,540
Greetings, Your Majesty

315
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,760
Your Majesty

316
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,300
Treaty lawress

317
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,020
invites the master to come to Kunning Palace

318
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,560
She doesn't do many female Innovations

319
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,200
What's the purpose?

320
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,340
Your Majesty

321
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
Unson and First 就是

322
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,260
saw the master metres each bag

323
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,060
He must heroise you

324
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,580
to be a loving person.

325
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,260
She still remembers me?

326
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,740
She must be a true love.

327
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,740
I must be careful.

328
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,820
Her Highness the Empress took a pill

329
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,860
and just took a break.

330
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,620
Please go for a walk.

331
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,380
When Her Highness the Empress wakes up,

332
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,620
I'll tell you immediately.

333
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,820
What disease did Her Highness the Empress have?

334
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,060
Why isn't she even seeing me?

335
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
Let's go back first.

336
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,500
I'll come back to the imperial exam later.

337
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,340
It's okay.

338
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,940
Chuzi,

339
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,220
why did you give the Empress

340
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,380
the medicine to send her to the Imperial exam?

341
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,980
It's going to be a lot of trouble.

342
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Your Highness the Noble Consort!

343
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Your Highness the Noble Consort!

344
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,700
Your Highness the Noble Consort!

345
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,060
Wait.

346
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,060
Put it down.

347
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,820
I'm sorry.

348
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,700
You don't have to be sorry.

349
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:14,900
Wang Dylan.

350
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
What happened?

351
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,220
The four ponies and families

352
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,700
who were taken away

353
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,900
by外 minded wrongdoers

354
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,020
including Xue Luo and theameda have all been brought home.

355
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,100
Why?

356
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,980
I heard

357
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,380
the Imperial thin pantries for the Empress

358
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,540
would be done on time

359
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,980
due to the ER's recruitment.

360
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,180
Your Highness the Noble Consort,

361
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,260
I'm always College Lady.

362
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,460
Please save them.

363
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,700
Who sent you here?

364
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,060
After you are released

365
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,300
Do you have any trouble at All industries?

366
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,100
While you working at All,

367
00:21:49,220 --> 00:22:00,500
Some money for her

368
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,420
If only you can hear that

369
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,140
Why bother to ask her mother for help

370
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,740
Then just take it

371
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,940
Then I'll ask for help

372
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,260
Your Majesty.

373
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,460
This is the punishment.

374
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,620
A punishment, huh?

375
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,060
Your Majesty.

376
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,100
First, branches,

377
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,680
pastries haveciót

378
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,780
and are causing trouble in the late emperor.

379
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,420
Ты living a low life

380
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,100
was髮質,

381
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,900
carrying out some good plays.

382
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,600
winning

383
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,420
makes everyone know

384
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,800
we gained blindly.

385
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,740
The eunuch sent a clinic

386
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,940
I pay no attention to your short speech.

387
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,720
Isn't this the rule?

388
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,660
As for Attorney County Governor Ding Yan,

389
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:50,340
the Governor has spent more than你知道 and is already free to go to яrish pae xian.

390
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,740
His Majesty has tipped off.

391
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,820
I'm not creating any trouble.

392
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,340
Delivery order.

393
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,660
All Imperial Physicians in the Qi region thought that

394
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,540
I'm innocent.

395
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,380
I'll be guilty later.

396
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,340
Your Majesty,

397
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,620
I'm here to see you.

398
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,180
Your Majesty,

399
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,820
I'll go back first.

400
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,980
The binding hand.

401
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,580
Show you the binding hand.

402
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,900
How marriage terperson is tasty?

403
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,220
Madam,

404
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,420
this video,...

405
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,820
Miss Xiaomin.

406
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,220
I dare not move anything from you.

407
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,100
and talk to Her Highness.

408
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,260
Yes.

409
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,340
I...

410
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,940
I want to tell someone.

411
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,420
Noble Consort Sun.

412
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,340
Yes.

413
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,940
I want to tell Noble Consort Sun

414
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,260
that she and the Imperial Court

415
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,540
are doing a secret plan for the child.

416
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,100
They're trying to harm Her Highness the Empress.

417
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,860
I saw it myself.

418
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,380
Your Highness,

419
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,300
please make it clear.

420
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:29,860
Take it.

421
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,140
Your Highness,

422
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,660
I can do it.

423
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,220
I'm telling you the truth.

424
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,060
Your Highness,

425
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,820
I can do it.

426
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,900
I...

427
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,940
Thank you for your kindness.

428
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,260
I don't believe that

429
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,900
the seal is only for real.

430
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,900
Whether it's Yin Sishan

431
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,900
or the maid who reported you,

432
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,860
you must be careful

433
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,380
and check the details.

434
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,660
Yes.

435
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,500
It's okay.

436
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,460
But...

437
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,020
Give me her shoulder position.

438
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,180
G concerts over the next few hours.

439
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,180
Thank you for your reminder.

440
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,100
The kitchen insun.

441
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Who would ever consider

442
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,020
as similitudes in Noble Consort's body?

443
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,420
It's just aistes.

444
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,420
Noble Consort,

445
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,660
if I were 91,

446
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,580
stop acting.

447
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
Why did you

448
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,660
betray Noble Consort Guo?

449
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,660
Because she can never get back up.

450
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
One more thing.

451
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
I know that Meng Shanggong

452
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
is busy with the palace court seal.

453
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
I'm sorry.

454
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,660
I have to get back the whole army

455
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
from the internal exchange.

456
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
I can't do anything about it.

457
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
But

458
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,660
the original plan

459
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,660
is not in the other place.

460
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,660
It's in the castle.

461
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
You should go back and check it out.

462
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Your Highness.

463
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
I just came here.

464
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Jin.

465
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
Come here.

466
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,660
Your Highness.

467
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,660
You can't...

468
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,660
You go now.

469
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,660
Yes.

470
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
Master.

471
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,660
Why don't you beg His Majesty?

472
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,660
Go.

473
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Your Majesty.

474
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
The food delivery is here.

475
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,660
Your Majesty.

476
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
You are finally drunk.

477
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
You hurt your stomach.

478
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
Your stomach is not well.

479
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,660
I have asked the doctor to give it to you.

480
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
From 300 to 100 grams.

481
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
It's in a good quality.

482
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,660
It's worth more than 100 grams.

483
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,660
Your Majesty, please use it.

484
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,660
This is white sugar powder.

485
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
It's high in fat.

486
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,660
It's high in fat.

487
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,660
It's high in phyllo.

488
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,660
It's high in red.

489
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
It's high in flower.

490
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
It's high in fat.

491
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,660
It's high in fat.

492
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
It's high in fat.

493
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,660
It's high in phyllo.

494
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,660
It's high in fat.

495
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,660
It's high in phyllo.

496
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,660
Or you can try this.

497
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,660
It looks like tofu.

498
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
It looks like tofu.

499
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,660
It tastes like...

500
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,660
Your Majesty.

501
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,260
This is made with sweet and sour

502
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,660
and fresh milk.

503
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Noble Consort once told me

504
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,660
that His Majesty doesn't like sweet and sour tofu.

505
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,660
But the new man's tofu

506
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
tastes like sweet and sour tofu.

507
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
It tastes even better.

508
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
Did you know Noble Consort before?

509
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
I didn't.

510
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,660
But

511
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
I used to be a maid

512
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,660
when I was in the royal court.

513
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660
Actually,

514
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,660
this is the hardest dish

515
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
in the Yinsishan.

516
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
I just took it

517
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
to offer the Buddha's offering.

518
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,660
I'm sorry.

519
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,660
Your Majesty, please spare Yinsishan.

520
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,660
Even though Yinsishan

521
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,660
has the guts to do it,

522
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,660
he doesn't dare to harm

523
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
Her Majesty.

524
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,660
Her Majesty?

525
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
How dare you!

526
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,660
You're talking nonsense in front of His Majesty.

527
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,660
You can't continue.

528
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,660
Speak.

529
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,660
Speak clearly at once.

530
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Yun Zhou.

531
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,660
Yes.

532
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,660
You're the one

533
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
who's in charge of the Kunjing Palace.

534
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,660
All the people who are involved

535
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,660
in the case

536
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,660
are in the same position as the government.

537
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,660
Before the matter is settled,

538
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,660
no one should ask about it.

539
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,660
I'll leave it to you.

540
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

541
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,660
I'll report to Noble Consort now.

542
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,660
No need.

543
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,660
Your Majesty.

544
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,660
I heard you went to visit the Empress.

545
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,660
How is she?

546
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,660
I was in a bad situation.

547
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,660
I didn't see Her Highness the Empress.

548
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
What else?

549
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,660
What else?

550
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,660
I made a marriage proposal

551
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
for Her Highness the Empress.

552
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,660
I'm sorry.

553
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,660
I'm sorry.

554
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,660
I'm sorry.

555
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,660
I'm sorry.

556
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,660
I made a marriage proposal

557
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,660
for Her Highness the Empress.

558
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,660
There's not much left.

559
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,660
These?

560
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
The long-awaited dish.

561
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
A piece of sugar.

562
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,660
It's very delicious.

563
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,660
It's delicate and delicious.

564
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,660
It's sweet and sour.

565
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,660
It's fragrant.

566
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
Your Majesty.

567
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,660
Have a taste.

568
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
You really don't have anything to say to me?

569
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
I want to say

570
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,660
if Your Majesty is interested,

571
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
you can visit the Empress.

572
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660
If Your Highness sees the Heaven Yan,

573
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
you'll be very happy

574
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
and you'll be very well-off.

575
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,660
Use these leftovers

576
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,660
to develop me.

577
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,660
This is a good thing.

578
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
You can keep it.

579
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
Your Majesty.

580
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
I'll go to the Empress.

581
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,660
Your Majesty.

582
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Don't you like to eat walnuts and sugar?

583
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
What do you like to eat?

584
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
I like it.

585
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,660
Your Majesty.

586
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
Your Majesty.

587
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
How should we investigate this case?

588
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
How should we investigate this case?

589
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
I don't mean that.

590
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,660
The criminal who tried to kill the brother

591
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
in the prison

592
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
didn't even open his mouth

593
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,660
and only did it this time,

594
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,660
while he was the Empress.

595
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,660
He was the empress.

596
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
He was the empress.

597
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
He was the empress.

598
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
He was the empress.

599
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,660
He was the empress.

600
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
He was the empress.

601
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
He was the empress.

602
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,660
He was the empress.

603
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
He was the empress.

604
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,660
The empress sent someone to ask

605
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,660
if His Majesty was watching.

606
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,660
It's not easy.

607
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Besides,

608
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
the decision of the harem

609
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,660
is just to see how the case goes.

610
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
The Sun is in the head of the fish.

611
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,660
It's a bit of a problem.

612
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
How should we handle it?

613
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Please explain it to me.

614
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,660
Use the heavy force.

615
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,660
Your Majesty.

616
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Your Majesty.

617
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Get up.

618
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,660
No.

619
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
Be careful.

620
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
No.

621
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
Go.

622
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,660
No.

623
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
No.

624
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,660
I found a small item in the box yesterday.

625
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
I just can't show it to you.

626
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,660
Can you help me?

627
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
I said so.

628
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,660
Zijin.

629
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,660
Help me.

630
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
Help me.

631
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Eat.

632
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,660
Master.

633
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,660
This is the jade果 skin you want.

634
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,660
Mother.

635
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Kneel.

636
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
I told you to kneel.

637
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
Don't you understand?

638
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,660
What did you do wrong?

639
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
What are you doing?

640
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,660
Actually, I've thought about it.

641
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Mother.

642
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,700
What are you doing?

643
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,740
I've thought about it.

644
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,620
But I still have hope.

645
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,900
I hope it's not you.

646
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,300
You're going to win the silver screen

647
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,660
and compete with the fair.

648
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,660
Who thinks you can use such a despicable means?

649
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,020
Do you know

650
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,900
how many innocent people

651
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,460
will be implicated in your actions?

652
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

653
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,380
You don't know.

654
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:01,980
If you don't know,

655
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,820
I'll beat you to death.

656
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,740
Get off me!

657
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,180
Su Yuanwang,

658
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,380
when did you become

659
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,020
the mother of the present?

660
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,180
It's all thanks to you.

661
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,860
Me?

662
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,860
Don't look at me like that.

663
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,340
You're the one

664
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,540
who's not qualified to be my wife.

665
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,820
For so many years,

666
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,420
you've been trying to enter the palace

667
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,500
to get my husband.

668
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,260
To protect the common sense,

669
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,580
you've been doing things

670
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,020
that my master has done.

671
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,980
What's wrong with me?

672
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,380
I'm just learning from you.

673
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,020
I'm telling you not to worry about anything else.

674
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,820
Otherwise, I'll go to the Empress Dowager

675
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,220
and tell her about our relationship.

676
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,260
I'll also say

677
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,020
that I'm just

678
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
sotto.

679
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,180
That's not what I mean.

680
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,300
Your Majesty.

681
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,260
Your Majesty.

682
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,660
Empress, His Majesty is gone.

683
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,940
You'd better take a long rest first.

684
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,820
I believe he will show mercy.

685
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,380
If you really want to avoid anger,

686
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,120
you should keep

687
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,940
killing and trappingAt the king's feast table.

688
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,900
They won't rebel and celebrities,

689
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,720
so you shouldn't be so strong like them.

690
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,440
Geneva.

691
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,360
Go to bed.

692
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,640
Go out.

693
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,680
I'll call you out.

694

695
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,240
Your Majesty,

696
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,320
do you remember

697
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,500
what you once said to me?

698
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,640
For the Humans and the Poison,

699
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,420
you should be separated from the rat.

700
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,280
However, you must care about the loved one after her.

701
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,360
How can you man MG Love

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,000
Everything is going well.

704
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,280
Your Highness,

705
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,200
you are so smart.

706
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,160
But you are too soft-hearted.

707
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
Her Highness is very sensitive to your situation.

708
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,800
She believes in you deeply.

709
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,200
She has been

710
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,920
kind to you.

711
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,160
You don't need to prove anything.

712
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,320
As long as the rumors are not true,

713
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,040
you can make a decision.

714
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,400
As for

715
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,160
Your Highness,

716
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,000
Her Highness will be angry with her.

717
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,360
It's not your fault.

718
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,040
At such a critical moment,

719
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,240
please don't be soft-hearted.

720
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,200
I want topling you from me.

721
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,800
You have been

722
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,560
asing Her Highness for the past ten years.

723
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,320
Do not rely on her.

724
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,760
Stop thinking ahead.

725
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,320
You

726
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,160
do not need to believe in me.

727
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,200
I did.

728
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,280
If you become like my ghost,

729
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,840

730
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,400
What!

Mr. Su of Xu'an.

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,880
Ms. Rong' 100 years old said

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,900
let us take him black.

735
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,380
Let us sleep.

736
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,980
Get home.

737
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,580
Are all the tablets ready?

738
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,440
I took the confession both sides of the street

739
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,360
believed it's true

740
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,200
if anyone is behind on it

741
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,860
he should seek life

742
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,080
since the transactions

743
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,700
involved this is the result

744
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,560
Your Majesty

00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,020
Her Majesty sends someone toモ

750
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,300

what are you planning to do?

754
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,360
What's Your Majesty's task

755
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,700
and what's your task

756
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,820
Now that I've held you back you're greatly poisoned.

757
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,620
What use do I have to do?

758
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,400
Your Majesty.

759
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,360
My case can be even moreolie

00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,040
They'll get the next Emperorμε

764
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,600
tomatoes are on theRich.

765
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,960
It'll be hard as a bum.

766
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,740
I don't believe

767
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,620
I will see

768
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,140
when she can last.

769
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,620
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

770
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,940
I have to ask the murderer

771
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,140
for the final evidence.

772
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,060
Is that so?

773
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,180
Your Highness,

774
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,940
I have a word with you.

775
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,980
You should go to Kunning Palace now.

776
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,220
Call me here

777
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,100
and I will be there in no time.

778
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,340
Kunning Palace?

779
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,340
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

780
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,740
Then kneel in front of the Empress Dowager and His Majesty

781
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,860
to make yourself at ease.

782
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,500
Finally,

783
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,380
you should get rid of Yin Sishan.

784
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,580
Is that so?

785
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,020
Your Highness,

786
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,180
isn't it time for you to say something?

787
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,060
Do you think I'm always saying something?

788
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,460
Today,

789
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,020
I ask you two to come here.

790
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,340
I want you to see something.

791
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,380
This is jade.

792
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,060
Jin.

793
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,420
This is the fruit of the meat-chewing.

794
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,860
The fruit of the meat-chewing

795
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,220
is made of skin and stomach,

796
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,540
stomachache and stomachache.

797
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,020
It's just a small thing.

798
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,460
The medicine and cooking process

799
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,980
must be kept outside.

800
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,820
But the poison of the cure

801
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,540
is only in the skin of the fruit.

802
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,820
The porridge is made of the kind of medicine.

803
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,820
The amount of the poison is very mild.

804
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,500
Plus, the herbal medicine

805
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,980
has strict control of the medicine.

806
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,540
Then,

807
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:24,300
where did this jade come from?

808
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,780
Your Highness,

809
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,940
you are too handsome

810
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,500
to say that.

811
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,660
The jade of Kunning Palace

812
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,300
was built by the Empress Dowager.

813
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,300
Who dares to report it to the Imperial Physician?

814
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,260
Plus, the doctors who tried to cure the jade

815
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,580
have three mouths.

816
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,060
All of them have no mouth.

817
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,620
The punishment of the jade silk fan

818
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,700
is also true.

819
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,500
If they can't make it,

820
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,220
I can take the medicine myself.

821
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,300
Yes.

822
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:05,780
I will take the medicine.

823
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,900
I will take the medicine.

824
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,700
I will take the medicine.

825
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,140
I will take the medicine.

826
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,660
I will take the medicine.

827
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,060
I will take the medicine.

828
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,300
I will take the medicine.

829
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:16,620
I will take the medicine.

830
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,820
I will take the medicine.

831
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,180
I will take the medicine.

832
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,380
I will take the medicine.

833
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,540
I will take the medicine.

834
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,660
I will take the medicine.

835
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,740
I will take the medicine.

836
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:24,860
I will take the medicine.

837
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:25,980
I will take the medicine.

838
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,140
I will take the medicine.

839
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,380
I will take the medicine.

840
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,580
I will take the medicine.

841
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,940
I will take the medicine.

842
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,140
I will take the medicine.

843
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,340
I will take the medicine.

844
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,420
균济能何归

845
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,540
扭粹

846
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,420
欲笔

847
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,900
冷门何归

848
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,020
遙墜

849
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,740
爱的怎么通电究竟

850
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,860
是谁

851
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:58,540
孤儿

852
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,500
狼狈

853
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
I'm not afraid of you.

854
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,500
I'm not afraid of you.

855
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
I'm not afraid of you.

00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
I'm not afraid of you.

857
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
I'm not afraid of you.

858
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
I'm not afraid of you.

859
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
I'm not afraid of you.

860
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
I'm not afraid of you.

861
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,500
I'm not afraid of you.

862
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,500
I'm not afraid of you.

863
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,500
I'm not afraid of you.

864
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
I'm not afraid of you.

865
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,500
I'm not afraid of you.

866
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,500
I'm not afraid of you.

867
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,500

00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500

871
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
I'm not afraid of you.

872
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,500
I'm not afraid of you.

873
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
I'm not afraid of you.

874
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
I'm not afraid of you.

875
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
I'm not afraid of you.

876
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
I'm not afraid of you.

877
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,500
I'm not afraid of you.

878
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
I'm not afraid of you.

879
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,500
I'm not afraid of you.

880
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,500
I'm not afraid of you.

881
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
I,

882
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
thought,

883
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
have

884
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
thought,

885
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
did not

886
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
have

887
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
thought,

888
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
have

889
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
thought,

890
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
have

891
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
thought,

892
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
have

893
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
thought.

894
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Have
