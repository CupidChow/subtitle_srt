I'm a little bit tired

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm a little bit tired

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm a little bit tired

I'm a little bit tired

I'm a little bit tired

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm a little bit tired

I'm a little bit tired

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm in a dream

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 1

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Your Highness, is there a dirty room on my face?

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're just like me

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm going to misunderstand

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Or I'm going to be a crazy person

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because of my appearance

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Your Highness, you're finally smiling

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Usually, when I enter the door

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Your Highness always smiles

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
talvez

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Infinity

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Infin장을

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Your Highness

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,480
Where is he, 가는 crowd- thereby

30
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,160
Your highness,

31
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,840
you must brush this cream onto your dry skin.

32
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,360
Why you must marinate it with cream?

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,280
Ji Ye!

34
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,480
Mother...

35
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,420
playback.

36
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,420
He,

37
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,480
pourquoi did you

38
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,700
leave him to be off duty?

39
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,520
As for your words,

40
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,400
the food for meat needed on a lot of different hot

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
mention it,

42
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,740
like pork,

43
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,100
��πгорθге,

44
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,700
and different flavor.

45
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,280
The wayWeishers bake different meats

46
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,360
must also added.

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,280
Like,

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,600
a StarFront's...

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,440
I've been waiting for a long time.

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,560
Don't take it anymore.

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm getting old.

52
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,120
Father.

53
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,720
Be careful of the soup.

54
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,880
The chicken is not crunchy.

55
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:30,600
Your Majesty.

56
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,200
The beefs needs to bearthed by theaves.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,200
The first bite of it mustル be crunchy.

58
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,260
If it's grandeury,

59
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,580
I bet they won't be within his scope anymore.

60
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,060
Yes, Father.

61
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,660
and you'll die at the castle or...

62
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,060
Father...

63
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,580
Do you still remember it?

64
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,380
I somed someone to send you the grilled lamb.

65
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,980
Were you the first person to train with it

66
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,820
so you don't want to hurt or thwart?

67
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,820
It tastes better.

68
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,660
I've taught you.

69
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,500
You've taught me?

70
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,140
You said that the lamb you grilled last time

71
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,060
was burnt.

72
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,700
You can't get into the barbecue.

73
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,020
Because it was the first time

74
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,740
I came to the barbecue myself.

75
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,940
I didn't have any experience.

76
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,220
These are Saintックs.

77
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,060
By the way,

78
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,780
this meat is very oily.

79
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,980
You'd feel chịTy

80
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,200
after eating it before.

81
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,660
Just consider it, Mr. Si.

82
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,600
they can produce iron fire

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,120
and enhance its flavor in hot days.

84
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,480
Your Majesty adjustment the power

85
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,160
by the fire age of using theViolence螖 ESP,

86
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,000
as long as it matches with counselors,

87
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,680
theusta can lower coldness

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,160
and reduce溫mass,

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,000
What's more,

90
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,440
on that day at the banquet,

91
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,200
선치지거 당場 and connective food

92
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,060

93
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,320
Your Majesty,

94
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,920
I prepared dinner for you sufferedly.

95
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,980
Chou эксперim, do you read the composition?

96
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,280
Uh...

97
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,160
What's this?

98
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,000
Your Majesty.

99
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,860
Your Majesty, please have a tortoise.

100
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,560
It's like A Guository of Fish Hoix.

101
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,740
His Majesty said that

102
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,280
Kurt came in

103
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,200
with minced meat, mushrooms,

104
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,620

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,580

106
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,000
egg lily,

107
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,600
ground pork,

108
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,400
because of the stuffed inside.

109
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,420
And the vàlnce.

110
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,960
Although part of them are grilled,

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,520
it's simple.

112
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,580
Influenced unsosteriously.

113
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,300
This grilled salmon

114
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,940
is cut oil based on the 1975 hurry

115
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,660
It's so delicious.

116
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,140
If I do not drink more for you,

117
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,420
my stomach will get all over my face.

118
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,340

119
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,700
Weose the carnival.

120
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,020
Yeah.

121
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:38,700
Gr金,

122
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,700
greatest glory,

123
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,780
and the famous auspicious step.

124
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,920
As for myself,

125
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,120
I rather make money than to serve the emperor.

126
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,280
In the area that is left,

127
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,200
we used to work for some business along the way to land.

128
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,700
I don't wish to lose my wealth,

129
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,940
but I want to progress quickly,

130
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,200
but I worked in no situation.

131
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,760
I need you.

132
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,240
If there are any jobs southwest.

133
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Zijian, don't take my path.

134
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,520
Your Highness.

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,100
Let's go.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,800
Go and have a look.

137
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,400
Your Highness,

138
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,440
I'm not good at using my right hand.

139
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,880
Forget it.

140
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,080
Let's try anyway.

141
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
I was afraid someone would kill someone.

142
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,720
It caused my injuries.

143
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,200
I don't want to be Ведьong.

144
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,400
Why get me that녀앙肉?

145
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,920
It's clotted【Buddho Mizan】

146
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,600
from the Marquis in Hulumu Temple.

147
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,000
Do you like it?

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,720
Your highness.

149
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
Did I dare not say anything?

150
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
Please say it.

151
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,560
The lord and child是 reincarnation of the heart.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,240
This sword imm corporate 雷

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
has become aappa who was found in the Late ...

154
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,560
The lord is admitting his father to songs

155
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,040
and the emperor is the book's son.

156
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,920
There is still a need for you and the empress

157
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,800
all of those years,

158
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm only afraid that Your Highness would even think

159
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,600
Your Majesty was able to achieve concerts without delay.

160
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,920
You are well into that task.

161
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,120
Of course in your heart,

162
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,880
a cardобbi like that would be missing from His Majesty.

163
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,280
We're totally in love.

164
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,200
You must be very bold.

165
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,040
You didn't even hold her hands.

166
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,960
Lordity.

167
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,900
If we go back to the drop,

168
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,200
the two governmentMa women retodol

169
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,520

00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,180
fixing up the confrontation in the war.

171
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,340
Those who are soon coming in

172
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,160
have all been conducted along the way.

173
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,960
We will expect

174
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440

00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
That's what Third Master said.

193
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,480
There's just one thing.

194
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,680
Mother, why are you here?

195
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
I heard you're in the school to get your wound healed.

196
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,600
I came here to see your father.

197
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,280
You're a child too.

198
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Why didn't you tell me about your wound?

199
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,480
I'm worried about you.

200
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,640
It's my fault.

201
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,560
Come on.

202
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Continue.

203
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,560
Your Majesty, I'm not a coward.

204
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,760
I deserve to die.

205
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,440
It's okay.

206
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,200
I won't blame you for what you said today.

207
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,520
Your Majesty.

208
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,000
It's okay.

209
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,840
This bold girl

210
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,920
said that your skills will be a great help.

211
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,520
I didn't ask you.

212
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,160
You said that I couldn't finish my skills in three days and nights.

213
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I just can't handle it.

214
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,240
What's the matter?

215
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,760
A little girl

216
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,400
dares to talk about the emperor's plan.

217
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
It's time to make a move.

218
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:18,880
Say it.

219
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,920
Your Majesty,

220
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,320
I've been listening to the trial and error.

221
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,520
They said...

222
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,000
They...

223
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,520
Say it.

224
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,680
They said that the court and the court

225
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,640
have been punished.

226
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,680
But the poor and innocent women

227
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,520
are all punished.

228
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,000
Shut up.

229
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,840
Say it.

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,200
They will be implicated

231
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,920
or separated from the court.

232
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,040
They will be slaves to the court.

233
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,120
Even some people will be implicated.

234
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
They will die.

235
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,120
When His Majesty ascended the throne,

236
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
he was sent by the people

237
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
to the world.

238
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,160
His Majesty is as good as a beggar.

239
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,120
He can even be forgiven by the sinners.

240
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,720
But

241
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,960
the light of the war

242
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,160
can reduce the suffering in the world.

243
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,920
No wild goose could break off the line.

244
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,640
Father.

245
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,000
She is nothing but foolish.

246
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,160
She was listenser than him.

247
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,680
I know the meaning of the people.

248
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
We have the state!

249
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,560
but it's addictive to Schl Christian跌 the light of the world!

250
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,560
I can't stand it.

251
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,560
I'm a man of my own.

252
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
I'm a man of my own.

253
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
I'm a man of my own.

254
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,560
But the person who is in charge of the case is so ridiculous.

255
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
He is so strict and brave.

256
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
He is so filial.

257
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,560
He has a good official and a good face.

258
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
He is so filial.

259
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,560
He has a good official and a good official.

260
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
How could I blame him for what I said?

261
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
You are the most punished for your reward.

262
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
You are...

263
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Your Majesty.

264
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
I'm the head of the Shang's Bureau.

265
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Your Majesty is kind to you.

266
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I'm grateful to you.

267
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
I thank you.

268
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,560
You have a good health.

269
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,560
I'll go to Nanjing after the recovery.

270
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

271
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Your Majesty.

272
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,560
The family of the rebel was the order of the Emperor.

273
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Now, if I forgive them,

274
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,560
they will not be the order of the Emperor.

275
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
The Empress Dowager and the daughter of the palace

276
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
can't do anything outside the palace.

277
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Since you are asking me,

278
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
I have to do it.

279
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
When His Majesty was 11 years old,

280
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
he was placed next to the Emperor of the Taizu.

281
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,560
He naturally guarded the ancestral information.

282
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
The people's ancestral information is good.

283
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
The family of the rebel is a man of the imperial family.

284
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
He is not punished by the Emperor.

285
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
In the future, the son of the emperor

286
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
will be the emperor's son.

287
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
He can't be punished by the Wang family.

288
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
He will be the one who will not be punished.

289
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
He will be the one who will not be punished.

290
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,560
The daughter of the palace is the one who will not be punished.

291
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
His Majesty forgave them at this time.

292
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
That's why he is really looking for the ancestral information.

293
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Your Majesty.

294
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Your Majesty.

295
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Did you

296
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,560
have these words in your heart for a long time?

297
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Although the palace maid was bold just now,

298
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
she said what the Emperor thought.

299
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
As the Empress of the Emperor,

300
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
I should be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one.

301
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Anyway,

302
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
the officials in the prison

303
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
have been exposed to the danger.

304
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
The family has been sent out to call for a private visit.

305
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
The imperial guards and the imperial guards

306
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,560
are all angry with the Xi's generals and the officials.

307
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
If there is a person who is loyal to the imperial family,

308
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
and has the great power,

309
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
he will be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one.

310
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
He will be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one.

311
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Your Majesty, you are wise.

312
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Your Majesty.

313
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,560
I am leaving.

314
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
You can use me.

315
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
Your Majesty.

316
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
His Majesty suddenly arrived.

317
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,560
I was also busy and unaware.

318
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
Think about it.

319
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
When I got injured in the concert,

320
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Father would definitely come personally.

321
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
I was so busy that

322
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
I couldn't get along with him.

323
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
I am so busy that

324
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
I couldn't get along with him.

325
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,560
Your Majesty,

326
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
I will definitely come personally.

327
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
You already guessed that he would come.

328
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Your Highness.

329
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
You were so busy that

330
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,560
you couldn't find your father in the north.

331
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Your actual purpose

332
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
is to get the girl's permission from the imperial guards.

333
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Your Highness, you are mistaken.

334
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
You really have wronged me.

335
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
How dare you?

336
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Tell me the truth.

337
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Your Highness,

338
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
those innocent girls

339
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
who were wronged by the family

340
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
were being taken as the bandit.

341
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
They were being taken as the bandit

342
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
and were insulted by the people.

343
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
They were so unfortunate

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
that they were like my mother.

345
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,560
Your Highness,

346
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
I have helped you.

347
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
If not for that,

348
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
you have already gone to Nanjing.

349
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
I shouldn't have given you the rabbit.

350
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
I should have given you the rabbit.

351
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
I should have given you the rabbit.

352
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
You are acting like a good girl in front of me.

353
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,560
You are being honest and honest.

354
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
I...

355
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
You are lying.

356
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Your Highness also lied to me.

357
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
What?

358
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Your Highness said that you wanted to let me go.

359
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Did you tell the truth?

360
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Your Highness was angry with me

361
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
and didn't read the military book.

362
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
You don't know what it is.

363
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
You are so generous.

364
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
It's just to make my heart beat faster.

365
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,560
Now that there is nothing else,

366
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,560
I must take my leave.

367
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
It's true that you are angry with me.

368
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Let you go.

369
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
It's also true.

370
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Your Highness,

371
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
what are you doing?

372
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Don't push me.

373
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
I have an urgent report.

374
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
Your Highness, you are busy.

375
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Your Highness.

376
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Your Highness, he came in by himself.

377
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
It can't be helped.

378
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,620
Your Highness

379
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,360
Your Highness,

380
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,560
thanks

381
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
thank you for冥卜

382
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,180
for protecting me.

383
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,140
You are very kind to Your Highness

384
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,480
and kindly fulfill my wish.

385
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Give me an air of satisfaction.

386
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
I ensure

387
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
well Definite

388
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
to drop by

389
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,120
We'll have a party tonight.

390
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,520
Okay?

391
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Okay.

392
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,760
Okay.

393
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,400
We've all been

394
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,120
over the moon.

395
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,840
Sister Yao,

396
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,920
do you want to teach us

397
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
how to be a teacher?

398
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes.

399
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,800
Teach us.

400
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,960
Teach us.

401
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,360
Teach us.

402
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Sister Yao, teach us.

403
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:09,800
Teach us.

404
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,320
Yes.

405
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Teach us.

406
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,120
Sister Yao, teach us.

407
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Teach us.

408
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Teach us.

409
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Teach us.

410
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Let's go.

411
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Let's go.

412
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Let's go.

413
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,520
Yao Si Shan,

414
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,000
Your Highness the Empress, please.

415
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,400
Yao Si Shan, don't move.

416
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,320
Let Jiang Si Yao

417
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,040
help you to know

418
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,880
how his medical skills

419
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,440
are better than the medical skills

420
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,760
of the medical staff.

421
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,560
ン

422
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,520
Jiang Si Yao,

423
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,600
how is it?

424
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,560
Your Highness the Empress,

425
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,600
please check

426
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,960
Yao Si Shan's own right hand

427
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,240
is widelyouldered.

428
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,880
Once he has,

429
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,320
you'll have to click

430
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,080
and not frown too much

431
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,080
He's healthy, but he's a bit selfish.

432
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,080
I know that he's tired from working all day.

433
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,080
As long as he's resting, it's not a big deal.

434
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
I'll open some music bowls,

435
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,080
and then I'll be fine.

436
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Please.

437
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Congratulations.

438
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
What's this?

439
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Come in.

440
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
Stop him.

441
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
Let me go.

442
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Let me go.

443
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,080
Lin.

444
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
Madam.

445
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Come in.

446
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,080
I'm here to serve the Crown Prince.

447
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,080
The best way to use it is to open the coffin.

448
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Madam.

449
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Crown Prince?

450
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
Madam.

451
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,080
The Crown Prince needs to be served before the ceremony.

452
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,080
It's not easy to do it.

453
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,080
The Empress has told me to serve you.

454
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Yes.

455
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Donggong is a state-run state-run state.

456
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Why do you have to send people to serve?

457
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
If it's the Crown Prince,

458
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,080
how could he send the right-hand man to serve?

459
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Didn't the Great Zhang Qi Gu tell the people who the empress is?

460
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
It's a little bit of a struggle.

461
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Your Majesty, don't be too clear.

462
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
I'm the one who's responsible.

463
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
You're not recovered.

464
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
You're not sick.

465
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
Your Majesty,

466
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
everything is because of the lack of evidence.

467
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
It's my fault.

468
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Please forgive me for three days.

469
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
I'll investigate it again

470
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
and find the real behind the scenes.

471
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Please.

472
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
The Crown Prince is here.

473
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Father.

474
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
I sent someone to check the room.

475
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
I just got the news.

476
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
The fire-resistant craftsman on the mountain

477
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,080
was killed by someone at the celebration dinner.

478
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
In the future,

479
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,080
the father and his people were killed by the fire-resistant craftsmen.

480
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
He didn't only blame the people,

481
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
but also the craftsman who was unlucky

482
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
and the man who was in the house.

483
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
He also escaped the interrogation of the Imperial Guards.

484
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
No wonder

485
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
the craftsman who was interrogated this time is a living person.

486
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Who would suspect a dead person?

487
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Your Majesty,

488
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
he must have the evidence.

489
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
His master

490
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,080
was the old man in the Prince of Han's Mansion ten years ago.

491
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
Prince of Han?

492
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Are you all right?

493
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Your Highness.

494
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
You were seriously injured.

495
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
You came to my side.

496
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
I should thank you.

497
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
The play of the wrongful craftsman is so tragic.

498
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
His Majesty only went to the palace to be angry

499
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
before he died.

500
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
His Highness should not be worried.

501
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
He was just a different person.

502
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I was worried that someone would take the chance

503
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
to take the chance

504
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
to fire the fire-resistant craftsmen.

505
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
I was worried that

506
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
His Majesty would be angry

507
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
before he died.

508
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,080
I was worried that

509
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
someone would take the chance

510
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
to fire the fire-resistant craftsmen.

511
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
Your Highness, be careful.

512
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Don't be too careful.

513
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Take good care of yourself.

514
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Take good care of yourself.

515
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,080
You can take it out.

516
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Okay.

517
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Be careful of the arrangement.

518
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
Okay.

519
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
The arrangement is one layer by layer.

520
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Don't look for the one who likes to play with hands and feet.

521
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
You can't go out.

522
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,080
I am also the leader of the Shang's Bureau.

523
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
Leader?

524
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
A swordsman.

525
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
He only did it once.

526
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
But I will give you

527
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
some money

528
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
if I grow up in the Shang's Bureau.

529
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
Your Majesty.

530
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
Your Majesty.

531
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
It's windy here.

532
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Let's go back earlier.

533
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
I am so bored recently.

534
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Let's go.

535
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Lord Liu,

536
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
you are so tired.

537
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Lord Liu.

538
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,080
Your Majesty is still worried about the assassin.

539
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
His Majesty is here.

540
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Why don't you come in?

541
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
The Shang's Bureau has a high score.

542
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
I am willing to give it a try.

543
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
You are so thoughtful.

544
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

545
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,080
Why are you so thoughtful?

546
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
How is it, Su Sishan?

547
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,080
I don't know

548
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,080
if you can be happy with His Majesty.

549
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,080
It seems that

550
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,080
I am really looking at you.

551
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Isn't it?

552
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
His Majesty is very considerate.

553
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
If there is a good food

554
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
or a good game in the future,

555
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
I will be the one to give it a try.

556
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
You are so insensitive.

557
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
You don't know medicine.

558
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
How can you take care of His Majesty?

559
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
It's just a new feeling in your mind.

560
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
When the new feeling is over,

561
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
how can you wake him up?

562
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
Then you should look carefully

563
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
how I am in Qingyun.

564
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
It's crazy.

565
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Where is Zi Jin?

566
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
No one can control Yin Ziping except him.

567
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Where is he?

568
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
What are you doing? You are out of the palace?

569
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Your Majesty.

570
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
You...

571
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,080
What are you doing?

572
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,080
I am tired.

573
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Li.

574
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
Li.

575
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Old Madam.

576
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Old Madam.

577
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Go find them all.

578
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
Old Madam.

579
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,080
Be careful.

580
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Be careful.

581
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Be careful.

582
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,080
You can't go out.

583
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
I will not leave you.

584
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,080
I will go to the palace.

585
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,080
I am going to the palace.

586
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
You are too tired.

587
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
You are too tired.

588
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
You are too tired.

589
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
You are too tired.

590
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
Be careful.

591
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,080
Be careful.

592
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
All of them.

593
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Find them all.

594
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Okay.

595
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
I will find them all.

596
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
I will find them all.

597
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
Old Madam.

598
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,080
I will go to the palace.

599
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,080
Li.

600
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Old Madam.

601
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Be careful.

602
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
Li.

603
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Grandmother.

604
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,080
You are in the palace.

605
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Why didn't you tell me?

606
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
Your Highness.

607
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,080
No need to worry.

608
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
I know where the grandfather is looking for.

609
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
Really?

610
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Didn't you hear that?

611
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
Grandmother is looking for Li.

612
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Bring her out.

613
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Yes.

614
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
Grandmother.

615
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
I heard you shouting.

616
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,080
I think you are looking for this cat.

617
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
No.

618
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
Old Madam.

619
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
His Highness personally gave this to me.

620
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
It's called Yan Tai.

621
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
Grandmother.

622
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
I have something important to do.

623
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,080
You should go back and rest.

624
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
No.

625
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
Come on.

626
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,080
Come on.

627
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Come on.

628
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
Come on.

629
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Come on.

630
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Come on.

631
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Come on.

632
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
Come on.

633
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
Come on.

634
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
Come on.

635
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,080
Come on.

636
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
Send Old Madam back.

637
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Your Highness.

638
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Be careful.

639
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
Your Highness.

640
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Your Highness.

641
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
I...

642
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
Come out.

643
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Cheng Wu.

644
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Grandmother just left.

645
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
Bring her back.

646
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,080
Yes.

647
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Your Highness.

648
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Where did she go?

649
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
What's the meaning of this?

650
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,080
Why do you have to be so afraid of me?

651
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
Li.

652
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,080
Li.

653
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,080
Li.

654
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
All day long,

655
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,080
I was walking around.

656
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
Mrs. Peng Cheng followed me.

657
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
I was so helpless.

658
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
I borrowed your book.

659
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
No matter what,

660
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
they can't search here.

661
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Please forgive me.

662
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
You even dare to use me.

663
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Why are you so afraid of her?

664
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,080
Your Highness, do you remember

665
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
I was seriously ill

666
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
and had a stroke?

667
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
The imperial physician in the palace

668
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,080
was so careless.

669
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
If it weren't for Old Madam,

670
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
she wouldn't have died

671
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
and asked for a doctor's doctor's doctor.

672
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,080
I'm afraid I wouldn't be in this world.

673
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
When it was difficult,

674
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
only Old Madam wouldn't have angered me.

675
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Old Madam's opinion

676
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
was to make a big deal out of it.

677
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
She's the only one in the family.

678
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,080
But she's taking me.

679
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
I can't help her.

680
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
Do you really want to be a minister?

681
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Don't think that

682
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
you're just a member of the imperial family

683
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
and you're just a member of the imperial family.

684
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
You're just a member of the imperial family.

685
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,080
You're just a member of the imperial family.

686
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
It's so great

687
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,080
to be a minister.

688
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Your Highness,

689
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
it's not your fault

690
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,080
to be so arrogant.

691
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
I'm not arrogant.

692
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
I'm just arrogant.

693
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
I never knew

694
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
you were so bad-hearted.

695
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I never knew

696
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
you were so angry.

697
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
What are you talking about?

698
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
You came here

699
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
on your own.

700
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
You wanted me to be your companion.

701
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
You wanted to make a fuss about you.

702
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
You wanted me to be your mother.

703
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
You're so free.

704
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
I'm being forced by people now.

705
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
It's all because of you.

706
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
You used me again and again.

707
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
You never brought me trouble.

708
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
But I'm so soft to you

709
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
every time.

710
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,080
I help you carry everything

711
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,080
and keep you safe.

712
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
Did you ever think

713
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
that I might leave without a reason?

714
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Go ahead.

715
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Yes.

716
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Your Highness.

717
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Let's go.

718
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Where are we going?

719
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
Kunting Palace.

720
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,080
Kunting Palace?

721
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Your Highness.

722
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
Didn't you say

723
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
that you were going to leave?

724
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Your Highness.

725
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Didn't you say that

726
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
you won't let him win this time?

727
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,080
I want to fulfill

728
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
all his wishes.

729
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
I just don't want to

730
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
see him sad again.

731
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,080
Your Highness.

732
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
Wait.

733
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,080
Put it down.

734
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
Put it down.

735
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,080
What's the formal matter?

736
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
What formal matter?

737
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
This is the dinner

738
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
for His Majesty tomorrow.

739
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Please check

740
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
if there's anything wrong.

741
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Steamed pig's head.

742
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
The head of the sheep.

743
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
The yellow tree outside.

744
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
These are so greasy.

745
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Don't repeat

746
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
the past mistakes of Yuehua.

747
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
You want to be a steamed pig's head?

748
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
You're really going to teach me?

749
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Today,

750
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,080
His Majesty is feeling well.

751
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
This is what the private doctor told me.

752
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Steamed pig's head

753
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,080
can help to cure His Majesty's fever.

754
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
And it can also

755
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
help to keep him from

756
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
being in a safe position.

757
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
It's a good way to help His Majesty.

758
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Ziping.

759
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
You're obviously not a good doctor.

760
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
You should have a short life.

761
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Why did you suddenly

762
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
think of using a medicine?

763
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Of course it's...

764
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
It's not right.

765
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
I'll go.

766
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
I'll go.

767
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Your Majesty.

768
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
Noble Consort Guo is already

769
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
in the third meeting.

770
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
I'm sorry.

771
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Your Majesty.

772
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Your Majesty.

773
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Your Majesty.

774
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Are you all right?

775
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Your Majesty.

776
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,080
Imperial Physician Xue.

777
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
Imperial Physician Xue.

778
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Your Majesty.

779
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
Please bring the food for His Majesty.

780
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
Your Highness.

781
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
The physician has checked it.

782
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,080
The food is not poisonous.

783
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Your Highness.

784
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,080
I've checked all the food carefully.

785
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,080
There's nothing wrong with it.

786
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Don't worry.

787
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
I'll take care of it.

788
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
You're right.

789
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
I'll go.

790
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
Your Majesty.

791
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
I've checked it carefully.

792
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
There's nothing wrong with it.

793
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
His Majesty suddenly fainted today.

794
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
I'm afraid that

795
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,080
he's in a hurry to give up.

796
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
It's about His Majesty's body.

797
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
It's not a big deal.

798
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
It's not poisonous.

799
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
It doesn't mean they're innocent.

800
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Food is like medicine.

801
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
If we're together,

802
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,080
we'll be harmed and helpless.

803
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
We should check it carefully

804
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
before we can make a conclusion.

805
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
How can this be?

806
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Yes.

807
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Who made this steamed cake?

808
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
Your Highness.

809
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,080
I made it.

810
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
What ingredients did you use

811
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
in this steamed cake?

812
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
The famous steamed cake

813
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
is made of Huai Shan medicine,

814
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
white pancake bean, lotus seed meat

815
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,080
and one-meter-long persimmon,

816
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,080
and persimmon and persimmon.

817
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
The steamed cake in the palace

818
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,080
is made of the prescription

819
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,080
from the Imperial Medical Academy.

820
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
The two of them

821
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,080
will be replaced by

822
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
the painkiller and the antler.

823
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
Nonsense.

824
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
Mother.

825
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
I've checked

826
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
the prescription prescription

827
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
used by His Majesty.

828
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
The prescription contains

829
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,080
the antler, the antler and the antler.

830
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
The drug is enough

831
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
for a patient.

832
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Now, the female cooks

833
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
in the Imperial Medical Academy

834
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
have been treating the drug.

835
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,080
They also dare to

836
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
use the prescription.

837
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Father, you need to be weak.

838
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,080
If you don't make it,

839
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
won't you be sick

840
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
and sick?

841
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
Your Highness.

842
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
His Majesty has been

843
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
treating the antler recently.

844
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
The Imperial Medical Academy

845
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
is a very cautious place.

846
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,080
The prescription is on the way.

847
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
We'll report to the Imperial Medical Academy first.

848
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
The Imperial Medical Academy

849
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
will open the prescription prescription.

850
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
The prescription is equipped with the prescription.

851
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
The prescription is used.

852
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,080
No matter how many drugs are used,

853
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
there are records of all.

854
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
I'm not afraid of any errors.

855
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
The Imperial Medical Academy

856
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
and the people in the Imperial Medical Academy

857
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
should be punished.

858
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Father, you don't need to be arrested.

859
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,080
You even know how to make the medicine.

860
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,080
Especially Lu Rong.

861
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,080
The weak one

862
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
will only be too weak

863
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
and will only be too weak.

864
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
There will even be

865
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,080
a blood sprain.

866
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
In my opinion,

867
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,080
the person who made the eight-spread knife

868
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,080
is so kind.

869
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
He doesn't care about

870
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Father's body.

871
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
He should be punished.

872
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Your Highness.

873
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Are you guilty?

874
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Please punish me.

875
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Your Highness.

876
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
His Majesty is a wedding star.

877
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
He is not fit.

878
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
The doctors

879
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,080
often open a large amount of prescription

880
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,080
to make his health better.

881
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,080
Such as Lu Rong,

882
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,080
Lian Shen, and Ling Zhi.

883
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
As the Crown Prince said,

884
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
the medicine will also be too weak.

885
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,080
But

886
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,080
all the medicines in the palace

887
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
and the amount of them

888
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,080
are made by the Imperial Medical Academy.

889
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
And there are many precious herbs

890
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
in the medicine shop.

891
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
In addition, other people

892
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
have the power to steal the knife

893
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
and the speciality to supervise the capital.

894
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
So...

895
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
The Crown Prince can't decide on the medicine.

896
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
You can just

897
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
give him the responsibility, right?

898
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,080
So,

899
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
I used the body

900
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
to make the medicine.

901
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
I made the medicine.

902
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
I also added

903
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,080
the raw radish juice

904
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,080
in the water.

905
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
Raw radish juice?

906
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Yes, Your Highness.

907
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Raw radish juice is good for your health.

908
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,080
It can be digested

909
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
and detoxified.

910
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
It can also be cooled

911
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,080
and remove the excess medicine in the medicine.

912
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,720
The radish can also be

913
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,080
digested and opened.

914
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
It is absolutely beneficial

915
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,080
to His Majesty's health.

916
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,080
So,

917
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
His Majesty is ill this time.

918
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,080
It must be related to the eight symptoms.

919
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,080
It seems that

920
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
you are the doctor

921
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,080
who gave the medicine to the doctor.

922
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
You are still sick.

923
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,080
Why are you hiding the truth?

924
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
Don't hold it back.

925
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,080
It's hot.

926
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,080
It's hot.

927
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,080
You

928
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,080
are talking to me

929
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,080
in front of me.

930
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,080
Since you are so angry,

931
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,080
why don't you tell everyone

932
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,080
the truth?

933
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,080
Your Majesty,

934
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,080
the good medicine in the eight symptoms

935
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,080
are good for your health.

936
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
It is indeed

937
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,080
beneficial to your health.

938
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,080
I am not wrong.

939
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,080
It's just that

940
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,080
His Majesty is firm in his heart.

941
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
The medicine has a life

942
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
and a good effect.

943
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,080
Then,

944
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,080
the doctors

945
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,080
dare not to be too careless.

946
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,080
The prescription is too useful.

947
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,080
If I report it to you,

948
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,080
you will misunderstand.

949
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
If anything goes wrong,

950
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,080
many doctors

951
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,080
and doctors

952
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
will be implicated.

953
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Why don't you

954
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,080
use your body and your body

955
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
to replenish your vitality

956
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,080
and then use your radish to heal your illness?

957
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,080
You are so ill.

958
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,080
As a chef,

959
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,080
I can not only

960
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,080

964
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
As a private cook,

965
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,080
I am sorry for you.

966
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,080

00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080

00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
I should call him

969

00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,080
I am sorry.

971
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,080
