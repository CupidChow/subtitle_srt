The game is a little bit complicated

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are some short and short mistakes

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The game is a little bit complicated

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000

Episode 29

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,680
I did it myself without any vibration.

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,560
Your Majesty, don't mind.

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,400
Stop writing.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,080
If you come back late,

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,480
don't wait.

30
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,560
Then, Your Majesty,

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,080
are you happy to see me?

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,120
Yes.

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
I'll wait.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,760
I'm the one who's always on my mind.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm the one who's always on my mind.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,440
The third-star Galaxy S2 series phone

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,920
will be on air in a few days.

38
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,680
No. 5G, Xiao Fuxing.

39
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,440
Wei Ke, Weisheng Jin will bring you to the live show.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
You're the one who's the key to the show.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,400
Your Majesty,

42
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,840
I don't know.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,680
I really don't know, Your Majesty.

44
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,080
It's not me.

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,560
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,920
Don't blame me.

47
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,440
Don't blame me, Your Majesty.

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,440
Your Majesty,

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,360
I don't blame you.

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,400
I don't blame you.

51
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,040
Your Majesty,

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,120
I don't blame you.

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,120
Your Highness,

54
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,200
I'm sorry for what I said.

55
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,720
I really don't blame you.

56
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Your Majesty.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,680
Your Majesty.

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,560
Your Majesty,

59
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,160
Yuanqi has been serving in the prison since morning and night.

60
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,760
She has to take care of the private affairs.

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,000
Due to the lack of internal organs and human hands,

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,040
she's been in the prison for a while.

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
How could she care so much?

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,840
I believe

65
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,320
Yuanqi will never have such a big audacity.

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
You're a woman.

67
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
How dare you say that?

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Go back.

69
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,200
Your Majesty,

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm not that obedient.

71
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,920
Yuanqi.

72
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
I'll get Her Highness back now.

73
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,000
What do you mean?

74
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Year Conflict.

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,760
Didn't they want to be Lay On Commanders of the Seven Devouters?

76
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
Ask them to bring their namesирend to the prison.

77
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,560
I'm going to discuss things again.

78
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,840
Go in there now.

79
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,480
Come.

80
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,240
Your Highness the Empress,

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,880
you came to visit His Majesty.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,120
Yuan said you should talk to him.

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,080
Why did you leave immediately?

84
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,640
The Empress Dowager always said

85
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,040
as a concubine,

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,680
he'd beative,

87
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,640
and noble.

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,440
I wanted toisse Yuan Qi

89
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,760
not to frame him.

90
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,880
Increase Yuan Qi's reputation

91
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,080
after years but still wasores of love.

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,900
How can he

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
cause any harm next?

94
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,520
It's a pity that

95
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,580
Zhong Yan has been too snob,

96
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,120
so I'm telling you

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,360
Go.

98
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,000
All of you go out.

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,760
Your Majesty.

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,000
Why are you so sad?

101
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,840
The Empress

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,520
is worried about your body.

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,240
She will be so serious.

104
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,120
Why did you

105
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,160
get rid of her?

106
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,640
Yes.

107
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
You are all right.

108
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
I was wrong.

109
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,640
You are wrong, too.

110
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't want to see you.

111
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,200
I don't want to see you.

112
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
I don't want to see you.

113
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I don't want to see you.

114
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
I don't want to see you.

115
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
I don't want to see you.

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
I don't want to see you.

117
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,640
Come on.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
His Majesty is in a bad state.

119
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
Please come to see him.

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,640
I don't want to see you.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
I don't want to see you.

122
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,040
Yun Qi.

123
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,200
Go.

124
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,040
Your Majesty, please take a break.

125
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,080
Go deliver the medicine.

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,920
Take this medical document.

127
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,240
I have to treat the people of the world

128
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,880
with great power and great power.

129
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,280
Ziqian.

130
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
It's hard for me.

131
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you understand?

132
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,480
Lord Nocturnal Lama.

133
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,600
Teacherعم.

134
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,440
What's the matter?

135
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,400
Our Lord Nu can't identify.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,680
His Majesty just fell by his cupboard at the front gates.

137
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,200
He's just heard the outside bolt.

138
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,560
All the subjects in the palace spread out over all directions.

139
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,040
Mother and his함 are somewhat lenient.

140
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,320
They even made curses on his Majesty.

141
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,320
They acted a wild way

142
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,620
against those

143
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,560
ministerian young scholars.

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,960
His Majesty still has such關心 people.

145
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,480
Mounite.

146
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,440
comb a veil well near

147
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,720
Do not see

148
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,560
Do not see

149
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
bonfire

150
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,560
Think his idea

151
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,560
here

152
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:41,200
Xiao

153
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,560
Song

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,760
Yes

155
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
The Imperial Physician of the Imperial Court

156
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
found out that His Majesty is in a state of emergency.

157
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,880
He asked for more time

158
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
after the emergency.

159
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
He delayed the time.

160
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,040
His Majesty is ill?

161
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,840
When did this happen?

162
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,280
Why didn't anyone report it?

163
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Your Majesty, don't worry.

164
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
The Imperial Physician said

165
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,040
His Majesty is cold-hearted and unwell.

166
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,840
His Majesty is in a hurry.

167
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,480
His Majesty is in a state of emergency.

168
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,960
He can't disturb the Qing Ling Palace.

169
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,720
This is also the emperor's filial piety.

170
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,720
How dare they defy the imperial decree?

171
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Get up.

172
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,560
Thank you, Your Majesty.

173
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,840
His Majesty is busy with his affairs.

174
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,120
So he is trying to be cautious.

175
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
He is so careless.

176
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,160
He is not aware of it.

177
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,920
It's my fault.

178
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,520
Father,

179
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
you can't blame me for this.

180
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,160
There are too many things in the palace.

181
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
The empress is ill.

182
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
She is alone.

183
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,080
It's hard to separate her.

184
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,840
Look at the concubines in the palace.

185
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,560
Who can help you?

186
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,520
The empress asked me

187
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,080
if I was bold enough to say this.

188
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,720
The empress was ill before.

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
I was the one who brought the palace stuff.

190
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,520
But now,

191
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,120
you are in good health.

192
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,480
You are the one who takes care of the palace.

193
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,640
The empress is in a bad health.

194
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,680
She has to be ill for three months.

195
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,240
There are too many people in the palace.

196
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,960
It's hard to take care of her.

197
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,680
It's hard for you to take care of her.

198
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,240
Your Majesty,

199
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,320
the empress is kind and loyal.

200
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,680
She is the one who is responsible for the mistakes of the servants.

201
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,280
She is not a good person.

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,520
The palace is a famous palace.

203
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,680
But the empress is ill.

204
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,040
She can't be too busy.

205
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,400
Why don't you ask Her Highness to help her?

206
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,000
She is in the palace for a long time.

207
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,720
She is a good person.

208
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,880
She is a good person.

209
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,400
The palace is not a good place.

210
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,840
There are too many people in the palace.

211
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,800
There are too many people in front of others.

212
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,200
I want to punish you.

213
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,480
What do you think?

214
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,920
Aunt Wu Zhaoyi is young and young.

215
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,200
She is very active.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,120
But I believe she is not evil.

217
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,840
Her Majesty sent someone to make Xuan Delu.

218
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,360
But the servants didn't take the picture.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,840
Aunt Wu Zhaoyi is so suspicious.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why don't you send her to see the death?

221
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,880
This is her intention.

222
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,840
It will ease Her Majesty's mind.

223
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,800
And...

224
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,760
You can continue.

225
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,920
Since the fifth year of the Hongwu Dynasty,

226
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
the emperor of the Crown Prince visited the imperial court to help the six states.

227
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,920
He helped the female officials to get the harem.

228
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,680
But later, the female officials' power was lost.

229
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,520
There were many internal troubles.

230
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,560
They caused the corruption.

231
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,080
When the Meng Shang Palace was closed,

232
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,600
the harem's affairs were not very small.

233
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,360
They were reported to His Majesty.

234
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,360
It's not like Her Majesty is sick.

235
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,520
It's hard to get the harem back.

236
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,200
So you want to restore the old harem?

237
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,600
Your Majesty.

238
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,400
The female officials' affairs are always in the past.

239
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,200
In my opinion,

240
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,880
Cao Jieyu is very considerate.

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,200
He is in charge of the imperial court.

242
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,680
Lady Jiao is in charge of the imperial court.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,200
And Xu and Yuan are in charge of the harem.

244
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,800
They are kind and all use to the harem vegetarian's office.

245
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,480
but they are one sparsely as well.

246
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,160
The three are equal.

247
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,360
Not all The Feiertelts sends flyers to select Acting Her Majesty.

248
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,040
The princesses at the harem,

249
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,200
ным are away with their remains

250
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,640
and earn money.

251
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,640
The female officials' status is bye-bye withplease!

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
The harem offers Qin units and proofs of the custom of living in the harem.

253
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,880
Only the official discom recounts it.

254
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,720
He is responsible for investigating the palace as a public official.

255
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,800
This matter must not be handled by anyone.

256
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,320
It must not be passed by Her Highness the Empress personally.

257
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,760
Then the good and bad of the six realms

258
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,920
should be asked by the Empress to decide the punishment.

259
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,160
If it is a person who cannot be promoted,

260
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,040
then it will be a bad person next year.

261
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,600
You mean that

262
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
everyone has a job

263
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,880
and they will be free from the trouble of the concubines?

264
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,440
You just drew a picture of Wei Jin, right?

265
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,400
Yes.

266
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,320
Some people have chosen it.

267
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,080
I can't take the decision.

268
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,000
Please think about it, Your Highness.

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,560
I understand what you mean.

270
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,520
If they want to do something,

271
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,840
then Wei Jin will have to give birth to a baby.

272
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,520
You are wise, Your Highness.

273
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,400
I have one more thing to tell you.

274
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,720
Tell me.

275
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,640
This year, the opening ceremony will be held in the border army.

276
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,680
But the cotton cloth that the East Medical Academy needs is not enough to be used.

277
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,960
I know that there are some limited cloths in the warehouse.

278
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,120
Please think about it, Your Highness.

279
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Okay.

280
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,920
I will take my leave.

281
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Go ahead.

282
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,920
You all come out.

283
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,840
Aunt Wu Zhao,

284
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,640
have you heard of it?

285
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Your Highness,

286
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,400
it's a real bad person

287
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,960
who does good deeds for the reputation.

288
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
No.

289
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,080
People usually call people bad.

290
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,320
I am just being too honest.

291
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,280
People who are sincere should always make people misunderstand.

292
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Shut up.

293
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Yes.

294
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
Your Highness,

295
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,880
did I say something wrong?

296
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
Your Highness,

297
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,280
I am just being too honest.

298
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
I am just being too honest.

299
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,480
Aunt Wu Zhao is a very honest person.

300
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,080
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

301
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,680
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

302
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,280
You are being too honest.

303
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,680
You are being too honest.

304
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,880
You are being too honest.

305
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,280
If you want to say something,

306
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,880
then say it.

307
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,080
If you want to do something, then do it.

308
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Then, based on my true feelings,

309
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,080
I should ask people to

310
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,680
make you pay for it.

311
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,480
If Noble Consort Sun is sincere like you,

312
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,280
and makes Consort Shi in front of His Majesty,

313
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,880
will you still be alive?

314
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,080
Your Highness,

315
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
I know my mistake.

316
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,680
I misunderstood Noble Consort Sun.

317
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,280
I was going to misunderstand.

318
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,680
I will definitely change Consort Xian.

319
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,280
I will never dare to say anything.

320
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,280
Whether you are sincere or not,

321
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,480
I only want to see if you can make a good deed

322
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,080
and make a good merit.

323
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,480
You may leave.

324
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,280
Yes.

325
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Come on, get up.

326
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,080
Your Highness,

327
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,680
you are being too honest in front of His Majesty.

328
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
This is right.

329
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,880
But...

330
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,080
you are not the royal heir of the previous dynasty.

331
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,280
You should still learn to be kind.

332
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,280
Yes.

333
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,280
Our Empress,

334
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,480
she is weak and sick.

335
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,080
She can't have a son.

336
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,680
She is watching Noble Consort Sun

337
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,280
and is being spoiled.

338
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,480
In the end, she is afraid that she will be a bad person.

339
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,680
Who would let her heart be broken?

340
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,080
She is a demon.

341
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
If I say so,

342
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
His Majesty is young.

343
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,280
She is being forced to be a 5-meter-long-diameter.

344
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,880
She has even put the ancestors of the people behind her.

345
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,480
It's a pity that Empress Hu

346
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,680
is not good enough to make a mistake.

347
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,680
It's a rare chance for the people in the world to be late.

348
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,280
And they even put the ancestors of the people behind her.

349
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,080
Our new emperor...

350
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,080
What's wrong?

351
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,080
You really don't know?

352
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,280
Uncle, the capital is changing now.

353
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Tell me.

354
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,080
The new emperor has been in the capital for less than a year.

355
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,880
He suddenly has a cold.

356
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Think about it.

357
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
Isn't this a coincidence?

358
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,080
It's just a coincidence.

359
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
He can't wait any longer.

360
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
You mean...

361
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,880
the Han King is ready.

362
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,480
He is waiting for a time.

363
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
A time?

364
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
The army of the Yi State is in a bad position.

365
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,480
They are all worried about their own interests.

366
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,480
How could the country be long-lasting?

367
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,280
How could that happen?

368
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
Don't you get me wrong.

369
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,280
You want to talk about it in private, don't you?

370
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,080
Wait a minute.

371
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
For this HMRIsna ring...

372
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,280
for the consequences of presenting the new emperor

373
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,480
to a guest.

374
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,280
Aunt,

375
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Eat the food.

376
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
One.

377
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
No delicious food left.

378
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,480
How could your family live it?

379
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Even if it is uzğini,

380
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,880
who would have done it without ten years' advantage?

381
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,080
Grandma...

382
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
I'm always so lonely every night.

383
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
I always have to learn to be a good girl.

384
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
I'm afraid that

385
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
one day, I'll wake up

386
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
and they'll be gone.

387
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Your hands are fine, right?

388
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,080
If someone can take one step away,

389
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
then the second step away.

390
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
I'll have to live in fear

391
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
if I can't take it for a day.

392
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Are you really afraid?

393
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
I'm afraid.

394
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm very afraid.

395
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
But there are more.

396
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,080
They know how important these hands are to me.

397
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
How can they do such a cruel thing?

398
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
I won't forgive them.

399
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
I won't forgive them.

400
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
I shouldn't have come here.

401
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
But except for you,

402
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
I don't even have a single speaker.

403
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
I'm sorry. I should go.

404
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
The real reason is not this.

405
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
Actually,

406
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
I've always wanted to tell you.

407
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
But I...

408
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Don't say it.

409
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I've already known it.

410
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
Mother, master,

411
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Zhiyou,

412
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm not a flower.

413
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
How can you be an exception?

414
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
Su Si Shan.

417
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Greetings to Aunt Wu Zhao.

418
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
Look at you.

419
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
You look so pale.

420
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Where did you come back from?

421
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
I came back to Aunt Zhao.

422
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
I'm going to the Ninth Cicada Mask

423
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
to get some information about this year.

424
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Since Noble Consort Sun has been in charge of the palace,

425
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
everyone has been surrounded by her.

426
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
If there's no order,

427
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
I'll lose the money

428
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
for the key.

429
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Su Si Shan.

430
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
You're a great cook.

431
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
You're a great cook.

432
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
I'm not here to eat and eat with you.

433
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm here to take care of Yin Ziping.

434
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
You're the one who lost the position of the superior.

435
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,080
You've been the head of the Kuning Palace.

436
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,080
When it comes to key,

437
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
the empress gave you the position of the superior.

438
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
She chose Yin Ziping.

439
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
And you're the filial son of the palace.

440
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,080
You're really happy.

441
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Noble Consort Sun is a unique and powerful cook.

442
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
She's a great cook.

443
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
The empress is more righteous and loyal to the palace.

444
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
She's the mother of the whole world.

445
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
In the end,

446
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
she's the master.

447
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
A woman like me

448
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
is just a servant who's a servant of the palace.

449
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Even if she's not happy,

450
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
what can she do?

451
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
I can help you.

452
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,080
You?

453
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
What did you say to her?

454
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
She didn't come back from the software.

455
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
She's reckless.

456
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Chen You, Fang Gui,

457
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
and Si Bao.

458
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
They didn't come back alive.

459
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
No.

460
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
None of them came back.

461
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
What did Guangdong say?

462
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
They followed the merchant's path.

463
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
They set off from Fujian.

464
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
They crossed the river and the river.

465
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,080
They'll be sent to the top of the mountain

466
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
by the end of the month.

467
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Even if they walk,

468
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
they won't bite or bleed.

469
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
They haven't heard from them for so long.

470
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Will they...

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
be in trouble?

472
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
Something happened.

473
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Come here.

474
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Something happened.

475
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Something happened.

476
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Something happened.

477
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Get out.

478
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Get out.

479
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Get out.

480
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Why is Wu Zhao Yi here?

481
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
You don't know where he is.

482
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
You don't know where he is.

483
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
If His Majesty finds out,

484
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
he'll kill you.

485
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
What a coincidence.

486
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
This is the portrait of the fellow merchant

487
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
that His Majesty wanted.

488
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
I'll give it to him personally.

489
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Thank you for your help.

490
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Thank you.

491
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
Thank you.

492
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Thank you.

493
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
What are you looking for?

494
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
What are you looking for?

495
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
Wu Zhao Yi.

496
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
His Majesty needs to be well-behaved.

497
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,080
If there's nothing else,

498
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,080
you can leave the portrait here.

499
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Please.

500
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
Eunuch Yuan.

501
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
Look.

502
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,080
なにが黃上豪 music

503
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Eunuch Yuan.

504
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,980
Your Emperor's Momo

505
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
gotten this good from Her Majesty

506
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
despite she went for the ouverture.

507
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
影中报連

508
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
Wukong is very smart.

509
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Do you hate her?

510
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,080
If His Majesty finds out your mines秒

511
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
you can land on the ground.

512
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,640
Wu Zhao Yi.

513
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,680
Wu Zhao Yi.

514
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,240
I was wrong.

515
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,840
Wu Zhao Yi, spare my life.

516
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,320
I was wrong.

517
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,400
Wu Zhao Yi.

518
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,640
I was wrong.

519
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,800
I was wrong.

520
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,880
Little Wu.

521
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,680
I'm unable to escape

522
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,320
Be careful!

523
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,680
If His Majesty knows your crime

524
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,840
you will definitely be punished.

525
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,560
I'm sorry.

526
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,200
I'm sorry.

527
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,800
I'm sorry.

528
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm sorry.

529
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,760
I'm sorry.

530
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,360
I'm sorry.

531
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,040
I'm sorry.

532
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,880
What are you doing?

533
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,120
Get up.

534
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:29,960
Come on.

535
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,840
You...

536
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,760
Tea.

537
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,880
Tea.

538
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,320
Secretary Ren?

539
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,040
Tea.

540
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,480
Have your tea.

541
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,500
Look here.

542
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,120
Doctor Liu will take her home.

543
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,960
You can have it.

544
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,080
Post-traumatization.

545
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,880
pouquinho.

546
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:54,940
Bear the pain.

547
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,120
A long-ибisuit service by the emperor and Princeamping.

548
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,220
Sir Yuan.

549
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,200
The tea got cold.

550
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,400
I'll bring tea instead.

551
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:12,780
Yuan极

552
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,720
Yuan极

553
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,000

554
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,040

00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,880
tell me about the State ofbank Charity.

566
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,160
I'll read it for you.

567
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,080
What is your name?

568
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
The konnteста du resort,

569
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,100
attacks were unintended

570
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,940
and powerful heavy loads of trucks and rips.

571
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,480
I can't eat this, I can't eat that.

572
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,480
I haven't eaten anything for three days.

573
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,080
I haven't been able to eat all day.

574
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,280
Noble Consort, you're the most heart-broken.

575
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,080
If she knows about this, how will she be fine?

576
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Why don't you find a woman to check it out?

577
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,680
It's no use.

578
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
Let me see.

579
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,080
Your Highness the Empress, why are you here?

580
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Didn't Noble Consort Sun go to Qianqing Palace to attend the ceremony?

581
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,680
Your Highness the Empress is worried that His Majesty will be in a bad mood.

582
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
She came to check it out.

583
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
What a pity.

584
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,680
I can't speak out.

585
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,280
If I had known this,

586
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,480
I wouldn't have let you get sick if you saw me.

587
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,280
I want to take her back to look after her.

588
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,080
Hurry and prepare.

589
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,880
Yes.

590
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,280
Dr. Cheng.

591
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Noble Consort, His Majesty has a long and warm heart. He is very kind.

592
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,680
He is known for his temperament and his temperament.

593
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:41,880
Okay. I will take a bath and take a bath.

594
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,080
I will be fine in two or three days.

595
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,680
Okay.

596
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
I will go to open the room.

597
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,080
Fu Jiang, is the banquet going well?

598
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,080
The Empress went to the storage room. She said she wanted to take care of it.

599
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
How about taking her back?

600
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,680
The Empress is really fond of the banquet.

601
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,680
Please take care of her for a while.

602
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,480
I will write a prescription later.

603
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,280
I will pick some of her favorite things for the banquet.

604
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
You have been working hard.

605
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,080
Why don't you go and rest?

606
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,080
I will wake you up when His Majesty wakes up.

607
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,880
Your Majesty,

608
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,080
when he wakes up, will he ask if the memorials for tonight have been sent here?

609
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,880
Where are the memorials?

610
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,880
Your Majesty.

611
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,080
Yuan Qi, it's...

612
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,280
Where are the memorials?

613
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,880
Since this evening, the memorials were all reöffended.

614
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,920
The memorials sent by the emperor

615
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,080
will be sent to Qianqian Palace

616
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,080
after they take care of the Yang family.

617
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,320
Yes.

618
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,600
Hua Ping.

619
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,080
Get the medicine box I bought before.

620
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,320
Hua Ping.

621
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,320
I want to save her.

622
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,600
Your Highness.

623
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,120
This is the favorite pet of the emperor.

624
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,320
It's so precious and precious.

625
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,240
How can it be so precious?

626
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
You heard it too.

627
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,960
He taught her so well.

628
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,880
I just want to try it.

629
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,200
I still have some chance to save her.

630
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,240
Will the empress really be cured?

631
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,320
The empress ordered

632
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,960
to take the medicine box for the banquet.

633
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,000
It's a serious pain.

634
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,280
It's a serious pain.

635
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,080
It's normal to get sick.

636
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,680
The cat is the same.

637
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,920
Why must they use the medicine to wake up the dead?

638
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The empress is so precious.

639
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,920
She is the one who gave her medicine.

640
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,680
She is the one who gave her medicine.

641
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,360
She is the one who gave her medicine.

642
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,120
She is the one who gave her medicine.

643
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,720
She is the one who gave her medicine.

644
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,480
She is the one who gave her medicine.

645
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,280
She is the one who gave her medicine.

646
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,160
She is the one who gave her medicine.

647
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,920
She is the one who gave her medicine.

648
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,760
She is the one who gave her medicine.

649
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,480
She is the one who gave her medicine.

650
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,360
She is the one who gave her medicine.

651
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,400
She is the one who gave her medicine.

652
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,680
She is the one who gave her medicine.

653
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
She is the one who gave her medicine.

654
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,000
The one who gave her medicine.

655
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,600
It's not good at all.

656
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,200
What's wrong with you today?

657
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,160
Your Highness,

658
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,640
Zhongyuan Festival's meal has been taken.

659
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,400
I'll give it to His Majesty and Empress Dowager

660
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,160
and then distribute it to Liu Hongbao.

661
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,040
Yes.

662
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,760
His Majesty's illness is very bad.

663
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
But since yesterday morning,

664
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,600
you haven't eaten anything.

665
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,200
I'm afraid you're too full.

666
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,520
You won't be able to bear it.

667
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,080
I sent someone to prepare the meal.

668
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,560
You should eat more and then rest.

669
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,920
I'm really not hungry.

670
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,680
I can't eat.

671
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,920
Mistress.

672
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,120
Noble Consort,

673
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,040
today is the day of the festival.

674
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,360
Empress gave all the Mistress to the princess

675
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,320
and prepared the vegetarian meal.

676
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,680
I can smell the fragrance of the food box.

677
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,120
Your Highness.

678
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,320
Your Highness.

679
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,520
Your Highness.

680
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,720
Your Highness.

681
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,760
Your Highness.

682
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Your Highness.

683
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Your Highness.

684
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,760
Your Highness.

685
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Your Highness.

686
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Your Highness.

687
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Your Highness.

688
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,760
Your Highness.

689
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Your Highness.

690
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
Your Highness.

691
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,760
Your Highness.

692
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Your Highness.

693
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,760
Your Highness.

694
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Your Highness.

695
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Your Highness.

696
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Your Highness.

697
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,760
Your Highness.

698
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Your Highness.

699
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
Your Highness.

700
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Your Highness.

701
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Your Highness.

702
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
Your Highness.

703
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Your Highness.

704
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
Your Highness.

705
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,440
Make way.

706
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,420
Let's go.

707
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,280
Your majesty.

708
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,600
I almost killed myself.

709
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
I've almost lost my gold.

710
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,640
What are you talking about?

711
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,120
Yuanqi.

712
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,800
Your Majesty.

713
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,120
Send the empress back to the Kunning Palace.

714
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,440
I'll order her to step out of the palace.

715
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,280
Yes.

716
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,080
Your Majesty.

717
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,800
What did I do wrong?

718
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,360
You should allow me to do so.

719
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,600
Your Majesty.

720
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,320
Your Highness.

721
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,240
His Majesty is in the cave.

722
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,960
Don't say anything else.

723
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,080
Go back.

724
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,440
I will send you back for DNA test now.

725
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,080
Ye Er.

726
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,120
Your Majesty.

727
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,720
Give me an blood test.

728
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,760
Okay.

729
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,680
Or maybe cold.

730
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,360
I'll do it.

731
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,600
He...

732
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,720
You know her well.

733
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,960
She will just Lupita.

734
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,600
That's how we know each other.

735
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,280
Good.

736
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,760
and the people's heart.

737
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,080
But the royal court doesn't dare to say anything.

738
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,560
Noble Consort Sun always treats Yinsi Mountain well.

739
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,160
Yanzhi is not a good choice.

740
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
It's a hard job.

741
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,800
Your Highness, Yinsi Mountain is here.

742
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,040
Send her in.

743
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,680
Yes.

744
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,840
Greetings to Your Highness.

745
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,640
Rise.

746
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,240
Today,

747
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,820
I'd like to hear

748
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,100
the opinion of Yinsi Mountain.

749
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:57,860
Your Highness.

750
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,420
The empress dowager would die on her own

751
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,220
and overcome the pain of being homeless.

752
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,860
I told her to put the pill to use for maltreatments.

753
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,940
I asked No.婆 to treat me.

754
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,500
However...

755
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,440
My bad苑治了 first- Summer Palace那天。

756
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,060
My lady feared the phantom of existence

757
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,800
or the end of her life,

758
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,600
the person behind her is heartless

759
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,000
and deliberately defying the palace.

760
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,760
I'm more worried

761
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,760
that the emperor is angry and afraid to offend the empress.

762
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,840
I'm bold enough to ask the empress dowager to hold the court

763
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,200
and protect the palace.

764
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,760
You're right.

765
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,720
Who taught you that?

766
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,280
No one in the world

767
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,360
can be the empress.

768
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,600
The empress dowager is so arrogant.

769
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,480
I'm not the empress.

770
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,800
You shouldn't be happy.

771
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,800
What?

772
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,120
You're also against me

773
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,240
like those officials in the imperial court.

774
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,320
If the emperor is out of the palace now,

775
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,480
everyone in the world will blame you.

776
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,960
I don't want the emperor to leave the name of the country

777
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,160
in the history book.

778
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,280
Aren't you worried about yourself?

779
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,680
You're worried about me instead.

780
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,240
Unfortunately,

781
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,040
it's too late.

782
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,080
Your Majesty.

783
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
Please forget your seat and rest.

784
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,480
together.

785
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Waiting for this moment to leave the fire.

786
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,480
And dream of a meeting.

787
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,480
The heart in the dream is not broken.

788
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Someone will come back.

789
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
I thought.

790
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:24,480
Waiting for this moment to leave the fire.

791
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,480
And dream of a meeting.

792
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,480
The heart in the dream is not broken.

793
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,480
Someone will come back.

794
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,480
I thought.

795
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
I thought.

796
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,480
I thought.

797
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
I thought.

798
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,480
I thought.

799
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,480
I thought.

800
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
I thought.

801
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
I thought.

802
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
I thought.

803
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,480
I thought.

804
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
I thought.

805
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
I thought.

806
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
I thought.

807
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,480
I thought.

808
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
I thought.
