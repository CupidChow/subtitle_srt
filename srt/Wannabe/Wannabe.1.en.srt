00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,291
[21 hours ago]

3
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,209
Hey, Ga-yeong.

4
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,791
When did you leave?
Couldn’t see you when I woke up.

5
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:32,775
You know I have a book signing today.

6
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:34,984
Oh, I see.

7
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,541
Then, you're gonna get back late tonight?

8
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:40,125
Well, I could be late.

9
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,417
You?

10
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,504
You said you have a meeting
with a film production company?

11
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:48,525
Yes, and now that you mentioned it,
may I borrow your dress?

12
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:54,098
Sure.

13
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:56,650
But make sure you keep it clean.

14
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:58,816
I appreciate it!

15
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:06,567
She only calls when she needs something.

16
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:04,375
Excuse me...

17
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,416
Yes?

18
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,666
I'm... LEE Su-yeon...

19
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,000
Umm... Okay...?

20
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,625
Umm... This one...

21
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,791
Oh! Ms. LEE Su-yeon!

22
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,749
Hey, she's real LEE Su-yeon.

23
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,499
Should we buy a book?

24
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,624
No way. She's already over the hill.

25
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,291
But It's pitiful to see her try hard.

26
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,750
Hey, are you seriously feeling bad
for all of what she did?

27
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,500
Let's go.

28
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,791
Could I have your autograph?

29
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,750
Sure. What is your name?

30
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,750
Ji-min,

31
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,791
PARK Ji-min.

32
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,749
I'm a big fan of you...

33
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,291
It is a great honor.

34
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,375
Really? I appreciate...

35
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:45,000
I was afraid that if this
event might be done.

36
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,166
Lucky you! I was about to leave...

37
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,041
Here you go.

38
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,416
Your leg...

39
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,625
Something happened?

40
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:14,124
Yes, I had an accident when I was young.

41
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,041
It's getting worse these days.

42
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,875
Must be a long way to get here...

43
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm good.

44
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,290
Now I have your autograph,

45
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,415
and greet you.

46
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,916
So, it means a lot to me.

47
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,916
Ji-min!

48
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,625
Wow... What an expensive restaurant!

49
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,125
I don't think we have
enough operating money.

50
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,375
No pressure. It's on me.

51
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,916
Wow! Really?

52
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,916
Then what should I eat...?

53
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:11,166
I still cannot believe I
could dine with you...

54
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,375
Not a big deal...

55
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,875
Anyway, how old are you, Ji-min?

56
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,750
I'm... older than I look.

57
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,625
People might consider me immature,

58
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,000
but for me,

59
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,041
you are more than an actress.

60
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,915
Am I?

61
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,916
Yes.

62
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:46,416
You gave me great strength
when I had an accident.

63
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:51,040
I watched all the movies and
TV shows that you acted in

64
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,540
since you were a child actress.

65
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:57,916
When you received the award,
I was glad as if it was mine.

66
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:06,916
Unfortunately, I made
a big mistake, though.

67
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,750
I really feel sorry.

68
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,875
Everyone makes a mistake.

69
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,250
Don't worry about what the nerds say.

70
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,666
Thank you for saying that.

71
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:31,541
Sad things?

72
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,666
Oh! Sorry...

73
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,875
You quit drinking... I forgot.

74
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,666
No... You're good...

75
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,250
Ah!

76
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,625
A wish bracelet?

77
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,666
A kid I knew when I was young
also used to wear the same bracelet.

78
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:01,916
Yes.

79
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,041
I'm still waiting for the day
when my wish comes true...

80
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,791
Not sure when the day is.

81
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,541
Hold on.

82
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,375
Hello?

83
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,374
One, two! "Have a surfing!"

84
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:25,250
Hello, we are 'Paran' that will
make waves in the music industry!

85
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,291
Hi. Nice to meet you all.

86
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,165
That's enough. Go ahead.

87
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,500
Yes, ma'am!

88
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,500
How do they look?

89
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,041
Cute, all of them.

90
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,166
Is that all?

91
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,124
Cute and even young,
which makes me annoyed.

92
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,166
Answered?

93
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,000
Never mind. You stone cold bitch.

94
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,750
Anyway, since when
have you prepared an idol?

95
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:07,624
Is it okay to have a girl
group for an actor agency?

96
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,166
It's hard to be an actor
for kids from the top, isn't it?

97
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:14,500
To enter this industry,
this is the quickest way

98
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,416
to break through.

99
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:24,874
And you know, it's hard to find kids
who want to be an actor from young age.

100
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:31,541
You just sound like the same
as the CEO 'Koo'.

101
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,000
Is he good to you?

102
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,499
You know him.

103
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,415
He is not a bad guy even
though he is a bluffer...

104
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,166
I can't help but have to believe in him.

105
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,250
I understand.

106
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:56,791
By the way, you quit drinking, didn't you?

107
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:03,416
I'm trying.

108
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,666
You have to stay low.

109
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,791
Make sure you don't rely on alcohol.

110
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:15,291
People have a prejudice against you
because of that accident you had.

111
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,416
You won't have any chance
if you make a second mistake.

112
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,249
Ah,

113
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,625
the girl you live with.

114
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,874
- Ga-yeong?
- Yes.

115
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,666
How is she? Are you two good?

116
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,666
Well, nothing special. Why?

117
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:43,625
Actually I've heard some rumors...

118
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:49,665
I recently met a CEO of a
movie company by chance...

119
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:54,041
It looks like she's
talking behind your back...

120
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,374
Because of that,

121
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,875
you are removed from the cast list.

122
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,541
Ma'am, may I get you another drink?

123
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,500
KOO Chang-seo, CEO.

124
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:55,166
Our hope! How was the book signing today?

125
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,666
Don't you think it's not right?

126
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:04,916
You don't pay too much time
to me these days, Mr. Koo.

127
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,915
You are so preoccupied
with making an idol debut

128
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,749
that I'm just behind the scenes.

129
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,374
Please understand.

130
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,666
I must take a chance.

131
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:19,541
I'm gonna catch a big TV show
for you, so stay tuned.

132
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:22,916
It's time to be in your prime again!

133
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,916
Way ahead of your word again...

134
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,166
Hey...

135
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:35,166
Can't you give me my own accommodation?

136
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:40,041
Sorry to bother you with the lawsuit...

137
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,625
But,

138
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,040
it's a little uncomfortable
living with Ga-yeong.

139
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,916
Hmm...

140
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,874
We will talk about it later.

141
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,999
I will have the chance
and give you a new house.

142
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,916
Be patient, alright?

143
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,666
Whatever...

144
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:04,041
By the way, are you taking
your depression pills well?

145
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,124
Never drink because you're depressed.

146
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,125
Take pills.

147
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,166
Is that clear?

148
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,916
Stop nagging.

149
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,541
Bye.

150
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,291
Is... it you, LEE Su-yeon? Right?

151
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,541
I wasn't sure before...

152
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,165
Since noon you drink alone...

153
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:04,625
What bothers you so much?

154
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,250
Nothing bad but you.

155
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,375
Don't get in my way. Just go.

156
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,791
Oops. As I heard, you
have a pretty bad temper.

157
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,666
After all, beauties aren't cheap.

158
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,416
But you are already out of date.

159
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,540
13 years ago.

160
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:18,874
Seriously?

161
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,415
You want to be an actress?

162
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,999
Why? Is there any problem with you?

163
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,375
No... that's not...

164
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:30,999
But to be an actress you should be pretty.

165
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,999
Of course, acting skills
are important, but...

166
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hey!

167
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:37,374
Isn't it supposed to be this pretty?

168
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,250
What if I just tweak my
eyes a bit with surgery?

169
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,000
Tweaking your eyes?
Is your face some kind of balcony?

170
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,000
Why don't you put some tiles
on your faces, too?

171
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you really think I'm wrong?

172
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:52,624
No, not like that.

173
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,040
You're definitely something here,

174
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,125
but in Seoul, there are
so many pretty girls...

175
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,500
Girls, there...

176
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,291
You can tell just by looking at that girl.

177
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,249
She transferred from Seoul last week...

178
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,250
She lives well and has good grades.

179
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:10,665
Rumor has it that some idol agencies
offered her deals,

180
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:13,915
but she wanted to be an actress
and rejected them all.

181
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:17,249
After all, pretty girls
count on themselves.

182
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,625
That's why they're so bold.

183
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:23,665
Hey, why are you so zoning out?

184
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:24,666
Are you shocked?

185
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:30,375
By the way, why is the weather so gloomy?

186
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,375
It's going to rain again...

187
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,875
Hey, what are you doing? Let's go!

188
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,125
You're not going?

189
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,041
Hey!

190
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,291
Excuse me, but are you in trouble?

191
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,625
No, I was just a bit tired.

192
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:23,666
Are you drunk?

193
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
No...

194
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,875
Have you ever seen this person?

195
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,499
I don't know...

196
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,290
He ran away from a nearby nursing home.
A report is coming in.

197
00:19:44,291 --> 00:19:45,749
He has aggressive tendencies.

198
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,624
If you see him, don't pretend to know him.

199
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,499
Please contact us right away.

200
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Drive safe.

201
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,125
Hello? Lawyer.

202
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,625
It's not something else,

203
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:25,250
but the CF damage that
we talked about last time...

204
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,249
I kept receiving a complaint
letter and a reminder letter.

205
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,666
What are you going to do?

206
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,750
Who doesn't know that now?

207
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,541
It's because I don't have money.

208
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,166
Anyway.

209
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,166
I'd like to get this sorted out
as soon as possible.

210
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,166
She's making such a fuss.

211
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,291
I'm home.

212
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,750
Oh, were you sleeping?

213
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,624
No...

214
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,415
Did the meeting go well?

215
00:23:47,416 --> 00:23:48,250
Yeah!

216
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:51,290
I met the production
company CEO and the director.

217
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,374
I guess they liked me more than I thought.

218
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:56,000
We had a drink while chatting
because the atmosphere was good.

219
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,500
Sure.

220
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,916
How can you not be loved at a young age?

221
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,374
I heard rumors,

222
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:12,375
that you were also
considered for the role.

223
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,500
It looks like
she's talking behind your back...

224
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,500
Yes, I know.

225
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:24,000
The role wasn't great, so I refused it.

226
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,999
But anyway,

227
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,500
you're going to do it?

228
00:24:29,375 --> 00:24:31,250
Almost 99% sure?

229
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm less skilled than you,

230
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,124
so I have to do everything I can.

231
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,845
There's no choice for me.
I have to do everything to avoid criticism.

232
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,665
That.

233
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,541
Isn't it what I drink?

234
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,625
Did you drink it?

235
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,250
Yes, I was thirsty...

236
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,500
My mom sent me to drink...

237
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:09,041
Since I borrowed your clothes today,
I will let you drink it.

238
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,416
What?

239
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:31,874
Su-yeon.

240
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:33,125
I will take a shower first.

241
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,749
Damn it.

242
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,500
This is obvious that she's getting old now.

243
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,375
I can't cut off that noise.

244
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:36,000
It's so noisy.

245
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,374
I'm dying of annoyance, CEO.

246
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,374
When I got home, she was drunk.

247
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,290
She took my drinks and drunk it as hers.

248
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:16,749
How long should I have to be with her?

249
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,999
She has been completely
ripped off by a lawsuit.

250
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,375
She would have nowhere to stay
if it weren’t for that place.

251
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,624
If this movie goes well,

252
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,999
I'll give you studio apartment in Gangnam.

253
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,375
Hold on until then.

254
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:34,166
She said she refused the role. Is it true?

255
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:36,749
She's delusional.

256
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,040
She is too sensitive to lose anything.

257
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:39,665
Even if it's tough, hang in there.

258
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:42,165
Treat your senior well too.

259
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,249
As people age, they’re more
moved by small acts of kindness.

260
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,165
Don't show too much
that you're doing well.

261
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,415
In our company, you are the best.

262
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:52,916
You know what I mean, right?

263
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:10,915
Su-yeon.

264
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:14,624
Hey! Didn't I tell you to make sure
this dress stay clean?

265
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,749
But what is this?

266
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,375
Throw it everywhere like a mop!

267
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:21,000
I was about to laundry it
and give it to you.

268
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:24,416
Did you enter my room?

269
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,040
Does it matter now?
We are talking about this dress?

270
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,124
How dare you enter my room
without permission!

271
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,249
Is it so wrong for a senior
to enter a junior's room?

272
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,125
Still, you have to keep it.

273
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,249
Wash this clean and bring it to me.

274
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,250
Okay?

275
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,250
Damn it.
Why's everyone trying to fuck with me.

276
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,125
Die!

277
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,750
Die!

278
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:33,250
Hey...

279
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,500
Sorry.

280
00:29:57,541 --> 00:29:59,500
Something bad happened today...

281
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,000
It's okay.

282
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,375
I'm sorry for my behavior.

283
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,166
But I'm the senior.

284
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,125
I behaved so childish.

285
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,000
You've had hard time these days.

286
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,250
I should have been a little more careful.

287
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:30,250
I'm proud of you.

288
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,291
Hey, embarrassing.

289
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,500
Who is it at this late hour?

290
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,666
Ah... just a friend.

291
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,750
A friend?

292
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,915
Seriously, this girl must be crazy.

293
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:12,416
She was screaming all along
and even cut herself.

294
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,750
Really?

295
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,250
That's the problem.

296
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,499
I guess I got it wrong.

297
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,000
I should cancel the contract with her.

298
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:28,375
Otherwise,
it is bad for the company image.

299
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,249
Isn't she going to cause another accident?

300
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,541
Fire her.

301
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,625
Sure. We only need you.

302
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,625
What is it?

303
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:48,416
Ga-yeong, shall I give you a massage?

304
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:54,665
You're so good at it.

305
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,506
It feels like all the
fatigue is melting away.

306
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,749
Like it?

307
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,250
I love it.

308
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,000
How good?

309
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,665
Better than being touched

310
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:07,875
by a production company CEO and a director?

311
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,040
What are you talking about?

312
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:15,750
Did you go around talking
behind my back like that?

313
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Who says such things?

314
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,580
How many years
have you been living in this industry?

315
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:28,666
You can't wear your mask like an amateur.

316
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,115
You really think
you are going to do the acting properly?

317
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,999
Please stop there. It's enough.

318
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,125
- Who decided?
- Why are you doing this to me?

319
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,041
Do you think your youth is going to last?

320
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,695
How much do you think
expiration date of your beauty lasts?

321
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,790
You're like an under-ripe persimmon
that is sweet and solid.

322
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,916
But in a little while, you will become soft.

323
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,416
Your limp skin will be
peeled off and ditched

324
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,791
after they taste the sweetness inside.

325
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,375
The moment you realize that.

326
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,541
You too will know what despair is.

327
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,750
You crazy bitch!!!

328
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,041
You're a lunatic that's just old and ugly.

329
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,041
I will never be a loser like you.

330
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,750
Die you bitch!

331
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:29,875
Die?

332
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,625
Why am I the one dying?
That should be you.

333
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,999
SONG Ga-yeong!

334
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,875
I will tear you up! You know?

335
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,666
Why is everyone doing this to me...

336
00:35:03,125 --> 00:35:05,125
What did I do so wrong?!

337
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:55,040
Every time I see her,

338
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:56,641
I think she's a typical actress material.

339
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,624
I have to say the genetic
from Seoul is different.

340
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,666
Is not it?

341
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,499
What are you saying?

342
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,250
We're all the same human.

343
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,000
Ah... my head...

344
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,916
Ga-yeong.

345
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,375
Ga-yeong!

346
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I'm gonna rip you off!

347
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,041
I didn't do this, did I?

348
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,665
Oh Su-yeon.

349
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:36,165
I have a very important meeting right now.

350
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,290
I'm busy with it.

351
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,165
Ga-yeong...

352
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,624
She's dead...

353
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,749
Yes?

354
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,625
I know Ga-yeong's body
always makes us dead.

355
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,375
Idiot! She's dead!

356
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,541
What.. What?

357
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,249
I do not know.

358
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,450
After I snoozed for a while,
I woke up to find her dead.

359
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,125
Fuck! What the fuck are you talking about!

360
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,375
Please come over here... I'm scared...

361
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,666
Okay. Let's calm down...

362
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,291
The police?

363
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,000
That's

364
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,750
that's a bit tricky.

365
00:38:24,375 --> 00:38:27,750
You didn't drink, did you?

366
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,915
I mean, I found it all too hard...

367
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:33,749
Fuck!! Why are you getting drunk again?

368
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,750
You know you are gonna
lose yourself again!!!

369
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,415
Please come over here... I'm scared...

370
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:44,624
Is she really dead?

371
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,465
You saw her wrong
because you’re drunk, right?

372
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:49,755
Do you really think I can't even
distinguish being dead and being asleep?

373
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,249
Okay. Hang in there.

374
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,665
Don't tell anyone else and stay there.

375
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,250
I'll be there soon. Understand?

376
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,666
A few minutes earlier.

377
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,375
Bitch.

378
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,833
Yeah... This isn’t me.

379
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,458
I didn't kill anyone.

380
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:03,791
I know you're here.

381
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,416
I don't care who you are.

382
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:12,541
Everything you just saw
is a misunderstanding.

383
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,958
I didn't hurt anyone.

384
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:22,708
Well, it was just an accident.

385
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:30,333
So please keep it quiet like now.

386
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,416
Have you seen this person?

387
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:13,931
Do you still feel sorry for that woman
after all that has happened?

388
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:20,083
Did I kill someone due to drunk driving?

389
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,583
Why are you not answering the phone?

390
00:50:34,583 --> 00:50:37,208
I just wish you had gone quietly.

391
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,416
Are you the new kid in the school?

392
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,291
I said are you the new student from Seoul.

393
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:23,041
Yes, I am.

394
00:51:23,916 --> 00:51:25,415
What grade are you in?

395
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,416
Second grade.

396
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,916
I'm in third. You know it, right?

397
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:32,666
Yes...

398
00:51:33,583 --> 00:51:35,783
Don't they say you're the prettiest
among second grades?

399
00:51:38,041 --> 00:51:40,458
I'm not sure.

400
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:44,458
Are you pretending to be nice?

401
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,040
No, it's not...

402
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:50,083
I have something I want to show you.

403
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,290
My mom told me to come quickly.

404
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:55,915
It won't be long.

405
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:56,916
Go!

406
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,332
Who are you?

407
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:26,541
Delivery.

408
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:30,166
At this late night?

409
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,457
Yes. Are you LEE Su-yeon?

410
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,541
Someone requested urgent delivery.

411
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:48,666
Hold on.

412
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,416
Are you LEE Su-yeon?

413
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,958
Yes.

414
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,290
Looks like someone I've seen a lot of...

415
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,415
You are an actress, LEE Su-yeon.

416
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:22,416
Right?

417
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:25,415
- Yes...
- Wow! This is an honor.

418
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:28,040
You look even prettier than on screen.

419
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:29,416
Do you hear that a lot?

420
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,832
Thanks... But which one I have to get?

421
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,208
Ah! This one.

422
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,166
Thank you.

423
00:54:37,167 --> 00:54:39,791
You're welcome.
I'm rather glad to see you.

424
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:44,208
You live in a very nice house.

425
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,833
Yes, bye.

426
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:52,541
Ah! Who sent this?

427
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:55,416
I have no idea.
I didn't see the sender either.

428
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:57,583
What?

429
00:54:57,584 --> 00:55:00,458
Just over there.
I got it from a designated place.

430
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:20,166
Alright.

431
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:22,208
Yes. By the way...

432
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,708
Aren't you filming these days?

433
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:28,333
Now I have to.

434
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:30,457
Looking forward to it.

435
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:31,458
Go for it!

436
00:56:07,666 --> 00:56:08,958
What is this?

437
00:56:22,791 --> 00:56:24,666
How far should I go?

438
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:28,915
Are we still far away?

439
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:30,833
No. Almost there.

440
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,458
My feet hurt so much.

441
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:40,958
You're such a kid.

442
00:56:41,791 --> 00:56:42,915
Pardon?

443
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,665
Living is a series of pain.

444
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:48,083
There is nothing in the world
that you can do as you please.

445
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:52,458
But you're born to be pretty.

446
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:56,665
You can live less painfully
with only that reason.

447
00:56:56,666 --> 00:56:59,457
So even now. Don't say it's hard.

448
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,666
Got it?

449
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,708
You said you wanted to be an actress?

450
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:09,165
But why do you want to be an actress only?

451
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,666
There are lots of other things to do.

452
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:18,416
I have a role model.

453
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:26,916
Is this your wannabe?

454
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:31,540
Do you know what it takes

455
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:33,333
to become an actress at this level?

456
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:36,833
No...

457
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:42,041
You need to be smart, kind,
and physically strong.

458
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:45,165
If you want to hear people say
you are ‘superior’ to others.

459
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,541
Wouldn't that be the case?

460
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:49,583
Let's go.

461
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:52,333
I'll be happy to help.

462
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:19,666
What?

463
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,333
Where is she?

464
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:28,666
Hello?

465
00:58:31,916 --> 00:58:33,666
What is it? What's going on?

466
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:35,666
The body...

467
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:39,458
Her dead body is gone.

468
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,041
What are you talking about!

469
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:49,833
There's somebody here.

470
00:58:50,666 --> 00:58:52,541
Are you still drunk? Calm down!

471
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:59,041
I'm so confused right now.

472
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:01,582
I'm afraid I'll just report it
to the police.

473
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:02,583
No!

474
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:06,041
If you mess up right now,
it'll be hard for me to handle it.

475
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:09,916
If you get into a trouble
one more time, you're over!

476
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:23,458
Anyway,

477
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:27,333
my life is on a downhill slope right now.

478
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,291
Aren't I?

479
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:34,332
There's no need to be so disrespectful.

480
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:37,332
You're the best actress I know.

481
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:39,540
To others, you're a wannabe.

482
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:40,916
It's all over.

483
00:59:43,666 --> 00:59:45,915
Now.

484
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,916
It's really over.

485
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,832
Yes, I know how hard you are right now.

486
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:52,416
No, you don't.

487
00:59:53,208 --> 00:59:55,166
How can you know!!

488
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:57,208
Hello?

489
00:59:58,666 --> 00:59:59,791
Hello?

490
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,833
Fuck!!!

491
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:24,583
Do you know what it takes
to become an actress?

492
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:02,666
You wanna play with me now?

493
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:09,708
Great. Whoever you are...

494
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:13,666
I'm willing to be your match.

495
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:28,292
Ah! Hi again!

496
01:02:28,293 --> 01:02:30,001
Sorry for the late night.

497
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:33,000
What are you doing here at this hour?

498
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:35,500
There's a report coming in.

499
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,542
Yes?

500
01:02:38,543 --> 01:02:40,375
The man we were looking for earlier.

501
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:42,042
Someone saw him run away this way.

502
01:02:42,043 --> 01:02:43,876
A report has been
received from the district.

503
01:02:52,751 --> 01:02:55,625
Excuse me. Hello.
Sorry for the late night.

504
01:02:55,626 --> 01:02:57,167
As you can see from the photo.

505
01:02:57,168 --> 01:02:59,000
This friend is not normal.

506
01:02:59,001 --> 01:03:02,125
I'm worried that he might harm you.

507
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:04,918
Would you mind taking a look
around the house?

508
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:10,542
I was just about to go to bed...

509
01:03:10,543 --> 01:03:12,750
Could you come back in the morning?

510
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:17,875
I'm sorry but we have
other work after this patrol.

511
01:03:17,876 --> 01:03:19,001
I'm begging you.

512
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:22,126
Okay.

513
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:26,751
Are you alright?

514
01:03:28,876 --> 01:03:31,250
Yes, I'm good.

515
01:03:31,251 --> 01:03:34,250
We'll quickly take a look around.

516
01:03:34,251 --> 01:03:35,626
Would it be okay?

517
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:37,751
Yes.

518
01:03:38,126 --> 01:03:39,750
Thank you.

519
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:40,876
Let's go.

520
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:42,626
Thank you!

521
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:56,542
Officer, that girl.

522
01:03:56,543 --> 01:03:58,750
Doesn't she look familiar?

523
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:02,000
It's kind of familiar but not really.

524
01:04:02,001 --> 01:04:06,000
Where did I see her?
I'm pretty sure I saw her somewhere.

525
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:08,125
But that girl.

526
01:04:08,126 --> 01:04:10,250
Doesn't she look a bit odd?

527
01:04:10,251 --> 01:04:12,375
I think she's hiding something.

528
01:04:12,376 --> 01:04:13,668
Do you feel that way?

529
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:17,876
Obviously, with my experience!

530
01:04:19,251 --> 01:04:22,500
She's completely hiding something.
It's so suspicious.

531
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:23,917
Ah! Got it!

532
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:24,918
What?

533
01:04:24,919 --> 01:04:26,250
Hey.

534
01:04:26,251 --> 01:04:29,500
She's LEE Su-yeon. The actress!

535
01:04:29,501 --> 01:04:30,792
Oh, she's an actress?

536
01:04:30,793 --> 01:04:32,126
I don't know her, though.

537
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:34,250
She's a very famous actress.

538
01:04:34,251 --> 01:04:36,875
- Which show was she on?
- I was a big fan of her!

539
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:38,126
No way.

540
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:39,918
Kim.

541
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:44,876
Didn't you just hear a strange sound?

542
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:18,043
Looks like someone is there...

543
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:21,918
What do you mean by someone is there?

544
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:27,876
Have you looked around the garage today?

545
01:05:30,501 --> 01:05:31,876
The garage?

546
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:35,625
I'm sorry.

547
01:05:35,626 --> 01:05:37,376
May I have a look in the garage?

548
01:05:41,126 --> 01:05:43,250
If you don't like it...

549
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:45,751
We might get a warrant.

550
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:11,043
What are these?

551
01:06:18,168 --> 01:06:20,501
These are potatoes!
Are they Gangwon-do potatoes?

552
01:06:21,626 --> 01:06:23,043
Do you like potatoes?

553
01:06:25,668 --> 01:06:28,376
I heard potatoes are good for a diet.

554
01:06:29,126 --> 01:06:30,542
Is that right?

555
01:06:30,543 --> 01:06:33,793
Isn't it sweet potato good for a diet?

556
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:42,542
I don't think there's anything weird.

557
01:06:42,543 --> 01:06:44,917
I'm sorry to bother you.

558
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,168
Let's go.

559
01:06:49,293 --> 01:06:52,501
I'm really sorry, but...

560
01:06:53,168 --> 01:06:55,667
It's because I’m in a hurry.

561
01:06:55,668 --> 01:06:56,828
I need to go to the bathroom.

562
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:03,667
If you don't mind...

563
01:07:03,668 --> 01:07:04,876
Is it okay?

564
01:07:08,418 --> 01:07:10,043
Yes.

565
01:07:13,168 --> 01:07:14,376
Go ahead. Hurry up.

566
01:07:29,001 --> 01:07:33,043
You are an actress, LEE Su-yeon. Right?

567
01:07:35,293 --> 01:07:40,042
I was right! You looked so familiar.

568
01:07:40,043 --> 01:07:42,667
I was a huge fan of you.

569
01:07:42,668 --> 01:07:44,793
No... still a fan.

570
01:07:45,918 --> 01:07:47,042
Thanks.

571
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:50,418
Could you wait here for a moment?

572
01:07:51,543 --> 01:07:54,167
The bathroom is a bit messy.

573
01:07:54,168 --> 01:07:55,792
It's okay.

574
01:07:55,793 --> 01:07:58,001
As long as there's no dead man
in the bathroom.

575
01:08:47,501 --> 01:08:48,543
Oh, my stomach hurts.

576
01:08:52,418 --> 01:08:53,667
Come on in.

577
01:08:53,668 --> 01:08:55,500
Thank you.

578
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:56,751
Excuse me, then.

579
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:35,417
Hey, please check what I requested,

580
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:37,168
and let me know once you've looked into it.

581
01:11:06,668 --> 01:11:08,001
Did you do some research?

582
01:11:09,251 --> 01:11:10,292
Yes, I looked into it.

583
01:11:10,293 --> 01:11:11,750
There is nothing special.

584
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:13,375
She has a clear identity.

585
01:11:13,376 --> 01:11:14,542
Really?

586
01:11:14,543 --> 01:11:16,168
All right. Good job.

587
01:11:26,543 --> 01:11:28,126
Have some of this.

588
01:11:28,668 --> 01:11:30,750
Oh, thank you.

589
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:32,750
Is Kim still in the bathroom?

590
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:35,667
I don't know.
I guess she's feeling a little sick.

591
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:37,042
I see.

592
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,043
She ate a lot for dinner.

593
01:11:41,168 --> 01:11:43,667
I have a question.

594
01:11:43,668 --> 01:11:45,167
What's it?

595
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:47,667
You said someone reported it.

596
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:48,668
Right.

597
01:11:49,126 --> 01:11:51,542
The person who reported it.

598
01:11:51,543 --> 01:11:53,168
May I know who did it?

599
01:11:54,168 --> 01:11:55,668
What is that for?

600
01:11:56,918 --> 01:11:58,917
It's nothing else.

601
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:02,292
There's someone who stalks me these days.

602
01:12:02,293 --> 01:12:04,542
I was wondering if it was him.

603
01:12:04,543 --> 01:12:09,793
I don't know.
We don't know who reported it.

604
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:14,043
Then...

605
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:18,876
Do other people know that you are here?

606
01:12:20,126 --> 01:12:22,293
What are you talking about?

607
01:12:23,376 --> 01:12:24,376
Ah!

608
01:12:25,293 --> 01:12:27,417
I was wondering.

609
01:12:27,418 --> 01:12:30,418
If there were any other people
at the police office.

610
01:12:31,251 --> 01:12:34,542
I was thinking I would
pack some snacks for you guys.

611
01:12:34,543 --> 01:12:36,667
Oh! It's fine.

612
01:12:36,668 --> 01:12:38,792
Our office is too small,

613
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:40,792
so there're only two of us on duty.

614
01:12:40,793 --> 01:12:42,250
It's okay.

615
01:12:42,251 --> 01:12:43,376
Thank you for this.

616
01:12:54,876 --> 01:12:56,293
Kim!

617
01:12:58,168 --> 01:12:59,293
What's wrong?

618
01:13:07,168 --> 01:13:08,625
Kim! What's wrong?!

619
01:13:08,626 --> 01:13:11,543
Hey!

620
01:13:13,293 --> 01:13:15,042
Who did this?

621
01:13:15,043 --> 01:13:18,293
Kim, get up! Kim!

622
01:14:28,543 --> 01:14:30,043
Is there still a long way to go?

623
01:14:30,668 --> 01:14:31,792
I heard it's dangerous

624
01:14:31,793 --> 01:14:33,667
because there are a
lot of traps around here.

625
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:35,501
We already passed the place with traps.

626
01:14:37,501 --> 01:14:39,375
We're close now.

627
01:14:39,376 --> 01:14:40,543
It's right there.

628
01:14:42,293 --> 01:14:43,543
What's that?

629
01:14:44,293 --> 01:14:45,418
You'll know when you see it.

630
01:15:13,585 --> 01:15:16,085
There are so many pretty things these days.

631
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,085
The compulsion to maintain beauty...

632
01:15:24,335 --> 01:15:28,168
That's a trap.

633
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,043
It's like a punishment.

634
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:38,335
It gets strangling as you get older.

635
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:13,835
Who's there?

636
01:16:50,293 --> 01:16:53,834
I don't know who you are,
but no matter what you do,

637
01:16:53,835 --> 01:16:55,335
I won't collapse!

638
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:00,085
It was you who sent the police, right?

639
01:17:02,668 --> 01:17:04,585
Did you see the cops?

640
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,709
I'm not a person
who's going to give up easily!

641
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:09,918
Do you know that?

642
01:17:59,585 --> 01:18:00,710
No!

643
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,668
No!!

644
01:18:03,918 --> 01:18:04,918
Oppa!

645
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:08,292
Don't!

646
01:18:08,293 --> 01:18:09,792
No!! Oppa!

647
01:18:09,793 --> 01:18:12,793
Don't die.

648
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,542
Sorry. I'm sorry.

649
01:18:15,543 --> 01:18:18,084
I'm sorry, oppa.

650
01:18:18,085 --> 01:18:20,334
Don't die.

651
01:18:20,335 --> 01:18:22,710
Oppa!!

652
01:18:39,043 --> 01:18:40,710
Please help me.

653
01:18:45,085 --> 01:18:46,710
Wondering what this is?

654
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,835
If you dare, take the stones away.

655
01:18:54,835 --> 01:18:57,210
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

656
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:15,710
Open it.

657
01:19:22,585 --> 01:19:23,835
What is this?

658
01:19:25,835 --> 01:19:30,418
This is the cat that my mom used to love.

659
01:19:31,293 --> 01:19:32,792
What was his name?

660
01:19:32,793 --> 01:19:34,085
Was it Simba?

661
01:19:35,835 --> 01:19:38,543
My mom was very fond of him.

662
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,209
As she loved the cat so much,

663
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,584
she couldn't pay much attention to us.

664
01:19:44,585 --> 01:19:46,460
So, I decided to bury her here.

665
01:19:47,543 --> 01:19:49,335
It's been about two weeks or so?

666
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,334
Look at this. A lot of maggots are twisted!

667
01:19:52,335 --> 01:19:54,292
Don't do this!

668
01:19:54,293 --> 01:19:55,918
Why the hell are you doing this?

669
01:19:57,335 --> 01:20:01,417
She said the cat is prettier than me.

670
01:20:01,418 --> 01:20:03,085
Isn't it normal to feel bad?

671
01:20:04,418 --> 01:20:07,835
But not this cat...

672
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:12,043
I was curious about something else.

673
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,292
What else do you want to know?

674
01:20:15,293 --> 01:20:18,460
If it takes a fortnight for the cat
to transform so gruesome,

675
01:20:19,293 --> 01:20:22,084
how long will it take
for a pretty girl like you?

676
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:23,834
What's wrong with you!

677
01:20:23,835 --> 01:20:25,834
Scary. Don't do this.

678
01:20:25,835 --> 01:20:27,459
Don't you wonder.

679
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,710
How long does the beauty last?

680
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:33,584
What are you so afraid of?

681
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:36,167
Please, let me go.

682
01:20:36,168 --> 01:20:37,667
Who killed you?

683
01:20:37,668 --> 01:20:39,668
I just want you to
stay here for a few days.

684
01:20:45,835 --> 01:20:47,335
What's this?

685
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:49,793
A wish bracelet?

686
01:20:51,418 --> 01:20:54,293
A girl who has everything
is carrying a thing like this.

687
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:57,460
Why are you doing this to me?

688
01:20:58,335 --> 01:20:59,335
Hold on!

689
01:20:59,336 --> 01:21:00,918
I do not like it! Let this go!

690
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:17,543
Ji-min!

691
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:20,543
How did this happen?

692
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:23,418
Oh my gosh.

693
01:22:41,835 --> 01:22:46,168
Was it you?

694
01:22:47,793 --> 01:22:50,334
Why me, why?

695
01:22:50,335 --> 01:22:51,585
Isn't that funny?

696
01:22:53,085 --> 01:22:54,668
The once glamorous radiance

697
01:22:55,835 --> 01:22:59,418
can be buried beneath such harsh skin.

698
01:23:01,085 --> 01:23:03,460
Withered flowers are always sad...

699
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,960
Who are you?

700
01:23:09,335 --> 01:23:11,293
Please leave me alone.

701
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:16,960
I've come too far for that.

702
01:23:19,085 --> 01:23:21,460
I got blood on my hands,

703
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:25,450
so something needs to be sacrificed
to wash my hands off.

704
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:28,710
Sacrifice?

705
01:23:31,335 --> 01:23:33,960
That's something only valuable
people can achieve.

706
01:23:36,085 --> 01:23:37,710
You got the wrong person.

707
01:23:39,085 --> 01:23:40,585
I have nothing.

708
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:43,210
That's the problem.

709
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,710
You don't respect yourself too much.

710
01:23:48,335 --> 01:23:49,585
Such a weak.

711
01:23:50,668 --> 01:23:52,959
Where did that confidence
from the past go?

712
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,209
Shut up! What's the use of that?

713
01:23:56,210 --> 01:23:58,418
The pride you enjoyed.

714
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:02,418
The honor of standing on top of popularity.

715
01:24:04,085 --> 01:24:05,293
All of them.

716
01:24:06,335 --> 01:24:09,543
Sometimes they are the final goals
that someone struggles to win.

717
01:24:17,293 --> 01:24:22,835
There was a girl who
admired you as an actress.

718
01:24:32,585 --> 01:24:37,585
She might have wished
you to guide her life.

719
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:45,710
So, I wondered how
great of an actress you are.

720
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:50,543
But after watching you for a while,

721
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:55,210
I realized that you're
a map that make her get lost.

722
01:24:56,543 --> 01:24:58,293
It's the wrong map.

723
01:25:02,168 --> 01:25:05,085
How sad would she feel
if she finds out the truth?

724
01:25:07,835 --> 01:25:09,793
To choose the wrong map

725
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:13,585
is not my fault.

726
01:25:17,293 --> 01:25:19,043
You are so cruel.

727
01:25:22,085 --> 01:25:25,292
The blade lasts longer than a sheath,

728
01:25:25,293 --> 01:25:27,710
and a heart remains longer than heartbeats.

729
01:25:30,335 --> 01:25:32,835
You'll never know what this means.

730
01:25:33,585 --> 01:25:35,460
Don't talk like that.

731
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:38,460
What do you know about me?

732
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:41,960
At least you can tell
that you haven't matured.

733
01:25:43,668 --> 01:25:44,960
And that's a sin.

734
01:25:47,085 --> 01:25:48,835
You don't deserve to be an actress.

735
01:25:55,335 --> 01:25:56,710
What are you doing now?

736
01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:00,293
Sort of a ritual of
disqualification, you know?

737
01:28:51,543 --> 01:28:53,460
Life is a strange thing.

738
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:59,418
Life is as miserable
as the size of one's ambitions.

739
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:21,210
Su-yeon!

740
01:29:25,668 --> 01:29:26,876
LEE Su-yeon!

741
01:29:30,626 --> 01:29:31,918
LEE Su-yeon!

742
01:30:06,126 --> 01:30:09,168
Come out!

743
01:30:11,668 --> 01:30:13,668
If you do something wrong,
you should be punished!

744
01:30:15,543 --> 01:30:16,543
I mean...

745
01:30:18,251 --> 01:30:20,293
I've been punished enough.

746
01:30:22,293 --> 01:30:24,168
So you should be punished too.

747
01:30:26,168 --> 01:30:28,418
Don't be cowardly and come out!

748
01:30:36,876 --> 01:30:40,918
I didn't mean to kill her.

749
01:30:44,418 --> 01:30:47,251
I just wanted to frighten her.

750
01:31:16,543 --> 01:31:21,168
I just wished I was the prettiest.

751
01:31:23,543 --> 01:31:25,793
That's what I wanted.

752
01:31:28,418 --> 01:31:29,543
PARK Ji-min.

753
01:31:57,501 --> 01:31:58,960
You won't know.

754
01:32:01,126 --> 01:32:02,876
If you don’t resist,

755
01:32:04,251 --> 01:32:06,835
you'll get used to being unfortunate.

756
01:34:50,168 --> 01:34:55,835
WANNABE
