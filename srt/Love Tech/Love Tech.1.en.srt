Sorry?

9
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:15,109
Actually, it's my first time using this app.

10
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,351
Interesting, right?

11
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:21,984
"I had thought it didn't make sense
that an app could control people's fate."

12
00:01:23,607 --> 00:01:25,101
I agree…

But

14
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:29,679

I'm not sure if it's okay not to see it.

124

You haven't checked it yet?

125

I understand.

126
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:23,574
It might be better to check it out.

127
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,818
No, you should check it out.

128
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:28,678
Why?

129
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:32,174
You have to break up
when it expires anyway.

130
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,678
It's better to check
the date and be prepared.

131

I'm...

135
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:54,623
meeting Soo-hyun soon.

136
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,178
Hey, you didn't tell me you were home.

137
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:27,357
What are you doing?

138
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:32,435
What is this?

139
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:39,874
Did you check the date?

140
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:44,388
I pretty much packed everything.

141
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,631
You can just dump
if there's anything I left.

142
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:49,865
I just asked if you've checked the date.

143
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:52,006
Jae-young,

144
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,303
let's end it here
rather than hurting each other.

145
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:57,388
Wait, why are you doing this all of a sudden?

146
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:00,170
All of a sudden?

147
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,701
Then tell me what's going on!

148
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:03,881
There must be a reason for this.

149
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:05,513
We were supposed to meet today.

150
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:07,607
Why didn't you keep your word?

151
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,396
I said I'm sorry.

152
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:14,466
I'm already worn and busy
because of my work.

153
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,107
You know that.

154
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,553
You're not the only one.

155
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,419
I'm exhausted and busy too.

156
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:22,817
But I try to call you as best I can

157
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:25,349
and care about us when I can.

158
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,974
At least I don't act like you.

159
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:30,426
What do you mean?

160
00:16:32,472 --> 00:16:34,342
Not paying attention when I'm around,

161
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,043
leaving me feeling alone,

162
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:41,037
and making me feel miserable
when I'm trying so hard.

163
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:43,693
This is what you do all the time.

164
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:46,662
What about you?

165
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:49,356
You always do whatever you want to do.

166
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:50,787
You're selfish.

167
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,036
You get whiney when I'm caught by work.

168
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:57,826
I always have to read your feeling.

169
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,099
You're not the only one
who's miserable and exhausted.

170
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:03,396
You have no idea
how far you can drive someone crazy.

171
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,131
Is that so?

172
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,146
No, Soo-hyun.

173
00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:21,381
We were together for three years.

174
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,709
We can't break up like this.

175
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:26,442
These are not that serious issues.

176
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:28,365
They are not that serious to you.

177
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,685
Please...

178
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:35,881
We should delete this app.

179
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:39,842
And let's see each other
as much as we want to.

180
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:42,314
Whether we have the app or not,

181
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,990
I might still end up
breaking up with you anyway.

182
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,998
Do you know this song?

183
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:42,357
Sorry?

184
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,490
Yes,

185
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,123
I know the song.

186
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,443
This song is pretty famous these days.

187
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:55,599
"It wasn't released since it was in the making,
but now it's finally complete and out."

188
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,734
Do you like this song?

189
00:20:02,608 --> 00:20:03,413
Yes.

190
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,428
I love it.

191
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:20,122
(DESTINY: THE EXPIRATION DATE OF HAN JAE-YOUNG
AND LEE JU-HEE HAS BEEN SET.)

192
00:20:20,162 --> 00:20:22,162
