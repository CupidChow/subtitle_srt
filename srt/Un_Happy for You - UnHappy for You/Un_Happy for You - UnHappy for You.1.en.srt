1
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,441
Good evening, everyone!

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:29,821
We finally reached the highlight
of the Maharang Festival.

3
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:34,117
This event has been part
of our yearly tradition.

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,329
Who will emerge
as the Chili King and Queen of 2018?

5
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,167
Are you ready
for the Chili Challenge?

6
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,629
Are you excited
to meet our contestants?

7
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,298
Let's all welcome them.

8
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,092
- Me!
- Bro!

9
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,677
- Get this guy!
- Not me!

10
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:56,264
- Naga, make some noise!
- Come on, come on!

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,768
Okay, guys.

12
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,103
- We only have four pairs so far.
- You should join!

13
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,481
We will get one more pair
from the audience.

14
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,734
- Me!
- Who wants to join?

15
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,611
You want to join, right?

16
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,404
- Here, him!
- Me!

17
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,781
- This guy!
- Any brave souls?

18
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:16,242
That girl over there!

19
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,411
- Get me!
- This guy!

20
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,454
Do you have a partner?

21
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,331
Partner?

22
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,457
- Get my friend!
- I don't want to!

23
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,835
- Get my friend!
- Any volunteer?

24
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,754
Who wants to partner with her?

25
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,512
You! He's my partner!

26
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,555
- There you go!
- Yes! Let's go!

27
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,598
Why me?

28
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,850
Come with me!

29
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,936
Come up here on stage.

30
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,774
Hmm…

31
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,324
Here we go!

32
00:01:56,407 --> 00:02:00,453
The first pair to finish wins.

33
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,373
Water?

34
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,586
It's so spicy. I can't.

35
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,838
Let me do it.

36
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,592
Can you still do it?

37
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,140
These guys are almost done.

38
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,518
Can you still do it?

39
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,602
You can do it!

40
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,778
Has anyone finished?

41
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,323
Go for it! Almost there!

42
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,664
We have a winner!

43
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:50,670
Please give it up
for your 2018 Chili King and Queen!

44
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,638
Try my kinalas.
It's for my future restaurant.

45
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,391
It's my first time to try this.
Is it good?

46
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,270
How is it?

47
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,439
Thank you.

48
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,732
I told you it's good.

49
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,154
This is so good.

50
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,822
Why don't you bring this to Manila?

51
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,074
Careful!

52
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,410
Which one? The kinalas or me?

53
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,412
Hmm…

54
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,872
I guess both.

55
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,251
So, come fly with me to Manila?

56
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,452
Miss Anita!

57
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,954
- Juancho.
- Wow! You look blooming today.

58
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,372
What brings you here?

59
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,500
My courage and my confidence
in Casa Rosa, ma'am.

60
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:38,087
My gosh! I've already spoken
with Aiah, and I'm sorry,

61
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,007
but my friends don't think
Casa Rosa will click in Manila.

62
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,136
Ma'am, you're wasting a very good
investment opportunity here.

63
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,680
Oh my gosh! You're stressing me out!

64
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,682
- My cortisol level is rising!
- Oh…

65
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,226
- Calm down.
- Put my bags inside the van now.

66
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,353
I mean, my God!

67
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,565
Miss Anita!

68
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,859
You know what?

69
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,569
We have a Chef's Special Night tonight.

70
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,404
Seven p.m.

71
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,990
And the best table
is reserved just for you.

72
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,826
For me?

73
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,703
Just for me?

74
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,457
- Stop!
- Stop. Stop.

75
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,708
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes!

76
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,419
Bro, let's start with the prep!

77
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,921
Are the ingredients ready?

78
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,881
Yes, we're ready.

79
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,466
Good! Good!

80
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,218
Bro, just like any other night,

81
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,179
tell everyone that we have
no room for mistakes.

82
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,556
I'll take care of it.

83
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,849
Okay, okay.

84
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,355
- It's burning!
- What happened?

85
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,649
A tricycle broke down.

86
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,400
Hello!

87
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,860
- Hello? Come on!
- What happened here?

88
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,737
Hello, bro?

89
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,656
Bro, are you still there?

90
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,546
Bro, please prepare
one seat in the open kitchen.

91
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,214
I'm just gonna tempt someone.

92
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,632
Okay, copy.

93
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,898
Yes, Agi, it's okay. I'm right here.

94
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,612
Sir, what the hell?
You almost ran me over!

95
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,657
You know? Just give me my food.

96
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,658
Can I just have it?

97
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,383
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,106
Hey!

99
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,649
Zy, how have you been?

100
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,526
What are you doing here?

101
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:13,826
I'm… I'm just waiting… for… food delivery.

102
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,287
Here? In Naga?

103
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,705
Naga.

104
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,043
When did you arrive?

105
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,085
Are you here to visit your family?

106
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,297
No. I'm just here for work.

107
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,632
- For work.
- Yeah.

108
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,510
Since when?

109
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,678
Just this morning.

110
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,181
Okay.

111
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,808
Until when are you here?

112
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,727
Just for a while.

113
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,021
Like… ten days

114
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,607
and then I'm going back to New York.

115
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,118
Awkward, isn't it?

116
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,120
What?

117
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,372
It's awkward.

118
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,252
Zy, let's be honest.

119
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:09,632
We didn't have a good break-up,
so now, it's awkward.

120
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,053
I knew it! You're still mad!

121
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,846
Oh my God!

122
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,390
You're still mad.

123
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,433
Of course, Zy!

124
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,435
You made a fool out of me!

125
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,647
You were selfish. And… a bitch!

126
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,904
Well… I had to be one,

127
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,698
just so that I could survive
being in a relationship

128
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,158
with a… boy like you.

129
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:38,828
Wow.

130
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,833
So, you really have no plans to apologize?

131
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,794
Why?

132
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,381
Would my apology still matter now?

133
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,437
Delivery, ma'am.

134
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,231
Is that for me?

135
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,316
Thank you.

136
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,110
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

137
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,531
It's nice seeing you again. I have to go.

138
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,366
Is that what you're eating?

139
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,535
Fast food?

140
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,704
Why don't you eat at the restaurant?

141
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,333
Why? You don't want to?

142
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,334
Or you can't?

143
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,669
No, of course not. I'm just really hungry.

144
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:31,088
Perfect! Let me make
Bicol Express for you.

145
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,549
Spicy, sweet, oily.

146
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,217
Just how you like it.

147
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,302
See?

148
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,723
I heard that! Let's go!

149
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,850
Or maybe you don't want to come with me

150
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,812
- because you're still not over me.
- Can you stop? My God!

151
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,303
Come in.

152
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,025
Wow!

153
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,027
It looks different.

154
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,031
Yup. We renovated and updated our menu.

155
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,409
I recreated Grandma Rosa's dishes.

156
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,326
Enjoy your food, sir.

157
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,871
I put up an open kitchen inside.

158
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,707
We also have Chef's Special Nights
during weekends.

159
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,668
Your timing is perfect.

160
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,587
- Hi, Chef Juancho.
- Hello.

161
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,423
- Hi, hi.
- Please say "hi" to our vlog.

162
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,507
- Hi, vlog!
- Hi!

163
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,551
Chef Juancho from Casa Rosa.

164
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,094
Thank you, Chef.

165
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:04,223
Good day! Welcome to Casa Rosa!

166
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,516
- La, two tables.
- Yes?

167
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,227
- One for her and one for our investor.
- Sure.

168
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,854
I'll take care of that, boss.

169
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,689
- This one right here,
- Here it is,

170
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,441
- this is Rosa Fresca.
- the open kitchen!

171
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,609
All the ingredients
are freshly picked

172
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,361
- Hold on.
- from our farm outside.

173
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,406
We will serve this in a bit.

174
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,199
Thank you.

175
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,119
This is Jon. He's training
to be the head chef

176
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,996
for our new branch in Manila.

177
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,789
You're so beautiful, ma'am.

178
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:29,957
- Hurry up.
- Thank you.

179
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,876
Okay? Bro.

180
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,669
Yes, bro?

181
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,712
Why?

182
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,755
- Menu.
- Menu.

183
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,050
Papa Jun, Zy is here.

184
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,054
- Menu.
- Thank you.

185
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,556
- Epi, double time.
- Yes.

186
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,350
There are so many customers.

187
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:53,647
Papa Jun had a stroke
more than a year ago.

188
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,277
I took over the restaurant since then.

189
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,281
Let me know if there's
anything else you want.

190
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,657
I'll send someone over to assist you.

191
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,827
Hmm?

192
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,245
You still have that?

193
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,248
Yup.

194
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,167
I'm not ready to let go…

195
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,795
of the bird.

196
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,006
- Sir?
- Excuse me.

197
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,133
- Hold this for me, La.
- Okay.

198
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,051
Don't go.

199
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,435
Jon, how are we doing?

200
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,895
Everything's good, boss.

201
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,814
- Psst! Hey, bro.
- Yes?

202
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,234
What is Zy doing here?
Why are you together?

203
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,735
She's in for a treat.

204
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,655
I'll make her join our Chili Challenge.

205
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,574
Stop fooling around.

206
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,951
Waiter.

207
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,661
Where's the restroom?

208
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,038
I'll take care of Zy's order,
so you can focus on the investor.

209
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,831
No. I'm already on it.

210
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,416
I'll do it. You might poison her.

211
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,168
- I won't poison her.
- Really?

212
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,461
I'll just make her regret.

213
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,214
Who is she anyway?

214
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,383
What do you mean?

215
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,592
Are you planning to get back with her?

216
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,512
Who are you getting back with?

217
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,805
I'm not getting back with her.

218
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,349
I will get back at her.

219
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,725
I'll ask her then.

220
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,353
- Hey!
- Wait!

221
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,688
That's Zy.

222
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,982
His Zy.

223
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,233
As in Zy?

224
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,611
Your psycho ex-girlfriend?

225
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,821
Yes.

226
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,366
Oh no! You're dead.

227
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,577
Not you, boss.

228
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,245
I meant Zy.

229
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,956
It's showtime!

230
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,873
I'm hungry.

231
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,292
Just a sec.

232
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,786
Your apology won't matter now

233
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,871
because I've already forgiven you.

234
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,168
What?

235
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,546
Just to answer your question earlier,

236
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,299
if your apology would still matter now?

237
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:09,927
Oh.

238
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,597
You really mean that?

239
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,308
Of course!
I mean, look at us now.

240
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,060
We both reached our dreams.

241
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,103
You in New York,

242
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,105
me with my restaurant.

243
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,482
Right.

244
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,693
Right.

245
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,736
Look at you.

246
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,697
You're not a boy anymore.

247
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,156
You've matured.

248
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,449
I'm proud of you.

249
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,665
So, your work. How's everything?

250
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,083
Are you covering an event?

251
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,501
Or an article to write?

252
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,461
- Yeah--
- Wait.

253
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,629
Do you still write?

254
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,548
Yeah.

255
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,674
Articles.

256
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,343
About what?

257
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,803
About Bicolano food.

258
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,514
Perfect!

259
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,932
Is there anything you need to know?

260
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,434
You can ask me.

261
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,519
No, it's okay.
I'm in contact with a tourism officer.

262
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,271
He said he'll help me.

263
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,231
Okay.

264
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:06,942
How's the food?

265
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,445
It's good!

266
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,071
No wonder you have a lot of customers.

267
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,992
The Bicol Express…

268
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,161
Did you change it?

269
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,705
Because the flavors are…

270
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:21,874
It's too strong.

271
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,334
Like it's showing off.

272
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,839
Maybe it's just me.

273
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,425
Yeah.

274
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:32,593
It's just you.

275
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,803
That's our best-seller.

276
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,516
Excuse me.

277
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,476
Enjoy your food.

278
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,937
Good evening, Miss Anita.
Welcome to Casa Rosa.

279
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,732
- Let's go.
- Okay.

280
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,942
Tonight,
you will not just taste the heat,

281
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,569
you will experience it.

282
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,654
This is your special seat.

283
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,199
Thank you. Wow.

284
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:58,786
Really up front and center.

285
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,580
To see where the magic happens.

286
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,040
All right, everyone!

287
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,625
Excuse me.

288
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,253
As you all know,
Bicol is known for its chili.

289
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,299
The closer to the volcano,
the spicier the chili is.

290
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,469
That's one of the things
we honor here at Casa Rosa.

291
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,429
And part of our Chef's Special Night

292
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,140
is the Chili Challenge.

293
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:26,522
And tonight is a special night because

294
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,359
the Maharang Fest
2018 Chili Queen is here.

295
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,569
Zy Angeles!

296
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:39,827
Chili Queen! Chili Queen!

297
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,412
And she will defend her title tonight.

298
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,622
Chili Queen!

299
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,207
- I can't.
- You can.

300
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,918
- I can't do it.
- Of course, you can.

301
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,378
- You can do it.
- Chili Queen!

302
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,505
- We believe in you.
- I can't, La.

303
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,342
Chili Queen! Chili Queen!

304
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,552
Okay, fine.

305
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,471
I will only join if you join.

306
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,472
Right?

307
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,599
- Chili King 2018.
- Oh, yeah!

308
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,601
- Right!
- That's correct!

309
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:10,274
Chili King! Chili King!

310
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:14,069
Chili King!

311
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,156
For the Chili Challenge,

312
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,993
each pair will go through
three spicy rounds.

313
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,744
Round one.

314
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,705
- The irresistibly
- Hey! Don't stop!

315
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,582
hot spicy Laing.

316
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,877
So spicy!

317
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,674
Round two.

318
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,761
The dangerous
and delectable Bicol Express.

319
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,471
Let's go, Zy!

320
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,389
Okay.

321
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,895
Okay.

322
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,106
Okay, game!

323
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,110
Fuck.

324
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,155
Oh my God! It's so hot!

325
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,491
Fuck, fuck.

326
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,703
For the final round,

327
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,664
the enticing yet deadly Bicol Chili.

328
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,164
It still burns!

329
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,877
This sugar cube should help.

330
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,365
‪

331
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,395
Ouch.

332
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,497
I'm getting married.

333
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,736
So you'll see her again?

334
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:27,447
I thought she's getting married.

335
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,616
Zy is getting married?

336
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,119
What a bunch of crap!

337
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,662
Then why did she come with you?

338
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,415
That's not what a decent lady does!

339
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,043
Even if Tin and I are apart

340
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,171
and her exes are also in Manila,

341
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,299
one is even her neighbor,
she never interacts with them.

342
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,177
She's so loyal to me.
That's why I want to marry her.

343
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,139
That's a decent girlfriend.

344
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,932
And you're saying Zy is engaged?

345
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:57,644
She shouldn't be flirting with her ex!
What the hell?

346
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:01,064
She's already fooled you once.
Wasn't that enough?

347
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,943
Bro, she wronged you.

348
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,236
Okay?

349
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,708
‪

350
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,381
Coffee? Do we have coffee?

351
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,676
Ba.

352
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,094
Laya's menu.

353
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,931
- Careful.
- I'm rushing.

354
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,683
Our first baby.

355
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,393
I have to go, Ba. Sorry.

356
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,311
- I'll check it later!
- Ba!

357
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,521
Ma'am, sir, free taste?

358
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,689
Kinalas nachos.

359
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,941
We have a promo today.

360
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,485
- Wanna try?
- Yeah.

361
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,822
Okay!

362
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,701
Yes, I'm free. I can interview her.

363
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,619
Zy!

364
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,871
I have to go. Cover for me.

365
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,049
She didn't just wrong me.

366
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,219
Let me know if there's
anything else you want to sell.

367
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,304
I'm sorry Laya didn't work out.

368
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,016
We said we'd reach
our dreams together,

369
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,935
but she only thought of herself.

370
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,480
They accepted my application
for a part-time job.

371
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,856
- Really?
- Yeah!

372
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,734
Yeah, and I'm really so grateful!

373
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,818
You have no idea.

374
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,196
I feel like everything
is really falling into place.

375
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,156
That's great.

376
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,033
Yeah. Sorry, I'll just move.

377
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,369
Do you already have
your plane ticket?

378
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,286
Yeah, I--

379
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,497
Please check
all the requirements that I sent you.

380
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,666
Yes. I have everything here, ma'am.

381
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,000
I have it with me.

382
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,762
She turned
her back on our dreams.

383
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:58,306
She made new plans without me.

384
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,615
Will you marry me?

385
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,083
Stop.

386
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,377
Stop it, Juancho.

387
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,837
Ba, please.

388
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,466
I'm sorry.

389
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,179
Please. I can't.

390
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,723
It was so easy
for her to drop me

391
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,100
just because she reached her dreams.

392
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,271
Zy?

393
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,273
Zy, why aren't you picking up?

394
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,858
Juancho, please stop.

395
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,861
Let's talk! Let's fix this, okay?

396
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:57,407
Let's talk about it, please?
I'm begging you.

397
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,452
I'll apply for a visa again.

398
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,204
I'll follow you there!

399
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,415
I met someone new in New York.

400
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,335
What?

401
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,714
Bro?

402
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,511
Bro.

403
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,016
Juancho!

404
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,393
Juancho, let's go!

405
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,479
Let's go back to Bicol.

406
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,399
Juancho!

407
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,944
Let's go home, dammit! Look at yourself!

408
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,112
Wait!

409
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,864
Let's go!

410
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,450
Fuck!

411
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,118
- What?
- Wait!

412
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,748
Zy.

413
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,334
Stop this!

414
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,919
Dammit.

415
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,128
Stop this!

416
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,547
Zy didn't just wrong me.

417
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,591
She insulted me, neglected me,

418
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,553
humiliated me, abandoned me,

419
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,721
and cheated on me.

420
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,598
That's right, boss!

421
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,393
So, let her feel your wrath.

422
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,729
She's evil.

423
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,150
She doesn't deserve to be happy.

424
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,443
Screw her!

425
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,845
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, babe.

426
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,388
How are you?

427
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,514
How's Bicol?

428
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,766
Good.

429
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,684
It's hot, though.

430
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,522
How was your research? Have you started?

431
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,192
No, not yet. We'll start tomorrow.

432
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,068
- I'll do some immersion with the suanoys.
- Mm-hmm.

433
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,987
- They know the heirloom recipes.
- That's good.

434
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,905
Good luck!

435
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,532
You seem tired. Jetlag?

436
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,911
Or did you see people
that you didn't want to see?

437
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,120
Well…

438
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,791
I saw Juancho.

439
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,584
Juancho.

440
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,128
Well, what can you expect?

441
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,839
You're in Bicol. He's from there.

442
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,258
Why?

443
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,802
How bad was it?

444
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,303
He was…

445
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,430
civil.

446
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,266
I can go there for you
if you need me there.

447
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,976
How?

448
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,812
You're too busy, babe.

449
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,023
Yeah. Guilty.

450
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,985
Well, anyway, good luck with your article.

451
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,279
Your first byline should be impressive,

452
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,573
so David could give you
more writing assignments.

453
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:27,742
Yeah.

454
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,993
I will.

455
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,537
I mean,

456
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,205
that's what I'm here for.

457
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,332
For work.

458
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:38,253
Anyway, babe, I have to start my day
and get ready for work.

459
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,921
I'll see you soon.

460
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,631
Get some sleep.

461
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,842
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

462
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:44,926
- Bye.
- Bye.

463
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,992
You're visiting Grandma Maring?

464
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,411
She's my Grandma Rosa's friend.

465
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,414
Yes, sir. Ms. Zy asked me
to look for suanoys

466
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,874
for her research.

467
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,378
Hi, Zy!

468
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,131
- Good morning!
- Ms. Zy Angeles?

469
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,508
- I'm Ronnie, your tourism officer.
- Yes?

470
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,177
Do you want to interview
Chef Juancho first?

471
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:29,762
He's off the list.

472
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:32,765
Zy.

473
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,609
You left this.

474
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,996
Thank you.

475
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,289
For this or for last night?

476
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,084
That shouldn't have happened.

477
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,172
And it meant nothing,
so there's no point in us talking.

478
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,924
I don't wanna see you anymore.

479
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,845
We'll go ahead, sir.

480
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,854
Oh.

481
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,397
Hello, Juancho? What is it?

482
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,774
Hello, Grandma Maring.

483
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,817
I need a favor.

484
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,361
The crazy girl?

485
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,654
What will I do with her?

486
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,281
Can I interview you?

487
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,118
- Oh no! You can't!
- I just have questions about your laing.

488
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,912
I will poison her!

489
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,122
If you're gonna interview me in Tagalog,

490
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,457
just go home.

491
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,625
- This will be quick.
- Wait!

492
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,543
Oh my God!

493
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,462
I'm dead!

494
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,380
I'm so--

495
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,424
You still have rice on your face.

496
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,010
I told you to leave your husband.

497
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,637
He's useless!

498
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,807
Grandma V! How have you been?

499
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,267
My baby. How are you?

500
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,105
Grandma, prepare the coconuts.

501
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,064
She's on her way to you.

502
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,816
The crazy girl?

503
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,901
Maring already spilled the tea.

504
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,573
She'll grate these coconuts to death!

505
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,452
- Grandma V, my lovey!
- My baby.

506
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,705
Zy! Is that you?
Is this your sideline?

507
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,331
Do it properly.

508
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,749
This is how you do it.

509
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,130
I'm ready. Let's go!

510
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,466
- Alright!
- Grandma, what about our interview?

511
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,427
Pretend you have
a headache until tomorrow.

512
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,095
- Like this.
- I'll take care of her research.

513
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,472
- Ouch! I have a headache!
- Please look after the store.

514
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,433
- Grandma, let's go! Zy!
- Let's go!

515
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,934
Grandma Zon!

516
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,687
The tea that you gave me the other day…

517
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,813
Did you drink all of it?

518
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,774
It cured my hangover!

519
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,694
Grandma, let's do the ritual.

520
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,238
We're here!

521
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,366
The others told me that she's crazy.

522
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,829
Well, let's see if she stands
a chance against us.

523
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,331
Cooking cassava pudding is sacred.

524
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,292
You need to be free of sins.

525
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:10,048
Have mercy! Have mercy!

526
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,592
Say it to Juancho.

527
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,804
Have mercy!

528
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,724
- Make it more affectionate.
- Have mercy!

529
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:25,521
- With feelings.
- Have mercy!

530
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,440
Please?

531
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,901
Forgive me?

532
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:30,902
Please?

533
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,196
Okay?

534
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,747
Oh my God!

535
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,875
Oh my God!

536
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,002
Juancho, oh my goodness! Oh my God!

537
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,253
- What the hell?
- What?

538
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,297
- Juancho! Seriously!
- You're too serious!

539
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,465
- Juancho! Please.
- More?

540
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,675
Juancho! Please.

541
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,886
Stop it! I'm serious!

542
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,513
Are you okay?

543
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,141
Do you really have to catch
the crablets yourself?

544
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,768
Not really.

545
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,812
You can catch them for me. Want to try?

546
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,648
Hmm… No, thanks.

547
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,067
See that?

548
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:15,113
That's the trap
where we also put the food.

549
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,038
Is that really necessary?

550
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,874
Of course! I'll be soaked with sweat.

551
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,502
You see this?

552
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,506
The crablets will bite the food
until they are trapped.

553
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,778
‪

554
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,238
Zy, I'm not the food.

555
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,408
What's there to bite? You're so thin!

556
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,535
Excuse me. You bit this before.

557
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,370
Not just bite.

558
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,164
Consumed!

559
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,415
Oh my God. You're so annoying.

560
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,332
Consumed.

561
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,625
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

562
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,586
Stop blabbering. Give it to me!

563
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,129
- Give me.
- Careful!

564
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,088
Do you even know how to do it?

565
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,424
Oh my God!

566
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,427
- We might fall!
- Oh my God!

567
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,554
Oh my God!

568
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,806
Breathe.

569
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,059
Breathe.

570
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,936
I'm so scared.

571
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:52,919
Come in.

572
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,754
I'll teach you how to make tinuktok.

573
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,301
How's your article?

574
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,892
Uhm…

575
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,687
I still need to do more research.

576
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,065
Weren't the grandmas helpful?

577
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,568
Yeah. It was… helpful.

578
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,404
I see the value in traditional cooking.

579
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:23,616
Yeah. That's why I want to use that
for the new dish

580
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,909
in my Manila branch.

581
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,826
It's new and yet,

582
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,079
the flavor of Bicol is still there.

583
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,373
Why don't you write about me?

584
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,624
About Casa Rosa?

585
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,918
That's interesting.

586
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,965
Well, I do need to submit
my piece tomorrow.

587
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,758
So…

588
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,510
you'll write about me?

589
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,637
My food?

590
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,764
Yeah. I can write about Casa Rosa.

591
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,182
I'll interview you.

592
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,019
I'd like that.

593
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:52,937
Babi?

594
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,650
- Babi, you're here!
- I'm here!

595
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,901
Put me down.

596
00:37:58,985 --> 00:37:59,902
I've missed you.

597
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,320
Missed you too.

598
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,155
If you looked at my messages,

599
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,158
- you'd know I was here.
- Hey, relax.

600
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,618
You smell so good!

601
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,495
And you look prettier after a shower!

602
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:10,413
Stop it.

603
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,456
- Oh. Babi.
- Hi. Hello.

604
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,457
My God. I'm so sorry.

605
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,334
- Zy, this is Babi.
- Hi.

606
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,628
My partner. Babi, this is Zy.

607
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,798
- Old friend.
- Hmm.

608
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,216
Okay. Hi.

609
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,884
Hi.

610
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,429
Babi, Zy is a writer in New York.

611
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,180
She's writing about Bicolano food,

612
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,223
and I'm helping her.

613
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,267
She'll also feature Casa Rosa.

614
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,477
Oh, nice! Okay.

615
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,729
Actually,

616
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,648
I was just going to… leave you guys.

617
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,068
We could… We could just resume,

618
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,236
I guess, tomorrow?

619
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,404
No. It's okay.

620
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,323
- You can stay.
- It's so nice meeting you.

621
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,742
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

622
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,201
Bye.

623
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,162
I think she felt awkward.

624
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:55,374
You should've clarified
that I'm just your business partner.

625
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,376
She got jealous, right?

626
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,170
Oh my God.

627
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,463
Honestly, I don't care.

628
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,382
Anyway, Miss Anita said no as an investor.

629
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,468
So, let's proceed
with the investors' dinner.

630
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,554
And I'm thinking, we should do it here.

631
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,889
Miss Anita has a point.

632
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,683
We should make it a bar and restaurant.

633
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,935
Do you think Papa Jun will approve?

634
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,771
If Papa Jun approves,

635
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,439
then we can do
the cocktail tasting tomorrow.

636
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,661
It's a shame you left early.

637
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,789
You didn't get
to try the crablets we caught.

638
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,749
How did you cook it?

639
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,834
Well, I made it into a bar chow.

640
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,753
Basically, tinuktok bites.

641
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,546
We need to expand our menu

642
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,840
to cater to our future Manila branch.

643
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,883
So, wait,

644
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:47,927
you're gonna change Casa Rosa in Manila?

645
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,136
Not entirely.

646
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,846
We just need to introduce dishes

647
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,473
that could appeal to the Manila market

648
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,017
while using Bicolano elements.

649
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,728
That's why the investors' dinner
is crucial for us to test this out.

650
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,814
I see.

651
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,733
That's interesting.

652
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,110
I'm curious how
the investors would receive

653
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,153
your concept about fusion.

654
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,489
I hope they would appreciate
how you keep up

655
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,492
with the times
without sacrificing your roots.

656
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,535
I know.

657
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,995
Actually, why don't you come
to the cocktail tasting tomorrow?

658
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,082
We will make signature drinks
using Bicolano ingredients.

659
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,292
It might help with the new direction
of your article.

660
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,794
Sure, I can join.

661
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,462
Is it okay if I invite Lei?

662
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,672
Of course!

663
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,048
Invite your brother.

664
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,508
Okay. I'll see you.

665
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,135
Thanks for today, Juancho.

666
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,594
No worries. Bye.

667
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:37,935
‪

668
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,528
Thank you very much.

669
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,904
Thank you also.

670
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,114
Yes!

671
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,491
Early closing, so we can go drinking!

672
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,493
Yes. I'm so ready!

673
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,413
Why close early? Not good for profit.

674
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,873
As long as we get paid the same,

675
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,499
there's no problem.

676
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,460
- Thank you for coming, ma'am.
- Thank you also.

677
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,753
- Jon.
- Boss.

678
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,382
Hey! Perfect!
So glad you could join us, Zy.

679
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,925
- Zy?
- I hope you're getting…

680
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,927
Finally, you decided to show up!

681
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,596
You're so workaholic!

682
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:14,972
Hmm?

683
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,892
Lei.

684
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,314
- Hi.
- Sis, where is Matt?

685
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,065
Why isn't he with you?

686
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,650
He's in New York.

687
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,943
We're okay. Don't worry.

688
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,528
Look, I'm getting married.

689
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,406
Sis! Oh my gosh!

690
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,577
I thought you're back together
with Juancho.

691
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,578
- Lei.
- Oh.

692
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,413
No offense, Juancho.

693
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,374
But for now, we're celebrating!

694
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,376
Sis, you're getting married!

695
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,338
We should celebrate!
Another reason to drink, right?

696
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,089
- Come on. I say let's go!
- Let's go!

697
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,011
We'll just start preparing.

698
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,726
This is a little strong.
What's a good name?

699
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,187
Cassava drink.

700
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,233
Crushed and beaten to goodness.

701
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,568
- That's savage!
- That's it.

702
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,736
That's it.

703
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,029
"Cas-savage".

704
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,280
Oh!

705
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,782
"Cas-savage".

706
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,243
Okay, next drink.
What should we call this one?

707
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,619
The taste of a martyr.

708
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,037
That's me!

709
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,580
He's a martyr too!

710
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,748
- Excuse me.
- Me?

711
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,668
My sister's a martyr, too!

712
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,796
Let's call it "Apple Martyr-ni".

713
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,589
Nice!

714
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,550
Okay, next drink.

715
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,218
- Now, what?
- Oh my God.

716
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,721
This tastes like pure alcohol.
It's like gas.

717
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,265
Oh my God!

718
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,432
- "Unleaded".
- What?

719
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,892
Any objections?

720
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,018
Good, right?

721
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,023
Okay, everybody.

722
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,567
Let's make a toast.

723
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,570
- Cheers to Zy's wedding!
- Cheers to that!

724
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:57,157
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

725
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,077
Cheers!

726
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,998
A managing editor and a beautiful writer.

727
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,958
What a perfect match!

728
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,253
Yes! My ship has sailed!

729
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,796
Your phone's vibrating.

730
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,590
Someone's calling you.

731
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,383
- I'll get it later.
- It's Matt.

732
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,676
- It's okay.
- Sis.

733
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,053
- I'll answer it.
- Lei.

734
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,179
- Cheers!
- Let me answer it.

735
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,391
- Hi, Matt!
- Lei!

736
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,477
- How are you?
- This is your B.I.L.

737
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,731
Brother-in-law!
We're celebrating your engagement.

738
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:29,857
Look.

739
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,026
- Say hi, everyone.
- Wow!

740
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,028
- Hello.
- He said hi!

741
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,613
- Looks like a great party.
- Hello!

742
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,948
Hi, everyone! I wish I was there.

743
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,325
Can I talk to your sister?

744
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,618
Yeah, okay.

745
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,995
I ran out of English.

746
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,913
- Babe, enjoy your night.
- Okay, babe.

747
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,332
Don't drink too much.
You have work tomorrow.

748
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:48,208
I won't get drunk. I promise.

749
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,878
- I love you.
- Okay. I love you too.

750
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,879
I'll talk to you later.

751
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,589
Okay. Bye.

752
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,798
Bye.

753
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,177
Are you done?

754
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:02,431
You're done.

755
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,308
Next drink.

756
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,935
- My favorite.
- Okay, okay.

757
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,979
Blue pea passion fruit.

758
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,734
This is good!

759
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,528
- It's sweet!
- Right?

760
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,113
This is for you, sis.

761
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,366
You and Matt!

762
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,825
Lei, you're right.

763
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,536
It's good, but it's deadly.
It will sneak up on you.

764
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,746
Like a traitor.

765
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,081
‪

766
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,626
Zy, try it.

767
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,920
I'm sure you'll like that.

768
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,299
Babi, next drink. Jon, bring it here.

769
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,134
No, Babi. We're not yet done.

770
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,637
Zy hasn't tried it yet. Zy, try it.

771
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,639
Just enjoy it.

772
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:47,267
At first, it will delight you,

773
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,435
and then, boom!

774
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,853
There's a twist.

775
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,523
It turns sour, then you're all alone.

776
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,528
You're all alone because you're drunk!

777
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,321
Zy, don't look so guilty.

778
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,781
Next drink.

779
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,282
Let's have some coffee.

780
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,325
- Someone's already drunk.
- Right, right.

781
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,993
Who's drunk, bro?

782
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,162
I'm not drunk.
We're just brainstorming here.

783
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,834
Has anyone thought of a name yet?

784
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,047
Nothing?

785
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,592
Okay, what if… Uhm…

786
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:25,097
"I Met Someone New In New York".

787
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,599
He's drunk.

788
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,892
Zy, what do you think?

789
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,019
- Huh?
- That's enough.

790
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,772
- What do you think? No?
- Come on now.

791
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,567
Or if you want,
we can take Lei's suggestion.

792
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,277
He said you're like that drink.

793
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,653
Let's call it "Zy".

794
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:40,612
You're a traitor, right?

795
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,990
That's not what I said, Juancho.

796
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,033
- That's enough!
- That's what you said.

797
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:45,993
- Let's pack up!
- Let's go home.

798
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:46,910
- You're drunk.
- Right, let's go.

799
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,162
Hey, Zy! No comment?

800
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,830
That's enough.

801
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,498
What?

802
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,000
I'll go ahead.

803
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,211
- You're leaving again!
- Juancho, please stop. That's enough.

804
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,007
That's right!
That's what you said to me that night.

805
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,050
On the phone, remember?

806
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,761
"Juancho, please stop."

807
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,388
The nerve to say "please"!

808
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,474
Bro.

809
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,770
- Good times. Good times.
- Good times, bro.

810
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,897
Next drink!

811
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,233
Let's call it

812
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,485
"Matt".

813
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,614
Matt.

814
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,282
- Juancho.
- That's enough.

815
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,783
He was next after me, right?

816
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,744
Bro, that's enough.

817
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,456
- That's enough.
- The nerve to talk to him in front of me!

818
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,250
- You're unbelievable.
- Juancho.

819
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,467
I never cheated on you.

820
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,057
Not with Matt.

821
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,645
- Not with anyone.
- Bullshit!

822
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:08,992
I lied.

823
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,508
To make you stop begging.

824
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:36,979
I'll go ahead.

825
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,981
- Zy, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

826
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,232
Thank you.

827
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,817
I'm so sorry.

828
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,235
‪Mm-hmm.

829
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,698
Ba, look at our signage for Laya.

830
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,036
Here. Have a drink first.

831
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:37,331
Help me finish this.
Just follow one stroke.

832
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,041
One stroke, okay?

833
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,584
Like this?

834
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,210
Ba, just one stroke.

835
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,630
- That's what I'm doing.
- Just one stroke.

836
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,131
Hey!

837
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,466
- You want to play around?
- I'm working!

838
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,925
- Here!
- Huh?

839
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,469
- Mm…
- Ba!

840
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,222
Ba!

841
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,404
Ba, I'm still short on money.

842
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,281
Didn't I tell you?

843
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,825
I found a new investor!

844
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:14,868
Who?

845
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,245
It's me!

846
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:21,083
I don't mind postponing
my scholarship in New York.

847
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,834
I'll invest in you, Ba.

848
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,836
I'll invest in us.

849
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,339
I know it will be worth it.

850
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,591
No matter what happens,

851
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,177
I will always be here.

852
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,555
Give me a smile, Ba.

853
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,683
- Smile!
- Thank you.

854
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,101
I love you lots.

855
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,270
Zy, I got a lot of complaints
from the other stalls.

856
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,064
They said Juancho doesn't clean up.

857
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,232
I'm so sorry.

858
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,566
I'll take care of it.

859
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,609
Make sure
this won't happen again.

860
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,945
Why can't you put
the clothes inside the basket?

861
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,947
- Why can't you do that?
- I'm doing it.

862
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,407
What else do you want?

863
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,618
- Give it to me!
- I'll do it!

864
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,745
- Give it to me!
- I do everything here anyway!

865
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,498
- I said I'll do it!
- I said give it to me!

866
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,668
You couldn't even do this simple thing?!

867
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,294
You're like a child!

868
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,423
Where are you going?

869
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,216
Away from you!

870
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,307
Zy!

871
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,684
Why aren't you picking up?

872
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,935
Juancho.

873
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,771
Please, stop.

874
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,064
That's enough.

875
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,316
Let's talk! Let's fix this, okay?

876
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,736
Please. I'm begging you.

877
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,487
Let's talk about this, Ba.

878
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,657
I'll apply for a visa again.

879
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,201
I'll follow you there!
I promised, didn't I?

880
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,913
I met someone new in New York.

881
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,834
What?

882
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,876
Zy! Zy, we need to talk.

883
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,171
Juancho, I'm not in the mood. Please.

884
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,088
Is it--

885
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,885
Is it true? What you said earlier?

886
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,011
That you didn't cheat on me?

887
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,847
Let's talk some other day.

888
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,058
Some other day? Zy, let's talk now!

889
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,560
If there was no one else,

890
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,687
why did you leave me? Tell me the truth!

891
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,273
- Zy, let's talk--
- Just leave, Juancho.

892
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,858
I don't want to talk!

893
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,568
No! We have to talk!

894
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,073
I told you earlier
that I wanted you to stop.

895
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,908
- Zy, I'm part of--
- Now, can you just stop?

896
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:01,451
Zy, I'm part of that relationship.

897
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,119
I deserve to know the truth!

898
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,664
What's the point
of talking about this now?

899
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,499
What's the point?

900
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,252
The point is you hurt me.

901
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,046
You fooled me and you're still fooling me!

902
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,466
For two years, you made me believe
that there was someone else.

903
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,720
Every night for two years,
I asked myself why.

904
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,558
Why did you replace me so fast?

905
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,394
Why did you just
throw me away like I'm trash?

906
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,939
Fuck! What does he have that I don't?

907
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,524
Is he more handsome?

908
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,317
Richer? Better?

909
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,319
Is he fucking better in bed?

910
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:42,742
Fuck.

911
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,500
I doubted myself for two years!

912
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,047
I was cursing you every day.

913
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,592
I wanted to hurt you.

914
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,303
I wanted to ruin your life.

915
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:03,889
And now,

916
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,308
you want me to believe
that all of it was a lie?

917
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,313
So, what's the truth? Huh?

918
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,318
Because I don't even know why I'm hurting!

919
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,658
I'm sorry, Juancho.

920
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,203
I'm sorry I made you feel that way.

921
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,371
Stop saying sorry.

922
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,415
Your apology is useless
if you won't tell the truth.

923
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:32,167
What's the truth? Why did you leave me?

924
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,711
After everything that I've done for you?

925
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,796
I even followed you in Manila,

926
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,964
- That was your decision!
- even though it was hard!

927
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,258
I put up a restaurant for you
so I could keep up--

928
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,385
- I was just helping you!
- Helping me?

929
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,721
Fuck! You call that helping?

930
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,182
When I was failing, you abandoned me!

931
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,828
Stop crying.

932
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,085
Zy, I just want to know the truth.

933
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,420
Zy, tell me.

934
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,634
Zy, what's so hard about
telling the truth?

935
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,344
Talk to me!

936
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,553
Tell me!

937
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,681
What's the truth?

938
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,058
- Tell me the truth!
- I got tired!

939
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:32,769
I got tired of carrying you!

940
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:36,022
I didn't want to drown with you.

941
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,609
Juancho, believe me I tried.

942
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,655
God knows I tried my best to help you.

943
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,324
But I could only do so much.

944
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,329
I didn't know how else to help you.

945
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,540
Because you didn't want to man up

946
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,917
and help yourself.

947
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:58,253
Yes, you did everything for me,

948
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:01,589
but I was willing to give up
everything for you too, Juancho!

949
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,009
I wasn't just your girlfriend.

950
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,386
I had to act like your mother.

951
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,304
I had to be the adult one
in the relationship

952
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,598
because you were acting like a child.

953
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,350
I endured that.

954
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,145
I endured that because we promised

955
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,480
that we were going
to build a life together.

956
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:22,235
But it was so hard to carry both of us.

957
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,864
I was the only one fighting.

958
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,035
I was starting to drown, too.

959
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,579
I was spent.

960
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,898
God, I hated loving you so much.

961
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,779
And I needed you to man up.

962
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,406
I needed my boyfriend.

963
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,575
I needed my partner back.

964
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,954
But that didn't happen.

965
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,792
You wanted to marry me,

966
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,877
but we were both miserable.

967
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,762
If you hated me, I hated myself, too.

968
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,642
If you were hurt, I was hurting, too.

969
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,855
You wanted to punish me,

970
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:44,109
I was punishing myself every day.

971
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,155
Why did I give up on the person I love?

972
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,283
Why did I let go?

973
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,330
Someone had to do it.

974
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,458
Someone had to end it.

975
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,547
And I know you couldn't do it.

976
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,010
You're right.

977
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,515
There are two of us in the relationship.

978
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,812
And the two of us will drown
together if no one ends it.

979
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,362
I'm sorry, Juancho.

980
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,823
I'm sorry.

981
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:34,868
I'm sorry I hurt you.

982
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,552
She didn't leave you
because she doesn't love you.

983
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,056
She was just hurt, too.

984
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,853
She suffered so much in your relationship.

985
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,488
Boss, what if

986
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:57,659
she told you the truth then?

987
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:00,537
Maybe you'd still be together now.

988
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,706
I don't think so.

989
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:06,834
They're done.

990
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,296
It is what it is.

991
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:14,801
But at least…

992
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,179
you two were able to talk it out.

993
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,348
Right?

994
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,643
And she apologized to you.

995
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,233
What about you, boss?

996
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,778
Have you apologized?

997
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,718
Thank you so much for all your help.

998
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,678
Just message me if you need anything else.

999
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,887
Thank you.

1000
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:24,746
Zy.

1001
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,586
I'm sorry.

1002
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,476
Do you need anything else
for your research?

1003
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,144
Maybe I can help.

1004
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,564
We're finalizing the details
for the investors' dinner.

1005
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,608
Will that help you finish your article?

1006
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,868
Everyone,

1007
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:06,663
before we start,

1008
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,248
I just want to apologize
about what happened last night.

1009
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,920
I won't blame the alcohol.
That was all me.

1010
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,923
It won't happen again.

1011
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:20,635
Oh?

1012
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,138
Why is Zy still here
after what happened last night?

1013
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:31,020
Juancho already apologized to me.

1014
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,898
And I need to finish my research.

1015
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,275
Zy, are you sure?

1016
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,277
Because I mean, if I were you--

1017
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,195
Aiah.

1018
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,364
I'm really sorry.

1019
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,574
From here on out,

1020
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,451
we'll remain professional.

1021
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,078
Promise.

1022
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,415
Okay. I forgive you.

1023
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,542
All right, everybody,
let's talk about the bar menu.

1024
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,086
We have tinuktok bites, celosia chips,

1025
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,337
and laing quesadilla.

1026
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,089
Okay. So, I guess we're good on the chows.

1027
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,006
What about the drinks?

1028
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,425
We have five signature drinks.

1029
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:03,594
Okay, perfect!
I already got a bartender for tomorrow.

1030
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,722
Jon, you're on cocktails.

1031
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,390
Epi, staff walkthrough.

1032
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:10,059
La, as usual, take care of the pantry.

1033
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,978
- Aiah.
- Yes?

1034
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,105
So far, so good.

1035
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,607
I'm meeting
the two other investors later today.

1036
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:19,402
The other one just arrived here in Naga.

1037
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,654
I need you to meet with him today.

1038
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,448
His name is Mr. JP.

1039
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,742
He's kinda quirky, but he's super rich.

1040
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,076
Exactly what we need.

1041
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,870
Yes, exactly.

1042
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:32,498
I need you to make sure to win him over.

1043
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,876
Because we need him
for the investors' dinner.

1044
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,754
- Okay?
- That's it. I got you.

1045
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:39,839
Stop it.

1046
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:41,549
Zy, do you want to join?

1047
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,050
I'm meeting an investor.

1048
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,553
I just need to answer this.

1049
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,638
I heard from your boss

1050
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,515
that you changed your article.

1051
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,558
Yes.

1052
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:53,436
I'm writing about Casa Rosa
and their expansion.

1053
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,645
I asked for an extension

1054
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,355
because I need more time to immerse.

1055
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,733
Zy, just follow your boss. Okay?

1056
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:00,526
He's not taking me seriously.

1057
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,778
What do you expect?

1058
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,489
You didn't follow his directive.

1059
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:05,782
Of course, you don't get it.

1060
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:06,866
You're a managing editor.

1061
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,659
You can do whatever you want to do,

1062
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:11,162
and you can tell other people what to do.

1063
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:15,333
Babe, don't ruin the trust
your editor is giving you.

1064
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:18,503
David will get mad at you for sure.

1065
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,962
Look, babe.

1066
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,714
I'm just concerned about you.

1067
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:22,924
That's all.

1068
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,133
I'm sorry.

1069
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,927
I'm gonna take some time off from work

1070
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,762
and go there to help you.

1071
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:28,763
Anyway, I have to go.

1072
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:29,931
I'm in between meetings.

1073
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,349
Bye.

1074
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,531
Are you okay?

1075
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:49,700
Yeah.

1076
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,743
What's he up to?

1077
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,870
Let's just do what he wants.

1078
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,621
You need an investor, right?

1079
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:46,591
Hi, Sir JP. I'm Juancho,

1080
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,259
Aiah's business partner.

1081
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:49,260
And this is Zy.

1082
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:50,469
My condolences, sir.

1083
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,435
This is Froi, my partner.

1084
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,648
You can give him a kiss.

1085
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,066
He'd like that.

1086
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,667
Froi loves this place.

1087
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,336
That's why

1088
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,547
this is his death wish.

1089
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,593
His wish is to…

1090
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:38,351
I'm sorry.

1091
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:43,940
Froi doesn't want me to cry
while letting him go.

1092
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:46,192
Can you please help me with that?

1093
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:53,115
Froi and I met in high school.

1094
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,159
He was my first boyfriend.

1095
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,372
But we broke up after graduation.

1096
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:05,002
Good thing the universe
brought us together again.

1097
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:09,882
We met at a concert, of all places.

1098
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,595
We were already working then.

1099
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:18,516
The universe gave us a second chance.

1100
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,728
Froi and I got back together.

1101
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:26,649
That was the happiest day of my life.

1102
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,068
But now…

1103
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:34,824
he's gone.

1104
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,618
I have to let him go.

1105
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:39,662
Again.

1106
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:42,748
Oh, no.

1107
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:47,128
I feel like crying.

1108
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,549
Oh my God. I think I'm gonna cry.

1109
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:53,926
Help.

1110
01:06:55,469 --> 01:06:57,013
Help me. I'm gonna cry.

1111
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,347
It's okay.

1112
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,307
Breaths.

1113
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,726
- Inhale.
- Good.

1114
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,478
Hold.

1115
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:05,855
Exhale.

1116
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,106
Nice one, Sir JP.

1117
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:08,983
I'm still sad.

1118
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,570
- It's okay.
- Sir, just relax.

1119
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,238
Here…

1120
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:16,323
- I'm gonna cry!
- Do the thing!

1121
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:17,491
What thing?

1122
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,452
Do the thing! Juancho, do the thing!

1123
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,120
That thing when you try to make me laugh.

1124
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,540
Look at him! Look! Come on.

1125
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,462
Juancho, bigger!

1126
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:30,713
With feelings!

1127
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,007
Smile!

1128
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,425
Look!

1129
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:37,887
Jump! Bigger dance!

1130
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,389
It's not freaking like that.
It's like this.

1131
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,433
- I'm doing it!
- Remember?

1132
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:47,271
The face!

1133
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,065
Juancho, come on.

1134
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,611
Juancho.

1135
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,157
Do it.

1136
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:00,201
Higher.

1137
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:37,113
It still works!

1138
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,287
You know,

1139
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,914
it's really good

1140
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:50,751
to surround yourself
with people who are in love.

1141
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,921
- We have a new dance step.
- That was good.

1142
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,924
- Did you see that?
- Hey.

1143
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,843
The two of you,

1144
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,137
promise me you'll stay in love!

1145
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:04,014
Sorry, sir. Actually…

1146
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:06,559
Yes, sir.

1147
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:10,771
We promise we'll stay in love.

1148
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:13,482
- Right, Juancho?
- Yes, sir.

1149
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,027
Love is all around, Froi.

1150
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,573
Even if you're gone,

1151
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,409
love lives on.

1152
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,289
Love lives on.

1153
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,550
Come on. Let's just finish this.

1154
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:41,969
Hey! Faster!

1155
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,095
Yes, sir!

1156
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,390
I know you're here, my love.

1157
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:49,435
This is your favorite view.

1158
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,190
I'm fulfilling your wish.

1159
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,859
Bye, Tweetney!

1160
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,485
You're free now!

1161
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,613
Bye!

1162
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:08,287
After everything that
Froi and I have been through,

1163
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:13,667
I realized that our love is like no other.

1164
01:10:13,751 --> 01:10:16,712
It's the kind of love that
you'll always be grateful for.

1165
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,297
Smile!

1166
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,799
And I'm grateful that
I experienced that love

1167
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,468
- once in my life.
- Smile!

1168
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,304
- One more!
- Okay!

1169
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,806
- I'm coming!
- One more.

1170
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,892
Oh!

1171
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,727
Smile!

1172
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,354
Stop it!

1173
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:36,482
Oh my! That's it.

1174
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,027
‪You're both crazy.

1175
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:42,571
‪Splash each other!

1176
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,449
That's it.

1177
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:48,577
Your love is the most--

1178
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:50,955
- It's too much.
- I agree.

1179
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,957
One sec.

1180
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:58,671
Your love is the best.

1181
01:10:58,754 --> 01:10:59,755
Tin…

1182
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,006
Here.

1183
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:04,093
- Your love, Tin… Please.
- Oh, my God.

1184
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:06,512
- Will you marry me?
- I really need to work.

1185
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,888
Okay, one more time.

1186
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,058
Tin, my baby,

1187
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,476
will you marry me?

1188
01:11:12,559 --> 01:11:15,729
Are you proposing or reciting a poem?

1189
01:11:17,856 --> 01:11:20,276
Relax, okay? Take your time.

1190
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,152
Look into her eyes

1191
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:26,991
and think about
all of your memories together.

1192
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:34,081
Of all the dishes that I've cooked

1193
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:36,792
and tasted,

1194
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,503
your lips,

1195
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,839
your embrace,

1196
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,175
your love is still the best.

1197
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:52,057
It wasn't always happy

1198
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:53,934
and easy.

1199
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,480
We hurt each other.

1200
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:05,446
But there's a reason why
we're still here together.

1201
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,700
No matter the pain

1202
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:13,579
and hardships,

1203
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,625
I will always choose to love you

1204
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:22,796
and be with you.

1205
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,555
Will you marry me?

1206
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,395
Wow!

1207
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,273
Boss! That was awesome!

1208
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,441
I will use that!

1209
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,318
- I actually thought of that.
- Yeah?

1210
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:47,029
Boss.

1211
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:50,115
I invited Tin
to the investors' dinner tomorrow.

1212
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,700
Is it okay if I propose after?

1213
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,744
As long as it's okay with Babi.

1214
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,872
- Of course.
- Yes!

1215
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,625
Boss, one last request.

1216
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:01,877
Please take the video.

1217
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,795
Can I borrow this?

1218
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,338
- Sure.
- Nice!

1219
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:08,008
Ma'am Zy,
will you help me with the bubbles?

1220
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,259
That's Tin's favorite.

1221
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:12,888
- For the vibe.
- Sure.

1222
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,432
- That's good.
- Babi, will Sir JP attend the dinner?

1223
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,017
Yes. He'll come.

1224
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:19,895
Yes! Oh my God!

1225
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:21,397
Thank you, Lord!

1226
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,315
- Oh my God! Thank you, Zy!
- Thank you.

1227
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,817
Oh my God. Perfect!

1228
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,194
Our guest list is complete!

1229
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:28,946
Oh my God! I could kiss you!

1230
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:29,863
I dare you.

1231
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,156
Just kidding!

1232
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,074
See you, guys.

1233
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,534
- See you!
- See ya!

1234
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:35,077
Thank you, Ma'am Zy.

1235
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,578
Thank you. Bye!

1236
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,543
It's our soft opening today.

1237
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,754
Ba, check the frame.

1238
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:47,506
You still have our old videos?

1239
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,343
What videos?

1240
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,053
Those are private.

1241
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,518
- Stop that.
- Wait. Next.

1242
01:14:00,727 --> 01:14:02,396
- Look at this.
- What?

1243
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,982
You were so clingy then.

1244
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,151
So, Ba…

1245
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,193
Yes?

1246
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,029
This will be your station.

1247
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:14,074
Okay. Where's yours?

1248
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,326
There.

1249
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,953
- What?
Yes.

1250
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,204
No.

1251
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,331
You should always be beside me.

1252
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:22,833
No, Ba.

1253
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:24,251
You have to focus.

1254
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,336
You have to make sure the food is good.

1255
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,172
Then, stay beside me.

1256
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:30,382
- Like this.
- Okay, fine.

1257
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,843
- We should always be this close.
You're so clingy.

1258
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:34,386
Okay, fine.

1259
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,180
1260
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,599
Oh my God.

1260
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,559
You're right. I was clingy.

1261
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,020
- Give me that.
- Wait!

1262
01:14:43,103 --> 01:14:44,980
- Enough.
- Wait! Hold on!

1263
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:54,198
Do you remember this?

1264
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,657
Yeah.

1265
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,911
It's our soft opening today.

1266
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:01,872
-

1267
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,249
Ba, check this out!

1268
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,045
Yoo-hoo!

1269
01:15:08,128 --> 01:15:10,464
Ba, check the sign.

1270
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,799
What if nobody buys?

1271
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:15,344
Of course, not.

1272
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,804
Our sign looks good.

1273
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,224
Our food is so good.

1274
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,184
And most of all,

1275
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:25,521
the chef is so good-looking.

1276
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:26,813
Ba, come on.

1277
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:29,191
Show me that smile.

1278
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:31,235
- Hello. Do you have bottled water?
Yes?

1279
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,028
We do. Are you buying?

1280
01:15:33,111 --> 01:15:35,280
- Yes. One bottle.
One?

1281
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,990
Miss, you're our first customer.

1282
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,116
- Really?
Yes!

1283
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,661
- Ba, our very first customer!
- Customer, customer!

1284
01:15:40,744 --> 01:15:42,204
1286
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:45,499
- Ba, go ahead.

1285
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:48,335
Here's your Bicol Express Burrito,

1286
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:51,004
and since you're our first customer,

1287
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,507
- you get a free kinalas nachos.
Wow!

1288
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,010
Ba, why so serious?

1289
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:00,722
Smile for me.

1290
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:05,227
Show me that smile.

1291
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,063
- Success.
Thank you.

1292
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:09,106
1295
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:10,691
More!

1293
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:14,987
1297
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,120
Wait, you're already here?

1294
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:49,289
- At the airport?
- Yup, I just left the airport.

1295
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,582
I'm on my way to the hotel already.

1296
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:51,625
Okay, babe.

1297
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:53,460
I'll see you at the hotel.

1298
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:54,586
Let's grab some lunch.

1299
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,671
Okay.

1300
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,090
Okay. See you, babe. I love you.

1301
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:02,928
Yeah.

1302
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,555
See you.

1303
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:06,473
Bye.

1304
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:21,988
Zy.

1305
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:34,960
I'm sorry…

1306
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:37,212
I have to go.

1307
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:05,240
Boss, is this Sir JP's seat?

1308
01:19:05,323 --> 01:19:08,410
Where should we seat
the last-minute guests?

1309
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:09,828
Boss?

1310
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:12,414
ZY, CAN WE TALK?

1311
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:15,625
Juancho, we have one more hour
before dinner service.

1312
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,461
I need you to focus, okay?

1313
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:18,587
You need to be on top of everything.

1314
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,505
We don't have room for mistakes tonight.

1315
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:25,051
La?

1316
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,239
Bro.

1317
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:47,240
The guests…

1318
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,241
The guests are almost here.

1319
01:19:48,325 --> 01:19:50,619
Let's do the staff walkthrough.

1320
01:19:50,702 --> 01:19:51,953
Bro!

1321
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:56,750
Juancho, listen to me.

1322
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,835
Just hear me out, okay?

1323
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,171
I've known you for so long.

1324
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:03,131
I know what you're planning to do.

1325
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,091
But please, not now.

1326
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:08,428
We're all depending on you-- Hey.

1327
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,182
Don't leave us, Chef.

1328
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:19,272
- I have to go.
- Juancho--

1329
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,192
‪Okay, sir.

1330
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,657
‪Okay.

1331
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:35,038
Okay.

1332
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:37,874
Yup. I think this is paid for.

1333
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:38,875
Zy, can we talk?

1334
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:42,921
Juancho, not now.

1335
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,589
Not now? We need to talk.

1336
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,216
Juancho, not now!

1337
01:20:46,299 --> 01:20:47,759
- Bro, wait.
- Zy…

1338
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:50,846
She doesn't want to talk to you.

1339
01:20:50,929 --> 01:20:51,930
So, please back off.

1340
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,266
Matt, I just need to talk to Zy. Zy--

1341
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,851
Bro, didn't you hear me?

1342
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:57,018
- Don't push me!
- What the hell!

1343
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:58,520
Juancho, enough!

1344
01:20:59,145 --> 01:21:00,105
Enough!

1345
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:02,148
Matt, let's go.

1346
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:04,025
Zy, please, I'm sorry.

1347
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:06,444
What happened last night,
it meant something to me.

1348
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:11,241
What happened last night?

1349
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,619
Zy,

1350
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,831
I know you feel the same way.

1351
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,126
What is he talking about?

1352
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,210
- Let's talk.
- Zy, please.

1353
01:21:22,294 --> 01:21:24,045
- Juancho--
- Talk to me!

1354
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:26,131
Let's face this.

1355
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,300
Let's fight for us!

1356
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:33,471
Zy, please say something.

1357
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:37,809
Please answer me.

1358
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,649
Did you cheat on me?

1359
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:57,537
- Zy.
- Matt.

1360
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:58,830
Zy!

1361
01:21:58,914 --> 01:21:59,748
Matt.

1362
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,419
Matt!

1363
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,631
Matt!

1364
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:14,304
Zy.

1365
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:17,223
Zy.

1366
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:23,021
Zy, please.

1367
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:26,191
Juancho, this is wrong.

1368
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:30,737
Zy, I still love you.

1369
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:36,076
And I know that you love me, too.

1370
01:22:40,914 --> 01:22:44,417
Juancho, my life is a mess right now.

1371
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,378
I'll help you fix it.

1372
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:48,672
What do you need?

1373
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:49,965
Do you need to go back to New York?

1374
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,508
I'll go with you.

1375
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:54,010
But if it's messy there,

1376
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:55,971
then maybe we can stay here?

1377
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:57,973
Wherever you want.

1378
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,391
In Manila?

1379
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:00,850
Here in Bicol?

1380
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,227
I'll find a way, Zy.

1381
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:07,023
You will give up everything for me?

1382
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,859
Zy, I'll do everything for us.

1383
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:15,865
I just want to build a life with you.

1384
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:32,716
‪

1385
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:38,763
Don't you want to be with me?

1386
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:46,855
Don't you love me anymore?

1387
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,735
I love you.

1388
01:23:57,323 --> 01:24:01,286
But that's not enough to fix my life.

1389
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:05,707
I tried fixing your life before.

1390
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,046
I know that you will do the same for me
because you love me.

1391
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:13,715
But you'll get tired.

1392
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,134
You'll be spent.

1393
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:22,640
You can't fix my life for me
and then you ruin yours.

1394
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,603
So, please.

1395
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:30,565
Juancho, you have to let me go.

1396
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:35,403
That's hard.

1397
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:43,036
I love you so much.

1398
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:48,666
I don't know how to let you go.

1399
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:05,785
Sir JP!

1400
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:10,582
The show is over, Juancho.

1401
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:12,584
You missed your biggest break.

1402
01:26:14,252 --> 01:26:15,253
I'm sorry, sir.

1403
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:17,547
No, I'm sorry.

1404
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:22,302
I don't know if I can invest
in a restaurant

1405
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,054
whose owner is not fully committed.

1406
01:26:32,812 --> 01:26:34,355
Boss, where were you?

1407
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,530
I wasn't able to propose to Tin.

1408
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:49,621
Let's go!

1409
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,290
‪Bro.

1410
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:55,627
Let's go!

1411
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:56,544
‪

1412
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,171
Is everything there?

1413
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,507
The investors
were all looking for you.

1414
01:27:03,134 --> 01:27:04,886
I'm sorry, Aiah.

1415
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:06,930
You should be sorry.

1416
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,934
Aiah, I'll fix this.

1417
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,018
No. Don't.

1418
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:17,106
You know how much
this investment means to me.

1419
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:20,401
But I came here and I stayed

1420
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,320
because I wanted to support you.

1421
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,032
Because we're partners, right?

1422
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,953
But you left me hanging, Juancho.

1423
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,959
You know what?

1424
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,003
Maybe you're not cut out for this.

1425
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,840
Because you're so fucking selfish.

1426
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:42,859
Matt.

1427
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:49,407
Matt, I'm really sorry.

1428
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,247
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1429
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:02,545
You don't deserve it.

1430
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:27,653
Juancho!

1431
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:30,156
Juancho!

1432
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:32,784
Get up!

1433
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:36,871
You need to open the restaurant.

1434
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:38,498
I'm sorry, Papa Jun. Sorry.

1435
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:41,542
I'll be quick.

1436
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,170
Thank you.

1437
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:04,649
Are you awake now?

1438
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:06,984
Yes.

1439
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:14,117
Your grandma used to scold me

1440
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:18,746
because she couldn't entrust
the restaurant to me.

1441
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:20,998
One night,

1442
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:23,292
your father came home

1443
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,379
with a young boy.

1444
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:28,589
He was two years old.

1445
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,176
He introduced you to us.

1446
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:36,055
And then he left you with us.

1447
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:40,935
Your Grandma Rosa and I took care of you.

1448
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:45,189
Not long after, your Grandma Rosa died,

1449
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,524
I was left alone.

1450
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:49,110
Your father left me, too.

1451
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:54,157
That's when I decided

1452
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:57,618
that I will dedicate my life to Casa Rosa

1453
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,455
together with you.

1454
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:11,174
I saw that you had a flair
for cooking growing up.

1455
01:31:11,757 --> 01:31:13,176
You're great.

1456
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:14,844
You're creative.

1457
01:31:14,927 --> 01:31:17,930
You create a lot of original dishes.

1458
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,766
You're happy in the kitchen.

1459
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,103
The thing is,

1460
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,980
you're too passionate.

1461
01:31:29,483 --> 01:31:31,485
When you love, it's intense.

1462
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:33,821
You really love Zy, don't you?

1463
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:35,114
You love her so much,

1464
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:37,617
even if you know she's not for you,

1465
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,328
you still run after her.

1466
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:49,503
Juancho,

1467
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,131
you don't want to be abandoned,

1468
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:53,758
but…

1469
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:59,722
you abandon yourself
to chase somebody else.

1470
01:32:03,893 --> 01:32:05,102
Sorry, Papa Jun.

1471
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,084
My son,

1472
01:32:30,002 --> 01:32:31,796
wake up.

1473
01:32:33,214 --> 01:32:34,590
You can get through this.

1474
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:43,784
- Why are we here?
- Let's go.

1475
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:46,162
You'll apologize and say,

1476
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:48,080
"Let's be professional."

1477
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:49,707
I've heard that before.

1478
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:53,544
Yes, La.

1479
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:56,297
I want to apologize to all of you.

1480
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:58,924
And yes,

1481
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,552
I will be professional from now on.

1482
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:04,347
But aside from that,

1483
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,766
since I was inspired by all of you,

1484
01:34:06,849 --> 01:34:10,061
I want to present the new
and improved menu of Casa Rosa.

1485
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:17,193
Here is "Cocido ala Padi".

1486
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:20,112
It's as sour as the face you make

1487
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,281
when I make stupid decisions.

1488
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:25,493
But despite my shortcomings,

1489
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:29,538
your love for me is as warm as the soup.

1490
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:31,665
He's just guilty.

1491
01:34:31,749 --> 01:34:32,958
This is for you, Lala.

1492
01:34:33,667 --> 01:34:37,254
"Coco Leafy Lala".

1493
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:40,424
You give strength
to all of us here in Casa Rosa.

1494
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:44,428
I'm touched.

1495
01:34:45,137 --> 01:34:46,680
And, of course,

1496
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:49,016
"Bicol Expressway to Babi's Heart".

1497
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:51,352
With the right amount of spiciness

1498
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,854
to kick me back to the right direction.

1499
01:34:54,438 --> 01:34:55,439
Aiah,

1500
01:34:56,065 --> 01:34:57,942
I want to be the best partner

1501
01:34:58,025 --> 01:34:59,276
that you deserve.

1502
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:05,241
The newest addition to the menu,

1503
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:06,826
"Jon's Fabulous Fritters".

1504
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:09,703
I'm sorry.

1505
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,248
I left you last night.

1506
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:16,544
Let's push through with your proposal.

1507
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:17,503
I'll help you.

1508
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:18,629
I got you.

1509
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,425
And lastly…

1510
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:24,427
He changed it.

1511
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:27,721
…the reason why Casa Rosa is successful,

1512
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,015
"Tinuktok Junior".

1513
01:35:33,185 --> 01:35:34,061
Papa Jun,

1514
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:35,771
thank you.

1515
01:35:37,857 --> 01:35:40,734
I don't know where I'll be without you.

1516
01:35:43,195 --> 01:35:44,822
Thank you for…

1517
01:35:46,782 --> 01:35:49,118
for being a father to me.

1518
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:53,664
And I'm sorry

1519
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:56,917
for all my shortcomings.

1520
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:04,550
Let's eat!

1521
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:09,138
I'm really sorry.

1522
01:36:09,221 --> 01:36:11,432
It's all good. We're good.

1523
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:13,851
- Time to eat.
- All good now.

1524
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:17,104
- Let's eat.
- Boss, how long did you rehearse that?

1525
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:19,690
Hey.

1526
01:36:19,773 --> 01:36:21,650
- Did you stay up all night?
- Let's eat, boss.

1527
01:36:31,702 --> 01:36:33,829
- La?
- Flowers.

1528
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:37,625
Balloons.

1529
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:40,544
‪-Balloons?
‪-Not sure.

1530
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:41,712
Jon!

1531
01:36:42,588 --> 01:36:43,714
Hey.

1532
01:36:43,797 --> 01:36:44,924
Relax.

1533
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,260
- Thanks, boss.
- Okay?

1534
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,804
Shit!

1535
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:52,181
The bubbles!

1536
01:36:52,264 --> 01:36:53,098
Okay.

1537
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:54,808
Never mind. I got this!

1538
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:02,274
Boss.

1539
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:30,344
Welcome back, 2022 Chili Queen!

1540
01:37:30,427 --> 01:37:31,262
Hey.

1541
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,847
Chili Queen!

1542
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:35,975
Enjoy!

1543
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:38,018
Papa Jun!

1544
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,398
You're so pretty!

1545
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:45,943
You're so pretty, Tin!

1546
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:51,282
- Here!
- It's the wind.

1547
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:02,293
- My Chili Queen.
- Ma'am Aiah!

1548
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:06,380
Tin, our journey was not easy.

1549
01:38:06,463 --> 01:38:10,134
We were apart
for most of our relationship,

1550
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:13,220
but we never gave up.

1551
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:17,266
You never gave up on me,

1552
01:38:17,349 --> 01:38:19,476
despite all my shortcomings.

1553
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:23,647
You are the right person for me.

1554
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:30,362
Of all the dishes
that I've cooked and tasted,

1555
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:33,073
your love

1556
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,284
is the most delicious.

1557
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:36,577
Really?

1558
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:38,078
Promise?

1559
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:40,080
- I promise!
- You swear?

1560
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,666
I'm not laing.

1561
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:45,085
But Tin,

1562
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:47,046
no matter how hard it is,

1563
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:51,133
I will always choose you.

1564
01:38:52,384 --> 01:38:53,344
And so…

1565
01:39:01,226 --> 01:39:02,311
Tin,

1566
01:39:04,688 --> 01:39:06,482
my baby.

1567
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:09,443
Will you be my casa?

1568
01:39:12,988 --> 01:39:14,281
- Of course.
- Really?

1569
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:16,575
Yes!

1570
01:39:22,748 --> 01:39:23,791
Does it fit?

1571
01:39:26,168 --> 01:39:27,836
It fits.

1572
01:39:32,383 --> 01:39:36,679
- Oh, you.
- My baby. I love you!

1573
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,807
Yes!

1574
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:47,690
Hey, come here, Jon!

1575
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:04,373
Where are you going now?

1576
01:40:05,457 --> 01:40:06,875
To the airport.

1577
01:40:07,626 --> 01:40:09,211
I need to go back to New York

1578
01:40:09,294 --> 01:40:12,339
to figure out what I really want to do.

1579
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,759
You'll figure it out.

1580
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,679
What about you?

1581
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:21,849
Me?

1582
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:24,643
I'll focus on the Manila branch.

1583
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:29,148
I'm rooting for you.

1584
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:34,570
Thank you for stopping by, Zy.

1585
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,450
Thank you for accepting me.

1586
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:33,378
Nope.

1587
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:37,090
‪Nope.

1588
01:41:41,553 --> 01:41:42,805
Thank you for the ride.

1589
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:45,724
I hope you miss your flight.

1590
01:41:54,775 --> 01:41:56,360
Lei, I'm already here at the airport.

1591
01:41:56,443 --> 01:41:57,361
See you inside.

1592
01:41:57,444 --> 01:41:59,279
See you, sis.

1593
01:42:06,036 --> 01:42:07,079
So,

1594
01:42:08,413 --> 01:42:09,581
are you sure you didn't leave anything?

1595
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:12,417
I'm sure.

1596
01:42:16,588 --> 01:42:17,881
Thank you for the ride.

1597
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:25,013
Your hair's a little messy.

1598
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:26,557
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

1599
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:33,438
Go ahead.

1600
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:35,858
You might miss your flight.

1601
01:42:59,506 --> 01:43:00,591
Zy!

1602
01:43:06,805 --> 01:43:07,723
What?

1603
01:43:08,473 --> 01:43:10,183
Nice meeting you!

1604
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:13,687
You too!

1605
01:44:22,422 --> 01:44:23,465
Zy!

1606
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,718
Zy!

1607
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:38,438
I'll follow you in Manila!

1608
01:44:39,481 --> 01:44:40,399
What?

1609
01:44:40,482 --> 01:44:41,692
I'll go to Manila!

1610
01:44:43,568 --> 01:44:45,237
It's your choice.

1611
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:49,533
Bye.

1612
01:45:10,053 --> 01:45:11,054
Zy!

1613
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:16,309
Juancho.

1614
01:45:37,873 --> 01:45:39,207
I'm happy for you.

1615
01:47:47,836 --> 01:47:51,840
