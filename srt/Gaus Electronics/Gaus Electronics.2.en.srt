00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,730
Hae Young called you because she has a favor to ask.

166
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,900
W-What is it? Is your laptop not working again?

167
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,170
If you say it like that,

168
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,640
it makes me sound like I only call you to get something fixed.

169
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,410
T-Then?

170
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,490
Please fix my tablet.

171
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,820
Hae Young will buy you a beer later.

172
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,500
Beer? H-Hae Young bring everything you need to get fixed.

173
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,620
I'm really going to kill him...

174
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,780
Shit!

175
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,740
She didn't even make it home last night.

176
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,320
When I woke up, I was in the office restroom.

177
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,290
Again? You were really fine last night, though.

178
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,600
It doesn't really show when I get drunk...

179
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,710
Is it blood?

180
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,700
What is it? Did you get hurt?

181
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,900
No, it's red pepper paste...

182
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,300
Gosh, really...

183
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,060
I guess I did drink a lot last night.

184
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,340
I can't really remember what happened.

185
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,890
You can't remember anything?

186
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,190
There's one thing I do remember.

187
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,410
Oh, my. What in the world!

188
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,660
So did you kiss or not? Hurry and spill it.

189
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:12,110
I did like him a lot, but it also feels like it was a dream.

190
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,580
It was too vivid to be a dream, though.

191
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,280
So I can't really tell clearly.

192
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,130
Seriously...

193
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:23,110
I can clearly tell you need to wash your hair, Kang Mi.

[Marketing Team 3]

195
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,710
This is what an ordinary new employee's seat looks like.

196
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,430
It's shabbier than I expected.

197
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,960
My father would tell me to come right back if he saw me like this.

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,280
Get it together, Baek Ma Tan.

199
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,750
I'll have to endure this much inconvenience countlessly from now on.

200
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,860
You are?

201
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,070
Well, I'm the owner of this seat.

202
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,460
Who might you be?

203
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,240
Nice to meet you. I'm Baek Ma Tan.

204
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,130
I see, the new employee.

205
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,580
I'm Executive Manager Wi Jang Byeong.

206
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,800
I didn't know that an executive manager would use a humble chair like this.

- This chair is even used by Fake—
- Where is my room?

00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,840
It's very micro.

Shall we greet the team members?

210
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,070
I'm Baek Ma Tan. I'll be working with you all starting today.

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,450
I won't make it long.

212
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,290
I'll try trusting...

the abilities that you have... with all my heart.

That's all.

215
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,070
Why did it make me clap?

216
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,850
I feel possessed...

217
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,310
I flinched without even knowing...

Let's wrap up his introduction here and please introduce yourselves in turn now.

I familiarized myself with your names in advance.

Well, my name is Cha Wa Wa.

You look just like your picture, Ms. Cha Na Rae.

225
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,320
What the? Where exactly do I look like him?

226
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,640
I'm the Cha Na Rae here.

227
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,360
The new employee doesn't have a fresh memory, I see.

228
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,660
I think it'd be faster for our Mr. Sang Sik to introduce everyone.

229
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,240
Y-Yes, s-sure thing.

230
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,530
I'll do that, okay.

Ms. Kang Mi?

238
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,200
Kang Mi went to the restroom.

- I see...
- There she comes.

240
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,550
Kang Mi!

241

I guess it wasn't a dream...

00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,630
Ms. Kang Mi, what's wrong?

246
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:28,370
Well, it's the trend nowadays to grow out your bangs.

Nice to meet you.

Shit, you're totally crazy, huh?

254
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,470
Why would you hide, though?

255
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,520
I'm not sure if it was a dream or not...

256
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,650
Okay.

257
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,540
I do have an idea.

258
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,130
Take a seat here.

Look here...

This is the house that I chartered to be together with you.

Chartered?

265
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,980
He got a charter...

266
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,030
My current house is a monthly...

267
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,390
They already got a house?

They're going to wed by tomorrow, Unni.

269
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,100
Why did you wake her up already, Unni?

270
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,550
I kind of couldn't stand it.

271
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,820
Sorry.

272
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,280
How is it? Do you have the courage to talk to him now?

273
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,210
I think it became more embarrassing.

Should we just skip the honorifics?

You've been skipping it since a while ago.

by looking at them up close like this.

Ms. Kang Mi, you can't tell like that.

311

You've got to shine a light on it like this.

It's fresher if the stem is thicker...

327
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,950
The savory and greasy flavor...

328
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,840
coats the tip of my tongue and

329
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,640
a strange spiciness...

330
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,380
splendidly embraces the insides of my mouth...

331
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,970
A taste like this... is a first.

332
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,390
What's wrong, Ma Tan?

333
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,530
As if you've never had gopchang...

334
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,810
Gopchang?

335
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,070
Is it called gopchang because it tastes better as you chew?
(Gop-sseep-da means to chew well)

336
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,190
Is that the reason?

337
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,420
The naming is brilliant.

338
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,510
Looking for a tidy male between 25-35 years old.

339
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,480
Welcoming a person without peculiar sleeping habits.

340
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,550
The rent is 250,000 won for using the loft.

341
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,060
[Hello. Will take the deal for 250,000 won. Want to go see the house.]

342
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,480
Hi, Matthew.

343
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,770
Are you a foreigner?

344
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,560
[Yes, but my Korean is also great. Can I go see it today?]

345
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,870
I'm looking for a roommate to cover my loan interests

346
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,880
but would a foreigner roommate be okay?

347
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,970
It's okay.

348
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,370
I guess I can practice my English while living with him, so it'd be okay.

349
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,930
What's our afternoon schedule?

350
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,610
Mandatory training for a new employee.

351
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,840
The first training is... how to use the copy machine.

352
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,570
Your senior here will teach you step-by-step.

353
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,110
Place the document you're trying... to copy,

354
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,710
check if there's paper in the tray,

355
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,960
click the start button, and it's done.

356
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,940
- Easy, right?
- Splendid.

357
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,410
Then could you also make ten copies of this?

358
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,530
- It can also copy double-sided.
- Sure.

359
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,400
Should I staple the papers?

360
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,250
Sure.

361
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
- Stapled, right?
- You do a neat job.

362
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,250
It's nothing really...

363
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,410
Next is how to make coffee.

364
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,150
This is the recipe catered to the General Manager's taste.

365
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,060
Have a sip.

366
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,140
What coffee is this?

367
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,590
I-It's a coffee m-mix.

368
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,330
The amount of water is important, so make sure you remember that.

369
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,450
A coffee mix?

370
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,330
Also, try dipping the cookie in there.

371
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,830
Just this much, right?

372
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,900
Its pairing with the cookie is splendid.

373
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,020
Is that why they named it a coffee mix?

374
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,510
Is that the reason? A mix means it's mixed.

375
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,000
That must really be the reason!

376
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,450
Thank you.

377
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,390
Wait, that one's...

378
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,920
You must've been thirsty, Ma Tan. Should've told me sooner.

379
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,420
Enjoy it, then.

380
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,140
A coffee mix...

381
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,260
Just looking at his aura and attitude makes him look like an executive, no?

382
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,850
Hey, mix double.

383
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,000
Hey, do you... drink all right?

384
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,130
Let's drink and die!

385
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,660
The "spin, spin, and spin" time has come back!

386
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,600
You start, Na Rae.

387
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,460
Okay, I'll start.

388
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,580
Gaus Electronics, I love you!

389
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,200
One for the promotion of our General Manager Ki!

390
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,230
Cheers!

391
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,960
This is the spinning glass that is never missed out in Korea's company dinner culture.

392
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,630
It's a culture that is unbearable for a neat person like me.

393
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,840
Your Highness...

394
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,010
Hey, shouldn't we do it with this big glass for the new employee?

395
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,660
However, if refusing is...

396
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,650
- forbidden in this situation...
- Baek Ma Tan! Baek Ma Tan!

397
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,360
Ma Tan, drink up!

398
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,680
That's why... I brought it.

399
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
Spin it...

400
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,720
Hey, what are you doing?

401
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,930
Did you not see how General Manager was drinking earlier?

402
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,390
I'm really at a loss for words here.

403
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,360
Please try once.

404
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,440
It's silver, huh?

405
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,480
Hey, I knew that you were a good guy!

406
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,060
Stop it before I break that straw in half...

407
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,370
Ms. Kang Mi, why are you like that ever since?

408
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,730
This is... testing the product.

409
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,530
Who doesn't know that you're testing the product here?

410
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,270
The question is, why are you wearing it at a company dinner?

411
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,560
Hurry and take it off!

412
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,610
Take it off! Take it off!

413
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,530
- Take it off!
- Gosh, General Manager!

414
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,800
How long are we going to spin this? Let's have another shot.

415
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,560
Okay, another shot!

416
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,590
Drink, drink!

417
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,770
Cheers!

418
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,020
General Manager, is the food okay?

419
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,500
- Should we order more?
- Yes, something with soup.

420
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,400
With soup?

421
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,470
Ms. Kang Mi.

422
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,290
- N-No, it's okay.
- I know what's good here.

423
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,940
- General Manager, the soup here...
- No, w-wait.

424
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,910
- I know what's good...
- I-I'm not done lookin—

425
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,080
Stop!

426
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,870
Fishcake soup! The fishcake soup is...

427
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,870
Okay, okay.

428
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,550
Jeju island is famous for horses.

429
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,900
Hanyang for people, and for fishcakes...

430
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,730
Busan!

431
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,270
One Busan fishcake soup, please!

432
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,180
Will you keep pretending you don't know, Ms. Kang Mi?

433
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,730
- Sorry?
- I've been waiting to talk to you.

434
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,560
- Do you know... how much I missed you after last nigh—
- Outside.

435
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,810
Shall we... talk about this outside?

436
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,170
That would be nice.

437
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,360
Ma Tan, w-where are you...

438
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,620
Youth is great, huh? Was anyone not young at one point?

439
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,660
Hey, let's drink.

440
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,990
It's a foolish youth...

441
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,160
A workplace couple, huh?

442
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,880
Where did you meet your wife, Senior?

443
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,620
At work.

444
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,440
That's right...

445
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,110
Is it going well for you with the junior at the public relations team, Sang Sik?

446
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,700
Well, she said let's have some beer sometime...

447
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,000
- Seriously?
- Whoa.

448
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,390
You're dead if it's not true.

449
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,370
Don't have false expectations.

450
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,010
There are already plenty of rumors of her having a lover.

451
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,430
I just might be that guy of the rumors.

452
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,420
Hey, get out of here! You're so funny.

453
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,490
You're so amazing, Senior Na Ra.

454
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,500
How can a person be this mean?

455
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,800
Really?

456
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,860
Thank you so much. You know I don't have the time to be nice because of somebody.

457
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,860
Not even a split second.

458
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,840
Somebody? It's not because of somebody, but...

459
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,990
it's just yourself to blame. Have you thought that?

460
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,220
Nope. It's because of somebody...

461
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,360
No. Somebody.

462
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,330
I really can't understand why you're like that...

463
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,140
I think you've been like this since the beginning of time...

464
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,140
My, the bee honey drink is so good.

465
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,940
Hey, let's have a bomb shot made by Sang Sik.

466
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,780
Sounds great!

467
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,670
General Manager, I'll brew some bomb drinks Sang Sik style.

468
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,910
Yes, a bomb!

469
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,400
Here we go!

470
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,750
Sang Sik style bomb drink...

471
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,190
- Do you want it?
- I do!

472
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,360
Do you want it?

473
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,440
Let's destroy it!

474
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,180
Sang Sik style bomb drink, delivered to your mouth.

475
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,360
Great.

476
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,860
How is it, General Manager?

477
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,390
- It's really goo—
- Should I give you one more or not?

478
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,600
One more or no—

479
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,970
Dae Sik, play "Music that calms nasty temper" right now.

480
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,810
Hurry, right now.

481
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,900
Dae Sik, turn it off.

482
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,170
Senior... why were you there?

483
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,710
Did you recognize me from the beginning?

484
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,140
Yes.

485
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,410
I remember everything from last night's event.

486
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,740
I'm sorry, but...

487
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,040
I actually don't remember...

488
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,550
I knew you would say that.

489
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:50,580
It's a letter about my feelings regarding yesterday's event.

490
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,320
I'd appreciate it if you'd read it thoroughly.

491
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,170
I'll read it on my way home.

492
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,500
I can give you the reply tomorrow, right?

493
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,350
Sure, although it'd be better if you could reply sooner.

494
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,580
Okay.

495
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,500
[Last night]

496
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,510
Yes, Ma'am.

497
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,800
Young Boss is currently experiencing a tent bar, the last course of the ordinary person's experience.

498
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,290
He's having seasoned whelk as the main dish.

499
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,360
Yes, I'll pay extra attention to hygiene.

500
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,800
Chef, all of the food tastes great.

501
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,510
Would there be a special recipe?

502
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,480
I used tons and tons of MSG and seasoning.

503
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,330
MSG and seasoning.

504
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,390
Ma'am!

505
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,540
Please give me chicken gizzards.

506
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,790
I'm sorry, Miss. We're not open for today.

507
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,180
But it's open, though.

508
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,620
Please move out.

509
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,960
Did he charter the entire place?

510
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,080
Yes, I did charter the place.

511
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,930
You're a rich person! I live on a month-to-month.

512
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,520
Let's share it just for today, okay?

513
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,400
Please mov—

514
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,680
Ma'am, please give me a lot of chicken gizzards and soju, too!

515
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,920
- Second round!
- Careful, careful!

516
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,740
Second, second round!

517
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,030
Second round!

518
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,700
- My bag...
- I got his bag!

519
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,810
We've got to go for a second round!

520
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,630
- Second round!
- Let's go.

521
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,030
Please get home safe.

522
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,910
Senior.

523
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,450
Don't follow me.

524
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,730
I'm not following you. My home is also this way...

525
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,640
Why, you!

526
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,560
Now then. I'll be waiting for your call.

527
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,990
I'll be waiting for your call. I'll be waiting for your call.

528
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,360
Okay.

529
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,540
[Hae Young]

530
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,620
Hae Young is not replying again...

531
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,370
Who is it?

532
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,450
Mr. Sang Sik! Mr. Sang Sik!

533
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,710
Mr. Sang Sik!

534
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,470
Let me hide here for a second.

535
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,370
What's wrong? Did something happen?

536
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,400
At my house, there's something in there...

537
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,930
W-What's t-there?

538
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,390
What's there? Tell me about it.

539
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,370
At my house...

540
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,930
there's something, I said...

541
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,420
- Gosh!
- W-Whoa!

542
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,410
Senior, we should call the police first.

543
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,430
The police?

544
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,580
God, I think the thief already turned your place inside out.

545
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,390
The thief?

546
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,160
Whoa! He really did turn your house into a mess!

547
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,290
Senior, you're lucky you didn't get hurt at this point.

548
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,260
I'll hurry and call the police.

549
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,120
Wait.

550
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,780
Why? We need to catch the thief.

551
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:35,710
What I was trying to catch... was a s-spider.

552
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,820
S-Spider?

553
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,510
Th-Then th-this is...

554
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,500
This is just stuff I couldn't clean up yet.

555
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,010
Senior, it's been more than a week since you moved in.

556
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,300
- I had no time to clean up because I was busy.
- But you left work on the dot every day.

557
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,280
I had work to do even after I left!

558
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,580
The spider! The spider!

559
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,010
Spider! Spider!

560
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,950
Spider...

561
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,580
Senior, this... it's dust! It's just dust.

562
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,070
How does something like this form in a house...

563
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,350
They're so terrifying.

564
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,960
I think this is more terrifying...

565
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,780
Senior, should I help you clean this up?

566
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,120
Forget it! I can clean it up, so...

567
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,420
Line. I told you not to cross the line!

568
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,170
You just cut the line earlier.

569
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,240
Whatever, whatever, whatever. Just leave now.

570
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,330
- A-All right—
- Go.

571
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,640
You suck at organizing documents,

572
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,500
but you're pretty good at organizing a house.

573
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,780
Senior, you need to open the window often to ventilate.

574
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,590
And you should pack the things you don't need and store them in the loft.

575
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,120
Okay.

576
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,360
Hey, since you're here,

577
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,170
- can you help me—
- Oppa, do you want to drink beer tonight?

578
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,860
My friend flaked on me.

579
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,740
No, Senior.

580
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,270
Please don't cross the line.

581
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,050
Deal! I'll be right there.

582
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,360
It's not much.

583
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,110
It's not- J-Just a few!

584
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,230
No, no. Senior, there's an urgent matter I need to attend to,

585
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,200
- so I'll leave now.
- Just a few things.

586
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,570
Oh, when do we sort the trash?

587
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,710
Is there a group chat for the apartment residents?

588
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,830
How do you clean the toilet? How much do maintenance fees add up?

589
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,770
S-Senior! P-Please, please don't cross the line.

590
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,070
Is there a good mart around here?

591
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,900
It's not central heating, right?

592
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,930
I was going to ask him how the noise control is...

593
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:33,200
Th-There's no spider...

594
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,820
No s-spider, right?

595
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,120
There's no spider.

596
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,990
So the meeting was today.

597
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,870
M-Matthew! Sorry.

598
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:47,750
Hurry up, please.

599
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,650
My name is Sang Sik and...

600
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,350
It's a stereotype to think you need to speak English to a foreigner.

601
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,370
You're really good at speaking Korean, Matthew.

602
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,860
Is M-Matthew your given name?

603
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,170
Why? Do I not look like a Matthew to you?

604
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,390
- That's also a stereotype.
- Oh, I-I'm sorry.

605
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,000
I just thought it'd be something like Sujal or Aziz...

606
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,510
- I'm sorry.
- My name is Aziz.

607
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,590
Huh?

608
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,940
Well, how's the house? Matt—

609
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,640
Matthew, no. Aziz! It's even near your school.

610
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,840
It's not bad.

611
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,690
- It's nice.
- It's pretty soundproof, too.

612
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,180
And the neighbors are all quiet.

613
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,310
Aziz is fine as long as it's quiet.

614
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,660
Then this place is—

615
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,650
What's wrong with her?

616
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,170
- Sang Sik,
- What?

617
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,500
it's a spider for real this time.

618
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,690
It's the size of my fist.

619
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,110
The size of my fist!

620
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,710
She recently moved in next door.

621
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,250
Aziz doesn't like a noisy woman like her.

622
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,510
I don't like her, either. I need to leave. I'm going nuts!

623
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,330
Sang Sik!

624
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,870
Sang Sik,

625
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,310
if you take off 50,000 won, Aziz will resolve this for you.

626
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,380
Really? H-How?

627
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,340
Wait right there.

628
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,960
Hey, A-Aziz, Aziz!

629
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,940
What the?

630
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,190
Who are you?

631
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,600
Where is Sang Sik?

632
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,230
I'm Aziz. He moved.

633
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,470
- He moved—
- Bye.

634
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,840
What are you talking about? I saw him just a while earlier.

635
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,540
Hey.

636
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,510
Hold on.

637
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,680
H-Hold on. I have a favor to ask.

638
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,000
Spider...

639
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,540
Can you please catch a spider for me just this once?

640
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,200
- No, I can't. Bye.
- Hey!

641
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,630
I'm just really, really, really scared of spiders.

642
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,070
Aziz is even more scared of spiders.

643
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,690
- No.
- Bye. Your hand will get caught. Move it!

644
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,910
- Hold on.
- Your hands could get cut off!

645
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,430
- Hold on!
- I'm going to shut it!

646
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,900
- A spider, spider, spider!
- Whoa!

647
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,770
Aziz, thank you so much!

648
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,080
It's going to be quiet for a while, thanks to you.

649
