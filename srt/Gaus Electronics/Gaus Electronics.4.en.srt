I submitted my application a while ago,

174
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,510
but it's quite hard to be admitted.

175

It's a system where only people who meet the standards can sign up.

What's the standard for hair loss?

202
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,910
Also, i-isn't it also... wrong to judge a person by looks?

That's why I came here.

You didn't have to say it in so much detail.

Instead, could you deduct this assistance from the debt, case by case...

242
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,110
I think it'd be better not to get the debt involved in this.

00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,170
It's too verbose. It's too much!

485
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,340
Why do you have your bag on? You want to go home?

486
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,010
Don't make me laugh. Do it again!

487
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,650
There's no point. I don't get what you're trying to say!

488
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,390
Yes, Honey.

489
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,230
I think we have to cancel the restaurant reservation today...

490
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,570
What?

491
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,490
What do you mean you're going to cancel our marriage?

492
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,050
Honey!

493
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,060
I'm going crazy, seriously.

494
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,610
What the hell does he want us to change, and how?

495
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,060
Okay, let me see.

496
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,860
I'll resolve it.

497
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,020
Where is the initial file?

498
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,520
Send it to my email.

[Gaus Hair Loss Manager Business Proposal]

500
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,390
Nice!

501
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,900
Beautiful!

502
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,780
How pretty is it when you do it like this?

503
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,110
See? Even you guys can do it when you focus.

504
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,500
You may go home now.

505
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,360
Thank you, General Manager.

506
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,810
- I'm going now.
- Please take care.

507
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,810
How?

508
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,100
How did you do it?

509
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,800
How did you do it in just a few minutes?

510
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,930
I just changed the font on the first file.

511
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:05,030
General Manager Gi just didn't like the Godic font.

512
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,030
- What?
- Does that make sense?

513
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,260
Whoa... In the end...

514
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,440
it was the looks...

515
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,040
- Good job today!
- Cheers!

516
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,940
Hey, it's burning.

517
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,910
Careful now.

518
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,380
Does it taste good?

519
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,770
- Hurry and eat.
- But, Kang Mi...

520
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,700
who is that gentleman?

521
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,580
I'm sorry... I've committed a sin...

522
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,900
- A sin?
- Don't mind me and

523
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,210
- please enjoy.
- Would you like some pork skin?

524
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,300
I'm fine.

525
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,190
The pig feet didn't come yet?

526
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,830
Yes, only the fried chicken came.

527
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,240
This is one good thing about living next to someone I know.

528
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,010
I was craving some chicken just now.

529
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,180
That's true. We can save up on the delivery fee.

530
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,700
By the way, I heard it from Aziz.

531
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,990
The one who we were calling polyamory and all was...

532
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,890
about Ms. Hae Young, right?

533
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,510
Aziz, I told you not to tell her.

534
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,020
I also don't like to share a house.

535
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,570
I looked into it. Thinking it was a detached house,

536
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,020
but it was a share house. So how can I not tell?

537
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,890
Talk some sense into him, Na Rae. So that he'll pull it together.

538
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,900
I hear plenty from her at work.

539
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,100
Whatever. A man in love is deaf to anything. He needs to experience it himself.

540
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,300
Right, Aziz?

541
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,900
But make this one thing clear.

542
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,610
Mr. Sang Sik, you're...

543
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,310
what should I say?

544
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,560
You're like that pickled radish for the chicken.

545
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,540
Pickled radish?

546
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,130
Are you saying that I'm refreshing?

547
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,390
Not at all.

548
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,020
You know, you never finish it every time you order chicken,

549
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,130
but it's a waste to throw it out, so it piles up in your fridge.

550
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,310
But do you eat it later? No, you eventually throw it out.

551
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,060
In that sense, you're like the pickled radish.

552
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,970
It's not like that.

553
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,030
Hae Young also seemed to have thought a lot, but

554
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,520
she said that because she couldn't let me go in the end.

555
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,050
That's seriously your own bias, man.

556
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,390
Is anyone else coming?

557
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,590
Why are there four plates?

558
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,860
Hae Young will be coming, too.

559
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,600
- What?
- Hae Young will be—

560
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,760
Is the pig feet here?

561
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,220
I came just in time.

562
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,410
We can have the coffee that Hae Young brought after eating pig feet.

563
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,680
Right?

564
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,430
But I didn't know Na Rae was here, so I only bought three.

565
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,270
What do we do?

566
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,960
I'm going to leave after eating a little bit, so don't mind me.

567
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,980
I absolutely decline getting stuck in between you two.

568
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,810
Let's do that, then.

569
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,030
Oppa, you also don't throw out the pickled radish?

570
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,900
Hae Young also throws it out after it expires.

571
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,270
Really?

572
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,410
Hae Young isn't intruding on a good time between neighbors, right?

573
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,790
Brother Roommate, are you uncomfortable?

574
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,280
I'm uncomfortable.

575
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,560
You already skipped the honorifics when we barely met for a few minutes.

576
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,210
Especially in...

577
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,800
the country of courteous people in the East, seriously.

578
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,410
Aziz!

579
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,430
Oppa, you can't eat pork because of your religion, right?

580
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,880
Oppa,

581
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,010
have some of this, at least.

582
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,360
That's a stereotype!

583
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,740
Aziz is Christian.

584
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,080
Aziz was just looking for the meaty piece with no fat.

585
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,650
Right here, lucky.

586
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,270
This one's too big.

587
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,920
Oppa, do you want to share this with Hae Young?

588
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,430
Share?

589
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,620
No, no.

590
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,020
I d-don't like sharing.

591
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,650
I'll just eat all of it myself.

592
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,520
I just stopped by for a bit while passing.

593
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,530
I only fed on your food shamelessly.

594
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,470
You three can have the coffee that Hae Young brought.

595
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,480
No thanks.

596
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,570
We're going to drink beer after Hae Young leaves.

597
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,610
Drink with Hae Young next time, Brother Roommate.

598
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,010
When Aziz moves elsewhere, come then.

599
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:15,570
Aziz doesn't really like sharing my space with other people.

600
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,740
You must not like Hae Young, Brother Roommate.

601
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,250
Is he just dry as a person?

602
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,820
How can he be like that?

603
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,580
Aziz doesn't like a person who refers to themselves in the third person.

604
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,610
Hae Young, too!

605
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,580
What Hae Young's using right now is the third person.

606
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,770
Hae Young is?

607
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,000
What you're using is the third person, Oppa!

608
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,100
Aziz is?

609
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,460
Aziz doesn't use the third person.

610
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,940
Hae Young also never uses it.

611
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,360
Aziz is totally frustrated.

612
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,080
Hae Young is more frustrated.

613
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,050
The time is...

614
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,940
Mr. Ma Tan, I'm really sorry.

615
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,780
You must also be tired,

616
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,450
so go on now and rest.

617
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,020
I'm worried that you might

618
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,700
make a mistake since you drank as well.

619
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,470
I'm really not drunk at all.

620
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,350
You said that you seek out chicken gizzards when you're drunk,

621
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,820
and you just ate two plates of chicken gizzards.

622
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,730
Geez, I'll go straight home.

623
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,190
My house is right over here and

624
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,880
I don't have anyone more to meet and talk to.

625
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,610
All right then.

626
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,630
- Bye.
- Okay.

627
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,940
Please take care now.

628
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,570
Thank you for your work, Young Boss. Where shall I take you?

629
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,680
- Let's head home.
- Okay.

630
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,470
Excuse me! Excuse me!

631
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,380
Hello, by the way, do you know who the heir to Power Group is?

632
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,600
I know who it is, so should I tell you just the last name?

633
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,180
His last name is Baek.

634
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,070
I know who the heir to Power Group is.

635
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,120
You see, his name is a secret.

636
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,020
Wait, wait!

637
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,690
I can't tell you about it!

638
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,440
Because it's a secret!

639
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,020
- The heir to Power Group...
- She is also pretty drunk.

640
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,060
It looks dangerous.

641
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,950
Should I take some measures?

642
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,770
Secretary Kim.

643
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,480
You don't have a poison dart by any chance, right?

644
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,720
Would a poison dart work on her?

645
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,730
Jesus Christ!

646
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,370
My goodness!

647
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,580
It's a joke.

648
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,260
A joke.

649
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:31,260
Hae Young, by the way, I gave it a lot of thought. Right?

650
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,780
I read it in a book a long time ago that a mouse species called the montane vole

651
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,400
goes to another female right after they're done having intercourse with another female.

652
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,480
Sorry?

653
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,950
But the prairie vole, whose

654
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,920
DNA matches 99 percent with the montane vole,

655
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,410
loves only one female for their entire lives.

656
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,630
Do you know what their difference is?

657
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,010
It's a hormone.

658
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,360
It's because the prairie vole has more love hormone

659
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,660
and jealousy hormone receptors than other voles.

660
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,030
What a pity.

661
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,350
Then it has to live with only one mouse forever.

662
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,350
But, Hae Young,

663
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,070
I'm that pitiful prairie vole.

664
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:30,720
An ordinary man who has a lot of love and jealousy.

665
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:36,430
After hearing your story, I imagined us dating. Right?

666
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:41,640
Eating with all of your boyfriends,

667
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,150
going to the café together,

668
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,340
and even marrying to...

669
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,410
live in one house altogether...

670
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,840
but I couldn't do it.

671
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,560
- Oppa.
- Hae Young, I...

672
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,350
want to be in a relationship where I can focus on each other, with just the two of us.

673
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,450
I'm really sorry for rejecting your offer.

674
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,090
However, it's just a difference in our hormones,

675
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,400
so please understand, Hae Young.

676
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,040
I didn't want to hurt you...

677
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,360
I hope that you won't suffer because of me.

678
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,420
- Sang Sik.
- Hae Young, don't do it.

679
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,560
Oppa.

680
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,160
Hae Young cares about a man's looks.

681
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,330
- Sorry?
- Polyamory just doesn't fall for any man.

682
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,120
I know that you're a good person, but you're not Hae Young's type.

683
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,250
Hae Young likes types like Choi Woo Sik and Park Seo Joon.

689
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,780
Hello, Big Brother.

690
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,800
We meet again today after yesterday.

691
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,940
I heard that you broke up because of personality differences...

692
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,970
- This couple ring...
- Yes.

693
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,340
I got it together with Hae Young.

694
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,870
The size didn't fit quite well.

695
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,530
Yes, it's the couple ring Oppa gave me yesterday.

696
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,400
- What about your boyfriend?
- I don't think we fit.

697
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,600
I see... that Oppa was...

698
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,050
so by not fitting, you meant...

699
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,620
Then, what were you telling me to think about?

700
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,970
Of course, whether to keep meeting as senior and junior, like friends.

701
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:01,470
There were a lot of people who didn't like my preference.

- What's the matter?
- But then...

Oppa, thank you!

00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,020
- Did you show Big Brother before getting the ring?
- What?

- No, I didn't.
- Wait.

Is this perhaps what you bought to give Hae Young...
