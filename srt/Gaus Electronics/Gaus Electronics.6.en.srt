However, just like many people,

Never mind that. I have a request to make.

I'd be more thankful if you could just apply for a transfer.

I'm requesting that you stay away.

I'll ask for that. Just look at me. What is this?

there hasn't been a day when I didn't get hurt.

Nosebleed, bruises, and even a cast now.

Senior...

You said you can't really call your friends because it's a weekday and

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,230
you don't want to let your parents know as well.

So let me help you with your immediate needs by your side.

How many times do I need to tell you?

I don't want to be with you, Sang Sik.

157
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,440
Still, the doctor said you can't overexert yourself.

158
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,740
You got hurt because of me, so I want to take responsibility.

159

It can't be helped even if you feel burdened.

166
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,370
Aziz offered to help first when he heard that you hurt your arms.

167
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,660
You're going to help and get paid?

168
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,780
That's your bias.

169
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Aziz doesn't calculate the numbers in front of friendship.

170
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,270
He's right, Senior. I got better last time, thanks to him when I had indigestion.

171
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,790
Also, Aziz worked part-time at a hospital.

172
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,920
- His nickname then was "Aightingale."
- Goodness.

173
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,500
You didn't have to. Gosh.

174
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,190
I was able to build a tower with the patients who

175
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,230
wanted Aziz to take care of them.

176
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,130
Forget it. No thanks.

177
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,100
You think I can't live just because I hurt my hands?

178
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,380
Are you two brothers or something?

179
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,340
Your arms are still uncomfortable...

180
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,510
Careful. Let me do it for you.

181
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,130
- Gosh.
- Careful, watch your arms.

182
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,150
I'll do it. I'll do it.

183
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,870
- I'll do it.
- No, Senior. You need to get better soon.

184
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,840
Please stay still and rest.

185
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,780
Yes. Unless you want to make a mess,

186
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,260
just accept the help.

187
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,190
Aziz happens to be free this week as well.

188
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,460
Don't worry about it.

189
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,920
I'll do everything, okay?

190
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,790
Just do as he says, Senior.

191
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,210
You need to wipe under as well.

192
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,640
W-Where, where?

193
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Right there. The side.

194
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,160
- Here?
- You need to wipe it clean.

195
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,510
What kind of Korean can't eat cheonggukjang?

196
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,360
I can't easily muster up the courage because of the smell.

197
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,870
You're spewing nonsense.

198
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,140
Your mom never made you cheonggukjang?

199
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,530
I don't remember eating a meal that was... prepared by my mother.

200
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,950
Hey, how could you not—

201
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,570
I mean, it's not a sin to be without parents.

202
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,830
What's wrong with that? No need to feel discouraged.

203
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,570
I'll... teach you everything one by one slowly.

204
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,170
First of all, about cheonggukjang.

205
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:11,150
You're Korean only if you eat this.

206
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,860
Scoop it up and

207
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,680
say "ah."

208
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,810
It's tasty, right?

209
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,440
No Korean can say this tastes bad.

210
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,240
Hello? Yes.

211
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,020
Y-Yes. The chairman ordered it? Okay!

212
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,010
It's an emergency. Hurry up! Let's go!

213
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,340
Roll out, roll out!

214
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,180
Marketing Team 3 finally got an order from the chairman.

215
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,060
He finally entrusted a special event to us,

216
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,340
Marketing Team 3 on which the future of Gaus depends.

217
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,180
The Gaus Phone Unpack Event in LA?

218
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,880
That's for Team 1.

219
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,280
The Gaus Dresser Convention Event at Gangnam!

220
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,090
Convention Event?

221
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,250
That's for Team 2.

222
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,450
Then, what else is there?

223
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,590
The 2022 Gaus Massage Gun New Product Demonstration

224
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,300
Event and the Volunteer Street Cleaning Event at Bulgwangcheon!

225
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,340
That's for us, Team 3.

226
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,230
What's up with all of your reactions?

227
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,070
Please wrap it up nicely, General Manager.

228
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,970
Executive Manager!

229
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,990
Fighting!

230
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,140
Are you all really going to be like this?

231
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,530
When we get to present our high-spec massage gun to the world?

232
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,770
It's a very significant event where we can increase

233
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,100
the buyer needs and contribute largely to the

234
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,650
reputation of the company by cleaning the streets!

235
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:47,950
It's a chance to flatten the noses of the people who have been looking down on us.

236
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,860
I told you... a chance is an opportunity, and an opportunity is a chance.

237
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,630
But isn't that event happening tomorrow?

238
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,880
Yes, I know.

239
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,810
Everyone's busy because of the launch of Serona.

240
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,180
However! Nonetheless!

241
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,930
There must be at least two more people besides me

242
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:08,400
who would be willing to sacrifice for the team. Right?

243
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,180
Come into the conference room right now.

244
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,520
I'll be looking forward to it.

245
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,350
I'm going off to hell first.

246
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,760
- One!
- Two!

247
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,950
- Three!
- Four!

248
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,060
It's him.

249
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,870
- Five!
- Five?

250
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,700
Go inside.

251
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,480
If we create a banner of the chairman's portrait and

252
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,720
post it at the center of the stage, wouldn't he like that?

253
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,180
Not too bad.

254
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,370
Not too good, either.

255
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,310
Hey, why are you spacing out?

256
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,740
- Let's do some head-spins.
- Sorry?

257
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,870
I'm telling you to rack your brains a bit, man.

258
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,710
Where did it go? Gosh, wait a minute.

259
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,810
Hey, what now? What did you forget this time?

260
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,540
I forgot... my belly button.

261
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,770
Because you called brainstorming a head-spin...

262
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,340
Right? Head-spin means spin your head.

263
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,640
Seriously, no?

264
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,210
Whoa, I lost my belly button

265
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,130
because of your humor, General Manager.

266
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,370
Geez, you're such a flatterer.

267
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,230
Being an employee at a company... really does not suit me.

268
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,140
It doesn't suit me.

269
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,070
How great would it be... if you can just quit whenever you want to?

270
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,920
Is there a reason why you can't do that?

271
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,910
There are plenty of reasons.

272
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,940
Ma Tan, you should do what you want to do before it's too late.

273
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,760
Don't become a regretful loser like me,

274
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,320
who kept hesitating to challenge while being wary of others.

275
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,560
Hey, the company is not everything in your life.

276
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,270
Don't ever trust the company. Okay?

277
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,030
Let's go down.

278
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,760
[Gaus]

279
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,830
Gaus?

280
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,600
That tattoo... isn't it the Gaus logo?

281
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,610
You just said that the company is not everything in life...

282
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,330
- and not to ever trust the company...
- Exactly.

283
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,490
Don't trust me, either.

284
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,500
I really wanted to eat that.

285
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,720
Aziz, you must've spent a lot of money.

286
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,670
Just send me the invoice for today and future purchases.

287
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,720
- I'll pay you back with interest.
- It's fine.

288
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,930
There's nothing left in Aziz if you take out loyalty.

289
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,530
Let Sang Sik have some of this as well.

290
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,810
He's such a country bumpkin, so he'd be mesmerized by this.

291
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,580
Wait.

292
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,410
Eat.

293
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,630
Good girl, you did well.

294
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,820
By the way, Aziz. Your care is a lot more luxurious than I thought.

295
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,100
You need to eat well to get well soon, Na Rae.

296
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,050
When Aziz was working at the hospital,

297
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,260
Coco, who ate both pet food and snacks,

298
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,700
got better faster than Poppy, who only ate pet foods.

299
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,830
Wait a minute.

300
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,160
- The hospital you talked about was—
- Na Rae, hand.

301
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,100
That's right. It was the Doggone Good Hospital.

302
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,650
The vet doctor was really kind.

303
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,250
What the heck? It was a veterinary hospital?

304
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,880
- That's why you treated me like a dog—
- Na Rae, bang!

305
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,560
Have some bread as well.
("Bbang" is bread in Korean)

306
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,710
You need to eat a lot to get better fast.

307
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,160
Mr. Ma Tan. You're having quite the time.

308
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,440
But you'll have to hang in there quite longer.

309
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,310
The seniors are determined to order you around.

310
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,600
Am I marked?

311
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,440
No, it's because you seriously suck at games.

312
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,160
So they're trying to use you.

313
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,350
Being incompetent and ignorant are two different things.

314
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,650
- I see. So you're saying you sucked because you were ignorant?
- Yes.

315
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,210
Mr. Ma Tan, do you know how to play rock-paper-scissors?

316
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,340
Of course.

317
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,270
Then shall we play it over, carrying the other person's load?

318
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,390
Rock-paper-scissors, shoot!

319
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,680
Thank you, Mr. Ma Tan.

320
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,250
Let me tell you one more time.

321
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,580
I was just unlucky.

322
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,540
I see. Okay, okay.

323
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,460
Hey, Ma Tan. It's so boring.

324
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,860

Yes.

didn't hear your voice at the office today.

652
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,570
Why play a game?

653
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,230
This stuff is for the youngest to do.

654
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,130
Hey! Who wears underwear in the public bath?

655
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,610
The owner here is going to get mad at you!

656
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,610
Go out and take them off right now.

657
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,730
Do you have to get totally naked?

658
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,550
You're such a mysterious human being.

659
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,910
Hey, look around. Who's wearing underwear in here?

660
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,600
Hey, haven't you ever been to a public bathhouse?

661
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,180
Hey, come out.

662
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,010
Come.

663
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,330
Here. Turn.

664
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,350
What are you going to do?

665
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,030
We got soaked, so we need to get shedding now.

666
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,930
I'm fine because I get scrubbed with pink salt twice a week.

667
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,480
What the heck are you saying?

668
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,990
- Turn!
- I-I'm o-okay—

669
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,900
All right, here we go!

670
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,610
Even though I hate it so much,

671
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,740
it's so refreshing...

672
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:08,300
It's shedding and something's falling.

673
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,710
Then it's piling.

674
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,600
Was the pink salt scrub nothing compared to this?

675
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,880
This is my first time becoming baby-skinned.

676
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,950
This feeling...

677
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,860
Switch.

678
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,530
What are you doing? It's your turn.

679
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,250
Come on, scrub it harder. Harder—

680
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,120
You're going to peel my skin off.

681
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,160
Scrub it properly, okay?

682
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,300
I saw the accident today in a video, Senior.

683
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,720
You must've been through a lot.

684
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,380
It's nothing new to me.

685
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,600
More than that,

686
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,180
an accident needs to happen to you, not the company.

687
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,040
What?

688
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,140
What are you saying to someone who has already had an accident happen to them?

689
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,690
How did it go?

690
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,350
Tell me about it. You got far, right?

691
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,910
Get far? Get far where?

692
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,780
Your progress.

693
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,220
Did it get far or not?

694
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,730
What progress are you talking about?

695
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,800
Come again?

696
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,190
You stayed home for days with your flirt, who's only a wall away.

697
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,830
Yet you blew off the opportunity that the heavens gave you?

698
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,490
It's a hallelujah, seriously.

699
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,600
What do you mean?

700
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,870
I already told you, too. I really hate the man next door.

701
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,380
That's only your first impression.

702
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,400
It's not the same now, is it?

703
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,680
It's really not like that.

704
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,560
Also, how can the carotid artery and the belly button understand feelings?

705
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,590
Only I know my own feelings.

706
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,920
What's the first thing you do when you're analyzing the profitability at work?

707
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,330
You first do the statistics, right?

708
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,350
You analyze and interpret the data

709
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,690
Why do you think we do that?

710
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:05,520
Gosh, I don't know. No idea.

711
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,550
Seriously...

712
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,730
It's because you can't tell.

713
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,570
You rely on the statistics because you can't tell.

714
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,630
Even the billion and trillion companies

715
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,480
go through a ruckus to make the statistics because they don't know which way to go.

716
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,850
How hard would it be for a person?

717
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,620
You know your feelings well because it's yours?

718
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,650
Right. Stop making me laugh.

719
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,040
My god, seriously!

720
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,580
I don't know, either, Senior. Seriously.

721
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,890
For now, make some progress first.

722
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,840
- Progress?
- Are you going to keep lighting a meaningless fire?

723
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,870
At that point, you'll get a feel for sure.

724
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,680
Whether that relationship is a yes or a no.

725
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,850
Progress...

726
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:41,070
Sang Sik.

727
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,670
Let's have a shot.

728
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,390
Thank you.

729
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,980
Mr. Sang Sik, drop by my place when you're off work.

730
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,070
Hey, why do you look so uncomfortable today?

731
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,920
Do you have a hidden lover at home or something?

732
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,060
No, not at all.

733
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,400
There's a ferocious dog at home that needs some care.

734
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,430
I see. You had a dog?

735
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,170
I didn't know that.

736
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,310
We're both heads of household who can't even drink freely.

737
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:12,300
Goodness, only the bad commonalities pile up.

738
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,820
Wait, wait. Don't do that.

739
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,330
I need to go home early anyway, so let's just chug this one as the last glass.

740
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,380
- Then let's call it a day.
- D-Drink all of this?

741
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,580
All right. Okay.

742
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,870
For the heads of household, bottoms up!

743
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,930
Gosh, it's nice.

744
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,340
All right, then.

745
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,780
Senior, what's this?

746
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,700
This...

747
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,520
Sang Sik, are you a fogey?

748
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,710
Bottoms up. It means you raise it only as high as you want.

749
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,630
Goodness, Senior...

750
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,900
Senior.

751
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,120
Come and have a seat.

752
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,040
Aziz left this here.

753
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,770
But the name on this card is Lee Sang Sik.

754
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,840
Why is that so?

755
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,550
Why did Aziz have it?

756
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,370
- Thank you—
- Gosh.

757
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:25,970
I already heard everything.

758
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,910
Apparently, you told Aziz that you'll pay him to take care of me all day?

759
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,200
Yes.

760
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,650
Why are you like this?

761
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,490
Did you think that I'd like it if you did that?

762
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,700
Then, what do I do?

763
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,700
You tell me not to come near you.

764
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,040
Are you drunk?

765
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,820
You're definitely drunk. This is unbelievable.

766
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,520
You made me like this and had no problem drinking, huh?

767
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,590
Yes... I had no problem drinking...

768
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,570
What did you say?

769
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,950
Have you gone mad, Mr. Lee Sang Sik?

770
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,860
Yes, I've gone mad and drank alcohol.

771
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,490
Senior, also, our team made a mistake at today's event.

772
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,160
D-Did you see it?

773
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,490
Forget it.

774
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,700
Go home and sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.

775
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,510
Senior, Senior.

776
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,240
Please hear me out.

777
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,600
General Manager was totally foaming at the mouth, you know.

778
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,270
Senior Moon Hak was crying his eyes out.

779
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,100
Ruckus here and ruckus there...

780
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,610
In the middle of that...

781
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,380
I couldn't think of anyone but you, Senior.

782
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,440
"If Senior were here...

783
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,730
Only if my Senior Na Rae were here...

784
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,540
She would've cursed like hell again.

785
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,420
She would've become a human massage gun and

786
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,060
stab me everywhere, even the places that are not tense.

787
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,700
- You fucking drunkard!
- See? This is what I mean.

788
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,010
You're totally a human massage gun.

789
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,340
Senior, I think I'll suggest a feature to the Development Team.

790
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:55,400
To develop a massage gun that can relieve your anger instead of muscles.

791
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,810
Gaus Massage Gun, anger cooling mode on.

792
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,330
Senior Na Rae's anger is loosening up.

793
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,810
That kind of feature doesn't exist, though.

794
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,740
Then you'd be angry every day, Senior.

795
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,440
Who do you think is making me angry every day?

796
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,360
Who do I think?

797
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,150
It's because of me...

798
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,580
That's right. I'm the cause.

799
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,980
Senior, are you in pain all the time because of me?

800
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,980
Senior, what do I do? I think I'm a really bad person.

801
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,770
I also embarrassed you last time because of Hae Young.

802
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,280
I should've synced my lips with you in advance, at least.
(Idiom in Korean that means to get on the same page)

803
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,380
S-Sync what?

804
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,290
I really shouldn't have called you over. Leave.

805
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,790
I said, leave!

806
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,270
- I'm going to take my medicine.
- Medicine?

807
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,880
Senior, I'll feed you your medicine.

808
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm going to take my cast off soon, so I can do it.

809
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,520
No, Senior. Please stay still.

810
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,450
Leave, I said.

811
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,600
Take it apart like this...

812
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,980
take it out...

813
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,710
and then...

814
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,380
Senior, say "ah."

815
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,510
"Ah."

816
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,880
I said It's fine!

817
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,190
Senior...

818
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,180
I'm really, really sorry.

819
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,530
I had a hard time all day today.

820
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,950
I was worried about you...

821
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,940
and when people were asking me how you got hurt...

822
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,120
I didn't know what to say to that.

823
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,980
Then we can just sync our lips.

824
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,550
Sorry?

825
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,210
Why? You don't want to?

826
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,370
No, I'd love to.

827
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,780
Senior.

828
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,560
Gosh, so stifling.

Aigoo, this freaking company.

840
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,040
Hey, how great would it be to be able to quit when you want to?

841
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,540
Is there any reason why you can't do that?

842
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,100
There are plenty of reasons.

843
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,920
Daddy's home!

844
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,370
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

845
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:50,640
- Daddy!
- Have you been well?

846
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,720
Daddy, play with me!

847
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,540
You're here?

848
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,990
Daddy, I want to eat fried chicken.

849
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,060
Daddy must've had a hard time today.

850
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,520
- Shall we give him a massage?
- Yes!

851
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,030
- It feels good, right?
- Yes.

852
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:05,740
It feels so great.

853
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,530
Aigoo, that feels great.

854
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:10,980
Kids, be gentle.

855
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,220
Wait, wait.

856
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,240
Goodness, okay.

857
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,100
It's painful, but refreshing, right?

858
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,000
Enjoy it more conveniently.

862
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:30,220
What do I do if he lunges at me, saying he likes me?

863
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,900
Did something happen between us yesterday?

864
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,590
Nowadays, you can just about kiss anyone.

865
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:35,630
I-Isn't that right, Senior?

866
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,610
Of course.

867
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,600
If you don't come back on your own, I'll make you.

868
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,970
Do you have something going on with Lee Sang Sik?

869
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,690
You should also think about your son.

870
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:44,820
Let's meet at 7,000.

871
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,560
Does that mean everyone's a suspect?

872
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,630
Wants to meet Lee Sang Sik?

873
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,930
Who would think of Lee Sang Sik as a man?

874
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:52,190
I'll do it! She's such a beauty!

875
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:54,720
Marketing Team 3 is out. Wrap it up nicely.

876
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,440
My team is going to be gone.

877
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,150
Senior, I'm going to quit.

878
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,780
♫ 'Cuz you're my everything, and tell me everydy ♫

879

W-Why? Y-You were the first one...

880
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,840
The tongue is too much!

881
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,320
I-I'm s-sorry. I won't d-do it.

882
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:20,460
Why this time?

883
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,410
Quitting in the middle is even worse!
