00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,570
Isn't General Manager Gi so funny?

166
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,490
He's funny. Ha. Ha.

167
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,980
- Should I do it?
- How could she not laugh after seeing that?

168
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,800
Seriously...

169
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,660
Her smile is so pretty, so why wouldn't she smile?

170
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,220
Manager Seong lacks facial expressions so much that...

171
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,890
there are weird rumors about her... saying it's because of a bad Botox job or...

172
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,700
that she's a humanoid made by Gaus, you know?

173
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,030
Even so, she has it easy during negotiations, thanks to that.

174
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,400
Let's proceed as written.

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Okay, understood.

176
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,580
I think you can consider the work to be done in about a month.

177
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,420
Half a month at best.

178
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,880
- Half a month?
- That much is really the best we can do.

179
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
Okay.

180
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,180
All right, we can do it in a week, to be honest.

181
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,730
But any more than that is really not possible.

182
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,440
I see.

183
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,020
Could it be that you want us to reduce the time even more from here?

184
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,770
Nope.

185
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,100
You are just as cruel as I heard.

186
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,290
You want to see us dying out, right? Okay.

187
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,210
We'll have it done by tomorrow...

188
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,180
Would you be able to do it?

189
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,630
We have to!

190
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,470
I'm going out for negotiation.

191
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,370
Let's give up.

192
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,040
Making Senior Hyeong Mi laugh won't be easy.

193
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,910
True. Do you remember what we said about this before?

194
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,100
Would it be faster for Manager Seong to laugh or

195
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,910
Senior Na Rae to smile affectionately at Senior Sang Sik?

196
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,600
Come on, that's totally off balance.

197
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,990
Why would Na Rae ever smile at Sang Sik?

198
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,170
On top of that, affectionately?

199
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,110
There's zero chance of that. No chance.

200
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,110
The question itself has a terrible balance.

201
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,740
Complete loss of balance.

202
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,350
Exactly, why would I smile at him?

203
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,640
It means it's that much of an impossible mission.

204
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,760
- Do you want to make a bet among us?
- A bet?

205
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,660
Don't you want to witness that precious smile of Manager Seong just once?

206
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,480
The first one to make her laugh takes all. How is it?

207
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,140
This isn't just a simple bet for money.

208
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,440
That's right. It's a hidden effort in trying to save the project.

209
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,680
That's right.

210
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,400
General Manager, you should chip in.

211
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,350
Code name... "Laugh out loud, Manager Seong!

212
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,120
Laugh out loud, Gaboss!"

213
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,220
Hey, listen to yourselves.

214
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,950
Are you really going to keep wasting time chatting?

215
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,300
Not doing the work that I told you to do!

216
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,640
These people, seriously...

217
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,240
So how much should the stakes be?

218
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,170
Manager Seong, do you want to hear a funny story?

219
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,180
No.

220
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,180
What sound does Cha Wa Wa make when he laughs?

221
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,230
Cha-Wa-Wa.

222
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,170
Cha-Wa-Wa.

223
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,730
Wait a minute.

224
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,190
Let's say someone's j-walking on the street.

225
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,780
"Hey, you can't j-walk!" If you say that in three letters...

226
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,110
it's Cha-Wa-Wa.
(Cha=car, Wa=coming, Wa=Whoa! in Korean)

227
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,510
Cha-Wa-Wa.

228
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,660
Why don't you do some work?

229
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,750
You can't expect this one at all, for sure.

230
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,670
Let's say I saw a really expensive foreign car.

231
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,960
The moment I see that car, I'd say—

232
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,100
Cha Wa-Wa.
(Cha=car, Wa-Wa=Whoa, Whoa in Korean)

233
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,590
Well, you... took my best punchline...

234
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,940
Have a good lunch, Cha-Wa-Wa.

235
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,410
You!

236
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,950
I-I think she did smile a bit!

237
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,940
Didn't you see it?

238
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,620
How do you think I feel right now?

239
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,150
Cha-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa...

240
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,240
Cha-Wa-Wa!

241
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,370
You guys should just laugh if it's funny!

242
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,000
Smooth sweetness spreads in my mouth.

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,400
The funny texture entertains both my tongue and my teeth.

244
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,410
I personally like the walnut pastries sold at service areas the most.

245
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,580
Walnut pastry?

246
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,520
- Is it called that because it's "wal"-liked by everyone?
- Ma Tan.

247
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,050
- What kind of food do you like?
- Not sure.

248
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,120
Before living alone, I usually liked to eat truffle chips.

249
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,850
Truffle chips?

250
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,860
Why don't you say you also ate stuff like caviar puddings?

251
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,460
Yes. That one pairs well with Darjeeling tea...

252
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,450
although not as well as foie gras ice cream.

253
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,840
Ma Tan, you... must come from quite a wealthy family.

254
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,990
We're about upper-middle class.

255
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,490
You seem quite tired.

256
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,560
Should I call for a driver and ask him to drive?

257
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,780
There's a driver whom I got to know while passing by a few times.

258
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,460
No, it's okay.

259
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,540
We'd be spending all of our per diem allowances on him then.

260
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,020
If I talk to him well, we can use him for free.

261
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,970
It's not like he's your private driver, so how?

262
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,980
Yes, Secretary Kim—

263
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,490
I mean, Brother!

264
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,950
Could you send me a driver right now?

265
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,030
I'm sorry, Young Boss.

266
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,200
Chairman told me not to give you any help until you come back to Power.

267
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,820
He made an earnest request.

268
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,040
I understand, Secretary Kim—

269
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,920
I mean, Brother. I must've troubled you.

270
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,530
He said he couldn't do it for me right now.

271
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,010
Also, that brother's name is Bi Seo.
(Secretary in Korean)

272
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,120
- Just in case you misunderstand...
- Ma Tan, you... assumed a really peculiar concept of personality.

273
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,040
- Sorry?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing.

274
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,250
You must not be in the right mind since we've been on the road since the morning.

275
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,680
If you're tired, just sleep like before.

276
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,040
Then should I return to the backseat?

277
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,070
Just sleep there.

278
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,130
It's ticklish, right? Right? Right?

279
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,780
- You're holding your laugh, right?
- What are you doing?

280
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,680
Why aren't you laughing?

281
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,560
Isn't it weird to laugh when you're in pain?

282
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,510
I think I even got a bruise just now.

283
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,590
Gosh, it hurts.

284
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,040
Are you not ticklish?

285
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
No. I'm not.

286
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,060
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,480
That's too one-dimensional.

288
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,400
Hey, this is going to work for sure. Right?

289
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,610
Wouldn't this contrarily reduce the humor when you attempt to make

290
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,690
her laugh with one-dimensional stuff like this?

291
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,880
It only reveals your anxious heart, Manager.

292
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,330
Is that so?

293
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,120
Hey, how are you going to make her laugh then?

294
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,880
Hey! That was mine!

295
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,430
Hey, you thief! Come here.

296
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,390
Hey, you thief! You said it's one-dimensional!

297
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,550
You said it's one-dimensional. You said it's one-dimensional!

298
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,090
That's why I drew two streaks!

299
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,360
Silence!

300
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,220
Are you in elementary school or something?

301
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,390
Manager Seong... please laugh once.

302
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,270
They're wasting even more time than usual because of that rumor.

303
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,810
I'll even beg of you like this. Please laugh once. Look closely.

304
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,030
If she laughs now, it's my win.

305
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,870
Come on.

306
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,950
It's not like I'm a genie in a bottle.

307
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,090
Good results come out if you do good work...

308
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,920
not from making me laugh with stupid makeup.

309
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,500
Manager Seong...

310
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,230
Even you, Executive Manager? Why?

311
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,060
Sorry? What?

312
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,960
I-Is there something on my face?

313
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,350
Gosh, I just had kimbap, so...

314
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,040
I-I'm sorry. Sorry.

315
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,620
Wait—

316
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,740
So sad... Why are you stingy, Manager Seong?

317
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,760
They say good fortune comes to those who laugh.

318
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,820
Don't you want to be fortunate? Come on and laugh now.

319
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,730
Manager Seong, this is an order from your superior!

320
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,240
Laugh!

321
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,370
I've never seen someone making others laugh that way.

322
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,460
Do you think your superior is laughable?

323
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,800
If you do!

324
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,340
Then you should laugh. Smile, smile.

325
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,280
Like Lee Byeong Heon, you know... just a little bit.

326
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,480
A smile. Just a smile.

327
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,830
I thought of H One Electronics as a small subcontractor because its office was

328
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,140
just as big as my rental room, but I guess it wasn't.

329
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,050
Wow... Your rental room must be... quite large, Ma Tan. Right?

330
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,930
Rental room...

331
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,040
No.

332
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,730
It's just a studio.

333
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,640
Studios do come pretty spacious nowadays.

334
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,350
Yes, they're about this big.

335
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,020
It's smaller than this place.

336
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,310
My goodness, have you been doing well?

337
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,620
Goodness, long time no see, General Manager.

338
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,930
I'm sorry to make you wait after your long trip.

339
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,800
Not at all.

340
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,370
He's our new director who came from our HQ in Germany.

341
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,650
He's going to advise you on core technology that will be used for the Gaboss Project.

342
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,760
- I see. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

343
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,710
These are the gentlemen from Gaus Electronics.

344
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,880
Prince?

345
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,270
You're working for Gaus?
(Said in German)

346
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,360
Does he know him? I don't speak German that well.

347
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,150
I don't really speak German as well...

348
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,860
Long time no see, Zokerberg.

349
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,480
I'm currently working at Gaus for a reason.

350
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,850
Gaus?

351
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,870
Power even acquired Gaus?

352
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,260
- Power?
- Power...

353
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,430
No, that's not the case.

354
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,890
These people don't know about it...

355
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,010
so please keep my background a secret.

356
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,380
Seriously?

357
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,190
Are you filming "Undercover Boss" or something?

358
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,660
- Boss?
- Boss...

359
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,610
This is interesting. Where is the camera?

360
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,820
- Cameras?
- The cameras are...

361
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,030
This is not Candid Camera.

362
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,610
I'm seriously a new employee at Gaus.

363
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,990
Anyway, just pretend that you don't know me.

364
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,370
Okay. I'll make sure.

365
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,600
Well, the thing is... he's a friend who I met on the trip.

366
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,020
I was just too glad to see him in a place like this.

367
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,090
- I see... a trip.
- I don't know this person.

368
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,220
You don't know?

369
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,630
I thought you two just had a conversation...

370
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,320
He speaks some nonsense German, but... this is my first time seeing this person.

371
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,640
But why did he bother doing that... at this meeting?

372
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,640
I apologize. My subordinate... likes to do things for show a bit...

373
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,270
Please excuse him.

374
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,000
Okay.

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
Good day.

376
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,880
- We'll be going now then.
- Okay, please take care.

377
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,040
- Please take care.
- Yes, thank you.

378
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,720
It was a good try.

379
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,900
You want to be noticed and get recognized even a little. Right?

380
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,340
I was also the same when I was new. It's only natural.

381
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,040
- What do you mean—
- However, Ma Tan...

382
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,530
I'm not your rival.

383
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm just a good senior and friendly brother.

384
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,330
So you don't have to pretend to be rich, strong, or different

385
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,270
from others in front of me at least. You understand?

386
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,400
We're done with everything for the day. Let's go and get some rest.

387
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,120
Here.

388
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,890
Wait! Do you know of PW Juliette Hotel?

389
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,010
Are you talking about the PW Hotel that's a subsidiary of Power?

390
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,440
Whoa... You do know, huh?

391
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,490
That place is so expensive in Seoul, but the price was all right in this region.

392
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,960
[PVV Juliette Hotel]

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,400
[PVV Juliette Hotel]

394
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,480
There was a reason why the price was all right.

395
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,880
It was PVV, not PW.

396
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,460
The "W" did look a bit long.

397
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,590
Still, what's a business trip without sleeping at places like these?

398
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,880
- Let's go in.
- You should sleep here alone comfortably.

399
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,770
I'll go somewhere else nearby because someone I know

400
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,090
opened up a hotel around here.

401
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,670
Ma Tan, you... again!

402
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,780
I told you this already. You don't have to pretend in front of me!

403
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,230
Gosh, let's go in.

404
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,000
- I really have a nearby—
- It's okay, it's okay.

405
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,940
Senior, one moment, please.

406
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,170
- Hello.
- Gosh, welcome in.

407
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,780
I made a reservation for Lee Sang Sik.

408
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, yes.

409
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,970
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

410
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,930
It's a system where you take your own amenities, huh?

411
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,440
What floor is the fitness center on?

412
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,900
Why are you looking for a fitness center here?

413
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,210
You need to go to the community center and ask.

414
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,050
Are the scrubs placed inside the room?

415
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,170
Ma Tan.

416
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,750
S-Scrub?

417
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,260
- What the heck is that?
- It's what you use to shed your dead skin cells—

418
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,070
I see.

419
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,260
It's 500 won.

420
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,150
Why aren't you giving me my keys, though?

421
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,310
We only got one room since it's a twin bed.

422
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,980
Please book me more room right now.

423
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,270
There are no more rooms.

424
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,340
That was the last one.

425
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,300
Well, then just this one, please.

426
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,190
I'll pay with a card.

427
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,290
Who pays 500 won with a card?

428
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,200
I'm sorry.

429
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,760
What's this?

430
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,680
It says it's suspended.

431
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,090
Sorry?

432
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,110
Chairman said it's time for a power move.

433
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,130
It seems he suspended all of your cards as well.

434
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,810
I'll put this to good use.

435
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,160
Though I'm unable to use my card due to personal circumstances,

436
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,940
I'll pay you back 500 won as soon as we're back in Seoul.

437
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,990
Forget about it. It's just 500 won.

438
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,900
Ma Tan, don't be too burdened.

439
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,740
You can just ask me if there's anything you need.

440
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,950
I didn't know you'd ask me to clean.

441
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,020
I don't really like dirtiness, you see.

442
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,160
It's not satisfactory, but...

443
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,290
let's call it a day with this.

444
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,950
Cheers.

445
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,000
I mean, I'm also on the clean side, but you're on the extreme side.

446
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,260
Does Ms. Kang Mi say anything about it?

447
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,450
I'm not in that kind of relationship with Ms. Kang Mi.

448
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,460
Really? But...

449
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,200
you said you didn't have a girlfriend before coming to Gaus.

450
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,290
You never had a relationship before?

451
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:16,550
Do you have a girlfriend, Senior?

452
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,810
I mean, I...

453
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:24,730
guess you can say that I have a person if you

454
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,450
can say that I have one as well, maybe?

455
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,990
Just drink this.

456
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,490
So you don't have one either, Senior.

457
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,130
Also, I can't eat the skins.

458
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,280
Okay, I'll peel them for you.

459
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,980
Since you don't really know much,

460
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,550
I can't really explain anything clearly.

461
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,100
So!

462
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,000
We already checked our feelings for each other.

463
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,250
It's a relationship where we just have to ask each other out now.

464
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,430
Gosh, it's embarrassing after saying it.

465
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,970
You seem to be happy...

466
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,310
- since you keep smiling.
- Ma Tan...

467
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,480
did you ever break out in smiles like this before?

468
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,520
What I mean is...

469
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,740
like your insides feel like there are butterflies and

470
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,480
just thinking about her make you restless.

471
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,060
Not sure.

472
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,210
What does it mean to be restless?

473
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,200
You've never had your heart...

474
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,100
keep on pounding like crazy?

475
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,870
It did happen. Once.

476
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,850
Then be good to that person.

477
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:34,370
That's hard to do...

478
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,600
because I already have someone I need to marry.

479
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,080
Ma Tan, you don't need to hide it by giving that kind of ancient excuse.

480
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,990
Having been single all your life is not a sin.

481
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,800
Despite my looks, I've never had a relationship, either.

482
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,060
- Yes.
- For five years...

483
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,930
I had my eyes on just one person...

484
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,100
but it turned out to be a meaningless crush.

485
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,570
So I thought it'd also take about five years to get over her.

486
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,490
But that wasn't the case.

487
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,130
Thanks to a certain person,

488
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,790
I got over her

489
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,070
- all at once.
- I see.

490
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,690
A really unexpected fate...

491
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,530
was by my side without me noticing.

492
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,250
I actually...

493
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,790
didn't even fathom having butterflies in my stomach because of that person.

494
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,800
But as I kept looking,

495
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,390
she looks like a smarty but is actually clumsy.

496
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,100
She seems strong but is actually fragile...

497
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,600
She's actually cute.

498
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,110
But what part of me did Senior like—

499
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,880
T-The senior that I'm talking about here

500
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,420
is someone who has lived longer than me in life—

501
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,800
Ma Tan.

502
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,860
Ma Tan, are you sleeping?

503
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,300
I had my eyes close for a bit.

504
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,050
Your deep sleep score is 100.

505
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,500
It says you had a deep sleep...

506
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,590
I wanted to have some beer with somebody tonight anyway.

507
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,620
But I didn't know that somebody...

508
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,660
would be this somebody.

509
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,540
Why? Hae Young is happy.

510
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,490
Aren't you happy, Unni?

511
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,110
- No way.
- Unni,

512
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,470
Hae Young intentionally made time to drink beer with you here.

513
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,380
You came over to my house after seeing that Mr. Sang Sik isn't home.

514
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,010
Is that what's important right now?

515
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,660
Unni, Hae Young is a really busy person.

516
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,170
I was really tired from having three dates after work today, too.

517
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,640
Whoa... shit.

518
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,420
You're really respectable.

519
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,050
I don't get close easily with other women.

520
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,680
Everyone's so sensitive, worrying that Hae Young might seduce their men.

521
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,510
Oh, it doesn't mean that I didn't seduce them.

522
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,270
Anyway, Unni, you're...

523
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,600
not sensitive to just me, but everyone. So I like you.

524
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,440
Watching you is fun.

525
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,640
Cheers?

526
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,070
To tell you as a sensitive woman,

527
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,810
even if Mr. Sang Sik is easy for you...

528
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,340
Let's say Mr. Sang Sik got a girlfriend.

529
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,040
But if you keep barging in whenever you want like this,

530
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,580
wouldn't it be unpleasant?

531
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,960
In that case, I'll have to ask some other oppa for repairs.

532
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,450
No one else does a good job like Sang Sik, though.

533
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,970
He's totally being treated like a worker.

534
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,440
By the way...

535
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,500
if Sang Sik does get a girlfriend within the next few days...

536
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,390
I do think that will be a little sad.

537
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,550
He's probably meeting anyone out of loneliness.

538
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,110
Poor Sang Sik...

539
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,910
Oh, a-are you okay?

540
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,410
There's something stuck in my teeth right now.

541
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,590
Are your clothes okay?

542
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,930
They're okay. I had your clothes on.

543
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,770
Senior, what are you doing?

544
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,230
J-Jesus Christ!

545
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,720
Aren't you going to sleep?

546
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,710
You'll have to drive long hours again tomorrow.

547
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,890
I-I should sleep. Yes.

548
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,800
Hurry up and go to sleep, too.

549
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,610
See you tomorrow.

550
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,400
I miss you.

551
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,680
Good night.

552
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,020
I got so startled that I'm wide awake now.

553
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,550
Why do you keep staring?

554
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,550
Please go ahead and sleep.

555
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,380
Okay.

556
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,200
See you tomorrow.

557
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,220
I miss you.

558
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,090
We can go straight home after reporting our business trip.

559
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,270
Okay. That's a good system.

560
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,110
However, I won't go home early.

561
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,610
It's been so long...

562
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,130
since everyone joined together to work toward a single goal.

563
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,170
I also have a new motivation after my video was approved from last time.

564
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:10,380
Everyone should be thinking the same thing as me right now.

565
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,800
Managers, we're here—

566
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,860
This is security, right?

567
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,620
Applaud!

568
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,980
Seriously.

569
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,480
Since when were you standing there?

570
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,890
You know what? Just forget it, Gaboss and everything else.

571
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,930
Executive Manager Wi, let's just have a company dinner after work.

572
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,770
I don't think I'll be able to go home sober.

573
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,780
Shall we?

574
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,300
Executive... Executive Manager Wi...

575
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,150
Kang Mi, book a karaoke right away.

576
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,350
- They want us to stop at round one.
- Okay.

577
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,860
I came back safely from the business trip.

578
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,400
Is your nose okay form earlier?

579
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,600
You should've gone home right away. Why did you come to work?

580
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,350
There's something I need to report to you.

581
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,220
It's what the H One personnel told me...

582
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,140
Power sent us the same request this time...

583
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,150
Are you planning this together with them?

584
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,010
- No.
- I mean...

585
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,630
The project names are different,

586
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:38,790
but the direction of progress and the core technology were totally the same.

587
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,250
I see.

588
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,110
I guess Power is pursuing the same case.

589
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:48,450
Yes, but I just think it's strange that something like this happened again.

590
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,840
With the smartphone incident last time and this time, too.

591
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,280
Isn't it strange that everything overlaps as if someone leaked the information beforehand?

592
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,430
But the thoughts people have are all pretty much similar.

593
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,870
For H One, it'd be a dilemma since they can't take both projects.

594
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,330
But it's barely in the developing stages.

595
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,510
Let's just wait and see a bit longer.

596
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,230
That's why I clearly told them.

597
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,170
We have Executive Manager Wi.

598
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,060
The protagonist of the legend of expanding 500% of the global market share of smartphones in 2012.

599
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,470
He's not someone who can be pushed aside by Power.

600
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,560
So get on the right line.

601
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,820
Yes.

602
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,780
You said something quite useless.

603
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,410
- What?
- Back off just a bit.

604
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,910
- Executive Manager Wi.
- Yes.

605
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,960
I believe in your skills and abilities.

606
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,650
I'll accomplish it quicker and more perfectly than Power.

607
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,420
So please just give me an order.

608
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,910
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

609
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:40,690
- Then can you leave, now?
- Okay.

610
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,060
Just do as you've been doing.

611
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,940
Don't be too quick.

612
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,530
Control your pace.

613
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,120
Well, I guess even if you tried to make peace,

614
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,320
you wouldn't be able to with those losers.

615
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,680
- Well—
- You...

616
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,450
need only to trust in me and follow.

617
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:11,640
While taking good care of Young Boss Baek Ma Tan.

618
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,370
Got it?

619
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,280
Wait—

620
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,270
Take care.

621
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,990
Rude little...

622
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,260
Yes, Chairman.

623
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,460
Yes, I heard the news about Power.

624
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,980
One more time!

625
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,400
Hey, don't worry.

626
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,330
I'm filling my stomach with water.

627
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,260
I'm not sure if it's because I crave soju, but I taste soju from the water.

628
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,740
Today, you absolutely must not, no matter what happens, ever get drunk.

629
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,920
Yeah, yeah. All right.

630
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,340
Wait, turn it off. Turn it off.

631
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,690
Gosh, Seong Hyeong Mi, you're stubborn. So stubborn.

632
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,300
Why aren't you laughing?

633
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,860
There's no reason for me to laugh.

634
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,810
I get a monthly pay working for someone else.

635
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,400
And that pay is smaller than this beef jerky.

636
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,970
Furthermore, we can only go to round one and order one type of liquor.

637
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,210
They're ordering us around even for our company dinner.

638
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,570
It feels like an extension of work time, but we don't get paid for overtime!

639
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,530
But you even expect me to laugh? Why should I?

640
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,660
Oddly, I understand what you're saying.

641
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,240
Senior, I waited for you.

642
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,870
- Why?
- We couldn't talk properly yesterday or today.

643
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,860
Time for mutual consultation.

644
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,640
Time for mutual consultation, my foot...

645
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,720
Hold on.

646
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,090
I won't keep you for too long.

647
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,640
Since people will get suspicious if they realize we've both gone missing.

648
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,160
Probably not.

649
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,320
Everyone's drunk and they all think there's a zero chance between us.

650
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,770
Oh.

651
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,070
Now that I think about it, it's amazing.

652
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,810
You and I also thought that until a few days ago.

653
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,020
That's right.

654
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,200
Since you even cried and bawled about another girl until a few days ago.

655
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,500
When did I ever cry and bawl—

656
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,360
I guess I did.

657
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,300
Good thing you're aware.

658
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,930
I have no intention of dating you as a replacement for someone else.

659
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,330
I never thought of you as a replace—

660
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:01,460
So what I'm saying is that we're not going to die without each other. Right?

661
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,540
I want us to think objectively about this before things get more serious.

662
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,760
Whether we want each other because of loneliness,

663
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:19,000
or if our hearts were shaken by the kiss.

664
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,630
Okay.

665
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,880
But I don't think we have nothing between us.

666
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:32,500
To say we have nothing between us, we've become quite friendly.

667
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,090
But if we're not dating, then...

668
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:39,340
Of course, we're not dating.

669
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,140
I guess you can say we're seeing each other.

670
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,910
S-Seeing each other?

671
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,720
- Seeing each other?
- Seeing each other.

672
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,400
Whoa, Manager Gi!

673
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,300
Serve who?

674
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,800
Who are you serving?

675
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,540
- Who?
- Our a-ancestors! Our ancestors...

676
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,930
But why are you two in here?

677
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,250
This isn't our room, Sang Sik!

678
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,120
Gosh, so out of it...

679
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,720
God!

680
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,070
Huh? Why am I suddenly in the men's restroom?

681
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,220
Manager, Manager! This isn't the restroom, Manager Gi!

682
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,350
- Have you been pouring your soju in there all this time?
- Huh?

683
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,420
Hey, Ma Tan, you must be drunk already.

684
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,130
Why are you saying such nonsense?

685
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,900
Ma Tan.

686
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,420
Come on!

687
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,390
Everyone!

688
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,410
What a great shame we lost the bet today, huh?

689
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,020
Instead, should I tell you a secret that will

690
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,790
shock everyone?

691
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,850
Hey, too noisy!

692
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,740
I might not be able to make you laugh,

693
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:29,140
but I can make you shocked.

694
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,550
To be honest...

695
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,930
I just finished a bowl of chicken gizzard outside.

696
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,590
I was scared you guys would steal them from me.

697
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,350
Kang Mi, you ate chicken gizzards?

698
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,600
She's drunk, so drunk.

699
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,740
But there's a more shocking truth.

700
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:57,570
Our Baek Ma Tan never had delicious chicken gizzard until now!

701
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,870
Because...

702
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,250
That's because...

703
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,060
- Be quiet!
- Come on!

704
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,710
Baek Ma Tan is the heir of Power Group!

705
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,940
That's awesome, right?

706
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,300
Huh?

707
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,660
What is she saying?

708
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,790
Wait! So you're saying he's the son of Baek Jo Won?

709
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,610
Oh! His last name is Baek indeed.

710
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,700
Baek Ma Tan.

711
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,900
Power Group's heir?

712
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,090
There is no way...

713
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,540
What the heck. I've failed again.

714
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,860
I'm going to sleep.

715
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,630
- Kang Mi...
- Kang Mi's drunk.

716
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,930
Hey, Ma Tan.

717
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,160
What is she talking about? Huh?

718
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,220
Who are you? Is that true?

719
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,770
Another person fell for Ma Tan's joke.

720
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,640
Kang Mi is so naïve. So naïve..

721
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,040
I mean, Ma Tan is really good at telling jokes.

722
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,300
You know the kind of cute bluffing that can only be done at that age?

723
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,460
He told me before that he has a personal chauffeur.

724
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,270
That he's acquaintances with the CEO of a hotel and

725
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,240
that he met the H One Electronics' Director on a trip.

726
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,570
- What? Can't believe it.
- I almost fell for it. Ma Tan!

727
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,850
Stop doing that. Gosh!

728
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:24,750
That's right.

729
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:29,010
To say that Power's successor joined Gaus is too much.

730
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,110
Our Ma Tan can really write stories, huh?

731
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,060
- So cute.
- Hey.

732
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,820
If you're lacking, just live a life that's a bit lacking.

733
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,100
You mustn't bluff like that!

734
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,630
I'm sorry.

735
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,510
Now I know.

736
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:54,010
This irregular heart rhythm every time I looked at you, Ms. Kang Mi.

737
00:39:54,850 --> 00:40:00,380
It was due to the stress you've caused me.

738
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,490
- Let's go.
- Okay, see you at work.

739
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:06,540
- Take care.
- Okay, get home safely.

740
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,010
Wait! I don't see General Manager Gi and Manager Cha.

741
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,730
They seemed really drunk.

742
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:12,010
They probably left by themselves.

743
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,860
We should go now, too. I'm tired.

744
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,340
- Senior.
- Yeah?

745
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:23,330
The weather's nice, so why don't we take a walk to sober up?

746
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,090
Just simply without physical touch.

747
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,840
Fittingly for people who are seeing each other.

748
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,340
Sounds good. Just simply.

749
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,340
Nice weather.

750
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,690
Oh, yeah. I heard you're meeting with Georyong people tomorrow.

751
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,400
I guess you'll be going straight there tomorrow.

752
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,830
Oh, I should've brought the documents.

753
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,210
- You didn't?
- Yeah.

754
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,940
Oh, my gosh!

755
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,370
It's scary going into the office alone at night.

756
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,350
I need to teach you everything. Teach you everything.

757
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,610
Must I even teach you to remember your documents?

758
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,480
Were you just going to go empty handed?

759
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,650
I'm sorry.

760
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,950
What will you do without me, huh?

761
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,390
I'd be in big trouble without you.

762
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,490
You call that a confession?

763
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,970
That kind of confession doesn't work on me.

764
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:29,310
I know. I know. We just talked about it earlier.

765
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:35,760
To think about it... objectively.

766
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,740
That's right.

767
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,540
Objectively.

768
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,910
Simply, right?

769
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,380
Calmly...

770
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,860
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

771
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:06,260
- My back!
- Are you okay?

772
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,930
Come here!

773
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,820
Should we go over there?

774
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,290
♫ We're going to party, we're going to party ♫

775
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:38,030
♫ The weekend has arrived, that's why tonight we're going to party ♫

776
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,210
♫ We're going to party, yes, we're going to party ♫

777
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,600
♫ The weekend has arrived, that's why tonight we're going to party ♫

778
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,920
Why?

779
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,430
I'm sorry.

780
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,720
I made another drunken mistake.

781
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,430
Are you sure you were even drunk?

782
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,710
Or did you do that upon my father's order?

783
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,200
Chairman Baek Jo Won?

784
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,870
You don't need to act clueless.

785
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:16,030
I also know you planned to meet Father yesterday.

786
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,580
Were you just going to expose everything when the deal didn't go through?

787
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,990
What are you saying?

788
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,180
I heard everything you said on the phone.

789
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,050
Power. 7,000.

790
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,960
Son. Cash.

791
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,080
What bullshit are you saying?

792
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,550
That bug zapper.

793
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:31,940
The power turns on okay, right?

794
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,300
There are no issues with the power.

795
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,290
All right. I'm buying it for my son who keeps getting bitten by mosquitos.

796
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,780
Can't you lower it to 5,000 won?

797
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,810
You should also think about your son.

798
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,880
I can't go any lower than that.

799
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,790
Let's meet at 7,000.

800
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,580
In cash.

801
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,370
You can stop glaring at me.

802
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:56,270
I believe I had good enough reason to misunderstand.

803
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:59,900
And the fact that I misunderstood doesn't null your mistake.

804
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,820
I'm more than grateful for all the help you've given me until now.

805
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,970
However, do you know how stressed I am?

806
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,390
Look, even now.

807
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,310
