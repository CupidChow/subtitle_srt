will be forever.

Who are you, the naked man at my beloved daughter's house?

61

D-Dad... it's not.

62

No, that's not it.

72
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,600
Not everyone gets naked just because it's hot.

73
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,040
You may help yourself.

74
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,520
- You can hurry up and eat.
- Okay.

75
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,730
By the way...

76
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,610
what do you like about my daughter?

77
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,240
Senior's beauty is as ample as the number of stars in the universe.

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,190
But to condense all that in summary...

79
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,000
she's pretty.

80
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,890
You heard him clearly. Right?

81
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,010
Does she have the same eyes as me?

82
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,300
- Yes, she does.
- Our noses, too. Right?

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,270
- Yes, they do look alike.
- The mold on our butts, too?

84
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, they look alike.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,310
How do you know about that?

86
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,020
Whoa, this is so tasty. When did you marinate the meat, Mom?

87
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,230
It's so delicious.

88
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,610
My gosh.

89
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,890
I'm going to go wipe my shirt.

90
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,770
Gosh, it's so brutal.

91
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,530
Are you thinking about marriage, by the way?

92
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,260
We don't even know their relationship, so don't speak too soon.

93
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,970
What's so soon when he was naked?

94
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,290
They'd marry because he was naked?

95
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,040
Then do people at the beach all get married?

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,200
You may eat comfortably.

97
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,740
You can hurry up and eat.

98
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,080
Okay.

99
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,380
A dry heave.

100
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,560
A second dry heave?

101
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,570
A third dry heave...

102
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,860
This guy...

103
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,240
What's up? Why aren't you talking?

104
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,710
You don't like the side dishes?

105
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,120
Why are you dry-heaving?

106
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,980
You heard? How embarrassing.

107
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,530
By chance, is it what I'm thinking it is?

108
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,980
I can't get rid of it.

109
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,790
This asshole...

110
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,340
Father and Mother, I'm really sorry!

111
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,460
I'll take responsibility.

112
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,760
I'll take responsibility for Senior Na Rae, no...

113
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,330
My Na Rae, I'll love her and take care of her for the rest of my life.

114
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,570

In fact, I've also been for it since earlier.

119

- It's Son-in-Law Lee.

121
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,590
Sorry, Son-in-Law Lee.

122
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,690
- We didn't even exchange names.
- Well, it's our first time meeting.

123
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,240

125

Aziz is asking for you.
(Sounds like "kicking" in Korean)

126
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,890
What? Kicking?

127
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,770
He's already kicking?

128
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,720
Maybe he'll become a soccer player.

129
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
Aziz?

130
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,750
A foreign birth name sounds nice.

131
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,640
Birth name? It's not a birth name.

132
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,000
Song Heung Min... Okay, let's name him Heung Min.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,030
H-Heung Min sounds good, Father.

134
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,060
We'll do that. We'll name him Heung Min.

135
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,820
Okay.

136
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,700
Goodbye now!

137
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,310
Birth name?

138
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,760
Pregnancy?

139
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,640
What the heck were you thinking?

140
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,450
Gosh...

141
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,260
I was about to die of a heart attack.

142
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,370
I suddenly met your parents and

143
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,070
also hearing I might become a dad...

144
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,500
I think you're feeling better, though.

145
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,670
I can't go on like this.

146
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,590
What did you say? Are you ultimately saying you want to break up with me?

147
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,250
No.

148
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,150
I can't go on as the Lee Sang Sik I am right now.

149
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,600
Although Lee Sang Sik and Gaus are not exactly interchangeable,

150
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,580
I need to represent something at least

151
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,900
to stand proudly in front of you.

152
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,790
Such as?

153
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,670
- Lee Sang Sik equals?
- Clumsy doofus...

154
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,320
w-which he's far from...

155
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,540
My cutie?

156
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,270
Sang Sik Bling? Cutie Pie?

157
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,740
Mr. Sang Sik...

158
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,760
Mr. Sang Sik?

159
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,760
You took a good look, right?

160
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,200
But y-you...

161
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,740
still can't tell?

162
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,870
Will you remember if you see this?

163
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,340
Do you remember Episode 1?

164
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,550
I was the one who made Sang Sik's channel public.

165
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,880
It was too good to watch it alone.

166
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,220
I was also the one who posted Sang Sik's

167
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,160
lonely act on Blind.

168
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,070
You can see me eating alone behind Ma Tan, can't you?

169
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,380
I also fixed Executive Manager Wi's girlfriend, no,

170
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,700
AI speaker as well.

171
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,240
But you really didn't know?

172
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,160
It's okay.

173
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,480
In fact, the people here...

174
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,900
can't see me as well.

175
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,640
Why'd they leave the lights on when no one's here?

176
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,930
Please don't pity me.

177
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,700
I can take a day off as I please,

178
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,050
get to be late as I want,

179
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,460
and also eat alone as I want.

180
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,150
It's so convenient and nice.

181
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,380
Of course, I do work as well.

182
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,720
The extremely important

183
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,590
work that only I can do.

184
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,820
[Sang Sik <3 Na Rae]

185
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,160
[Man Deuk]

186
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,880
[Man Deuk <3 Hae Young]

187
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,450
All of Gaus' dating stories are in here.

188
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,290
This is really busy and tedious work.

189
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,830
I need to update it daily.

190
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,920
Then I'll think about it.

191
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,600
Mo Hae Young again?

192
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,110
I don't have any more empty space...

193
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,700
What?

194
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,110
What's the meaning of this?

195
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,540
Please keep it a secret from Senior Na Rae.

196
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,140
Has Sang Sik gone mad?

197
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,580
Such a bad feeling...

198
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,220
as if I left my curling iron on...

199
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,000
I have a terribly bad feeling.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,350
He said he's going to eat separately again today.

201
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,840
I know he has no work, but he's getting off late

202
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,500
and I think he's distracted when we're together.

203
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,470
This little shit...

204
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,810
Whoa...

205
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,250
Senior Sang Sik must really be busy.

206
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,760
I asked him for the meeting details, so I could collect them,

207
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,020
but he still hasn't replied, as if

208
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,980
- he's going to bring them himself.
- Right?

209
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,370
You also find it weird, don't you?

210
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,930
Now that the Gaboss Project has gone down the drain,

211
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,610
there's nothing to keep him that busy.

212
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,770
He should've told me if he had something else to do.

213
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,550
Senior, your expression...

214
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,520
- looks like you're talking about your boyfriend.
- What?

215
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,220
It's what a woman who's suspicious of

216
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,050
her boyfriend of cheating or has another woman says.

217
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,580
Cheating?

218
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,920
Gosh, scared me. What's wrong with him now?

219
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,800
As if he's trying to avoid someone.

220
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,080
Gosh, I have too much going on in my head.

221
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,930
- Senior.
- Yes.

222
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,910
Not too long ago,

223
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,200
I rejected a certain person's confession a little too harshly.

224
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,510
But I want to be friends with him again.

225
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,560
Would there be a way?

226
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,120
That man must've fallen for a certain charm you have about you.

227
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,000
Show him the polar opposite side of that charm.

228
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,360
Then, wouldn't he give up, and things would get better?

229
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,180
The polar opposite?

230
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,750
"My Head is Spinning Washer."

231
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,190
"Don't Weigh Scale."

232
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,950
"You Caught Me Camera."

233
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,730
"I'll Bury It for You Kimchi Fridge."

234
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,870
Instead of keeping the focus on their features,

235
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,510
- we should focus on the emotion-effectiveness—
- Enough. Stop here.

236
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,530
There are so many grooming men like me.

237
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,710
We're not satisfied with enhancing ourselves.

238
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,420
Let's also enhance our appliances.

239
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,050
Storytelling is also important, even for appliances in this day and age.

240
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,100
"Think difficult."

241
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,790
Let's add those sentiment-stimulating phrases.

242
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,170
But why are you guys reporting to Baek Ma Tan?

243
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,700
If a senior whom I spent time with at Gaus

244
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,480
comes with me to Power,

245
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,350
he'd be a great help since I can rely on him.

246
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,590
I'll need to think more about who to ask.

247
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,940
We'll have to make a better offer than his current one.

248
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,000
Did you promise them a position when you went to Power or something?

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You guys flock to anyone who seems to have some power. These guys...

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,900
Also, why are you staying here, taking money from Gaus,

251
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,780
and ruining the mood?

252
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,160
- Get lost now!
- General Manager!

253
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,580
Please show your respect to our staff member, Mr. Ma Tan.

254
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,560
What respect?

255
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,610
Are you trying to make some petty change from Gaus?

256
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,480
General Manager, please cut it out!

257
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,270
Don't listen. Just don't listen to him.

258
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,770
Have you gone mad as a group? What's this bullshit!

259
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,230
If you want to experience the ordinary person's life from the bottom,

260
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,220
I'll gladly do it for you. Should I curse you out?

261
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,720
Your bourgeois head is full of butter, shining like crazy, you slacking little brat, bling-bling...

262
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,800
Gosh, the pressure point is important.

263
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,940
You know they are all jokes. Right?

264
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,290
General Manager Gi might talk that way, but he's a kind person inside.

265
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,450
I'm...

266
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,650
shockingly kind and warmhearted both in and out.

267
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,740
Just quit if you can't take it.

268
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,420
Why are you guys doing this?

269
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,500
I'm just taking care of my beloved junior.

270
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,230
Whoa... amazing. Did you see him?

271
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,970
Manager Cha just showed his back on you. Does that make sense?

272
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,320
He needs to walk backward when leaving, doesn't he?

273
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,850
Manager Cha's the type of person to betray you, Mr. Ma Tan.

274
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,100
[Thank you and love you]

275
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,900
A red carnation's flower meaning is parents' love.

276
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,490
You're my parent, Mr. Ma Tan.

277
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,670
Sincerely, Baek Hyeong Mi.

278
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,420
Please don't feel pressured, Father.

279
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,000
Father... Grandfather!

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,350
Ma Tan! Ma Tan!

281
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,830
I'm thinking about naming my soon-to-be-born child as Ma Tan.

282
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,770
- Which Chinese characters do you use for your name?
- You said you already chose the name!

283
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,220
You said you already chose the name!

284
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,210
- No, I didn't.
- Father, please give me a position.

285
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,500
Me, too!

286
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,280
I need to go to the restroom.

287
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,230
- Restroom?
- We'll give you a ride, Father!

288
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,800
- Please get on, Father.
- Managers, seriously?

289
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,690
What are you doing? That's uncomfortable.

290
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,530
This one is comfortable. You need to care about the ride quality, Young Boss.

291
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,370
Let me give you a comfortable ride and explain to you about my family of six and the two dogs—

292
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,860
What's the use of listening to a dog story? Get away!

293
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,080
I prepared a horse ride, Father.

294
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,530
- Let me give you a horse ride!
- Please get on here.

295
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,780
What the heck is that? Mr. Ma Tan, please get on here.

296
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,030
I'll give you a comfortable ride.

297
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,460
Father, please get on here.

298
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,920
I'll walk on my own feet.

299
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,330
Father... Father!

300
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,310
Hey, Assistant Manager Kim, will you keep getting in the way?

301
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,050
You ruined it, Manager Cha!

302
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,300
Both of you were problematic!

303
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,160
- You were the biggest problem, Manager Seong!
- Nope.

304
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,460
- I'm the problem.
- What?

305
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,840
I'll resolve this.

306
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,690
Gosh... did I avoid too noticeably?

307
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,290
What's this?

308
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,650
- Try avoiding me, too.
- My heart almost stopped just now!

309
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,300
You can't be as shocked as when I learned your true identity.

310
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,460
Are you going to start that again?

311
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,090
Was it your third day in the company?

312
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,560
I didn't even know you were a bloody wealthy family's kid and

313
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,000
- used a stunning—
- You spent 123,000 won.

314
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,470
The boxed tissue you gave me,

315
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,180
the amount you spent at the restaurant,

316
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,130
and the price of the banana milk at the sauna...

317
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,770
I can memorize them because you talked about them so much.

318
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,800
O-Okay. A-All right then.

319
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,690
I'll pay you back as soon as I get paid.

320
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,530
The rich ones are worse.

321
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,170
- Conglomerates have like—
- One hundred trillion won.

322
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,620
One hundred trillion won?

323
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,850
It's one hundred trillion won in total.

324
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,830
That's how much my father has.

325
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,260
I'll pay you back for your care.

326
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,350
Please see to your business here.

327
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,990
Gosh! It's hot!

328
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,910
It's so hot.

329
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,990
Did that bastard turn this around on purpose?

330
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,150
Wait a second. All day today...

331
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,320
He was talking weirdly.

332
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,700
Hello.
(Said without honorifics)

333
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Okay.
(Said without honorifics)

334
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,800
Did you eat?
(Said without honorifics)

335
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,670
That asshole did insult me.

336
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,960
Didn't he?

337
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,290
I think he did.

338
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,700
Yes.

339
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,660
It's uncomfortable, as expected.

340
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,090
Even so, after secretly insulting your superior as you told me,

341
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,830
I can now breathe a little bit.

342
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,950
Young Boss, I guess it was worth using it constantly for the past five years.

343
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,260
By the way, the superior you secretly insulted be...

344
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,160
No, that's really a misunderfucking.

345
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,330
I just heard that very clearly.

346
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,690
Anyhow, did you decide who to bring to Power?

347
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,180
Yes.

348
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,010
I decided.

349
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,980
Ms. Kang Mi?

350
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,590
You find me completely unlikable now. Right?

351
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,500
Easygoing and hardy?

352
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,050
No, those qualities don't suit me.

353
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,960
I'm actually a lot more princess-like.

354
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,760
Did you burn your tongue?

355
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,530
Kang Mi always talks like this.

356
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,540
Oopsy daisy.

357
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,350
This is too heavy.

358
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,140
Kang Mi's arm is about to give.

359
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,220
What are you doing, Mr. Ma Tan? Hold it for me.

360
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,190
Okay.

361
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,080
Kang Mi almost lost her arm.

362
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,370
Now then, the princess will be off.

363
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,330
Whoa, whoa. Let me help.

364
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,900
Kang Mi, thank you so much.

365
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,520
- There.
- Thanks.

366
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,030
Gosh, my back.

367
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,050
Kang Mi, when did you change your clothes?

368
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,760
Is she seeing someone today? Kang Mi dressed up a lot.

369
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,000
Ma Tan, why is your face so red?

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,670
If I find a lady who rejected me already

371
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,780
still attractive in whatever she does, that makes me stupid. Right?

372
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,780
Not stupid. You're a stupid idiot.

373
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,200
That's a serious problem.

374
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,690
I was also like you at one point.

375
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,210
Did things change a bit now?

376
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,480
Mr. Sang Sik, come see me later.

377
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,910
Later?

378
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,170
I have an important matter to take care of later...

379
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,590
Are you wearing red shoes or something?
(Referring to The Red Shoes, fairytale)

380
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,000
I guess you need to keep moving your feet.

381
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,980
That's really funny.

382
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,840
Where... Where do you keep going?

383
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,880
Where else would I go? I go to take care of my work.

384
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,850
What the heck is this?

385
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,250
Is he going to keep avoiding me?

386
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,820
Did you throw out your Elsa dress?

387
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,850
That was only for one-time use.

388
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,210
My daughter always wears that, too.

389
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,250
Isn't that Senior Sang Sik ?

390
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,830
Where?

391
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,630
He was trying to get back together with Ms. Mo Hae Young.

392
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,340
That shitty dickhead...

393
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,340
But why are you trying to go, Oppa?

394
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,910
Does Sister Na Rae know as well?

395
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,850
No, Senior doesn't know yet.

396
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,370
I think leaving is the right thing to do.

397
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,280
So I'll tell her once things are more certain.

398
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,110
Why is it so hot here?

399
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,060
Do they have the heater on?

400
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,200
What? Why?

401
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,040
Senior!

402
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,570
I got you, you punk.

403
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,080
There was an internal announcement like this one.

404
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,250
[Recruitment of Participants in the Overseas Training Program at Gaus Electronics' Indian Corporation]

405
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,870
The Indian Corporation is nefarious for the amount of work,

406
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,480
but they said people acknowledge you after doing it once.

407
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,420
So I wrote a post on the community,

408
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,500
asking for an experienced person to give me some tips.

409
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,790
Are you saying the people who answered

410
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,490
- just had to be all Ms. Hae Young's boyfriends or something?
- Yes.

411
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,450
Hae Young's ex told the current boyfriends about having been there.

412
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,960
But Hae Young's current boyfriends told Sang Sik to

413
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,790
talk to me in person because it's hard to explain.

414
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,720
You be quiet over there. All right?

415
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,420
Are you Pink Panther? Is your top an eco-friendly sponge?

416
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,820
Anyhow. So why were you trying to go to the project that everyone avoids?

417
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,640
Were you trying to leave me?

418
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,350
No, Senior. I clearly told you this.

419
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,580
That I can't go on like this.

420
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,670
So what?

421
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,860
Are you saying you did it for me or something?

422
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,330
Senior...

423
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,940
I want to be a more respectable and reliable person to you.

424
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,400
[Sang Sik - Na Rae]

425
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,780
Look here.

426
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,110
This has to be done rather accurately, but...

427
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,720
this thing called a variable keeps coming up.

428
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,360
What are you doing?

429
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,450
You can see me?

430
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,220
Yes, very well.

431
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,420
Senior, I've been looking for you. I have a question for you.

432
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,970
What?

433
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,900
I see. You knew already.

434
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,610
Are you okay with a long-distance relationship?

435
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,340
But still, if I go abroad and get promoted,

436
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,540
wouldn't other people acknowledge my efforts?

437
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,750
Why are you waiting for others to recognize you?

438
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,290
Why does that matter?

439
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,560
Sorry? Then what does?

440
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,820
Just one person.

441
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,590
Isn't it enough for just one person to recognize you?

442
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,040
Assistant Manager Cha, who cherishes you and loves you.

443
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:55,000
In fact, I think you're that person to me, Sang Sik.

444
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,190
Before you called my name,

445
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,980
I was just a single gesture.

446
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,690
But when you recognized me, approached me, and—

447
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,470
Gosh, that brat.

448
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,470
Why do they keep leaving the lights on when no one's here?

449
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,370
Young people these days have no sense of conserving energy.

450
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,110
Do you remember?

451
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,370
The day when we mopped the hallway with our bodies because of the spider.

452
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,360
How could I forget?

453
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,720
That was our first physical interaction.

454
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,400
Do you remember, Sang Sik?

455
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,170
The day you cleaned up my entire house.

456
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,900
How can I forget?

457
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,400
It was my first time coming to your house.

458
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,800
I vividly remember where every dust was.

459
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,180
Why does time just keep flowing?

460
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,630
Why... can't we hang onto it?

461
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,910
It's the hospital, right?

462
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,380
I heard that bullshitting is also a disease.

463
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,050
Could I get two people hospitalized simultaneously?

464
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,990
What?

465
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,940
S-Sang Sik, you're going to India?

466
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,610
That's why Na Rae caught the bullshit disease?

467
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,730
Sang Sik, do you even know what kind of place India is?

468
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,280
The capital is New Delhi, and its surface area is 1,269,219 sq mi, which is the seventh largest in the world.

469
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,070
Its population was the second largest in the world in 1989, with 87.43 million people.

470
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,970
In 2500 B.C., the first civilization formed near the Indus River—

471
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,760
Enough, enough.

472
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,290
Sang Sik, that knowledge is also important, but do you know this?

473
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,880
Contrary to Korea, in India, shaking your head...

474
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,700
left and right means "yes."

475
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,250
Yes, okay. Like this?

476
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,790
Yes, like that.

477
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,840
How are you so fast at adapting?

478
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,010
What do I do if Indian people like you too much?

479
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:54,910
What do I do if the Indian women keep hitting on you?

480
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,070
See? Aziz also agrees.

481
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,930
Sang Sik, don't worry about Na Rae.

482
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,610
You trust Aziz Care, right?

483
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,140
Also, Na Rae, don't worry about Sang Sik as well.

484
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,640
Aziz has a lot of brothers in India.

485
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,940
Really?

486
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,710
If Sang Sik fools around,

487
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,410
they'll cut off his hands and send them to you.

488
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,990

At the moment, the joy and dismay of emotions are exchanged

657
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,680
creating a very interesting situation.

658
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,110
- Do it right.
- Pardon?

659
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,430
- I said, do it right.
- Ah, okay.

660
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,760
Is it true you embezzled funds?

661
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,370
- One word, please!
- Do you admit to the allegations?

662
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,730
Please tell us!

663
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,790
One word, please!

664
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:24,590
[Awkward meeting of two chairmen... still remaining silent]
Perhaps Chairman Baek was conscious of Chairman Cheon's nickname, "Wheelchair Man."

665
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,580
This time, he has appeared at the Prosecutor's Office

666
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,470
while lying down on a bed comfortably without shaking...

667
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,560
Due to this reason, it looks like I'll have to stay at Gaus forever.

668
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,360
Now, you're using your father as an excuse...

669
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,490
I can't stand it. This makes me too sad, Ma Tan.

670
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,530
Looks like she left out of embarrassment, right?

671
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,560
She left 100% out of embarrassment.

672
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,400
Are you all right?

673
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,020
I'm fine.

674
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,980
I can lift a person weighing 80 kg without any problems.

675
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,930
I realize now there is something I can't lift.

676
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,810
What can't you lift?

677
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,620
My face...

678
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,630
I'm so embarrassed that I can't lift my head.

679
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,610
I fully understand how you feel, Kang Mi.

680
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,930
Going forward, can't you just treat me

681
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,710
like a good friend and be comfortable with me?

682
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,990
Can I really do that?

683
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,570
Yes.

684
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,680
I ask of you.

685
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,450
Okay, Ma Tan.

686
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:55,450
Then, let's speak casually outside of work and let's get along.

687
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,170
Okay.

688
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,150
Kang Mi.

No. It's Big Sister to you.

690

You're 24. I'm 25.

691
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,160
Oh, yes.

692
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,270
Sister Kang Mi.

693
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,530
But what are you going to do now?

694
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,060
The seniors were nice to you because they wanted to go to Power and take good positions.

695
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,520
I know. I had already decided who I wanted to take with me later.

[POWER]

697

Director Gi, what time did you come to work this morning?

698
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,960
Yes, I came to work at 5:23 a.m. this morning.

699
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,230
I was the first one at work today.

700
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,150
Who told you to come in so early?

701
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,010
Pardon?

702
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,050
I guess you're the only one with a different time to come in?

703
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:41,420
Well, I just wanted to "do my best."

704
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,350
I said, "Let's do my best." So—

705

How dare a subordinate talk back to his boss?

706
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,280
When I used to be at Gaus,

707
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,750
no matter how preachy my superior got,

708
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,610
I just shut my mouth and listened.

709
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,340
How can you argue with what your high and mighty boss says?

710
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,540
Y-Y-Yes...

711
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,320
But the seniors won't just sit back and watch.

712
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,930
As always, I'll try to get used to it.

713
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,320
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Faster.

714

Hey, can't you see my sweat rolling off my face?

- I'm so sorry.
- Faster than a fan!

- Then, go ahead.

Gosh, no, no, no! I didn't tell him!

Here.

Geez. Too bad. I thought they'd reveal it next year.

00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,140
Why don't you also fill your glass, the one at the end?

812
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,310
Pardon?

813
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,020
- Me?
- Yeah!

814
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,830
All of us. Everyone.

815
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,210
All of us.

816
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,530
Let's go!

817
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,410
Senior, see?

818
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,930
General Manager loves it when you come to our team dinner.

819
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,060
Be sure to come often in the future.

820
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,710
I always came.

821
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,410
All right. This is the last glass, for real.

822
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,240
We have to go to work tomorrow, too.

823
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,330
But still, the executive manager stood up. Come on...

824
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:46,230
Oh, yes...

825
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,120
General Manager, wrap it up, please.

826
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,970
Give it to me!

827
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,460
- Ga!
- Like Jok!
(Gajok means family in Korean, but the way he says "jok" sounds like a cuss word)

828
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,530
U!

829
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,890
Our Marketing Team 3!
("Uri" means "our" in Korean)

830
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,000
S!

831
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,540
Saranghaeyo, Gaus!
("I love you" in Korean)

832
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,650
Electronics!

833
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,010
Suprisingly, people don't quite know.

834
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,760
You almost got hurt. You should look up.

835
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,930
It'd be a headache if you requested compensation for damages from Gaus and stuff.

836
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,310
The genuine care that others have for me.

837
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:49,420
Gosh, I'm so sick and tired of the same old meetings.

838
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,800
How many times are they changing the font?

839
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,420
What's on the menu for lunch?

840
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,890
Hey, what are you guys doing? Hurry up and come in!

841
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,090
It's the happy meeting time!

842
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,420
Yes, sir!

843
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,500
Because it's a repetition of the same daily routine with the same people at the same place,

844
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,550
you tend to sigh more because it gets boring and frustrating.

845
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,100
Honey.

846
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,570
Yeah, I just finished.

847
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,740
Yeah, I told them I'll revoke my resignation, as you said.

848
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,540
Each and every day that seemed bearable as long as I endured...

849
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,610
Hey, headlock on Sister Kang Mi!

850
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,990
Ma Tan, you! Come on, you kiddo!

851
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,200
Just because seniors aren't around, you speak down to me, huh?

852
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,970
We're not awkward with each other anymore.

853
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,380
Let's be good friends and get along going forward, Big Sister.

854
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,390
was little by little...

855
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,150
Oh, um...

856
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:55,330
I didn't wash my hands all day.

857
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,570
...very slowly...

858
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,310
Sorry.

859
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,980
I'll be going ahead.

860
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,600
...changing.

861
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,790
I think I was kind of cool just now.

862
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,270
Kind of like a cute younger man type?

863
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,840
Why am I so hot?

864
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,540
It's so hot!

865
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,240
Which crazy nut turned on the heater?

866
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,810
Oh!

867
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,160
No wonder.

868
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,300
Gosh, it's hot.

869
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,840
Couple number one is leaving.

870
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,490
See you tomorrow!

871
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,530
See you tomorrow!

872
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,800
[Gaus Electronics]

873
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,230
See you tomorrow!

874
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:39,990
- See you tomorrow, Executive Manager.
- Bye now.

875
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,770
I'm off now. See you tomorrow.

876
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,490
- See you tomorrow, General Manager.
- Bye.

877
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,340
See you tomorrow.

878
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,280
- Shall we go, too?
- Yes.

879
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,950
See you tomorrow!

880
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,260
Senior Moo Myeong, see you tomorrow.

881
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,400
Okay.

882
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,440
See you tomorrow!

883
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,450
So wherever you are and whatever you're doing,

884
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,910
if you're with someone next to you,

885
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,400
don't worry and just sleep tonight.

886
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,540
And we'll...

887
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,510
see you tomorrow.

893
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:55,820
Is everyone here?

894
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,430
Hurry up and come.

895
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,960
Oh, coming.

896
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,380
Okay... our new recruit!

897
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,090
- What the heck?
- Aziz!

898
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:16,480
Nice to meet you. I'm Aziz.

899
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,950
I look forward to working with you.

900
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,280
I used to live with Sang Sik before

901
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,600
and now that Sang Sik is living with Na Rae,

902
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,640
I'm living with Ma Tan.

903
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,180
Mr. Aziz.

904
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,190
You should call me "senior" at work.

905
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,140
That's a bias.

906
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,820
Age takes precedence in Korea.

907
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,060
Assistant Managers Sang Sik and Na Rae, and other seniors...

908
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,400
I'll be sure to train him hard.

909
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,140
If you look, Ma Tan is the worst old fogey around here.

910
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,450
Can you speak English?

911
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,060
Yes, I can. How can I help you?

912
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,010
No, thank you.

913
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,070
Okay, let's go Junior Aziz.

914
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,370
Whoa, pretty tough.

915
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,140
Ow. Senior M-Ma Tan...

916
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,650
Everyone, gather around!

917
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,870
Gosh, what a hassle. Why are you making me wear a jacket, too?

918
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:06,420
What are we recording today?

919
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,920
The PR clip for Dae Sik 2 launch.

920
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,600
Sang Sik is so excited because he's getting quite a few clicks on his channel.

921
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,050
I had no idea he'd keep it up this long.

922
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,590
- Will we get to finish today?
- Ready, begin!
