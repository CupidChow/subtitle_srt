00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,740
Don't do it.

167
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,710
Today's sentence, "don't try hard."

168
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,860
Anyone can try hard.

169
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,790
We need to do a good job.

170
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,240
To survive this reorganization,

171
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,660
we must recover our good name no matter what.

172
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,520
It was already at rock bottom from the start.

173
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,980
Do we even have a good name to recover?

174
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,460
Okay, I admit that's true.

175
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,440
Yes, we're at rock bottom, but I'm saying somebody will dig a hole at rock bottom.

176
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,750
While some other person is making an underground bunker.

177
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,800
"One who has tied a knot must untie it."

178
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,560
I'll have the person who dug the hole fill it up himself.

179
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,170
What are you doing? Speak, Mr. Pro-Japanese Group.

180
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,620
Pro-Japanese—

181
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,390
You're a murderer who gave Chairman a balloon funeral...

182
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,690
Come on, don't be fighting now.

183
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,390
I, Cha Wa Wa, shall try to recover our losses.

184
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,320
It's a marketing idea that can draw out participation from the MZ generation.

185
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,640
Hey, hand this out, all right?

186
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,810
What year is it right now?

187
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,600
It's 2022, is it not?

188
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,750
22!

189
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,480
Hereby commemorating the double two,

190
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,800
I propose a concept of a double's party

191
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,060
where we give discounts on all of our products only to couples.

192
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,800
We make them perform missions that confirm a couple's relationship and...

193
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,620
lead them on smoothly onto purchases as well.

194
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,810
By the way, how are we to know if two people are really a couple?

195
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,460
Can't we confirm it with a light kiss?

196
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,900
Whoa, good idea!

197
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,740
A light kiss probably won't work, though.

198
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,900
Why not?

199
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,980
Nowadays, you can just about kiss anyone for no reason.

200
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,390
I-Isn't that true, Senior?

201
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,270
Of course!

202
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,300
Nowadays, even if you're not dating,

203
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,310
you can very easily do a kiss verification with anyone.

204
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,580
Right?

205
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,500
You're saying they'd just kiss anyone, even strangers?

206
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,670
Y-Yes, they do!

207
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,110
Does that even make sense at the Land of Courtesy in the East?

208
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,520
We're not some low-life bastards.

209
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,690
Seriously! That's so bold!

210
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,830
It's boring.

211
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,160
See? Even Executive Manager is bored with this.

212
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,130
W-Well, that's not what I meant.

213
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,300
Don't try too hard and take it easy. Okay?

214
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,110
Fighting.

215
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,430
Why is he saying that? That's so random.

216
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,420
That's true.

217
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,260
We always took it easy on our jobs.

[Executive Manager Wi Jang Byeong]
Is this my last time sitting here now?

219
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,160
This is the new reorganization proposal that will be announced this week.

220
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,090
As you can see, Marketing Team 3 is out.

221
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,250
It was expected, right?

222
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,360
Pretend not to know for now since it's top secret.

223
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,350
Wrap it up nicely so that the underlings won't be a hassle.

224
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,700
- Could—
- "Could I block at least a dissolution?"

225
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Am I a goalie or something? Block what, exactly?

226
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,380
Even Chairman, whose memory is shot, remembers your team very clearly!

227
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,820
Insulting him as a Pro-Japanese collaborator and shoots an arrow at his head to blow it away...

228
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,780
Would you pay your team salary if you were him?

229
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,900
Get out! I don't even want to look at you.

230
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,720
It was all fun in the beginning...

[Three years ago]
Congratulations on your promotion, Director.

232
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,970
I told you to be comfortable when it's just the two of us.

233
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,680
What's the matter? We're colleagues. I feel so distant from you.

I mean, we were in the same class back in college...

How could I skip the honorifics in front of you, Director?

236
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,270
All new Gaus phone...

237
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,790
I got your back again this time, so make it well.

238
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,990
You know we have to strike before Power does, right?

239
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,950
Yes, as soon as the retest results of the new battery come out...

- Well—
- And the U.S. branch transfer you were talking about.

243
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,520
I'll try to talk about it to the higher-ups if you wrap this one up nicely.

244
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,210
Okay?

245
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:48,900
- If you can just do that—
- Gosh, I'm more thankful to you than you're to me.

246
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,780
What favor? I was able to come up this far, thanks to you in some way.

247
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,590
As of now, every employee of the Marketing Team 3 is suspicious.

248
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,980
So I'll need more detailed data than what we have now.

249
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,820
There are no issues with Power.

250
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,060
Power?

251
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,890
One second.

252
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,210
You should also think about your son.

253
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,440
I can't compromise anymore.

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,230
Could Ms. Kang Mi have been...

255

Okay.

Let's meet at 7,000. Cash.

257

Shall we meet at the four-way in front of Ojak?

258
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,750
The time of the meeting will be about 8:00 p.m.

Yes. The awkward acting and absurd coincidence.

Could she have been planning this from the beginning?

She apparently got lighter by working out three hours a day.

I guess her mouth also lightened.

277

Naturally, while enjoying exercising, she mastered various martial arts like

Everything else about her points to Power.

Wouldn't it look nicer to hand in one more

- Bingo!

Prior to the reorganization, wouldn't it be

327
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,590
good to appeal to the board so that they think,

"Whoa, these guys really worked hard," right?

But you dropped it for lacking practicality, General Manager.

That's why it's perfect as a sacrificial card.

If we submit that nonsense together with this one,

we can create a clear contrast.

00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,540
The limited edition jacket.

484
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,820
Well, you do have good taste.

485
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,670
But I'm not an uncle yet—

486

- Never mind.
- Come on!

487
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,150
Let me wear it just once.

488
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,330
It was fitted to my body size, so it probably won't fit you.

489
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,560
I can just tell that it's going to fit.

I can give you the number of the person in charge of the brand...

I'm fine. Don't worry.

00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,110
Man, I was worried.

509
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,420
Thanks for worrying, Aziz.

510
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,810
That's a bias!

511
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,090
Aziz was just worried he wouldn't finish his gig on time.

512
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,100
I steamed that spot, so I could peel garlic.

Hurry!

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,910
Yeah, on the blind date.

523
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,190
Sang Sik, are you thinking about becoming polyamorous like Hae Young?

524
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,260
It's impossible with your face.

525
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,830
How could you leave Na Rae to meet another woman?

526
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,500
I told you nothing's going on with Senior.

527
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,710
You two must've kissed because you had feelings for each other.

528
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,720
- Why don't you talk it out with Na Rae?
- I'll get dumped.

529
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,520
- How was the blind date?
- I was dumped.

530
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,800
Do you want to at least "peel" the garlic, Sang Sik?
(Same word as "dumped.")

531
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,600
Sang Sik, there's no need for you to be so down.

- I'm not.
- Gosh.

Don't cry!

Oh, gosh. Let me wipe it for you.

Hands off! Your hands!

Yeah, take this chance to cry your heart out. Cry it out.

I said, don't touch me!

After that day, your face was all I thought about

Don't make up your mind.

♫ 'Cuz you're my everything, and tell me every day, day ♫

806
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,510
Your house is quite micro...

807
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:20,560
There's nothing inconvenient for living alone, though.

808
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,610
Here. Change and come out.

809
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,490
I'll be outside.
