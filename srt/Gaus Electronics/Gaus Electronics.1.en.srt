00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,460
I have some more good projects. Okay?

316
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,680
First one.

317
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,910
We open a communication channel to clear the false accusation of him being a pro-Japanese collaborator.

318
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,380
"Is there anything you want from Gaus?"

319
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,610
You want from Gaus... G-Gaus...

320
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,540
Gaus-subarashi.
(Subarashi: an expression of awe in Japanese)

321
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,310
- Hey.
- Senior Manager, please calm down.

322
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,480
If not, we proceed with a collaboration with

323
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,240
Ballantine's, which Chairman frequents.

324
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,470
A chance to target the vices of the MZ generation with a naming sense...

325
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,770
Gaus-Ballantine.

326
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,210
Gaus... Ballatine.

327
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,200
Woohoo!

328
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,000
Gaus-Ballantine?

329
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,750
Lee Sang Sik...

330
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,680
You stay put until the audit is over. Okay?

331

Stop shitting everywhere and stay still. Please spare us!

332
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,910
Senior Manager, not at all.

333
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,820
Everyone, please listen to me.

334
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,460
They said that a crisis is also an opportunity.

335
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,870
So trust me just one more time and pleas—

336

I've never trusted you. Not even once.

337

We'll release you later.

338

Hey, hurry up and release me.

339
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,270
We need to lay low with our lowest posture...

340

Where were you, everyone?

341
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,380
You're... from the Audit Team?

342
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,370
Yes.

343
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,430
My goodness, how hard must it have been to come down here?

344
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,620
- Would you like some fresh water?
- No thank you.

345
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,820
Coffee.

346
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,410
Juice?

347
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,890
We've got everything ready!

348
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,180
Please just tell us!

349
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,570
Let's proceed right away.

350
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Ms. Seong Hyeong Mi.

351
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,810
Are you Ms. Seong Hyeong Mi herself?

352
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,320
Yes.

353
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,710
What we need from now are "Three Pretends."

354
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:16,370
What was the reaction of the team upon watching the video?

355
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,580
First one, pretend to be surprised.

356
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,010
Oh, my god, how in the world?

357
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,050
My heart is still pounding like a storm.

358
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,230
When we were surprised like this...

359
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,870
how much of a shock must have it been for everyone?

360
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,430
Are you really surprised?

361
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,140
Second one.

362
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,790
Pretend to be pitiful.

363
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,840
They say that a salaryman has three fortunes...

364
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,430
good superiors, good coworkers, and good subordinates...

365
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:44,050
I don't have any of these. Especially good subordinates...

366
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,780
My subordinates... they're not even human!

367
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,540
Not a proper human being...

368
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,380
I just want to quit everything and

369
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,390
live alone somewhere in the countryside...

370
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,810
Would you buy me a drink?

371
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,300
Last one. Pretend to be a good person.

372
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,130
Our Sang Sik must be the one suffering the most.

373
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,560
He was feeling so much guilt when it was really his account being

374
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,510
hacked and a weird video getting uploaded...

375
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,210
He blamed himself so much for failing to maintain security...

376
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,410
Watching him suffer as his senior...

377
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,010
my heart really was ripping apart...

378
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:30,340
I heard that many people saw Mr. Lee Sang Sik in agony because of you, Ms. Cha Na Rae.

379
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,570
A person who can't even do what's asked of him nor what's not asked of him properly...

380
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,760
Would he be suffering more than me?

381
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,700
Just who is the one that listens to others with his ear in his mouth?

382
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,260
How could he spread that kind of rumor and give me trouble?

383
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,700
Even today, he kept whining that he wanted to be investigated and

384
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,630
eventually made all of his seniors get investigated!

385
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,010
Should I mess him up, seriously?

386
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,610
I apologize.

Thank you for answering questions over a long period of time.

I do think that I was the one who went through the most though.

395

Let's all take a seat now.

396
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,890
Anyhow, the facts that I gathered are as follows.

397
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,620
The channel manager himself doesn't show up.

398
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,430
Marketing Team 3 attempted to cloud the issue with awkward acting.

399
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,500
To come up with a reason to bully Lee Sang Sik who makes a lot of mistakes usually, these people

400
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,670
collaborated to create a mocking video of Chairman,

401
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,890
and when the situation got out of their hands,

402
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,610
they pretended not to know anything about it.

403

What? No, not at all.

404
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,950
Conclusion.

405
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:57,150
This incident is inferred to have been aroused by bullying within the team.

406
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,780
What do you mean bullying? It's not true.

407
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,540
It's a conclusion based on the facts.

But when did we ever bully Mr. Lee Sang Sik?

411

We never insulted Mr. Lee Sang Sik directly... ever...

Yes, yes. Of course.

Senior, will Senior Sang Sik be okay?

443
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,300
He probably won't be okay.

444
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,130
But this is also best for Lee Sang Sik.

00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,130
Interviewer, one moment, please.

476
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,070
I'm not saying empty words, but...

477
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,920
I really will bury my bones here.

[Interviewer]
Live with Gaus and die with Gaus!

That's enough, stop it now. Please!

481
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,010
- Do you think an interview is a joke?
- No, not at all.

482
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,200
- Take your seat.
- Okay.

483
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,710
Next applicant, please go ahead.

484
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,970
Okay.

485
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:43,300
I don't know about anything else, but I'll never shovel if I do get hired.

[Cha Na Rae]
I don't like people who lack common sense.

487

Was it when I failed at the first interview because of that sly somebody?

[One year ago, Gaus Electronics General Affairs Department]
Please!

492
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,460
Was it when I was transferred out from the...

493
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,180
General Affairs Department that I barely got in, in less than half a year?

494
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,130
Wait! Who did you send?

495
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,710
He is a klutz!

496
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,230
Why do you give us a flawed person like him?

497
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,270
You must be happy to lose a bad tooth.

498
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,470
Lose it and hang up now.

499

My name is Lee Sang Sik.

500
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,980
Oh, was it from when I was marked as a klutz from the moment I came in?

501
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,100
I still have so much that...

I haven't got to tell those good people to leave like this...

No, I said "Those good people," Senior.

Please stay out, Senior. Hurry.

Fuck. Fucking bitch. Wait longer.

Did you curse at Hae Young just now?

00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,020
No...

525
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,070
No, it was a mistake!

Yes, you. Dumbass.

My goodness, my boy...

This guy likes to work while he's tied up.

You're wearing a costume! Are you going somewhere after work?

Who did this to you?

This is what the Seniors did earlier...

I really mean it!

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,310
Please do not report it!

- I must give you a word before you go...
- Senior...

554
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,540
what exactly happened here?

555
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,720
I'll go and explain the situation properly.

556
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,360
Let's have a word, shall we?

557
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,140
W-What...

558
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,650
Senior...

559
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,410
Senior.

560
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:26,110
Did I tell you to erase it or not?

561
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:28,800
I really was going to erase it, but...

562
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,380
it said that someone tried to log in to my account.

563
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,100
So I called Google and they told me to call YouTube.

564
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,410
Then when I called YouTube, they told me to call Google.

565
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,590
I'm sorry.

566
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,550
I'm thankful.

567
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,430
I get to be your superior who has been bullying you.

568
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,330
It was my wish, did you know?

569
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,010
Are we really going to be dissolved?

570
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,020
Why? I'm happy about it.

571
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,640
I feel refreshed down to the bone.

572
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,720
I'll work harder so that it won't happe—

573
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,870
I beg you, please don't do anything!

574
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,920
From now on, whatever you do, Lee Sang Sik...

575
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,230
tell me about it before and get it confirmed, understood?

576
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,730
Why are you like that, seriously?

577
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,210
You said you were so good at studying.

578
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,590
You said that there's not a thing you can't do in this world.

579
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,100
You told me to entrust you with anything!

580
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,180
You... remember that?

581
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:34,060
I have a 4.0 GPA.

582
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,700
Also, I have 13 different certifications.

583
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,450
If you entrust me with anything, I'll work hard at it.

584
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,100
I should've really buried you back then...

585
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:54,590
Senior, back then and now, how are you such a cold person?

586
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,960
In a situation like right now, you could give me a word of encouragement, no?

587
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,320
You're my immediate superior, are you not!

588
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,320
I just can't bring one out, you see...

589
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,320
- because of you-know-who.
- Because of who?

590
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,380
You.

591
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,130
You, you. You, Lee Sang Sik!

592
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:18,560
You keep skipping the honorifics, but technically, I was born early in the year.

593
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,000
So I know that you're my senior, but if you keep skipping the honorifics, it's a bit rude.

594
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,350
You skip it, too, if you don't like it then.

595
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,470
- Okay, Na Rae.
- You crazy...

596
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,810
Hey, Lee Sang Sik!

597
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,870
Don't scream, Na Rae. You'll only tire yourself out.

598
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:33,130
And if I were to be honest, I didn't like you from the beginning, either.

599
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,760
How can you say things so meanly all the time?

600
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,890
You must go to an academy to learn it every week.

601
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,390
Oh, i-is that so? Oh, yeah?

602
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,040
You think it's fine since we won't see each other after the dissolution?

603
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,080
Okay, never mind then. What am I going to discuss with a person like you?

604
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,070
I'm okay!

605
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,600
Why is it...

606
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,320
- What's wrong with the door?
- Move aside.

607
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,740
It's usually a bit stuck like this.

608
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,490
It's fine, I'll do it. Move aside.

609
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,390
You don't even have strength. I said I'll do it.

610
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,390
Why is it not budging?

611
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,530
It should open when I pul—

612
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,940
Runny nose...

613
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,240
It's runny nose...

614
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,410
Lee Sang Sik...

615
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,280
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

616
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,550
You son of a bitch!

617
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,690
Come here, come here!

618
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,180
Shit! It makes me mad the more I think about it.

619
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:02,480
Everyone, thanks for going through shit because of that shitty you-know-who.

620
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,940
Gosh, seriously.

621
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,520
You've been talking smack about that shittty you-know-who for three hours now!

622
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,780
No more. No more talking about him.

623
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,770
Let's move on to talking about Cha Na Rae's independence story!

624
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,170
Love it!

625
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,780
Congratulations, Na Rae sunbae.

626
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,460
Seriously, we gathered to drink in a good mood originally...

627
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,640
Once again.

628
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,050
Raise your glasses.

629
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:27,110
Congratulations on my independence!

630
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,400
Congratulations!

631
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,660
Ms. Cha Na Rae.

632
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:38,700
A word about how you feel about becoming independent, please?

633
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:45,180
I did separate from my parents after living with them for almost 30 years.

634
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,040

Director Choi, the pronunciation is a bit... Chivas?
(Sounds like a Korean curse word)
