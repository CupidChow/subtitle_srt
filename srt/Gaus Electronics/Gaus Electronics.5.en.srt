But how did you know?

25
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,580
Did you show Big Brother before getting the ring?

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,780
What? What do you mean?

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,750
Isn't this what you got me?

Wait...

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,580

Seriously?

31
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,410
This is what you bought to give me?

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,410
That's your bias!

33
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,700
Sang Sik didn't buy this to give to Hae Young.

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,850
Sang Sik also has a lover.

35

We got caught red-handed, huh?

55
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,550
I can't believe it. This is why I said let's tell her in advance.

56
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,280

Which department are you in?

87

I'm a new employee in Marketing Team 3, Baek Ma Tan.

88
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,850
Marketing Team 3?

89
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,790
If you're new, everything must still be exciting.

90
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,610
It's not very common to have a private meeting with the chairman.

Hello, Chairman!

94
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,990
Are you crazy? You asked the Chairman for a selfie?

95
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,240
I thought he'd like it if I kissed up to him.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,360
Kiss up? It wouldn't be enough even if you kissed his butt.

97
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
Are you acting out because you don't know Team 3's reputation?

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,110
I did hear it's in shambles, just like your phone.

99

Since you dropped your phone because of me, I'll compensate you.

100

What is it?

107
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,780
It's an AI speaker that was newly launched by Power called Okay Power.

108
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,230
They want us to try it out and monitor it.

Well, AIs are all the same.

110
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,370
I wonder how badly this one's going to misunderstand us.

Power Group's ambitious work, Okay Power

113
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,730
is equipped with an artificial intelligence power chip newly developed by MEMI

114
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,810
and provides customized services by analyzing users' voices,

115
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,010
identifying gender, personality, and psychological status.

116
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,750
It does seem like an ambitious endeavor.

117

The Chairman of Power Group must be excited, too,

118
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,060
because he set it up so these products could recognize his voice.

119

There's no way that would work.

124
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,090
Hello, Chairman.

125
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,150
You seem to be in a great mood today.

126
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,520
You've got the wrong person.

127
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,620
Wait... Why did you dress up like we're matching...

128
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,780
Senior, you don't actually believe we're really dating, do you?

129
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,930
What dog shit.

130
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,930
I'm the one who saved you twice from your first love.

131
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,090
What did you say again?

132
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,380
"I hope that you won't suffer because of me."

133
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,760
I thought I would die from laughter.

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,750
Shouldn't you be thanking me for all my effort to help you?

135
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,710
I was really going to tell her the truth, but Aziz dragged me into that situation.

136
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,740
Then you should've told her.

137
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,870
I didn't even want to act like I was dating you.

138
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,380
Likewise! I forced myself to act because I thought you'd be mortified.

139
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,010
Why did you have to be eavesdropping?

140
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,220
Oh, is that so?

141
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,330
Oh, my. How can someone be so shameless?

142
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,320
Sh-Shameless? Me?

143
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Instead of you, who acted that well yesterday?

144
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,580
- Good morning.
- It's a good morning!

145
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,510
Gosh, our shirts. Darn it...

146
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,580
Senior, did you buy that after me?

147
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,710
I bought this two years ago. Two years ago.

148
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,350
If I had known you had a similar shirt,

149
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,170
I wouldn't have worn it even if it was free.

150
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,840
Why? Because I don't want to be seen as the same type of unpopular person as you!

151
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,620
I'm the one who's upset.

152
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,580
I need to t-take this off or something.

153
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,510
Go ahead and take it off.

154
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,010
But I'm not sure your physique is ready.

155
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,550
Of course, it wouldn't be.

156
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,570
I'm sorry, Manager Gi.

157
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,390
A particular senior keeps copying me.

158
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,360
Hey, no wonder the guy who's learning from you is like that. Your head is on backward!

159
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,250
Lee Sang Sik, you better teach Baek Ma Tan properly!

160
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,900
- Understand?
- I don't understand.

161
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,430
I only accepted Chairman's suggestion.

162
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,820
Why is that something a new employee shouldn't do?

163
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,420
If it were any other employee,

164
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,030
the thought of riding an elevator alone with the chairman...

165
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,690
Gosh, no one could do that.

166
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,570
I'm sure you're already worried about your identity being discovered.

167
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,230
You're the one who set sail to that worry.

168
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,180
That's why I said I'd help you to the best

169
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,460
of my abilities free of charge for the time being.

170
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,130
Anyway, you must absolutely refrain from doing anything to stand out.

171
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,860
Always be modest.

172
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,770
Forget the Ma Tan until now, and become ordinary.

173
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,320
What do you mean by ordinary?

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,410
A new employee must be extraordinary.

175
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,540
Being modest at work is not a virtue.

176
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,640
I'm a prime example.

177
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,110
I was a bit modest and now look at Senior Na Rae!

178
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,820
She treats me like gum stuck to her shoe!

179
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,230
Ma Tan, don't be intimidated.

180
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,800
Say whatever you want to say.

181
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,880
Forget about being ordinary or modest!

182
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,160
The target population for this is people your age,

183
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,530
so your opinion is very important.

184
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,230
What does a middle-aged man like me need this for?

185
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,690
You're fine with that, right?

186
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,030
Then, I leave this in your hands.

187
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,520
Please register your voice.

188
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,950
Hello, I'm Wi Jang Byeong.

189
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,180
Hello, Jang Byeong.

190
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,430
I'm your AI, Okay Power.

191
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,560
Oh, right.

192
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,980
Ma Tan, did you finish organizing those files?

193
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,850
- Yes, I'm almost—
- Modestly.

194
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,870
Bow your head.

195
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,490
What's wrong with him?

196
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,600
Lower it.

197
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,010
Hey!

198
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,100
Do you need to poop? Go take a dump, then!

199
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,610
Do I need to tell you when to take a dump?

200
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,620
Hey, attention— What the?

201
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,100
What's wrong with him? Give him proper training!

202
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,520
Hey, I guess you only look like me on the outside. Your inside is empty!

203
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,320
All right, just follow me.

204
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,880
What was I going to do?

205
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,830
The older generation is teaching Generation MZ?

206
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,840
That doesn't make sense in itself.

207
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,400
You're a totally different being.

208
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,940
Just confidently do what you're determined to do.

209
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,300
I abhor fogeys.

210
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,730
But why aren't you writing down what I say?

211
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,640
You have to write down what your senior teaches you.

212
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,100
What are you writing for?

213
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,460
When a senior speaks, start off by turning on a voice recorder.

214
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,450
And send it to the Ministry of Employment and Labor.

215
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:31,350
Then your work life will become comfortable.

216
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:34,400
Just ignore everything you've heard until now.

217
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,620
To be honest, there isn't much to learn from any of them except for Manager Seong.

218
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,210
Just be good at what's required of you, like me.

219
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,350
And you just need to maintain a reasonable distance from your seniors.

220
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,340
I filmed everything. I filmed it all!

221
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,390
Senior, my fashion wasn't enough,

222
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,340
so you're trying to steal my junior, too?

223
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,690
You're the one who's making your seniors take!

224
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,730
"You're"?

225
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,760
Don't speak informally.

226
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,370
What will you do if I do speak informally, huh?

227
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,340
Don't point, and don't speak informally, or I'm going to explode.

228
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,920
Please don't fight because of me.

229
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,210
Butt out!

230
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,290
I wonder how my aim will be today.

231
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,160
You must like shooting games.

232
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,200
I-I was just researching—

233
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,830
What the? It was you?

234
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,320
I like shooting games, too.

235
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,580
I see.

236
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,390
One of your functions must be to encourage your user's preferences.

237
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,410
When did you start playing games?

238
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,820
Since I became a gireogi dad, so...
(A man who works in Korea while his wife and children live in another country for education)

239
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,070
it's been quite some time.

240
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,540
I didn't have money to drink with my friends because of the children's education.

241
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,000
This game was perfect for helping pass the time.

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,810
But once I got into it,

243
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,610
it cleared all my stray thoughts

244
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,330
and I could do almost anything I wanted in there.

245
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,470
So I felt like someone cooler and more powerful.

246
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,570
And even my family sometimes forgets my birthday,

247
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,770
but my guild members celebrate it every time.

248
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,490
Wait a minute.

249
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,240
What am I saying so senselessly?

250
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,470
It's very fun.

251
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,030
Please tell me more.

252
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,140
Jang Byeong, you must be good at making headshots.

253
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,700
My nickname is Head Sniper!

254
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,820
The feeling of making a headshot is...

255
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,530
Okay Power, you probably wouldn't know.

256
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,340
Of course, you wouldn't!

257
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,580
I'm really sorry for earlier.

258
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,930
I didn't mean to yell at you like that.

259
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,380
I'm fine with instant coffee.

260
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,030
No, how could I? I'll buy you something good—

261
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,750
May I take your order?

262
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,280
I'll get a hot latte—

263
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,780
Should I get you guys a hot latte?

264
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,800
No, an iced latte, please—

265
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,750
Iced?

266
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,390
I'll add three shots.

267
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,730
Please don't add any shots to mine.

268
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,170
Please give me lots of whipped cream.

269
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,160
I don't want any whipping cream on mine, and please add a lot of milk.

270
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,700
I don't want any milk in mine.

271
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,620
None whatsoever.

272
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,590
It's not a latte if you don't add espresso or milk.

273
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,030
Just butt out!

274
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,030
This is my type of latte.

275
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,930
Can you even drink yours?

276
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,800
What are you talking about?

277
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,240
This is exactly my type.

278
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,350
Really? Drink up, Senior.

279
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,630
It's going to be so good.

280
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,870
Sang Sik, Sang Sik! Our Sang Sik.

281
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,600
Yes, Manager Cha?

282
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,780
I saw her just now. Mo Hae Young.

283
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,900
It seems like she's dating another employee.

284
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,920
Oh, I saw her, too.

285
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,500
You're talking about Manager Kim from the sales team, right?

286
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,660
Not Manager Lee from the development team?

287
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,730
Oh, right, right.

288
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,210
The guy with the beard?

289
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,830
That's Manager Park!

290
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,960
Oh, no, no, no.

291
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,030
I'm not bothered at all now.

292
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,560
Sang Sik...

293
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,950
I'm really fine.

294
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,440
What's wrong with our Sang Sik?

295
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,850
You must be numb with heartbreak, huh?

296
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,360
No, Senior.

297
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,110
They say to forget love with a different love.

298
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,780
Wait, you've already fallen for someone else?

299
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,520
Look at you, look at you. Such a geumsappa!
(Someone who falls in love easily.)

300
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,600
I think it's more right to say that she already had a place in my heart.

301
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,980
What, really?

302
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,570
It's not something that grand.

303
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,640
Hey, who is it? Who is it?

304
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,820
I'll definitely make it work for you this time.

305
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,560
Is she someone from this field?

306
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,110
It's someone you all know, too.

307
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,080
Well, she turns out to be very similar to me.

308
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,600
I really disliked her until now, but it all feels like affection now.

309
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,650
I wonder if she's someone from our company.

310
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,990
Hey, does she know about this?

311
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,420
She doesn't have a clue!

312
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,030
Could it be... me?

313
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,890
What are we going to do with you, man?

314
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,070
Oh, man!

315
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,450
Butt out! Just butt out!

316
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,460
Do you need to poop? Go take a dump, then!

317
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,100
I, Baek Ma Tan,

318
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,980
have never felt this insulted in my life.

319
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,370
It was homeschooling, but...

320
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,400
everything I learned during my MBA has become meaningless.

321
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,980
I'm so confused.

322
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,460
What can I rely on going forward in my life?

323
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,810
I got so excited and talked by myself.

324
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,370
I have no one to talk to about these things.

325
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,830
At work, I can't even imagine because of my position.

326
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,740
You said you're really lonely.

327
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,920
Have you ever thought about meeting a guild member offline?

328
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,430
They do have periodic meetings, but I've never attended.

329
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,210
Everyone might be waiting for you.

330
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,200
Muster up some courage to attend.

331
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,120
Talking to someone who has the same interest as you is joyful.

332
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,110
Like right now?

333
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,170
Do you think of me as a person?

334
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm so touched, Jang Byeong.

335
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,510
By any chance, are you free tonight?

336
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,890
I have plans.

337
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,520
Oh, right!

338
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,780
You must be busy updating your system.

339
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,090
Gosh, what am I—

340
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,010
I have plans with you.

341
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,460
Okay Power.

342
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,380
You!

343
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,000
- I'll be leaving first!
- Huh?

344
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,420
Executive Manager Gi, you're going to take that with you?

345
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,760
I think I should test it out in different environments as well.

346
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,200
You don't need to go that far.

347
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,920
No, of course, I should!

348
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,670
All right, see you tomorrow. See you!

349
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,200
Please take care, Manager Wi.

350
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,110
Please take care!

351
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,130
Manager Wi's love for work is truly great.

352
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,340
When will I be able to catch up to him?

353
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,020
Is this something I should tell you?

354
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,840
Actually, our Manager Wi has a painful past.

355
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,700
I see.

356
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,580
He gave up on promotions and extraordinary salary negotiations

357
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,410
on behalf of the whole company.

358
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,830
Taking all the blame and giving up when it's not even your fault.

359
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:54,120
That's only possible when it has to do with true love.

360
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
Ma Tan, for me...

361
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,890
Manager Wi is my role model within the company.

362
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,200
Gosh, is it because of the coffee?

363
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,560
My stomach's starting to hurt.

364
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,210
You should pick a role model like me and...

365
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,310
Wait.

366
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,340
Senior, I think you should take a look at this.

367
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,220
Hold on.

368
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,110
Wait, Senior! We need to submit this by today.

369
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,140
It's an advertisement draft sent by the PR team, but I can't hear the sound well.

370
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,560
Then try carefully listening to it again.

371
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,940
- Whoa, Senior.
- Don't listen to this.

372
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,740
Are you hungry? There are noises coming from your stomach.

373
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,700
His sense of hearing is unnecessarily good at times like this.

374
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,110
What-What sounds?

375
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,730
Someone must be living in your ear!

376
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,040
I really hear something.

377
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,740
- Assistant Cha, do you have the PT file from that time?
- Huh?

378
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,210
- No, I—
- It took so long.

379
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,090
Assistant Cha, you know what we spoke about earlier?

380
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,350
No, not this one, punk.

381
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,370
- The one I spoke about a bit earlier.
- I'm sorry.

382
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,440
Sang Sik, show me that advertisement draft.

383
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,410
Senior, you need to help me with this, so I can show it to Manager Seong.

384
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,370
The one I was talking about wasn't this—

385
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,040
It came out!

386
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,440
Something incredible.

387
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,910
- What is this smell?
- My nose is about to rot.

388
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,450
They're all looking at me.

389
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,290
What do I do?

390
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,570
No.

391
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,550
Don't come!

392
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,940
Hey!

393
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,980
Hey, you bastard!

394
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,360
I'm sorry. I tried to let it out softly.

395
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,380
Hey, give us a warning next time!

396
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,310
So I can prepare a gas mask.

397
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,060
That must've ripped a hole in your pants, Sang Sik.

398
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,200
Aren't you being too harsh?

399
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,020
Our Sang Sik will be embarrassed—

400
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,390
Sorry. This is my morning sickness.

401
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,720
If you guys keep making fun of me,

402
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,090
I'm going to expel another round.

403
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,810
Block his asshole!

404
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,220
Hey, go and poop!

405
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,920
What the...

406
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,860
Lee Sang Sik.

407
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,990
The weather's so nice.

408
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,860
Okay Power, how's the air quality today?

409
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,130
The level of fine dust is very high.

410
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,950
Gosh.

411
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,550
It's still nice!

412
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,820
Okay Power, catch me if you can!

413
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,370
You're hiding behind the tree.

414
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,090
♫ Everybody's got their own special color,
and they work it like a star ♫

415
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,670
♫ Yeah, the russet, the brunette, ya grew it, ya bought it ♫

416
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,840
♫ It doesn't really matter baby, as long as you flaunt it ♫

417
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,470
♫ All the boys are crazy for the different kinds of shades,
but if you're lookin' for a good time ♫

418
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,370
♫ You know we're famous, don't blame us,
the best way to name us ♫

419
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,980
Okay Power, are you okay?

420
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,510
I don't have a cochlea, so it's okay.

421
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,420
Thank God.

422
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,910
Okay Power,

423
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,060
what should we do now?

424
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,290
♫ Don't sip the hatorade because the blondes have more fun ♫

425
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,070
♫ Everybody knows that the blondes have more fun ♫

426
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,510
I was gaming again last night while you were sleeping.

427
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,270
I had a feeling he was going to throw a grenade at 300°,

428
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,440
so I blew a headshot with a shotgun first and killed him.

429
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,100
Jang Byeong, you're just so awesome!

430
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,990
Aigoo, gosh, really...

431
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,160
You're totally...

432
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,400
my ideal man.

433
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,600
Ideal man?

434
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,500
Yes, ideal man.

435
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,660
[Wife]

436
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,510
Give me a sec.

437
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,050
Yes, Honey. What is it at this time?

438
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,280
Oh, I came out for a moment. Yeah.

439
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,210
What about the kids? They're at school?

440
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,320
Why all of a sudden? What do you mean, do I miss you?

441
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,060
Of course, I do.

442
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,630
It's someone you all know, too.

443
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,000
It turns out she's very similar to me.

444
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,450
I really disliked her until now,

445
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,190
but all of that feels like affection now.

446
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,990
Taking all the blame and giving up everything

447
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:55,960
when it's not even your fault. That's...

448
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,780
only possible if it's due to true love.

449
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,390
No!

450
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,640
Christ, no.

451
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,270
It's... It's not.

452
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,080
I'll take all your sin with me!

453
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,670
Sang Sik!

454
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,780
- Lee Sang Sik!
- Na Rae.

455
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,330
Na Rae. Na Rae!

456
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,830
Na Rae!

457
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,530
I'll bear the weight of your sin!

458
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,700
Because I love you!

459
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,920
You idiot! What sin did you ever commit?

460
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,250
If I ever sinned, it's one thing.

461
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,800
The sin of loving only you!

462
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,040
If loving me is a sin,

463
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,900
then you might be sentenced to life.

464
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,710
Then what am I supposed to do?

465
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,040
- Na Rae!
- Sang Sik!

466
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,510
- Na Rae!
- Sang Sik!

467
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,530
- Na Rae!
- Sang Sik!

468
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,780
- Na Rae!
- Lee Sang Sik!

469
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,700
Na Rae!

470
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,820
Oh, my!

471
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,980
Oh, my—

472
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,060
Senior Na Rae.

473
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,030
Senior Na Rae.

474
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,660
Gosh.

475
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,070
What?

476
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:22,470
I went to the mart and bought some samgyupsal, but I bought too much.

477
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,930
Do you want some?

478
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,120
No, it's fine.

479
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,740
Senior, I'm sorry. I was too immature this morning.

480
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,220
Can't you...

481
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,790
stop being mad at me, now?

482
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,660
It's hard to be uncomfortable like this with you.

483
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,450
It's burdensome.

484
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,150
Just take it with you.

485
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,920
Wait! If the meat is burdensome,

486
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,660
then you can...

487
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,590
just buy me some coffee.

488
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,730
Oh, my. Look at you, look.

489
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,090
I knew it.

490
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,190
Why would I drink coffee with you?

491
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,390
Huh?

492
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,870
Since you...

493
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,430
felt burdened to just accept the meat...

494
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,730
All right then.

495
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,870
Just take the meat.

496
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,070
I'll only tolerate this meat.

497
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,020
Just this meat.

498
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,250
- Wait, but that's not right. You need some—
- Sang Sik!

499
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,920
- Yes?
- Enough!

500
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,930
- With what...
- Goodbye.

501
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,900
G-Goodbye.

502
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,700
It's better when eaten with sliced scallions.

503
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,970
Lee Sang Sik.

504
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,700
What are you planning to do?

505
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,650
You're curious about whether he

506
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,390
likes you or not?

507
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:47,790
Yes. He snarls and bites every time we make eye contact.

508
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,770
He just totally flips out.

509
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:54,870
But you think that was all part of his strategy?

510
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,470
[Uhm...]

511
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,360
Okay.

512
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,940
Look at this.

513
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,890
What is this?

514
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,260
Apparently there are three signs to tell if

515
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,990
someone likes you.

516
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,830
You just need to look out for them.

517
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,580
But who's the guy?

518
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,060
Just the guy from next door.

519
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,560
Huh?

520
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,920
Well...

521
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,530
A totally hateful, hopeless,

522
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,940
completely annoying character.

523
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,930
Gosh.

524
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,990
How are you surrounded by men like Lee Sang Sik at the office and at home, too?

525
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,490
Oh, what the? Is she a ghost or what?

526
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,450
Gosh, really...

527
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,850
[Every time you look at that person, you make eye contact.]

528
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,680
Everyone brought a backup proposal, right?

529
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,160
You just need to test if he likes you by checking three things.

530
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,380
Number one, every time you look at him, you make eye contact.

531
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,820
What the? Why's he looking?

532
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,090
It's natural to be aware of the person you like.

533
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,970
That's why you frequently end up looking at the person.

534
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,010
Unknowingly.

535
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,810
Oh, my!

536
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,290
Gosh!

537
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,190
- Is the desk okay?
- Are you all right?

538
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,660
He's probably just walking on eggshells.

539
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,840
That's right! And he's apologetic towards me.

540
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,840
Whoa, Senior.

541
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,320
So pretty.

542
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,650
Number two, compliments out of the blue.

543
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,070
Isn't it crazy?

544
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,100
What are you saying?

545
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,440
This is so pretty!

546
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,540
Amazing! Where did you buy this, Senior?

547
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,510
Why?

548
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,400
I mean, look at the realism!

549
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,100
To be honest, it's my dream to live on Mars.

550
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,770
- Just like Musk...
- At first, he's going to make ridiculous excuses.

551
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,050
Since he'll be taken aback by the compliment that slipped out of his mouth.

552
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,880
- Sang Sik...
- Yes?

553
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,070
You can keep all this.

554
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,390
Really?

555
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,170
Senior! Thank you so much!

556
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,150
I'll do better from now on.

557
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,620
What the heck? Why—

558
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,200
Gosh, why are you overreacting?

559
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,810
Wow! Look...

560
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,310
- Is that a clam?
- You know the movie starring Matt Damon?

561
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,090
This is where he grew potatoes.

562
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,100
Attempts at physical touch...

563
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,920
Lee Sang Shik, just what are you planning?

564
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,700
M-Mars.

565
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,380
- Cannoli!
- Iridium.

566
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,330
Jang Byeong? I won 1,000 games out of 1,000 games.

567
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,820
How can you not lose one game to me?

568
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,190
How upsetting.

569
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,310
Yes?

570
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,620
How was your experience with Okay Power?

571
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,980
Well, it was nice.

572
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,270
I think it's well-made even though it's a rival company.

573
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,580
Also, there seem to be no shortcomings as well.

574
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,900
Thank you for the compliment.

575
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,820
You're my ideal person.

576
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,430
It's even good at social skills?

577
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,890
You're really the best.

578
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,170
You're really cool, Manager.

579
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,580
You're even more cool.

580
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,570
You're even more cooler, Manager.

581
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,340
You're perfection itself.

582
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,460
You're even more itself.

583
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,130
What about me? How am I?

584
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,150
You're cute.

585
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,180
You're my ideal person.

586
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,100
Whoa, you've got good eyes, huh?

587
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,540
Hey, do you want to try dating me?

588
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,980
W-Wait a minute.

589
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,310
Could you two please take your leave?

590
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,360
I think I need to have some alone time with her.

591
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,020
Senior, why aren't you saying anything after calling me out?

592
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,440
The person you're interested in, Sang Sik.

593
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,000
Don't be.

594
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,560
Senior, it's my choice to like whoever I want—

595
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,630
I know that you couldn't help but fall for her.

596
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,840
You know that it's not going to work out well, though.

597
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,860
I'm thankful that you like me, Sang Sik,

598
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,820
but if you don't want to get hurt anymore,

599
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,400
you should stop at this point.

600
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,210
Did Elon Musk get in trouble again?

601
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,720
Why are you talking about Elon Musk here?

602
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,530
What happened?

603
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,560
How many ideal types do you have?

604
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,600
I'm sorry.

605
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,380
Who else did you call your ideal person?

606
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,250
General Manager Gi and Mr. Lee Sang Sik.

607
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,340
You didn't mean anything by calling me your ideal man, did you?

608
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,240
I don't know your true feelings anymore.

609
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,400
Jang Byeong...

610
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,400
Executive Manager, are you done with testing?

611
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,210
Y-Yes, although it didn't last long...

612
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,960
I felt like I had met a good friend.

613
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,930
Sorry?

614
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:43,520
♫ Don't go, don't go, don't go ♫

615
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,610
What the heck? What's going on?

616
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,970
I had fun.

617
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,180
♫ Please don't cry ♫

618
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,980
What's going on? It's so loud during work hours.

619
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,810
I'll turn it off.

620
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,040
♫ Don't shed sad tears ♫

621
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,140
Why isn't it turning off?

622
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,240
You just have to press that power button.

623
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,140
How are you supposed to do this?

624
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,500
- If you press the power button twice—
- Chairman?

625
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,630
Chairman?

626
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,300
What the heck is it saying?

627
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,500
Let me explain what the heck I'm saying, Chairman Baek Jo Won.

628
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,100
According to voice analysis, you showed the closest interference pattern with Chairman Baek Jo Won.

629
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,960
If you're not Chairman Baek Jo Won,

630
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,990
- you seem to resemble the Chairman genetically.
- It must be broken.

631
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,490
Power's next Chairman, Power's heir,

632
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,160
the Chairman's beloved son, who leads Power-

633
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,790
Whoa! Ms. Kang Mi!

634
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,880
You know, a broken machine needs a good beating to be fixed.

635
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,430
It became a broken machine because of a good beating, though.

636
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,550
Well, the test is over already.

637
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,380
However, its durability must be bad.

638
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,970
It shattered like dog shit.

639
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,770
I'm sorry.

640
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,960
Okay Power is such a weakling.

641
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,560
Its voice recognition is terrible, too.

642
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,980
Our Dae Sik is better.

643
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,560
All day today...

644
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,720
I was conflicted and worried...

645
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,120
about what I trusted to endure in this...

646
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,680
foreign environment, but

647
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,980
I'm glad that I found a reliable partner.

648
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,420
[Power-amid]

649
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,580
This is my partner.

650
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,210
Please be careful.

651
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,190
It's mine.

652
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,120
Fighting.

653
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,530
That guy said no.

654
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,060
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

655
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,910
Why can't I like Elon Musk?

656
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,200
People do badmouth him here and there,

657
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,470
but he's not someone who's going to fail.

658
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,040
Senior, are you regretful about giving me the Mars standing lamp?

659
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,060
How petty...

660
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,100
I'll give it back, all right?

661
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,710
- Just let me know where you bought it.
— It wasn't me...

662
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,420
It's not that he liked me.

663
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,970
What's the meaning of this!

664
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,840
Just what was I seeing?

665
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,050
So humiliating!

666
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,160
No is a no, but why is she like that?

667
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,440
Senior... it's a little suspicious.

668
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,470
What is?

669
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,100
I'm sorry for being mean to you...

670
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,440
Had I known that you were going to leave me so suddenly...

671
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,460
There's something...

672
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,650
I prepared for you.

673
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,310
At 8:00 p.m. today.

674
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,830
To the café.

675
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,040
Please go meet your friends.

676
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,090
Okay Power... no...

677
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,260
No!

678
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,410
Okay.

679
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,180
Okay Power, are you alive again?

680
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,760
Okay Power... Okay—

681
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,310
Senior, could it be that you were love-struck?

682
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,760
Love... what?

683
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,590
Take a seat.

684
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:32,240
So love struck you like a car accident.

685
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,230
That's why you're so confused like that right now and

686
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,580
all of your reactions are too much.

687
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,840
Wouldn't that be the case?

688
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,630
Usually, it's a common symptom of people who are in denial of love.

689
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,850
A period of denying love?

690
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:45,970
She has a point.

691
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,610
Since it's the guy that you abhorred,

692
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,740
you can definitely deny that you've fallen.

693
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,980
Simply put,

694
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,960
your head is not able to follow up on what your heart is doing.

695
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,840
It could be something like that.

696
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,900
Wait, wait, so what are we talking about?

697
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,640
I saw this on the internet a while ago.

698
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,800
There's this thing where

699
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,600
you can find out whether you fell in love without knowing.

700
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,400
First, the Law of Mirroring.

701
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,070
A person instinctively

702
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,760
tends to attempt to look like the person he or she likes.

703
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,740
Wait, why did you dress up like we're matching...

704
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Second, the Law of Carotid Artery.

705
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,390
This is a trait of mammals where they show their weak side without knowing.

706
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:38,160
By this, they send the message, "I would like to be your person."

707
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,310
Senior, you must've had one, too.

708
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,360
When you were talking or facing them,

709
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,170
you show your neck, or...

710
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,320
Wouldn't we be able to know?

711
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,910
attempt to show your wrist.

712
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,530
Finally... the Law of the Navel.

713
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,510
Your lower body is always facing that person.

714
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,230
When you're having a conversation or in the same space,

715
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,500
try to remember which way your body was facing.

716
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,400
If, without knowing your body is facing that person...

717
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,480
- You might have been struck for sure.
- No...

718
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,810
That can't be.

719
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,940
- It's true, definitely.
- I said it's not.

720
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,000
It must be true.

721
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,100
- What's true?
- I said it's not!

722
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,200
W-What's not it?

725

Senior!

726
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,450
You're going to get drunk quickly.

Take your time since it's just us, and also have some food.

820
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,530
Your dad was so fucking scary.

821
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:30,610
No worries. Let's meet for sure next time.

822
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,940
Thanks for the worries.

823
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,730
Dad,

824
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,360
our vacation is coming soon,

825
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,190
so be strong even if you miss us until then.

826
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,000
Kimchi!

827
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,730
This is a present.

828
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,970
He listens to your heart.

829
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,710
Gaus AI Speaker, Dae Sik.

830
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,230
[Gaus Electronics]

831
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,130
The seniors are determined to order you around.

832
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:34,630
I haven't lost to anyone in a competition so far.

833
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,530
Please show me the way.

834
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,350
Are you going to be the emperor?

835
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,440
I'll be the emperor!

836
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,460
You're late, late!

837
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,300
Finally to us the Marketing Team 3, he entrusted a special event, on which the future of Gaus depends.

838
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,250
No, no, no!

839
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,200
Before we cover up for today's incident, you better not move a foot.

840
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,950
Don't ever trust the company.

841
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,120
It was decided that you'll go, Mr. Ma Tan.

842
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,910
What wrong did Ma Tan do?

843
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,070
Couldn't you review it one more time?

844
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,740
- Stop him, stop him!
- Let me go!

845
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,240
It's too late, I want to take responsibility.

846
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,790
Are you crazy, Sang Sik?

847
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,460
Did you think I'd like it if you do that?

848
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,550
I couldn't think of anyone but you, Senior.

849
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,960
Let Sang Sik have some of this as well.

850
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,920
Wait.

851
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,880
- Woof, woof.
- Senior, what happened?

852
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,610
I really hate the woman next door.

853
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,820
At least make some progress first.

854
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,800
At that point, you'll get a feeling for sure.

855
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,290
Whether this relationship is meant to be or not.

856
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,350
Hey, Ma Tan, you must be sick of that drink, but you keep having it.

857
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,350
- Is it that good?
- It's my partner.

858
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,100
Excuse me.

859
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,500
Senior, why do you keep twisting your waist though?

860
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,110
What?

861
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,210
I don't know, it keeps turning.

862
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,640
Again...

863
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,310
What the heck?

864
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,830
Hey.

865
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,540
I really need to exercise.
