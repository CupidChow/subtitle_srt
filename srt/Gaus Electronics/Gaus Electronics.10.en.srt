Do I have to shake my butt or something in front of those kids at my age?

160
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,910
You have to! You have to do anything!

161
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,730
It's only two days. Today and tomorrow.

162
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:53,920
Before you retire, shouldn't you get called the Executional Manager at least once?

163
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,790
Can I really be an Executional Manager?

164
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,440
Of course. Let's get right to work by cramming.

165
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,030
First, brand repositioning.

166
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,610
Just as we form new images of existing products according to changes,

167
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,620
you should also do things you didn't do before for today and tomorrow.

168
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,410
Equip the kind eyes that think of your juniors.

169
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,360
Gosh, I'm so scared. I could die.

170
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,120
General Manager...

171
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,840
This is the data about the 2022 Thick Skinned Behavior Removing Process.

172
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,010
The research was not easy.

173
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,310
What I asked for was... the data for dead skin remover, though?

174
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,930
No, it was thick-skinned behavior removal.

175
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,810
Compliments even make whales dance.

176
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,320
Turn into a complimenting machine!

177
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,180
Okay, but... thick-skinned behavior removal! It's also important data for our times.

178
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,060
Excellent! Good job, Lee Sang Sik.

179
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,290
Thank you.

180
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:03,010
Also, launder your image into a generously spending superior!

181
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:07,100
I'm so pleased because of Lee Sang Sik.

182
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,850
I'm buying coffee today!

183
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,570
I stopped drinking vending machine coffee.

184
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,760
Just your thought is enough.

185
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,650
Who said it's the vending machine coffee?

186
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,670
Hey, youngest. You know the Starbucks across the street, right?

187
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,710
Go there and buy everything they want!

188
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,230
This is what the golden bell is!

189
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,140
Ring, ring, ring!

190

[123,000 won]
What is all this? Whoa...

191
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,830
This one tastes good.

192
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,220
I bought this one that you like, Senior.

193
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,250
123,000 won?

194
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,030
123,000 won for eight people drinking coffee?

195
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,800
You said to buy everything we want.

196
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,500
I also bought my lunch.

197
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Good job, good job. Splendid!

198
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,340
Dear my beloved family at Marketing Team 3,

199
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,920
please make sure to enjoy

200
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,110
by shoving and chugging down every last crumb and drop.

201
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,200
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you.

202
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,830
They made General Manager Gi flex...

203
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,070
I hope we have a comprehensive evaluation every month.

204
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,420
Looks like you didn't get enough sleep?

205
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,490
Someone installed lighting for filmmaking in front of my house.

206
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,120
It's so bright that I can't tell whether the sun's up or not.

207
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,810
The one who installed it must've been worried about that neighborhood's security.

208
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,120
Your heart must still feel warm whenever you see it.

209
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,380
No.

210
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,890
I reported it to the community center as an illegal construction.

211
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,140
Y-You reported it?

212
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,960
They demolished it right away.

213
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,580
But it was so expensive!

214
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,820
Do you even know how much it costs?

215
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,530
It could be more than 10 million won!

216
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,800
Wait, 10 million won?

217
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,400
What kind of a whacko buys that?

218
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,690
They must've really had nowhere to spend their money.

219
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,180
That's not...

220
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,890
- Ta-da!
- Whoa...

221
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,020
Is there anything that you're bad at, Senior?

222
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,550
Actually, I also...

223
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,540
wanted to have a lunch date with you. Just the two of us.

224
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,450
Senior, you're really a firetruck— Wait a minute.

225
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,780
Hello, it's the fire station. Right?

226
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,230
There's a firetruck charging at me right now.

227
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,070
- What do I do?
- Gosh, enough. Stop overreacting!

228
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,660
I really need to put the fire out.

229
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,240
Thanks for the food, Chef.

230
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,400
Hurry up and open them.

231
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,040
There's a message inside.

232
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,370
Even a message?

233
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,810
Gosh, seriously.

234
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,590
Let's see what you said—

235
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,280
Is it a foreign language? W-What did you mean?

236
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,260
A heart.

237
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,690
Oh, a heart.

238
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,440
I see. Anyone would say it's a heart.

239
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,720
You two are also having lunch boxes?

240
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,370
You too?

241
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,950
Bon appetit.

242
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,670
Senior Sang Sik, what's up with your...

243
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,910
lunch box's side dishes?

244
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,770
What's wrong with the side dishes? They're great.

245
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,600
This right here...

246
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,980
is a mung-bean pancake...

247
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,770
I-Isn't it a rolled omelet? It looks like it.

248
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,730
It's a mung-bean-pancake-looking rolled omelet.

249
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,660
This is what's trending nowadays.

250
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,510
Also, this is marinated galbi.

251
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,370
M-My goodness.

252
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,650
It's marinated galbi of the ocean.

253
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,520
I-I forgot to eat the rice first.

254
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,340
I-I also have beans that are good for your body.

255
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,410
Senior, are you okay?

256
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,950
Whoa, my teeth...

257
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,470
I-I'm okay. I'm unharmed.

258
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,350
The beans are organic, so...

259
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,510
I bought two, just in case.

260
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,930
Please just have this.

261
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,230
Ma Tan, thank you so much...

262
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,510
- but no thank you.
- Are you sure?

263
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,840
Yes.

264
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,360
Why are you suddenly having lunch boxes, Kang Mi?

265
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,070
I think I gained some weight lately,

266
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,170
so I'm going on a diet.

267
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,480
I see... a diet.

268
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,770
Then you should eat this.

269
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,310
If you want to go on a diet,

270
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,130
don't pack your lunch, but go on the Gi Seong Nam diet.

271
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,700
If you do that, you'll lose weight right away.

272
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,800
That's true. Totally.

273
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,820
Gi Seong Nam diet...

274
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,020
What's that?

275
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,270
You don't even know what that is, Ma Tan?

276
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,650
If you work overtime with General Manage Gi, you lose so much weight.

277
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,250
So it's called the Gi Seong Nam diet.

278
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,680
It's a diet method that Senior Hyeong Mi, Assistant Manager Kim,

279
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,790
and Executive Manager Wi also use sometimes.

280
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,060
What?

281
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,430
Gi Seong Nam diet?

282
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,540
Everyone was using me like that?

283
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,940
I was the only one who didn't know!

284
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,750
No... that's not what it means. W-What I meant was—

285
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,590
I would've created my own company if I knew how popular I was.

286
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,250
All right, let me see, an expert diet company.

287
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,130
What should be the name? Oh, Kill'em All sounds nice!

288
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,700
Oh, no. Come on!

289
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,070
I said it as a joke.

290
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,300
Laugh. I said it to make you laugh. I'm a witty superior, am I not?

291
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,630
Oh, it was a carrot? The color was a little...

- Hello.
- Yes, hello. My name is Baek Jo Won.

296
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,920
[Baek Jo Won/Power Group Chairman]
Since I didn't have much exposure in the media,

297
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,720
a lot of people must've been curious.

298
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,870
From now on, we, Power, will be different.

299
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,700
We'll do our best to communicate with you

300
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,220
and become a transparent business

301
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,720
that reveals everything publicly.

302
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,340
Today, our goal is to explain the future of Power.

303
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,370
What do you think is the main product of 2023 for Power?

304
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,310
The main project of Power for 2023 is...

305
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,910
Paboss AR Lens.

306
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,010
Oh, my.

307
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,660
Its appearance is the same as our Gaboss.

308
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,740
[Home automation system + AR Lens]
Seriously. Even the name is just one letter off.

309
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,040
It's an innovation of daily life

310
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,950
achieved through the combination of

311
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,270
a wearable device and AI technology.

312
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,170
Power pulled another Power.

313
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,610
How many times did they do this to us? Seriously...

314
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,180
Putting the concept aside,

315
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,220
the contents of Chairman Baek's explanation are the same as our meeting notes, word for word.

316
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,870
Someone must be leaking the progress to Power.

317
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,600
The Paboss Project will be...

318

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,030
my son as the center of the project.

320
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,340
Your son has never appeared in public so far.

321
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,100
Will he be able to join us soon as well?

322
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,410
Of course.

323
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,260
My son will be looking forward to it as well.

324
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,800
He's robbing us of our idea and yet he still makes sure to get a share for his son.

325
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,750
That's what our Ma Tan created!

326
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,810
I don't know too well, but even his son probably would also

327
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,580
look like a dog thief or a cow thief, just like his dad. No?

328
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,170
- Probably.
- Seriously.

329
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,440
Or he could be six feet tall and very handsome.

330
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,210
Come on. That's nonsense.

331
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,590
No, no. I heard a few things about him.

332
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,630
I heard his son has a lot of problems.

333
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,000
- Yes, that's true.
- What problems?

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,460
First of all, he's rude as hell.

335
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,530
He's also extraordinarily particular and

336
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,180
his face is fine, but he has germaphobia.

337
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,580
He even has a terrible temper that

338
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,950
especially women hate him a lot.

339
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,990
Right.

340
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,470
I heard the female employees have a tough time because of him.

341
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,670
You heard it as well, didn't you?

342
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,410
- I mean, kids always take after...
- Come on—

343
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,790
Chairman Baek Jo Won's action was unexpected.

344
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,670
Yes. Since Chairman Baek is acting so hastily,

345
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,780
he must have something else he wants.

346
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,990
- Let's just keep a watch for a while.
- Yes.

347
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,440
Have you found evidence that Executive Director Choi is colluding with Power?

348
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,620
I'll soon—

349
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,640
Chairman, I'll call you right back.

350
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,940
Okay.

351
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,160
Please come in.

352
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,390
Executive Manager.

353
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,330
I looked through the documents here again—

354
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,200
Executive Manager...

355
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,520
you know who it is, don't you?

356
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,650
The person who's leaking our technology to Power.

357
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,470
Your balance is terrible, Mr. Lee Sang Sik.

358
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,490
You don't usually even have common sense.

359
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,740
- Sorry?
- For now, please wait for me.

360
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,700
I'm going to take care of this...

361
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,700
so that I'll never have to ask you for help.

362
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,260
Executive Manager, let's combine our forces.

363
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,400
As I told you, I'm prepared to do anything for this project.

364
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
- That's why I'm worried.
- Sorry?

365
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,320
Executive Manager, please entrust me with anything.

366
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,980
- I'll entrust you to do nothing at all.
- Do nothing?

367
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,720
Are you speaking in metaphor?

368
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,340
No, I'm being direct.

369
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,920
Thank you.

370
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,720
Executive Manager? Please don't forget that we're a team.

371
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,960
If you trust me and tell me anything despite whatever may come—

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,430
[Why are you kicking me out? Could it be that you're the one?]

373
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,910
Gosh, who could it be?

374
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,080
H-One Electronics also told me it's too similar to Power.

375
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,690
So I told the Executive Manager, right?

376
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,330
Why is the Executive Manager not taking any measures?

377
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,280
Are you still thinking about Paboss?

378
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,580
I mean, it's just so weird that Power copies us every time—

379
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,250
This is why I didn't want to get involved in an office romance.

380
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,550
Do we have to talk about work when we're on a date after work?

381
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,510
I'm sorry, Senior.

382
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,410
This is our official first date.

383
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,690
Let's just talk about ourselves only.

384
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,600
I'm not sure what to talk about because it's my

385
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,690
first official date with you.

386
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,250
Well, we can talk about...

387
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,560
when we first fell for each other.

388
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,100
Since when was it for you, Senior?

389
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,260
For me, it was when you became my scapefarter.

390
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,250
A scape-farter?

391
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,890
Instead of a scapegoat, a scape-farter.

392
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,050
I couldn't hold my fart in once at the office and let it out. Remember?

393
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,470
But you pretended that you farted instead of me.

394
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,660
Gosh, seriously!

395
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,040
How long are you going to pretend? You'll keep this up, huh?

396
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,750
Goodness, you sweet man. So cute.

397
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,550
You really didn't know?

398
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,060
I was also joking.

399
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,870
You know the word scape-farter just sounded cute.

400
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,260
Isn't it funny?

401
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,160
It's not funny.

402
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,280
So since when was it for you, Sang Sik?

403
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,780
Since when did you fall for me like that?

404
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,410
Well, you're...

405
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,930
cool, bright, and confident.

406
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,210
And?

407
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,570
Also, you're lovely...

408
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,030
smart...

409
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,590
and good at writing project proposals...

410
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,000
and suggestion letters.

411
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,660
Your hands are fast, and so is your mouth.

412
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,110
Not stuff like that.

413
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,520
Exactly when did you fall for my inescapable charms?

414
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,820
That was...

415
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,190
Was it when I moved in next door?

416
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,030
Were you excited when we became neighbors?

417
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,820
- No, that wasn't it.
- I got it!

418
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,000
When I put up an umbrella for you. That was touching. Right?

419
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,050
I mean, yes...

420
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,620
What's up? Are you embarrassed to say?

421
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,160
Was it when I put my hair up like this?

422
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,440
Did you fall for my neckline?

423
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,990
Was it the unexpected charm when I got scared by a bug?

424
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,670
It's when you gave me a piggyback, and I was too light!

425
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,220
Was it when I agreed to act as your girlfriend?

426
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,820
What are you being so careful about?

427
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,880
Never mind.

428
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,940
I got it. It was when I went, "Mr. Sang Sik," for the first time...

429
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,000
acting cute. Right?

430
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,180
That's it.

431
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,140
- See? I don't do it, but when I do—
- Senior, it's a green light, so we need to go.

432
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,640
I look like I'm dying to hear those things.

433
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,010
I even pulled out my subconscious memories.

434
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,560
Are you saying it's one of them or not?

435
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,430
So it's a little vague to say in words.

436
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,930
Do you even know that I was the only one talking on the way home?

437
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,030
I'm sorry, Senior.

438
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,790
Did you get angry again?

439
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,780
Am I someone who gets angry every day?

440
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,760
You seem to be a little angry right now.

441
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,020
I said I'm not angry.

442
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,470
Right, you're not.

443
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,880
- Aren't you hungry, Senior? Let's eat together first—
- No.

444
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,060
I'm a little tired today. I'll be going in first.

445
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,530
Also, you must not be aware, but

446
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,280
I think the firetruck's running low on fuel.

447
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,240
Senior...

448
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,830
Wait, S-Senior...

449
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,870
So the thing is... Senior, wait...

450
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,810
S-Senior!

451
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,900
Senior! You're really not angry, are you?

452
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,300
I said I'm not. Just go home.

453
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,080
Okay, get some rest, Senior.

454
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,990
You're really leaving just because I'm telling you to go?

455
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,050
What are you doing?

456
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,660
The Chairman or Ms. Oh Ro Ra might have someone stalking us...

457
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,750
My cover can't be blown.

458
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,160
Please just act naturally.

459
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,870
You're the most unnatural-looking person here, Secretary Kim.

460
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,060
Is that so?

461
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,020
Should I try taking this off?

462
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,390
- Come over here.
- Okay.

463
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,450
What exactly is Father plotting?

464
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:59,530
How can he proceed Gaboss Project at Power as is?

465
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,560
I thought I'd be able to have him by doing this because he...

466
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,100
is my son.

467
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,920
I tried impersonating the Chairman impersonating Choi Min Soo
(Korean actor)

468
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,580
from Sandglass and lamenting about his life.
(Famous Korean drama)

469
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,470
Right now, the Chairman doesn't think he stole the Gaboss Project.

470
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,310
He's actually saying he brought it back since it was an idea from the Power Group's heir.

471
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,410
Was Father always this underhanded?

472
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,310
He thought you were naive and unexperienced and

473
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,220
would complain about work and quit in two weeks, Young Boss.

474
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,530
But instead of quitting, you're now leading a project that can threaten Power.

475
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,300
So he can't help but use this pathetic method.

476
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,390
On top of that...

477
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,490
- he found out.
- About what?

478
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,210
Your idiotic act of gifting a baseball field lighting

479
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,580
you bought with your security deposit for Ms. Kang Mi.

480
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,160
You threw a 10,000 won container at the Madam

481
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,820
while not sparing tens of millions of won for a present to the woman you like.

482
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,480
"What? Is this all true?"

483
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,000
Saying, "Is it true?"

484
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,170
He was enraged in a musical tone.

485
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,660
My ears almost went deaf.

486
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,350
That's something only you know, though.

487
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,910
Oddly, the tomato here tastes like ketchup, no...

488
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,710
Why does the ketchup here taste like tomato?

489
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,740
Secretary Kim?

490
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,290
That's not important right now.

491
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,470
Please return to your parents' home instead of staying at the hotel for now

492
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,230
so that Chairman and Ms. Oh Ro Ra won't think

493
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,390
you're seeing someone else.

494
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,290
- I refuse.
- How come?

495
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,670
You don't have money or a place to go.

496
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,290
Wouldn't there be a place for me under this broad Seoul sky?

497
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,410
Where was your house again?

498
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,860
I live with my elderly parents.

499
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,260
As you know, I also have my quadruplet children, Mae, Nan, Gook, and Jook.

500
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,800
Also, the twelve animals they're raising live with us,

501
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,010
Ja, Chook, In, Myo, Jin, Sa, Oh, Mi, Shin, Yoo, Sool, and Hae.

502
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,230
Welcome to my house.

503
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,360
I'm fine, thank you.

504
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,360
I just thought of a place where Father and

505
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,980
Ms. Oh Ro Ra won't care or keep a watch on me.

506
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,170
Hello, Senior.

507
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,470
I recall that you told me to let you know if there's anything I need.

508
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,580
Who are you?

509
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,140
I'm Aziz.

510
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,550
Sang Sik, who's this guy?

511
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,830
I don't mind, but as you can see I live with a roommate here.

512
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,870
So it's not something I can decide on my own.

513
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,700
I'm not asking for a permanent stay.

514
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,110
It'll be brief until I can find a place.

515
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,300
Of all the houses, why did you come to Sang Sik's?

516
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,830
Because I don't think my father's people will be able to find this place.

517
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,560
What does that mean?

518
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,290
I'm sorry, Aziz. He's a good kid, but he likes to pretend.

519
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,860
I'm sorry, but Aziz doesn't want a new family member.

520
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,750
I'll help pay for this month's rent.

521
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,720
Staying for a little bit sounds all right if it's short.

522
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,990
Instead, I want to set things straight and clear.

523
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:47,390
There needs to be an order of command for a society to be established correctly, right?

524
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,630
I hope you won't forget your rank and behave accordingly to your position.

525
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,720
We had ranks?

526
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,860
Aziz started living with Sang Sik first, so he's the first-rank senior.

527
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,250
He just came in, so he's a second-rank junior.

528
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,970
I'm sorry, Ma Tan. He's a good person, but he's a bit of a fogey.

529
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,570
Okay, Senior.

530
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,020
Hey, Second Rank.

531
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,320
Back in my days, I started living here with just a toothbrush.

532
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,330
Why do you have so much stuff?

533
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,590
Is this a lot of stuff?

534
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,390
Aziz, enough is enough.

535
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,200
Whoa, is she your mother?

536
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,450
She's really beautiful.

537
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,620
Yes.

538
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,320
I feel like I have seen her somewhere.

539
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,920
Wait.

540
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,100
- This is—
- Is there another picture?

541
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,130
Isn't this Gouis Vuitton's limited edition tie?

542
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,460
Aziz is doing a shitload of part-time jobs to buy this.

543
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,330
Do you want it?

544
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,780
That's a stereotype.

545
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,700
You think I asked to get it from you?

546
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,200
Even the shirt looks good on you.

547
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,340
You can have both of them.

548
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,340
The pictures came out well.

549
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,030
- Yours looks good!
- This one also looks fine, Sang Sik.

550
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,030
L-Let's share them.

551
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,910
Didn't you say you were going for dinner with Na Rae?

552
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,630
- Aziz, your tie is...
- A-A...

553
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,490
♫ Arirang... Arirang... ♫

554
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,320
♫ Arariyo ♫

555
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,770
♫ Arirang ♫

556
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,480
Arirang, the Korean food place across the street. Their kimchi jjigae is good.

557
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,620
Yeah, right. It's really good.

558
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,160
Are you dating the person you mentioned last time?

559
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,380
The one who seems strong but is actually fragile...

560
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,080
You do remember...

561
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,790
Is there a problem or something?

562
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,660
I'm not sure about that.

563
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,960
I feel like I touched that fragile part,

564
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,200
but...

565
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,830
when I ask her, she says I didn't.

566
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,140
I thought she'd feel better after eating together,

567
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,990
but she suddenly tells me to go home.

568
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,480
So I just came in.

569
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,110
I'm placed in a vague situation where I can't go or stay.

570
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,040
I don't know what I need to do at all.

571
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,450
Geez, Aziz is about to pass away from feeling frustrated.

572
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,050
Sang Sik, did you flush your common sense down the toilet?

573
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,340
In dating, emotions become

574
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,840
shit if you reserve them, become poisonous if you bottle them up, and

575
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,100
get fucked if you postpone them.

576
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,820
You've never heard of that, Sang Sik?

577
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Where did you hear such a thing?

578
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,480
From inside Aziz's head.

579
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,730
Whatever it is, go to her right now and resolve it.

580
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,910
Sang Sik. Come on, man.

581
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,610
Is that so?

582
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,310
Aziz, thank you.

583
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,410
Please keep this safe.

584
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,070
S-Senior!

585
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,980
Senior! Senior!

586
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,520
It's okay. There's nothing to worry about.

587
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,660
I said it's okay.

588
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,850
Ma Tan, open up the other bag so I can take a look at what you've got.

589
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,190
Okay, Senior...

590
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,850
Gosh. Be done with calling me that.

591
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,660
The word "senior" doesn't have affection.

592
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,190
Just call me "brother."

593
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,630
I'm sorry, Senior. I've still got a lot to learn.

594
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,660
I also shouldn't have just left like that earlier.

595
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,430
What's this? You were avoiding my questions earlier.

596
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,010
I wasn't avoiding them. How could I avoid you?

597
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,080
Then what was it?

598
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,670
When you asked me when I fell for you earlier...

599
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,510
inside my mind was like that.

600
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,050
- It's just black.
- Yes.

601
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,570
It became black.

602
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,380
You see...

603
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:29,760
the moment was when I didn't see you around anymore.

604
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,250
Wait a minute.

605
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,810
- So you fell for me because you didn't see me anymore?
- Yes.

606
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,120
Gosh, isn't that like how we celebrated General Manager Gi going on vacation?

607
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,810
I couldn't tell you because you'd get angry like this.

608
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:45,720
When I asked you what makes me attractive, you said it was when you didn't see me.

609
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,520
Wouldn't I be taken aback?

610
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,270
But that was really the moment.

611
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,840
The day you got hurt because of me and couldn't come to work.

612
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,660
Senior, could you look at this for me—

613
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,220
Since I didn't see the person who always glared at me and nagged next to me,

614
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,970
I didn't feel like I ate even when I did all day...

615
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,700
and I couldn't focus on other people talking.

616
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,530
I couldn't do anything.

617
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:18,250
So that's when I realized it.

618
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,920
I wouldn't be able to live without Senior.

619
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,030
♫ So that it doesn't lose its colors ♫

620
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,460
What the heck?

621
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,390
I thought you prepared a specially-planned event or something.

622
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,410
You called me all the way to the rooftop and are just talking your way out of this?

623
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,130
What are Venus and Jupiter doing today? They're not even helping, either.

624
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,060
Senior, look over there carefully.

625
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,590
There's something amazing over there.

626
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,230
What?

627
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,090
I can't see because of the micro-dust.

628
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,430
That's not true. I can see well. Over there.

629
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,730
Where?

630
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,610
I really don't see anything.

631
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,280
Look from there...

632
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,290
What? Where?

633
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,120
if you keep going to the right like this and here.

634
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,150
So childish.

635
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,010
Me?

636
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,230
Am I a star?

637
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,140
Which star am I?

638
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
The black hole.

639
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,860
What the hell? Seriously...

640
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,360
You see, the black hole sucks everything in.

641
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,500
It means you can't escape it once you've fallen.

642
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,630
Oh-ho?

643
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:22,560
Not too bad.

644
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,550
I am quite inescapable.

645
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,800
What was that?

646
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
I'm a black hole, you know.

647
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,730
Is that enough?

648
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,400
All done.

649
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,600
Is Senior Sang Sik not coming?

650
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,160
Is he sleeping in a different house because of me?

651
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,150
I'm not sure.

652
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,090
I don't want to be someone who lacks tact.

653
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,960
Then apply some tact, Bro.

654
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,410
Hurry up and sew those eyeballs.

655
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,510
The house is a bit messy, huh?

656
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,730
And it's a small space.

657
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,410
We should've just met outside.

658
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,080
It's fine, Senior. A person ought to have at least one flaw.

659
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,160
I'm good at cleaning, so you can be messy to your heart's content.

660
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,590
Gosh, how do you speak so adorably?

661
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,780
That's because you cause me to say those things.

662
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,480
By the way...

663
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,120
if Ma Tan is staying over at your house tonight,

664
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,810
you'll be uncomfortable because you have a single bed.

665
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,570
It is a bit uncomfortable, but I can just sleep on the sofa.

666
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,110
But my bed just happens to be a double.

667
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,860
Oh, my.

668
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,130
How could that be...

669
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,690
Then two people can sleep on that bed and it won't be uncomfortable at all.

670
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,560
No chance of being uncomfortable.

671
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,810
It's too spacious to sleep on it alone!

672
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,620
What should we do, then?

673
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,280
For our junior?

674
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:22,330
For our junior...

675
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,930
Sang Sik?

676
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,640
Man, I told him to just spend the night out.

677
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,190
What a bother.

678
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,420
Who the hell are you?

679
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,360
Me? Aziz.

680
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,620
Oh Ro Ra.

681
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,040
How did you...

682
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,480
Ma Tan...

683
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,530
I knew you had unique preferences, but...

684
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,380
Oh Ro Ra, you really lack prejudice.

685
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,680
How did you know that I'm staying here?

686
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,400
I'm surprised that you thought I wouldn't know.

687
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,900
So, do you like him a lot?

688
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,670
Aziz and I are really just in an older brother and young brother relationship.

689
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,750
That's a typical excuse.

690
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,890
I can't help it if you don't believe me,

691
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,200
- but I like someone else—
- As expected.

692
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,400
It's Geon Kang Mi, isn't it?

693
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,030
It is.

694
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,840
Geon Kang Mi. She insisted it wasn't her.

695
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,340
- You met Kang Mi?
- Yes.

696
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,140
But I felt ridiculous after meeting her.

697
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,310
I can't believe I have to compete with a woman who lives in a basement studio.

698
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,600
You think that makes sense?

699
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,410
What did you say to Kang Mi?

700
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:56,960
I let her know that we're on different levels.

701
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,840
She was quick to understand.

702
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,820
She backed off as soon as I put money in her hands.

703
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,640
Get away from my Ma Tan.

704
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,630
I never meant to get in the way between you two.

705
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,540
Like the lowly commoner, she is, I'm glad she understands her place—

706
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,030
I don't think...

707
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,210
- it's Kang Mi who's lowly.
- What?

708
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,690
Whoa, burn.

709
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:26,120
I'll get going first.

710
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,850
I'm not finished talking!

711
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,250
Hey, Baek Ma Tan!

712
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,260
Right now?

713
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,300
I'm working out at the gym right now.

714
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,370
Kang Mi!

715
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,560
Kang Mi, I'm sorry.

716
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,630
Because of me...

717
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,600
What are you doing, Ma Tan?

718
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,650
What the heck?

719
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,470
Kang Mi, are you okay?

720
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:11,030
You're here because of Oh Ro Ra, right?

721
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,710
She came to see me this afternoon.

722
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,700
Yes.

723
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,290
You were really hurt, weren't you?

724
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,700
I'm really sorry.

725
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,670
What? No.

726
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,650
She's a very nice person.

727
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,930
You and Ma Tan are just colleagues?

728
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,890
Yes.

729
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,560
I knew you wouldn't tell me easily.

730
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,420
Take this.

731
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,450
So that you don't become more than just colleagues.

732
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,640
You know what I mean, right?

733
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,330
Don't worry about that.

734
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,620
Gosh, you shouldn't have!

735
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,320
Thank you. I really like these.

736
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,920
Is she making fun of me or what?

737
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,880
Why? Do you want one?

738
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,300
O-Oh! I'll just get you some water.

739
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,670
It hasn't been in the fridge too long, so it's not cold.

740
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,560
Kang Mi?

741
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,590
All right, all right.

742
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,750
I wouldn't have taken it if I knew it was money.

743
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,880
I thought she gave it to me, feeling bad about showing up out of the blue.

744
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,570
Can I just take a picture of this before I give it back?

745
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,550
It's the first time I saw this much cash.

746
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,250
I'm kidding. Just joking.

747
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,300
When you return it to her, please resolve the misunderstanding.

748
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,380
That you and I have nothing going on.

749
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,000
She had such a big misunderstanding.

750
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:47,880
What if I don't want to explain?

751
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,030
What?

752
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,590
The light that was in front of your house,

753
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,100
I'm the one who installed that.

754
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,600
Oh, that light!

755
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,050
No wonder.

756
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,770
So that's why you were so mad when I said I threw it out.

757
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,160
But why?

758
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,260
You said you didn't have much money.

759
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,680
Why did you go through the trouble of installing a light...

760
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,010
I know.

761
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,120
It was to mess with me, wasn't it?

762
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,190
Because I kept running my mouth, so you tried to take revenge.

763
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,410
To blind me!

764
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,270
To chase away the bullies

765
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,790
because you were so upset about what they did to you!

766
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:36,100
It was because I was worried about you.

767
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,280
Why would you worry about me?

768
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,340
I'm a black belt.

769
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,360
No matter how energetic and strong you are...

770
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:54,580
Even though you expose my personal information when you get drunk,

771
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,390
I worried about you.

772
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,730
Why?

773
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:08,540
I think I must have feelings for you.

774
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,720
How do you feel?

775
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,440
I...

776
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,340
I don't.

777
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,080
What?

778
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,640
I don't like you.

779
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,010
I mean, how could you be so frank—

780
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,550
Wait! Why don't you like me?

781
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,940
Because my identity is overwhelming?

782
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,270
Because our fortunes differ so vastly?

783
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,350
No.

784
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,330
You're just not my type.

785
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,900
I like someone like Kim Jong Kook.
(Korean celebrity/singer/body builder)

786
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:50,390
But you're weaker than I am more delicate,

787
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,830
and scrawny.

788
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,140
How should I say this? You're more like my little brother.

789
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,980
Young Man,

790
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,770
I don't know what happened, but hang in there.

791
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,630
Sir, I really need a lot of strength.

792
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,770
I really need a lot of strength to hang on.

793
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,510
We're here.

794
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,860
Stop crying and including the late-night premium,

795
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,280
it's 33,000 won.

796
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,150
Late-night premium?

797
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,050
You're here?

798
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,120
Ma Tan,

799
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,110
you're not hurt by what I said last night, are you?

800
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,650
I was worried because I thought I came off a bit too firm.

801
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,210

00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:54,240
Hurry up and hand it over.

963
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,690
How dare you expect complete anonymity at work?

964
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,110
Dream on. Give it to me.

965
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:00,970
- Gosh...
- Hurry up. Give it.

966
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,810
Wait, th-then you can't say you saw it. Never.

967
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:06,390
Off the record. I promise. I promise.

968
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,030
Oh, the titles are written.

969
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,600
I can deduct who's who, then.

970
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,940
Hey, I fed them 123,000 won worth of coffee.

971
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,950
If they dared to mess with the evaluation, I won't leave them alone.

972
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,660
- You may leave.
- Okay.

973
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,220
Man, whatever.

974
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:29,430
I can trust and follow him as a boss because he's strongly devoted to the team.

975
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:33,000
He's always hardworking and leads our projects.

976
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,800
He strives to improve the quality of his work through continuous efforts.

977
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,270
He has the ability to predict and swiftly identify and respond to critical situations.

978
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:43,660
He never neglects his efforts for self-improvement.

979
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,470
He takes the initiative and does his best in his work.

980
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,610
He's a respectable boss and leads his juniors well.

981
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,910
Our role model!

982
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,640
They're giving me a lot to think about...
