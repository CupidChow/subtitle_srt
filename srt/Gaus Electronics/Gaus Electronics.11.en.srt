that one leak created publicity worth tens of billions.

00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,750
So the company wants to try the same method.

156

159
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,530
that might not have been uploaded by him.

160
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,430
Lee Sang Sik actually doesn't really make mistakes these days,

161
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,880
and his work performance has quite improved, too.

Still...

165
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,250

Right, right.

168
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,940
Top secret, all right?

169
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,280
Yes, of course. Of course.

170
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,430
It must absolutely not be leaked.

171
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,230
No clumsiness.

172
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,760
Of course, it might be better to be a bit clumsy this time.

173
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,700
What?

174
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,860
No.

175
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,240
You must be thorough.

176
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,560
You might think it could bring incredible marketing results

177
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,580
like the leaked video incident from last time.

178
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,660
What are you saying I should do?

179
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,150
To keep it top secret.

180
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,820
Top secret! All right.

181
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,040
Don't worry, Senior.

182
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,840
Senior, this is a secret,

183
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,500
but Gaboss's spy I think I know who it is.

184
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,610
Oh, really?

185
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,380
I still need to confirm it,

186
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,020
but what's certain is that it's one of our team members.

187
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,460
I disagree.

188
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,100
I'll let you know after confirming my suspicions.

189
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,950
I'm so curious.

190
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,820
Who could it be?

191
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,030
Assistant Kim, please deliver this to Father.

192
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,370
[Don't you think Marketing Team 3 just copied Paboss?]

193
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,320
Wow.

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,010
MT3 is getting creamed.
(Marketing Team 3)

195
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,040
What Father did just to catch me...

196
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,430
He must know how many people are facing difficulties because of this.

197
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,020
And please deliver my words verbatim.

198
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,360
If he wants me to return quickly, he should give up on Paboss immediately.

199
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,850
Then you can just return right now!

200
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,470
I will,

201
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,000
but I'll decide the date of return.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,440
There are still things I must do here.

203
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,750
And what are they?

204
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,870
Assistant Kim, your speech has been a bit...

205
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,200
Oh, I thought this is how Chairman might react,

206
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,580
so I mixed in some mimicry to make it realistic.

207
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,960
So what must you do specifically?

208
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,930
I found something worth giving up everything for in this place.

209
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,010
- I'll deliver your words verbatim.
- Oh!

210
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,990
Lastly,

211
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,620
what's so appealing about someone named Kim Jong Kook?

212
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,160
Thank you, Ma Tan.

213
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,230
- Give it to me, I'll—
- This needs to...

214
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,960
go to the conference room. Right?

215
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,740
I can carry it.

216
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,610
Thanks.

217
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,700
Ma Tan, by any chance, are you doing this because I told you about my ideal type?

218
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,970
Because I said I liked someone like Kim Jong Kook?

219
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,660
No.

220
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,710
I was researching an effective way to carry boxes.

221
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,560
I didn't mean I like someone with a muscular body like that.

222
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,770
Are you mimicking Kim Jong Kook right now?

223
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,190
I'm not.

224
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,700
I normally have a smiling face.

225
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,460
I wasn't talking about his physical attributes.

226
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,400
I no longer want to smile.

227
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,270
Ma Tan.

228
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,190
Let's talk for a moment.

229
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,130
There's a man who's following Senior Sang Sik.

230
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,490
I wasn't talking about his voice, either.

231
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,420
I'll be back.

232
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,200
Properly answer the questions I'm going to ask you.

233
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,360
Name?

234
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,820
Baek Ma Tan.

235
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,860
Let's turn on the light—

236
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,010
I turned it off on purpose. Sit down.

237
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,510
I'm going to become quite scary.

238
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,730
Baek Ma Tan, the day you came to my house,

239
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,040
I ended up seeing a photo in your belongings.

240
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,790
Whoa, is she your mother?

241
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,990
She's really beautiful.

242
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,620
Your mother's photo.

243
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,540
But she's...

244
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,560
[Let's become someone with Power!]
Park Mal Ja!

245
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,820
Power Foundation's Executive Director and Chairman Baek Jo Won's wife.

246
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,840
That means Ma Tan, you're...

247
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,570
Chairman Baek Jo Won's son.

248
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,360
Right?

249
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,680
The photo you saw

250
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,100
is a photo that was taken at the Power Scholarship Foundation.

251
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,980
I received a type of scholarship from Power.

252
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,190
She does look quite similar to my mother.

253
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,470
That's true. There's no way Power's heir would come to Gaus.

254
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,570
That's right.

255
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,430
Then, as expected, you were Power's spy.

256
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,330
After choosing the path of a spy to repay the favor you received from Power,

257
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,460
you came here to Marketing Team 3, the heart of Gaus!

258
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,330
The heart?

259
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,770
Not the heart, the kidneys! Kidneys! Right here, the kidneys!

260
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,410
- A bit higher.
- Don't cut me off.

261
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,130
Your target is Lee Sang Sik.

262
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,760
The true power of Team 3 and a key player in Gaus.

263
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,750
You tried to manipulate my kindheartedness

264
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,950
and followed me around with puppy eyes calling, "Senior! Senior!"

265
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,100
You acted like a cute junior in order to win my heart—

266
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,690
- I-I did?
- Why?

267
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:58,830
Because you wanted to use this extraordinary brain of mine to complete Gaboss.

268
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,780
So that's why you even infiltrated my house.

269
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,530
Your delusions are a bit severe.

270
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,570
The buttons on the silk pajamas you wear every night

271
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,340
are probably hidden cameras!

272
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,190
Why? Are you shocked?

273
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,500
That I discovered so many things in such a short time?

274
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,960
You've discovered nothing.

275
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,240
Fine.

276
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,430
This is how you'll play it?

277
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,460
- So noisy!
- Detective Gi, stay outside!

278
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,060
Judging by the room, you're playing detective today?

279
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,530
Are you guys putting on a show at work?

280
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,980
Wow!

281
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,790
I lost. You win! You win!

282
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,580
Cut it short, come out, and do some work, you bastards.

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,530
Fine, let's see who wins.

284
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,660
Baek Ma Tan.

285
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,990
That's enough, Senior!

286
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,750
Including this Gaboss project,

287
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:02,620
you know best how sincere I am with Gaus affairs.

288
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,870
That's true.

289
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,300
Going to your house with all my belongings wasn't because I'm a spy.

290
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,300
It's because you were the only one I could rely on, Senior.

291
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,450
You really don't know?

292
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,350
Baek Ma Tan...

293
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,600
I'm Gaus Electronics' Marketing Team 3's...

294
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,520
Lee Sang Sik's junior, Baek Ma Tan.

295
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,400
I wish you would believe me, Senior, if no one else.

296
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,110
Ma Tan...

297
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,830
Stop with the bullshit. I won't fall for it.

298
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,690
- Where's the hidden camera?
- There are none! There are none.

299
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,420
Since I've grown fond of you,

300
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,090
I won't ask you anything else until I find solid evidence.

301
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,240
But don't expect me to be the warm senior I was before.

302
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,240
You're going to follow me into the restroom now?

303
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,640
I also need to excrete waste.

304
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,070
Your eyes make my need for excretion dissipate.

305
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,300
I'll go later.

306
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,330
- Zokerberg?
- Prince!

307
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,770
I came because of the Gaboss project.

308
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,690
There's something I must discuss with you before we start.

309
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,040
Your father came out on TV, and I was shocked to hear about Paboss.

310
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,870
It's more than similar to Gaboss.

311
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:53,450
Hey, you. Were you Power's spy, not an undercover boss?

312
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,670
No.

313
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,560
Why would I come all the way to Gaus to carry out a project

314
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,140
that would have been easy to do at Power in the first place?

315
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,290
It's hard for me if you're like this, too.

316
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,050
I have a headache as it is because one of my seniors suspects me.

317
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,590
Are you talking about Lee Sang Sik?

318
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,730
That's right.

319
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,420
That senior unexpectedly catches on quickly.

320
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:17,910
But how do you know Lee Sang Sik?

321
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,390
Senior!

322
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,130
Did he understand what we said?

323
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,390
Yes, I understood everything.

324
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,120
I was right.

325
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,070
Ma Tan, you...

326
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,160
Shit.

327
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,430
I should've spoken French.

328
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,460
[Translator: Shit, I should've spoken French]

329
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,910
Ma Tan,

330
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,320
you're not better than me. (French)

331
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,070
Good day, Zokerberg.

332
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,390
Do you like Chabon? (German)

333
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,960
I won't say much.

334
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,290
Go back to where you came from.

335
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,150
Was it fun?

336
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,730
Eating with me every day, sharing a ride with me,

337
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,480
sleeping at an old inn with me,

338
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,910
and now, bustling and rolling around together in a tiny studio!

339
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,330
Were they all just like a theme park to you?

340
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,110
They were all precious experiences to me.

341
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,340
I wouldn't give up a single one.

342
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,030
Our warlike daily lives are just experiences to you?

343
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,360
I'm crazy envious.

344
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,190
What do you mean, crazy envious?

345
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,420
Well, you can just start over even if you fail.

346
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,120
Why did you leave such a great place, stupid?

347
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,520
I...

348
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,580
want to live in a world where I can rely on myself.

349
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,840
Then isn't that all the more reason for you to stay at Power?

350
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,440
Senior, could you please keep this a secret?

351
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,800
If my father's identity is exposed like this, it'll be the worst.

352
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,090
I guess since there's talk about Power copying Gaboss.

353
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,580
If they find out that Power's heir is on our team...

354
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,600
Of course, I should keep it a secret.

355
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,920
But wouldn't it be wrong to keep lying to our team members?

356
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,580
Hey!

357
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,830
Did you both get cysts on your ass?

358
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,060
I'm already out of my mind because of Paboss.

359
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,560
I've never seen you stay put at your desks!

360
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,690
Is work a playground?

361
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,630
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

362
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,400
And Lee Sang Sik.

363
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,540
How come you still have no idea with all those years on you?

364
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,150
Did you dip your common sense in corn soup and fucking eat it?

365
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,350
Sang Sik!

366
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,640
You kept going back and forth because of the

367
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,140
Gaboss Project I assigned you, didn't you?

368
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,190
What?

369
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,330
Thank you. Is it this? Huh?

370
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,610
Gosh, Lee Sang Sik!

371
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,570
You did a great job!

372
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,880
We had a Picasso in our MT3?

373
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
How did you put this all together so artistically?

374
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,670
I'll report it to "Capture the Moment: How is that Possible."

375
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,630
That there's someone who's reached a godly level of organization.

376
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,850
Good job.

377
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,690
What did you say? Gaboss data?

378
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,130
Lee Sang Sik, bring it here.

379
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,810
Oh, okay!

380
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,020
No.

381
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,370
Hurry up and bring it.

382
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,240
On October 14, I was—

383
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,920
Wait. What's this?

384
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,190
"I couldn't resist the urge with Manager Seong Hyeong Mi's beautiful appearance,

385
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,060
so I fostered an improper atmosphere within the department.

386
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,060
In the future, in order to prevent similar incidents from happening,

387
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,330
when I'm overcome with the urge to kiss her,

388
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,390
I'll immediately leave the company to secure a cozier—"

389
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,570
Hey, what's this?

390
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,020
My written apology.

391
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,230
Cha Wa Wa.

392
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,470
Hey, are you writing erotic stories at work?

393
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,960
What erotic stories?

394
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,220
I didn't mean to.

395
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,250
Cha Na Rae.

396
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,870
Your ability to screw someone over improves by the day.

397
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,960
Exactly.

398
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,840
Do you attend school for that?

399
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,300
I mean, it was a mistake.

400
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,410
I made a mistake and picked up Manager Cha's erotic story—

401
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,150
I mean, I grabbed his written apology.

402
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,480
That doesn't mean my compliments about Sang Sik were fake.

403
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,630
I complimented Sang Sik out of the purity of my heart,

404
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,870
- pure intentions—
- As if.

405
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,380
Sang Sik is more tender-hearted than you think.

406
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,550
I know you don't really think highly of him, but...

407
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,410
God, I'm going nuts.

408
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,910
Why doesn't anyone recognize my sincerity?

409
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,030
Why? Well, you have quite the history.

410
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,870
Just the nicknames you made for him alone...

411
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,320
This is a previous idea,

412
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,980
Lee Sik Sang Sik!*
(Overused)

413
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,360
Everything's wrong,

414
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,600
Mr. No Sang Sik with no common sense.
(Sangsik means common sense in Korean)

415
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,490
Mr. Chewy Lee Sang Sik?

416
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,550
You should eat after you've done some work.

417
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,980
Is this a bake sale?

418
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,240
Is this a bakery?

419
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,550
And the best nickname for a doofus?

420
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,770
It's Lee Sang Sik.

421
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,140
That's what you concluded.

422
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,010
This child's father isn't Ko Doo Sik!

423
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,900
This child's father is Lee Bong Soo's father,

424
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,070
Lee Yong Deok!

425
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,450
Are you crazy?

426
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,740
How dare you?

427
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,150
Why are you watching a drama out of the blue?

428
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,680
I must find something.

429
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,980
- What is it?
- A way to approach a woman.

430
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,110
Going up.

431
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,380
- Of course.
- The door is closing.

432
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,500
Are you also going to the second floor?

433
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,440
Of course.

434
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,610
Are you mimicking Kim Jong Kook again?

435
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,090
Of course.

436
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,720
Ma Tan,

437
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,190
the real reason I like Kim Jong Kook isn't because of stuff like this.

438
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,590
Then what on earth is it?

439
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,400
That's because Kim Jong Kook is a man from TV.

440
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,070
You can't see him in reality.

441
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,320
My ideal men were all people like that.

442
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,510
Male protagonists from varieties or dramas.

443
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,150
They don't exist in reality.

444
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,380
Do you mean to say you like main characters from TV dramas?

445
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,180
So you want to become a man who's good at being slapped by kimchi?

446
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,760
What are you trying to learn from a plot-twist drama like "My Father-In-law is My Boyfriend"?

447
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,920
These are the only dramas I know.

448
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,990
Are there other famous dramas?

449
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,440
"My Love from the Star," "Coffee Prince,"

450
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,630
"Fight My Way," "Crash Landing on You,"

451
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,510
"Reply 1988," "Boys Over Flowers," "Our Blues."

452
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,350
There are plenty of famous dramas.

453
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,630
Why are the titles all...

454
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,950
Anyway, can you help me...

455
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,410
Brother Aziz?

456
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,350
Well, since my little brother is asking...

457
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:10,480
If you had any tact whatsoever,

458
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,590
you'd help me crack 1 kg of peanuts. Right?

459
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,440
I'll do as you say.

460
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,950
Must I push everything back?

461
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,140
Of course, you do!

462
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,290
Instead of seniors pushing you around, it's better to push your hair back.

463
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,310
How is it? It's exactly 2:8.

464
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,150
Do you know why all politicians have this hairstyle?

465
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:32,490
This is the golden ratio to earn people's trust.

466
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,460
It does grow on me the more I look at it.

467
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,750
It really suits you!

468
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,120
So charming.

469
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,750
Ta-da!

470
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,170
Carry this around from now on.

471
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,410
It's so pretty!

472
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,730
You like it?

473
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,560
Yes, thank you, Senior.

474
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,110
Front teeth.

475
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,830
Don't show your front teeth. Credibility.

476
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,840
No lower teeth, either. Lower teeth.

477
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,490
- Doesn't this basically mean I can't smile?
- Yeah.

478
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,180
Spot on. Don't smile.

479
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,360
How can someone live without smiling?

480
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Elon Musk, whom you like so much.

481
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,620
He put off the Mars migration plan recently.

482
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,130
Right?

483
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,340
Yes, I was really disappointed.

484
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,550
That's right. It's that expression!

485
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,960
- Right, Senior.
- Yes?

486
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,500
- You know the thing I said in the morning?
- What did you say?

487
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,170
That I suspect someone of leaking information about Gaboss.

488
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,600
- I think that person—
- Gosh.

489
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,530
I said I don't want to talk about work at home.

490
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,570
I'm sorry.

You dared to spy on me to mess with me?

656
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,970
But you're the one who was messed with.

657
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:31,470
Mr. Cheon, I'm sorry, but Gaboss costs way too much money.

658
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:35,070
One lens costs 100 million won.

659
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,490
Power's Baek Jo Won is seriously mad.

660
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,870
Yes, Chairman.

661
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:42,960
As Mr. Zokerberg said, Gaboss was never meant to be established.

662
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,560
Without knowing this, Power made their announcement.

663
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,070
I'm thankful, Wi Jang Byeong.

664
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,580
Thanks to you, I intentionally leaked info to Power,

665
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,840
caused serious damage and became a top contributor.

666
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,240
Don't you get it?

667
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,460
You can never get on my level, Wi Jang Byeong.

668
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,530
Executive Manager Wi, sorry.

669
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:06,010
Anyhow, Director Choi ended up giving a lot of help to Gaus.

670
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,240
So this one is a pass.

671
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,410
[Saeryong Electronics - CEO Kim Sae Ryong]

672
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,340
CEO of Saeryong.

673
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,830
The transfer offer from last time. Is it still valid?

674
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,830
Executive Manager!

675
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,100
The major announcement...

676
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,160
will be made next time.

677
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,410
Executive Manager...

678
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,540
E-Executive Manager!

679
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,640
What happened?

680
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,380
What's going on?

681
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,860
He said it's a major announcement, so

682
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,250
I thought he was going to reveal who leaked the info.

683
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,370
What does that even matter?

684
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,160
It's all fumbled because of the crazy cost.

685
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,120
Power would still go with it, though. Right?

686
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,430
They have a lot of money anyway.

687
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,530
In the first place!

688
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,750
Power didn't have an interest in Paboss itself.

689
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,420
Ma Tan, how do you know that?

690
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,030
Everyone there's a truth you must all know now.

691
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,780
Is this a trending drama quote?

692
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,360
What Chairman Baek Jo Won of Power

693
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,350
intended to gain through the Paboss Project was...

694
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,900
his son.

695
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,830
It's a tragedy produced by the twisted fatherly love

696
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,280
of trying to make his son come back to his company.

697
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,190
Are you saying Baek Jo Won's son is in Gaus right now?

698
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,850
Yes.

699
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,380
Also, that son is me, Baek Ma Tan.

700
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,560
This guy is Baek Ma Tan.

701
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,360
It wasn't my intention, but I'm sorry for deceiving all of you.

702
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,300
I'm also sorry for how this has caused damage to all of you.

703
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:58,730
Father said, "I thought I'd be able to have you by doing this because you're my son!"

704
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,800
Manager Cha, would you like a cup of coffee?

705
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,100
Sure. I'd like mine over ice.

706
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,630
You think this is a café or something?

707
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:12,070
Right, Kang Mi. What's the email address of Executive Manager Lee of Georyong?

708
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,100
It's big dragon lee.

709
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,120
- Okay.
- Wait, wait!

710
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:21,520
Everyone, you all seem not to believe Ma Tan's story.

711
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,550
But it's the truth.

712
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,400
I can vouch for this.

713
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,860
I was going to buy a little bit into it only if you didn't vouch.

714
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,480
I-It's true, though.

715
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,050
Ma Tan, listen up.

716
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,390
I'm King Gojong, you punk.
(26th king of the Joseon Dynasty)

717
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,270
You look normal outside, and yet...

718
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,810
I'm really the heir of Power Group-

719
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,470
I am! Right, Ms. Kang Mi?

720
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,340
I really am...

721
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,260
Please explain what you saw and heard.

722
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,310
What do you want me to explain, and how?

723
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,270
I'll explain everything.

724
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,900
You can tell from this family picture, right?

725
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,960
What the heck?

726
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,570
Didn't you say you live at a studio, Ma Tan?

727
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,280
It's indeed a studio, but

728
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,820
it's 80 pyung and costs 300 million won per month.

729
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,560
He licked the top off every time there was yogurt.

730
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,370
Ones stuck to the top taste the best.

731
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,610
So when he says he came to work by bus,

732
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:17,480
he means he rode alone on a bus he paid for entirely.

733
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,390
The reason he goes crazy after coffee mixes and

734
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,380
beverages is because he had them for the first time here.

735
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,720
Ma Tan's hobby is having an ordinary person experience at a tent bar.

736
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,800
He uses a knife to cut a whelk like a steak.

737
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,380
He obviously has a driver at home and even a personal secretary.

738
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:37,120
Back then, when Okay Power recognized Ma Tan's voice. You remember that, right?

739
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,530
Power's next Chairman, Power's heir, the Chairman's beloved son, who leads Power—

740
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,320
The reason I destroyed it was

741
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,490
because it might put him on the spot.

742
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,270
This is all true.

743
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,570
What the—

744
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,500
Oh, my god!

745
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,050
What the heck? My novels sound more realistic.

746
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,560
But why are you telling us this out of nowhere?

747
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,810
I don't want to become a busy person while hiding, covering,

748
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,410
avoiding, and disguising.

749
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,940
I'm a bright person, you see.

750
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,930
It's more shocking than the story about Sang Sik of Team Leakage

751
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,780
not having leaked any information this time.

752
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,040
What? What do you mean?

753
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,600
Team Leakage?

754
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,240
Assistant Manager Cha, you haven't told him yet?

755
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,150
Sorry?

756
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,990
What's this?

757
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,400
I wanted to commemorate that day by coming back

758
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,570
to where our memories first started.

759
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,850
It's a fresh memory.

760
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,290
Fresh?

761
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,400
It might have been fresh for you, but

762
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,080
I only remember busting my butt to pay off my debt.

763
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,890
Look here, Mr. Ma Tan.

764
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:09,810
You and I are just way too different.

765
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,330
That's true.

766
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,600
We're different. Just like "The Heirs," "Secret Garden,"

767
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,340
and "Boys Over Flowers" an inevitable gap exists between a chaebol and an employee.

768
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,490
I know.

769
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,510
However, don't worry about it.

770
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,740
Just like the dramas, it'll be a happy ending in the end.

771
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,990
I can convince my parents quickly and I broke the marriage with Ms. Oh Ro Ra.

772
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,340
- Secretary Kim is already practicing the wedding song—
- Wait.

773
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,070
That's not what I'm talking about.

774
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,220
Then what's the matter?

775
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,890
Can you pull an all-nighter tonight?

776
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:43,040
I think I might have to ask my mother, but

777
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,130
I can do it.

778
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,620
Listen carefully, Mr. Ma Tan.

779
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,260
I'll start.

780
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,940
It might hurt a little.

781
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,290
Okay.

782
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:53,460
Please start.

783
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,320
As a lover, you're...

784
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,070
unlikable.

785
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,070
You're a mama's boy and a papa's boy.

786
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,240
You have zero sense of relatability and

787
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,910
an OCD that makes you vacuum for three hours for one speck of dust.

788
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,970
It's suffocating.

789
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,690
On top of that, your speech is that of an old man, but

790
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,330
your behavior is that of a top-tier coward.

791
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:14,330
- Please stop now—
- The most important thing among all this is...

792
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,220
that you have absolutely no consideration for your people.

793
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,820
I'm talking about Secretary Kim and Ms. Oh Ro Ra.

794
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,910
You should've explained your situation clearly to Ms. Oh Ro Ra.

795
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,100
If you just run away to Senior Sang Sik's home on your own and

796
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,130
say nothing, even I would be like her.

797
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,530
Also, Secretary Kim. He's at least 10 years older than you, so

798
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,040
your rude-ass behavior like that is—

799
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,290
I'm going home now.

800
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,400
Can I go home with you—

801
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,940
I'll take care of things here, so please go on ahead.

802
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,970
Okay.

803
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,330
Please help me!

804
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,170
I didn't even start yet.

805
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,730
Let's talk about the light fixture thing.

806
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:48,570
Don't you think about the person getting it?

807
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:51,030
I couldn't sleep for days because it was so bright.

808
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,690
I was so tired because I couldn't sleep for days, you hear?

809
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,100
How much was it again? 10 million won?

810
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,650
Is that what a conglomerate mind is like, Mr. Ma Tan?

811
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:59,750
Also, about your mother. Even if she misunderstood the situation,

812
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,090
how could she call a person she met for the first time vulgar?

813
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,600
Senior, I'm sorry to tell you this, but...

814
