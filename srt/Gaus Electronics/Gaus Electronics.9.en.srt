the determination of sexual harassment and sexual violence

149
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,750
is made by not the perpetrator's intention,

but the victim's subjective circumstances.

151

If an act inadvertently humiliates a person sexually,

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,900
it becomes sexual harassment.

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,830
Fiancée?

170
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,410
Honestly, it doesn't matter, even if you do.

171
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,420
I'll see you again next time.

172
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,480
All right! I got my pay.

173
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,680
You should check, too.

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,590
How does it feel to get your first pay?

175
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,070
I think there's something wrong with my pay.

176
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,970
Which department must I visit to resolve this?

177
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,310
It went to the right person.

178
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,580
Marketing Team 3, Baek Ma Tan.

179
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,520
Monthly salary of 2.5 million won before taxes. It's correct.

180
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,580
2.5 million won is my monthly pay?

181
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,260
Not per day, but per month?

182
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,340
- What?
- Before joining, I looked into it

183
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,180
and new recruits in Gaus Electronics Marketing team are supposed to receive 30 million.

184
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,080
That's right. A yearly salary of 30 million won.

185
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,540
2.5 million per month

186
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,120
for 12 months makes a total of 30 million.

187
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,080
You mean to say it wasn't 30 million per month?

188
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,380
30 million per month?

189
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,790
Who'd give a new recruit who's in a contract 30 million per month?

190
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,190
At Power, I earned 50 million per month

191
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,770
as an executive member.

192
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,420
2.5 million won per month?

193
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,740
What can I do with this meager sum?

194
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,960
Father even put a hold on all my cards.

195
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,650
How can I survive one month with this measly amount?

196
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,040
[Account Balance: 2,122,250 won > 2,049,250 won > 49,250 won]

197
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,680
No!

198
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,150
What's wrong?

199
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,730
I didn't do anything

200
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,260
but breathe, and yet...

201
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,200
my monthly pay...

202
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,710
just briefly swept through my bank account.

203
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,330
Hey, your pay isn't yours in the first place.

204
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,220
It's owned by the bank, credit card company, and pension corp.

205
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,870
My pay is owned by my wife and kids.

206
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,970
You all lasted a month with this amount of money so far?

207
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,200
Ma Tan still hasn't abandoned his bravado.

208
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,410
If I blink my eyes twice like this,

209
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,210
it means I like you.

210
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,430
If I blink them three times like this, it means let's see each other for a second.

211
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,360
If I blink both eyes...

212
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,580
alternatively, it means to stop it.

213
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,050
Is it that dusty in the office?

214
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,010
Why do you keep blinking your eyes?

215
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,640
I-I did?

216
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,030
Gosh, my eyes are so dry.

217
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,840
Hey... I can tell just by looking. You two...

218
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,320
must have a magnesium deficiency.

219
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,280
That must be it.

220
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,070
Don't forget to take those supplements.

221
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,260
Your eyelids won't last with that much blinking.

222
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,350
Senior, we weren't caught.

223
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,990
The code is pretty good, right?

224
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,530
What do you mean? It's going to be deciphered soon.

225
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,080
Senior, calm down. Calm down.

226
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,570
Just trust me from now.

227
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,730
I'll get rid of any obstacle that comes our way.

228
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,340
Get rid of what exactly?

229
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,110
I'm about to get rid of your eyeballs.

230
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,280
Senior, I told you not to say those mean things.

231
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,610
Stop saying those things.

232
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,090
Wait.

233
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,980
Did anyone see the Chivas Gaus Regal that was here?

234
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,360
I saw it here during the day yesterday.

235
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,720
I also saw it yesterday.

236
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,460
Why are you looking for the Chivas Gaus Regal?

237
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,650
Are you going to do some day drinking?

238
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,090
You're a strange one.

239
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,700
No, I just noticed it missing while looking for a file.

240
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,890
Wait, is it not there?

241
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,100
It's not here.

242
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,170
He's right. Why look for something that doesn't even cost much?

243
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,550
- Kang Mi, just get back here.
- Stop wasting your time and just

244
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,530
focus on your own work when you're working.

245
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,210
Come back. Come back.

246
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,830
General Manager, did you take it home by chance?

247
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,790
That's a major accusation to make!

248
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,830
It's a reward that was given to the team.

249
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,100
How could I have drunk it alone?

250
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,530
Just what do you think of me?

251
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,200
Then was it you, Na Rae?

252
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,650
You seem to be aware of something.

253
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,750
What do you mean?

254
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,970
I just really hate this situation where my team members

255
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:28,460
are doubting each other.

256
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,430
That's right!

257
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,180
The team next door must've taken it.

258
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,910
Right! Right! That's a just suspicion.

259
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,300
That really sounds probable. Totally.

260
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,470
Those Team 2 punks!

261
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,610
Okay, then we can just check the CCTVs.

262
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:45,270
Who installs CCTVs in an office?

263
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,900
We did.

264
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,310
S-Since when did we have a CCTV there?

265
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,030
We have one there, too.

266
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,440
Kang Mi, call up the Security Office and ask for footage.

267
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,700
- Okay.
- Wait!

268
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,200
I don't think this is a situation where we have to check the CCTV and stuff.

269
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,740
It's the only badge of honor that Team 3 had.

270
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,160
No, no, no... My man!

271
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,680
This picture alone is enough for us to remember it.

272
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,310
Isn't that so?

273
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,490
What in the world?

274
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,720
You must be involved as well, Manager Cha.

275
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,220
Kang Mi, call them up right now.

276
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,870
Gosh, these people... how dare they?

277
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,370
Kang Mi... it's not going to work due to the protection of privacy or something.

278
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,310
I'll stop by the security office while going down to the first floor, so put the phone down.

279
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,830
Everyone, calm down. I'll resolve this issue.

280
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,350
No, they'll send us the footage.

281
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,270
Ask them to make haste, okay?

282
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,620
I'll go there right now.

283
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,900
Hello, this is the Security Office.

284
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Hello, this is the security, right? This is Geon Kang Mi from Marketing Team 3.

285
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,180
Could you send us footage from the CCTV—

286
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,360
Ms. Kang Mi...

287
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,540
please hand over the phone.

288
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,970
Thank you.

289
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,810
Everyone, calm down and listen to me, please.

290
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,230
The culprit of this Chivas Gaus Regal Theft Case is...

291
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,400
no one else but me.

292
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,100
What? You did it, Sang Sik?

293
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,910
Overwhelmed by the duty to successfully end the Gaboss Project,

294
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,670
I came to the office yesterday after company dinner and chugged it down.

295
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,030
Y-You chugged it?

296
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,750
I never got to drink a spirit though!

297
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,660
Senior, please reprimand me now.

298
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,270
How could I do that?

299
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,150
You can do it, Senior.

300
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,600
Mr. Lee Sang Sik, isn't that too much?

301
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,870
Even if we got it with your idea, how could you just enjoy it by yourself?

302
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,060
Did you not think about others?

303
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,000
Hey, Lee Sang Sik, have you really...

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,520
- gone mad or something?
- Hey!

305
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,130
Spit it back out!

306
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,140
Spit it! Spit it!

307
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,550
My neck! My neck!

308
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,490
Sang Sik...

309
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,780
The minimum amount I need per month is 7.5 million won.

310
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,660
[Rent: 3 million won, Food: One million won, Expenses: 3 million won, Transportation: 500,000 won]

311
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,290
Ma Tan, your rent is 3 million won?

312
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,600
Is it rather expensive?

313
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,070
It's very expensive.

314
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,670
Food and transportation costs on top of that?

315
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,870
You're lucky since your parents give you financial support.

316
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,000
I would've gone bankrupt in a month and lived on the streets...

317
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,650
to end up eaten by pigeons.

318
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,470
If it were you, how would you change things? Could you help me?

319
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,970
[Rent: 300,000 won, Food: 100,000 won, Expenses: 300,000 won, Transportation: 50,000 won]

320
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,330
I think you just need to eliminate a zero from each of them.

321
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,370
You must be this frugal, so you can use the remaining money to live like a human.

322
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,660
It's your first pay,

323
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,420
so you should buy your parents and everyone you're grateful to some gifts.

324
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,110
You were able to gift people with this pay?

325
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,430
Yes, I give my grandmother an allowance each month and add it to my savings, too.

326
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,570
That's possible?

327
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,870
Do you want me to explain it in detail?

328
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,140
How to live doing everything you want with this money?

329
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,150
Yes, I put myself in your hands.

330
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,610
Not for free.

331
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,240
We've established our unit price thus far.

332
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,090
Would you take 5,000 won?

333
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,460
That's is a good start.

334
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,110
I didn't know the Gaboss system would even connect to a blender.

335
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,370
How great. Gosh, my eyes hurt.

336
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,220
Senior! You had an office romance for quite a long time. Right?

337
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,070
That's right. For about five years.

338
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,620
Wow, five years?

339
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:40,000
That was probably possible because of the many benefits of an office romance, right?

340
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,340
Oh, of course.

341
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,990
Since we work at the same company, it's easy to empathize with each other.

342
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,210
And you can help each other with work.

343
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,360
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, and one more thing!

344
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,460
One more, one more!

345
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:56,040
Whether you do well or not, you always get bullied as a couple.

346
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,750
The proposal is nice.

347
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,870
The two of you must have it sweet these days.

348
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,840
This is total garbage!

349
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,160
You two going through a rough patch?

350
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,910
Did you break up?

351
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,030
If you get caught and break up soon after, it's total hell. Hell!

352
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,940
Hey, we can't forget about a company dinner because of you two.

353
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,200
Na Rae, you come earlier, and Lee Sang Sik can come afterward.

354
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,650
No need to be embarrassed.

355
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,060
There's always a way.

356
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,200
One of you can leave or go die.

357
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,610
As expected, I should avoid an office romance.

358
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,790
No, no, no. That's not all, Senior.

359
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,110
- Isn't there more to it?
- Of course.

360
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,090
I can constantly be with the person I like at work.

361
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,460
Yes, yes, things like that.

362
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,430
You end up fighting a lot.

363
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,310
And naturally, it impedes your work.

364
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:53,090
And you try not to let it show, but you think it won't show?

365
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,120
And if rumors start going around, then it's complicated whether you date or not.

366
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,240
Anyway, it's the end if you get caught in an office romance.

367
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,220
The performance is incredible.

368
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,100
But you know, I want people to date without having to walk on eggshells.

369
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,180
Right, Senior?

370
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,980
As an onlooker, what would be more entertaining than that? Am I right?

371
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,850
- Right.
- Yeah.

372
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,400
Anyway, why'd you ask all of a sudden?

373
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,830
I always had a fantasy about an office romance.

374
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,980
You...

375
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,510
still haven't given up on Hae Young, huh?

376
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,980
- I-I have.
- Huh?

377
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,470
It got stuck.
(Also sounds like "Gotcha" or "You got caught")

378
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,870
What's wrong? It's supposed to blend rocks, too.

379

For starters, the secondary pay of an employee.

381
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,070
- Benefits?
- Especially overtime benefits.

382
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,140
It could cover transportation and meals.

383
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,390
If you reap all of that, it'll eventually become worth it.

384
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,530
Overtime benefits...

385
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,180
General Manager, you said company get-togethers are also an extension of work. Right?

386
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,960
I did, why?

387
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,240
Then the get-together from a few days ago and last week...

388
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,700
and the one from when I entered this company...

389
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,060
I think you need to give me overtime and overnight pay.

390
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,830
I would like for you to pay me additionally.

391
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,120
Hey, he's nuts.

392
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,750
He's lost his mind. He's lost it.

Ma Tan, buy a dumbbell.

398
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,430
I think a 2kg one would be perfect.

399
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,240
I'll go with a 3kg one.

Ta-da!

407
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,510
If you accumulate the number of steps you walk,

408
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,090
you can get paid in cash.

409

And you should bring your own lunch from now on, too.

412
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,850
Even by saving the 10,000 won the company provides for lunch, it really adds up.

413
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,530
- My own lunch?
- Yes.

414
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,460
Buy a seal-tight container that costs one lunch's worth,

415
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,040
and buy instant rice.

416
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,280
And you'd use the side dishes from home.

Could you take a look at this document for me?

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,670
Don't look at my face and just look at the document.

It doesn't seem like anyone's suspecting us,

428
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,580
but now there's even a functioning CCTV in the office.

And it also seems like your worry level increased after what Senior Moon Hak said.

430
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,200
So I created a method to succeed in an office romance.

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,200
- You little...
- Father!

487
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,050
Don't pressure him too much.

488
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,480
I also want Ma Tan to be at ease.

489
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,260
I'll get going.

490
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,370
I mustn't be rude to Oh Ro Ra, so I'll just have a bite before I leave.

491
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,260
Ma Tan,

492
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,140
why did you go to Gaus as a new recruit when you could've come to our Gulji Group?

493
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,800
I heard you're learning something.

494
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,190
He's learning how to live a lacking life. A lacking life.

495
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,680
Oh, that's not it.

496
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,360
Secret business administration.

497
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,200
It's supposedly very popular amongst young conglomerates according to America's Wall Street report.

498
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,700
Yes.

499
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,940
I don't know how many new things I've learned with nothing in my hand.

500
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,670
Living alone isn't uncomfortable at all.

501
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,100
A person can live in a bean-sized house.

502
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,740
One cup of coffee can bring pure happiness.

503
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,860
I've never used discount coupons

504
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,400
when buying products.

505
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,900
You're someone who's going to lead Power Group.

506
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,830
Saying such pathetic words I think this punk is drunk.

507
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,810
I only drink cider, Father.

508
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,760
This won't do.

509
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,850
Ma'am, clean this up and bring out the dessert.

510
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,850
You know, the Assam Early Grey Chiffon Cake?

511
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,990
Okay, Madam.

512
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,780
Wait, before you clean anything.

513
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,050
Oh, Ma Tan. You're really...

514
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,910
He got his first paycheck not too long ago.

515
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,200
Such a good boy.

516
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,620
A gift with that measly sum of a paycheck.

517
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,630
How incredible are the gifts that you're stalling?

518
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,610
Huh?

519
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,670
What's this?

520
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,150
Wait, did you...

521
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,000
These are gifts for you, Mother.

522
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,660
They were as clear as your skin, so I bought them.

523
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,730
They sparkle. They sparkle.

524
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,100
Are they designer brand?

525
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,310
Oh, Louis Luitton!

526
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,810
Honey, Louis Luitton.

527
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,540
Senior!

528
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,060
[A few nights ago]
We won against

529
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,790
General Manager Gi, no less.

530
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,400
So don't worry too much.

531
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,460
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I swallowed it.

532
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,720
That was because Senior was drunk, so we need to do well at work tomorrow.

533
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,220
- Go inside—
- Sang Sik.

534
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,330
What the?

535
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,170
- You two are having a blast, huh?
- No...

536
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,380
We had a company get-together. Good, take him inside.

537
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,290
Hey, is this some kind of motel?

538
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,120
This is a motel?

539
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,770
Manager Gi, I specifically told you...

540
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,850
Congratulations.

541
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:37,180
An office romance is good.

542
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,880
Hey, that's a stereotype.

543
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,360
We're not at that stage yet.

544
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,240
Servants usually end up falling for each other.

545
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,220
Work is stressful already, so you need to have some kind of fun. Right?

546
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,010
So you shouldn't hold back either.

547
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,970
- What?
- Hold something for too long

548
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,170
- and it will become poop.
- Poop?

549
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,670
Who said poop? Poop...

550
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,140
My stomach hurts.

551
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,570
- Hey, hey.
- Do I need to poop?

552
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,200
That's right. Let's not become poop.

553
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,100
What is that?

554
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,560
Is he a turtle?

555
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,440
Did you wait long?

556
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,120
But what's with the backpack?

557
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,710
Fashion.

558
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:21,180
- Isn't it cool?
- No, it's not.

559
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,370
Let's go, for now.

560
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,080
Senior.

561
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,390
It's our first date.

562
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,370
Should we wear a couple outifit?

563
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:37,700
Sang Sik, we're just going to eat today.

564
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,450
Let's go.

565
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,480
Well, this much is...

566
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,150
okay.

567
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,260
Since we're seeing each other, holding hands seems all right.

568
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,310
♫ I should know better than to let things grow bigger than a kiss ♫

569
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:05,800
I read on a certain blog about three things you can learn at work.

570
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,130
Senior!

571
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,020
♫ But I'm sure this room has planned ♫

572
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,190
♫ the fall of many girls like this ♫

573
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,740
Are you okay? You must've been surprised.

574
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,600
♫ 'Cause now you’re rushing through my fingers
 ♫

575
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,900
I'm fine.

576
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,830
There's no one who's just unpleasant.

577
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,250
If you get to know them, there's at least one good feature.

578
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,940
It's good to be together.

579
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,560
If you work together, you can see a better path than when you do it alone.

580
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,090
And high risk, high return.

581
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,540
You had a little something...

582
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:41,140
The riskier it is, the better the result might be.

583
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,470
That means, an office romance everyone advises against...

584
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,790
even if it was unpleasant at first, together...

585
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,920
you can be happier if you overcome any danger!

586
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,750
Like us, now?

587
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,280
I explained it terribly, but you understood exactly what I meant.

588
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,350
I must send someone to Gaus.

589
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,990
There's probably a woman by Ma Tan's side.

590
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,030
Tell them to take a picture of her tomorrow and send it to me right away.

591
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,410
All right.

592
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,660
Don't worry, Father.

593
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,710
I was able to cover one meal today, thanks to you.

594
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,200
Thus, today's meal cost 0 won.

595
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,710
What the? Is that a gift for that woman?

596
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,070
If I sell these, it will be a good contribution to my housekeeping.

597
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,280
But where and how can I sell these?

598
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,420
Lotus.

599
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,500
Install this.

600
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,040
So if you submit a post saying you want to sell something,

601
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,420
people who want to buy it will contact you?

602
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,800
That's right. You can raise the price by looking at the market price.

603
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,120
It's most important to sell electronics quickly before the market price drops.

604
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,240
The person who said he'd buy said he'd be wearing a white T-shirt and navy sweatpants.

605
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Well...

606
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,230
Is that him?

607
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,500
Hello!

608
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,790
You're from Lotus, right?

609
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,360
Uncle and Autie—

610
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,580
Whoa... Uncle.

611
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,880
They look nice.

612
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,070
What bullshit.

613
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,000
Wow, amazing. You're dead.

614
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,580
I should've known when he asked to split the cost.

615
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:25,250
I guess I'll have to teach him a lesson again today.

616
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,260
Hyung! I found that auntie and uncle from last time.

617
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,640
- Auntie?
- You know that dark ass place without a street lamp?

618
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,700
Come quick!

619
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,250
Hey,

620
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,850
- are you alone?
- Yeah.

621
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,080
- I'm still single.
- You little...

622
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,980
Things might get out of hand, should we just run?

623
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,370
We can earn points, too.

624
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,180
Shall we?

625
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,900
Hey! Where are you going?

626
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,990
Living a lacking life, Father means living a life full of surprises.

627
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:05,990
Father, I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be returning to Power.

628
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,530
Young Boss, I canceled the one-room contract with the real estate.

629
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,240
You said you need the money urgently,

630
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,900
so I did clear out the one-room, but what will you do?

631
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,050
I'm going to live a frugal life for the time being.

632
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,410
Are you going to return to the main house?

633
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:21,830
I'll let you know my residence as soon I'm able to arrange one.

634
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,620
I understand.

635
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,590
[1200 won > 1300 won]

636
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,230
Huh?

637
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,890
How could you raise 100 won so poor people without money can't buy it?

638
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,160
Do you think you'll be happy if you get rich by leeching off of those who aren't well off!

639
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,620
I think he's really gone crazy since last time.

640
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,580
Do something about him!

641
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,410
Ma Tan, what's wrong? Are you crazy?

642
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,800
Hey, did you eat something bad?

643
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,170
- Come here, Punk.
- Come here!

644
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,720
One law for the rich, another for the poor!

645
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,470
This dirty world where you can't buy a drink with 1,200 won!

646
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,540
I never thought I'd hear those words from Ma Tan's lips.

647
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,590
I'm about to become afraid of Ma Tan.

648
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,180
Didn't Manager Jang from the personnel team and the new recruit break up?

649
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,040
They broke up for the fifth time and are back together again.

650
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,190
They're getting married next month.

651
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,540
I thought they didn't get along.

652
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,210
They lost the timing to cut ties.

653
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,100
Gosh, Manager Jang... his stocks weren't doing too well either.

654
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,010
What do stocks have to do with dating?

655
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,110
An office romance is the same as stocks.

656
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,150
Look.

657
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,100
You think you'll be better at it than others.

658
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,320
So you start it without much thought.

659
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:58,270
And then you end up being stripped of everything you own and...

660
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,750
realize you're no different.

661
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,470
You end up with regrets.

662
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,110
What if you start by doing proper research?

663
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,660
Operating margin, surplus cash flow,

664
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,960
financial statements... after looking into everything.

665
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,460
You might discover an undervalued stock.

666
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,130
You have to buy that right away!

667
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,220
Whoa, but how did you know all that?

668
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,430
I have quite a bit of pieces of knowledge.

669
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,990
Lee Sang Sik,

670
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,100
your name is Sang Sik, but you always do things lacking common sense.

671
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,990
- W-Why?
- Do you like me?

672
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,290
Manager Wi, yes, I do.

673
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,900
So it was my hand yesterday and my foot today?

674
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,620
Foot?

675
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,590
I thought your foot might be cold...

676
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,320
Thanks.

677
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,030
- Yes.
- Lee Sang Sik.

678
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,290
- What about me?
- You have athlete's foot.

679
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,270
I heard that's contagious.

680
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,660
I can't believe he's trying to learn the ways of the world from that tiny Gaus.

681
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,710
I can't stand watching any longer.

682
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,660
I'm keeping watch from his side, so don't worry too much, Chairman.

683
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,500
If we slow down the Gaboss project like we are now,

684
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,730
there will be no problem proceeding according to your plans, Chairman.

685
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:46,390
All right. Only then will I rest assured.

686
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,040
Now, have a drink.

687
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,330
Since you're going to be working with us at Power.

688
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,420
Chairman, I'm...

689
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,750
someone who escaped even during the Gaus phone recall ordeal.

690
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:06,880
No one will know that I'm meeting the chairman like this.

691
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,110
But Manager Wi, who's in the same department

692
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,460
as my son...

693
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,660
Manager Wi?

694
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,970
There's no need to worry about him.

695
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,440
He's quite an oblivious person.

696
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,230
People ignore me thinking I'm oblivious, I won't be treated like a fool again.

697
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,610
What should we do with Power Group's son?

698
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,680
I think it's better to discard him along with Director Choi.

699
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,300
That buddy is...

700
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,960
just an innocent guy who's fond of liquid sugar.

701
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,180
- Is it to your liking?
- Yeah.

702
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,120
It's so delicious! How did you know about this place?

703
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,420
I found it after some research.

704
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,250
That it's a hidden gem and perfect for dates.

705
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,010
- This place is...
- Welcome.

706
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:48,890
Hello.

707
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,560
Huh? It's Manager Seong and Manager Cha.

708
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,530
- Why are Manager Seong and Manager Cha...
- Hello.

709
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,560
It's a true hidden gem!

710
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,380
Okay. I'll give it a try.

711
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,470
Pack your things. Your things!

712
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,190
No, no.

713
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,780
From here to there.

714
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,570
Man, why are you ordering everything?

715
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,590
How did the managers know about this place?

716
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,310
You said I can eat at ease and that it's a hidden gem!

717
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,980
Is it a hidden gem because we need to hide and eat?

718
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,150
- We should go now, too.
- Okay.

719
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,480
I'm sorry, Senior. We came all this way.

720
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,380
It's fine.

721
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,900
Senior, wait.

722
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,970
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

723
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:53,800
No, no. Sit here for a sec.

724
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,510
I'm really fine.

725
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,810
Oh, my. W-What are you doing?

726
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,740
Hold on.

727
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,170
It's all blistered.

728
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,560
♫ Please stand on my ♫

729
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,480
All done.

730
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,570
♫ trembling path ♫

731
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,530
When did you prepare all this?

732
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,340
I should prepare for anything when on a date with you.

733
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,850
Since you trip easily.

734
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,600
♫ but beautiful ♫

735
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,830
Your foot.

736
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,190
Oh...

737
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,780
I can do it myself.

738
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,070
Your foot.

739
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,520
♫ light doesn't fade ♫

740
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:53,900
♫ 'Cause we are in young in love, let's save our tears ♫

741
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:00,340
♫ What time taught me is love ♫

742
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,210
Try them on.

743
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,480
♫ We are strong enough ♫

744
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,650
What the heck?

745
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,170
Is that why you wore this big backpack since yesterday?

746
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:14,530
I didn't realize and thought your fashion sucked.

747
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,110
Wasn't it heavy?

748
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:21,490
If you're in pain, my heart is heavier.

749
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:28,410
♫ If you are there to protect me ♫

750
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:46,970
♫ 'Cuz we are strong enough ♫

751
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,980
Senior, are you okay?

752
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,130
What if someone—

753
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,570
I'll shove you if we run into anyone we know.

754
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,970
But right now, I just...

755
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,460
want to stay like this.

756
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,630
♫ Our love ♫

757
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,850
Okay.

758
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:09,500
♫ I will overcome it ♫

759
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:20,120
Young Boss, were you in urgent need of money because of Kang Mi's gift?

760
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,420
It concerned me about how dark it is.

761
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,600
She's coming. Get ready.

762
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,780
Now!

763
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,800
Is it a green light?

764
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,120
It's just a normal light.

765
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,670
What is this?

766
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,960
Why's it so bright?

767
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,580
What crazy person installed an industrial light in a residential area?

768
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,570
She's asking if you're crazy.

769
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,340
How are we to sleep at night?

770
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,310
That's what I'm saying!

771
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,980
Where did this come from?

772
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,700
Gosh, my eyes hurt!

773
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,010
We should make a civil complaint.

774
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,950
They're going to make a civil complaint.

775
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,350
How are we supposed to sleep like this?

776
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,280
- Gosh.
- My eyes are blinded.

777
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,180
God! Which lunatic...

778
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,400
- Lunatic?
- Is he crazy?

779
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,960
Young Boss, I think you should get a refund—

780
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,480
Apparently, no refunds.

781
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,930
It's really cold, now.

782
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,270
Are you cold, Senior?

783
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,980
If we hug you'll feel a bit warmer.

784
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,730
And what if we run into Aziz?

785
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,710
How will you stand his teasing?

786
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:39,460
Oh, Senior, what's our relationship, now?

787
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,900
Like 3.5?

788
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,300
3.4?

789
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,770
3.3?

790
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,110
Time to go home.

791
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,460
Oh, right.

792
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,360
3...

793
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,210
.9?

794
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,670
Senior, thank you so much.

795
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,730
I'll be really good to you, so we can become a 4.

796
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,810
Let go!

797
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,440
I'm just really happy.

798
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,930
If someone comes, I'll shove you right away.

799
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,080
Na Rae!

800
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,670
- Where are you two coming from?
- Huh?

801
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,950
What do you mean?

802
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,670
I saw you getting off the bus earlier.

803
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,290
Us?

804
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:27,560
Coincidentally!

805
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,230
Coincidentally...

806
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,620
Then was hugging each other a coincidence, too?

807
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,550
I hugged her because it was cold.

808
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,590
So don't go spreading weird rumors anywhere. We were just cold.

809
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,210
So you're really dating.

810
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,350
N-No, we're not.

811
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,970
Are you coming back from there?

812
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,810
The hidden gem? With the park nearby?

813
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,110
Huh?

814
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,540
How...

815
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,690
How do you know about that?

816
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,110
Sang Sik has been telling me to go on a date there since a few years back.

817
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,730
I did?

818
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:03,660
Oppa, you still carry around this backpack.

819
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,900
You carried it every time you met Hae Young.

820
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,260
When did I...

821
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,790
Could you take a look at this document?

822
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:12,990
Well, it doesn't seem like it was made in a rush.

823
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,740
Where did you get all this?

824
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,770
It's really delicious! How did you know about this place?

825
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,080
I found it after some research.

826
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,820
I always had a fantasy about having an office romance.

827
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,870
You still haven't given up on Hae Young, huh?

828
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:27,050
He's probably meeting anyone out of loneliness.

829
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,950
♫ The person who'd stay with me after enduring the rough wind ♫

830
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,220
Unni!

831
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,120
I didn't upset you, did I?

832
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,620
Senior.

833
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,260
I'm so tired.

834
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,290
- I'll go first.
- Senior.

835
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,890
- Hey, S-Senior!
- Oh, and...

836
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:50,310
♫ Then, in front of whatever life brings me, ♫

837
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,740
we're definitely not dating.

838
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:56,610
♫ Because we'll together for all of time,  ♫

839
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,730
Senior!

840
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:04,760
♫ Hey! Because I love you ♫

841
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:12,390
♫ I want to tell you, only you ♫

842
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,490
♫ I want to show you everything, even before you ask me ♫

843
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:22,170
♫ Hurriedly to your ears, I love you ♫

844
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,950
You don't understand me.

845
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:30,560
I'm frustrating and pathetic.

846
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,460
Na Rae!

847
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,000
And you think I like another woman more than you, so you're stuck on that?

848
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,800
- Ta-da!
- Install this.

849
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,010
She's smarter than me and stronger than me and everything.

850
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,640
You're here.

851
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,680
...but my parents are against her.

852
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,040
Are you stuck on that?

853
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,360
You take care of that on your own.

854
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,810
I'll mix everything else for you.

855
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,330
When you're stuck on something, Gaus Blender.

856

Buy everything you want to eat!

859
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,610
Is it time for him to die? What's wrong with him?

860
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:05,100
Is she your mother? Ma Tan, you really take after your mother.

861
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:07,260
The man next door is someone I know, right?

862
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,650
I really seem crazy, right?

863
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,800
I'll become a Lee Sang Sik with great intuition.

864
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,150
Once I start, I'm all or nothing.

865
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:15,710
I plan to proceed with my son at the center.

866
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,710
I've seen him somewhere before.

867
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,240
Do you really like her?

868
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,460
Please resolve the misunderstanding.

869
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,030
That you and I have absolutely nothing between us.

870
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,330
What if I don't want to explain?

871
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:27,770
♫ And tell me everyday, day ♫

872
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,510
Senior, there's a misunderstanding.

873
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,820
H-Hold on!

874
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,010
Senior—

875
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,880
Hello, Senior.

876
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,080
I recalled that you told me to let you know if there's anything I need.

877
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:45,080
Ma Tan.

878
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,950
Take one step back for a sec.
