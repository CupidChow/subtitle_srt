- Hello!
- Me?

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,670
- Thank you.
- Please take a good look.

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,990
- Have you tried this before?
- Yeah. Wait! Thank you.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,910
- Are you okay?
- Thank you!

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,130
Hold on.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,760
Hold on!

Hold...

18
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,920
Hold on. H-Hold on!

Thank you. Thank—

Thank you.

- Did you just press the close button?
- Sorry, I didn't see you.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,900
I was ready to accept your apology,

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,940
but you have no intention of apologizing at all.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,140
Why should I?

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,900
I'm the one who was contemplating whether I should accept your apology or not.

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,500
Please see me for a minute.

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,990
Who is he to tell me to see him?

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,600
How outrageous.

30
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,920
I don't have time, so make it quick.

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,890
Do you know what you've done to me?

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,490
It's not left on "seen." It's just "not seen."

33
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,510
Hae Young has been denying me since yesterday.

34
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,110
She's someone I don't really know.

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,770
You haven't misunderstood, have you?

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,750
Yup.

37
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,700
She just replied.

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,100
"Yup"? Just "yup"?

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,420
She said, "Yup."

40
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,840
What's the problem?

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,080
There's no "ha."
(Korean consonant to mimic laughing, like "haha.")

42
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,270
Hae Young, who always adds "Ha" too much just messaged, "Yup."

43
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,130
"Yup," that's it!

44
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,400
In the past five years, I've never received a message as dry as this.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,720
Do you still feel nothing after looking at this, Senior?

46
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,810
You don't feel sorry, one bit?

47
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,140
Senior, are you a sociopath?

48
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,590
I mean, what do I need to be sorry for?

49
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,750
You made her misunderstand!

50
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,560
Because you made excessive physical contact with me!

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,850
Hae Young!

52
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,000
Wow! All right.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,670
I'm sorry if I was being excessive. Happy?

54
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,370
Explain everything to Hae Young, Senior.

55
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,370
That you coincidentally live next door, and that you're the one who came into my house.

56
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,410
And that we absolutely do not have a relationship together!

57
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,910
Do it yourself. Why would you involve me in your relationship?

58
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,920
- There's a spider behind you.
- As if!

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,040
I knew it.

60
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,920
Are you even truly scared of spiders?

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,240
Forget it. I need some time to myself.

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,190
Hold on.

63
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,360
Are you saying I did that on purpose?

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,140
I'm really, totally, absolutely scared of spiders.

65
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,710
I'm so scared of them I couldn't even watch the "Spiderman" trailer!

66
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,410
Yeah, yeah! Thank you for telling me something that doesn't interest me at all.

67
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,320
Yeah, right. You'll be interested.

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,270
- Look.
- God.

69
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,420
Should I request a diagnosis?

70
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,980
Go ahead. Go ahead and request one and

71
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,770
explain everything to Hae Young

72
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,330
that there's nothing going on between us—

73

I'm sorry.

I-It's not what you think... Hae Young!

76
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,590
H-Hae Young, there's nothing between us, nothing! Hae Young!

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,900
- What?
- Did you just see Hae Young?

78
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,400
Why did you have to...

79
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,040
Did you see her and do it on purpose?

80
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,270
And why did you move in next door?

81

82
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,680

Anyhow, your mother was quite surprised

131
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,660
W-When did I ever say I needed these?

132
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,430
Gosh, how ridiculous.

133

Geez, you said you didn't need any, but

134

the smell of the pain patches could reach the live octopus restaurant across the street, Senior.

135

You think I used them because I wanted to?

136
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,020
Forget it and let's do this.

137
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,050
You should explain it to her, not me.

138
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,660
What would I say?

139
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,720
"Hae Young, there's no need for you to misunderstand at all.

140
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,670
Senior Cha Na Rae is too busy to even glance at me,

141
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,810
and she's very popular and has high standards.

142
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,980
And she already has a boyfriend."

143
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,180
How could I say such nonsense, Senior?

144
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,090
Who would believe that when everyone in Gaus knows about your nasty temper?

145
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,170
Shit, you're going to make me curse again, you little...

146
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,430
Senior!

147
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,040
How about just cursing in front of Hae Young like that?

148
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,980
I don't think Hae Young would misunderstand if she knew your true nature.

149
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,970
Should I rip the fudging soles out of your shoes and flatten you to a sheet with them?

150
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,400
Do you really want me to rip your mouth for you? Should I?

151
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,150
"Fudging, sheet, rip your mouth." I just took note of everything.

152
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,980
- Stop, you want to die? Stop it.
- Say some more.

153
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,580
- Erase it. Erase it.
- "Stop it, I'll erase you from the world—"

154
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,020
That's enough, you two.

155
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,510
This is an office!

156
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,690
I'm sorry.

157

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,230
You're dead later, I mean it.

"You are dead."

160

"I truly mean it."

161
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,410
- "Today, I will make sure to—"
- Were you two sworn enemies in your past lives?

162
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,690
But, Senior, past lives still haven't been scientifically proven...

163
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,290
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,890
This is Baek Ma Tan's job application I got from a colleague in HR after some bullshitting.

Huh, what the?

168
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,040
They're all blank.

169
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,370
Even his family relations.

170
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,770
This guy is totally suspicious.

171
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,100
How can this be possible? It's not like he's a secret agent.

172
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,770
I'm going to have to do a little digging on him

173
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,660
with my potato-digging skills from childhood.

174
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,930
Did you call for me?

175
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,310
Yeah, Manager Seong.

Cancel all of today's schedule.

177
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,750
We don't have anything scheduled today.

178
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,310
It's chewy, but soft.

179
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,530
Spicy, but sweet.

180
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,110
This saltiness at the tip of my tongue

181
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:16,240
is asking me for white rice.

182
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,250
This savory taste...

183
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,800
continues to remain inside my mouth.

184
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,190
He's using his fork to swirl the jinmichae?
(Dried squid)

185
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,950
Jinmichae...

186
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,640
Even its name is divine.

187
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,380
Hey, Newbie.

188
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,370
Hey, Ma Tan.

189
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,770
Yeah, Ma Tan. I memorized your name.

190
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,050
I'm smart despite how I look.

191
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,790
I have a question.

192
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,910
Have you been living abroad with your parents?

193
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,100
I did go back and forth.

194
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,140
Oh, then are your parents...

195
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,070
diplomats? Expatriates? Or do they do business abroad?

196
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,070
I have no desire to tell you.

197
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,570
Did I ask you something difficult?

198
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,310
Tell me honestly.

199
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,460
Which line did you ride here?

200
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,780
I don't know what you're saying.

201
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,700

202
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,060
Hey, you moron! Do you think that's what I meant?

203
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,590
I'm talking about your back.

204

Background!

205
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,110
We didn't even have any open positions in Gaus.

206
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,430
But how did you obtain a position and

207
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,800
end up eating here like this?

208
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Tell me.

209
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,900
It's difficult for me to tell you.

210
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,820
Oh! I guess it could be.

211
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,350
Are your parent NIS? CIA? Or are they

212
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,950
the head of a major company or the president?

213
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,970

I'll get up first.

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,190
Look at him!

216
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,250
Did you see that? That rudeness?

217
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,580
And why did he just leave without cleaning up?

218
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,010
It does seem like he has a personal reason.

219
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,280
Personal reason, my foot.

220
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,900
He's like that because he has something to hide.

221
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,860
You might fool everyone else,

222
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,210
but you can't fool me.

223
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,250
I read the letter you gave me yesterday.

224
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,300
- What is this?
- The money you requested.

225
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,350
I put in what I could repay for now,

226
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,270
but could the remaining 5,500,000 won

227
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,980
be repaid in installments?

228
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,470
It will be too difficult to pay it off at once with my monthly salary.

229
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,480
To think that amount is too difficult...

230
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,390
Pardon?

231
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,840
I understand your situation.

- I'll give you until tomorrow.

237
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,920
Oh, I was just giving him stuff he needs.

238
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,690
Should I let you in on what you really need?

239
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,200
No.

240

Back in my days...
(Sounds like "Latte")

242
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,310
Wait, you finished your military service. Right?

243
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,060
I was exempted due to a health condition.

244

That's right.

245

I knew it since you left your tray on the table.

246

The military is the same as work.

Kissing your superior's ass.

Are you talking about the anus located on their bottom?

250
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,120
To think I'd have to go that far...

251

This crazy bastard.

252
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,780
I'm not actually telling you to kiss it. It's an analogy! An analogy...

253
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,770

Oh, yes. Who's there in our department?

Whose ass do you think you need to kiss?

257

Is there anyone else, but General Manager Gi?

258
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,070
Look carefully. General Manager Gi is the one who runs those vending machines.

259
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,750
If you buy expensive coffee from outside,

260
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,070
all you're asking for is more criticism about how well-off you are.

261
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,890
So just buy three drinks from there at least three times a day.

262
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,290
Sail smoothly with Manager Gi, okay?

263
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,590
More criticism...

264

Do I already have a target on my back?

No, no, no, yes, yes, no.

No, not yet.

267

It's embarrassing, but this is a record of all my failed attempts to confess to Hae Young.

277

During the past five years,

there were nine attempts,

but I've never once succeeded.

280
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,310
Like everyone else,

281
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,650
if I made a heart with candles, it would suddenly rain.

282
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,130
And if I stayed up all night to practice singing to her, I'd get a sore throat.

don't you think the universe is trying to tell you something?

299
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,980
Yeah.

300
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,330
The universe did give me a sign.

301
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,440
What?

302
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,860
It did let me know.

303
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,410
It told me that today is the day.

Failure is an option.

If things are not failing, you are not innovative enough.

00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,720
- Senior, just this once.
- Why should I?

329
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,210
Do you want your name to be recorded as the 10th reason for my failure?

330
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,250
Please...

331
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,180
He's...

332
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,370
totally suspicious even at a glance.

333
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,360
You just wait to get caught, you punk.

334
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,550
What the?

335
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,300
His wallet is so shabby.

336
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,580
He must not have any money.

What's with him?

339
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,120
He didn't put in any money.

340
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,710
Is he trying to get a free drink from my vending machine?

341
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,340
What kind of discipline did he get from his parents?

342
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,090
Father! Mother!

343
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,800
I'm doing well!

344
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,080
So please don't worry...

345
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,370
about me and rest in peace!

346
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,480
Well, I mean...

347
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,250
Frankly speaking, just because his parents aren't around,

348
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,580
does it give him the right to do that? Is he a thief?

349
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,490
General Manager!

350
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,630
W-What?

351
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,370
Go inside and work.

352
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,580
So stop surveilling me!

353
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,200
Assistant Kim, you stop, too!

354
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,160
Is he looking at me? We've been caught! Hide! Hide!

355
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,590
What?

356
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,260
Hide...

357
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,150
Hide the drone.

358
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,670
Yes, I'll hide the drone.

359
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,010
Gosh, this really won't do.

360
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,190
As I thought, you're perfect.

361
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,540
I can't explain the specifics,

362
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,150
but if something happens to me at work or I'm in a predicament,

363
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,060
would you be able to help me?

364
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,910
I'll make it a condition to write off the debt.

365
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,270
Then... per case...
- Per case?

366
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,380
Well, fifty...

367
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,420
Fifty? 50 won?

368
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,370
Gosh. 50 won is being a bit stingy...

369
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,220
It should be at least 50,000 won,

370
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,420
so I have the desire to help you.

371
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,970
- Will you be fine with that?
- Of course!

372
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,410
Then, 50,000 won!

373

Please take good care of me!

374
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,760
Sure.

375
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,670
- Please get rid of this.

W-What brings you here?

378
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,230
This is my office.

379
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,660
- Oh, right.
- Are you here to see me?

380
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,030
No, I was just passing by.

381
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,730
Oh, but Hae Young.

382
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,300
- Yesterday and this morning...
- Yes.

383
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,910
- You didn't misunderstand or anything, did you?
- Misunderstanding?

384
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,630
Sang Sik. Sang Sik and I have nothing going on between us.

385
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,180
The fact that we live next to each other is also just a coincidence.

386
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,100
Of course, I know. I know Sang Sik's style.

387
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,120
Sang Sik likes the cute and petite type. Like me.

388
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,310
But you're... the big, strong, and scary type.

389
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,900
Me? I am?

390
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,150
Moreover, there are things Sang Sik said about you until now.

391
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:46,310
So how could I misunderstand? I really didn't.

392
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,430
What might that bastard have said specifically?

393
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,270
Unni, Sang Sik makes it really tough for you. Right?

394
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,710
Does he think I have nothing to say?

395
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,810
He must've eaten his tact when he was eating something because I can't find it anywhere.

396
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,420
You know he's really nosy, too. Right?

397
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,530
Yesterday, he even consulted his roommate about my future dating life.

398
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,780
That's all part of Sang Sik's charm.

399
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,230
He's unexpectedly sensitive to details.

400
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,570
- Not narrow minded?
- He's pure-hearted, too.

401
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,360
Oh, gosh. His brain is pure.

402
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,390
He gives his all on something once he becomes fixated. But he's always wrong.

403
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,830
Exactly. He always heads in the wrong direction.

404
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,270
Same goes for what happened this time.

405
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,280
If he does well, he's Elon Musk,

406
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,430
but in reality, he's closer to being Heo Kyung Hwan.
(Korean comedian)

407
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,150
But Sang Sik is still cute.

408
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,580
I see...

409
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,290
It's a relief to see that you two are on the same page.

410
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,360
But why did you suddenly leave last night?

411
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,850
That's why he worried.

412
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,790
That's because my boyfriend suddenly said he has time.

413
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,290
You have a boyfriend?

414
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,540
Of course.

415
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,970
- What about Sang Sik?
- Sang Sik?

416
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,360
Sang Sik is just a good senior.

417
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,740
As a boyfriend, he's...

418
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,380
You know. He's the best caring guy,

419
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,330
but as a lover, he's a bit...

420
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,230
Is Sang Sik aware of this, too?

421
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,570
Of course.

422
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,240
If he failed that many times, he must know by now.

423
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,530
Oppa! When did you prepare all this?

424
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,010
Do you know how many times I friend-zoned him?

425
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,140
You probably wouldn't know.

426
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,120
How difficult it is to be confessed to all the time.

427
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,810
I'm not totally oblivious or anything.

428
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,100
Anyway, Hae Young wants to get along with Sang Sik.

429
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,310
Sang Sik is a really good person.

430
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,710
He buys me food and coffee all the time.

431
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,940
So, Hae Young doesn't even need to bring her wallet.

432
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,850
He's good at sorting my garbage and discarding my trash.

433
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,110
He's also good at cleaning my dog's poop.

434
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,190
And if we order chicken, he only eats the neck.

435
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,870
Neck...

436
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,210
This is it. I'm not going to get involved between you two again, so keep that in mind.

437
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,880
Yes, of course. I wouldn't want that, either. It has all been resolved now, right?

438
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,730
There wasn't anything to resolve.

439
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,590
Hae Young isn't bothered by it at all and you're overreacting on your own.

440
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,260
Oh, so she just forgot to include an "ha." Thank God.

441
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,140
Do you not understand what I'm saying, Sang Sik?

442
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,500
Hae Young has zero interest in you.

443
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,100
Hae Young is always a bit aloof.

444
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,880
Anyway, you did a good job.

445
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,340
Wait! So you're still going to confess?

446
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,790
I'll take care of that on my own.

447
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,740
Wait!

448
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,190
Have you ever thought that your idea of "some"
(Flirting)

449
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,930
might differ from everyone else's?

450
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:34,610
Senior, I think you told me about 47 seconds ago that you'll no longer get involved.

451
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,340
I won't, I won't, I won't. Geez, it's not like I'm concerned.

452
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,210
This is the end!

453
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,290
Senior!

454
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:46,280
Anyhow, I really thank you.

455
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,560
I think I'll do well this time, thanks to you.

456
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,450
My innovative confession.

457
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,700
Wait...

458
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,830
You know Elon Musk, who you really look up to?

459
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,890
Don't you think Elon Musk gave up on certain things, too?

460
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:03,350
He could've given up on something that didn't work out and ended up creating Tesla.

461
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,250
Wait. I'm going nuts.

462
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,000
Why do you keep trying to prevent me from confessing?

463
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,960
I mean, I was really going to stop suspecting you now, but...

464
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,380
Senior, do you really have feelings for me?

465
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,390
Forget it.

466
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,600
You don't, right?

467
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,380
- I'm going now.
- Fighting.

468
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,820
Senior, you too! I'm going!

469
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,480
Oh, my god.

470
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,860
Whatever.

471
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,610
Whoa, it's restocked.

472
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,950
A penny saved is a penny earned. A penny saved is a penny earned.

473
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,790
I must store it away when it's available.

474
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,380
Three-layer embossed tissue is the best,

475
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,860
but the company is being stingy and doesn't use it these days.

476
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,750
Isn't that Ma Tan?

477
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,360
His posture is so unecessarily upright.

478
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,190
Will he be able to fit in at work when he's that upright?

479
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,430
I figured it would be difficult for you to unpack on your own, Young Boss.

480
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,380
- Let's do it together.
- No. It's fine.

481
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,690
It's fine.

482
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,770
It was your mother's earnest request.

483
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,130
Let's go.

484
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,190
It's really fine.

485
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,660
But please do me a different favor.

486
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,570
Huh? Why is he giving him money?

487
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,080
Please change all of this to coins.

488
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,070
I want to try buying a drink from the company's vending machine.

489
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,600
Wait! Did Ma Tan borrow money from a loan shark?

490
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,710
All right, but we'll take you home. Please don't decline.

491
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,290
We've also prepared the van you wanted to ride, Young Boss.

492
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,150
- Let's go.
- I'm fine.

493
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,150
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

494
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,790
- Your mother is very worried.
- I'm fine.

495
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,040
- I'm fine.
- Shit!

496
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,060
- Please, get in.
- Hold on! Hold on.

497
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,530
Sorry, excuse me.

498
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,290
Hold on... The timing is now!

499
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,570
Don't look back! Don't look back!

500
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,470
Hey, it's getting cold and soggy. What are you waiting for?

501
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,570
Dig in.

502
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,340
Why are you staring at the food as if it's the first time you're eating snack food?

503
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,110
Snack food?

504
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,160
It's my first time trying snack food.

505
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,970
Exactly just how impoverished was his childhood?

506
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,800
Wait a minute. Is he saving the food for later?

507
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,600
Wait! Geez, you punk. Just eat the whole thing!

508
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,720
I'll eat it myself.

509
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,410
Huh? Sure.

510
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,950
Your address was in the middle of nowehere in the countryside.

511
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,160
Do you have someplace to stay in Seoul?

512
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,380
I got a studio near the company.

513
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,460
I finished moving and I just need to unpack tonight.

514
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,690
There's no need to be dispirited or anything because you live in a studio.

515
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,630
I went to and fro work from a study dormitory.
(A space with just enough room for a desk and a single bed.)

516
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,670
But after 20 years,

517
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,770
I bought a 32-pyeong apartment in Seoul!
(1 pyeong=35.5832 sq ft.)

518
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,030
You can do it, too!

519
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,060
Hey, but you ordered some black bean noodles on your moving day, right?

520
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,240
No, I couldn't.

521
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,270
What? This punk doesn't even have enough money for black bean noodles?

522
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,130
Ma'am, please give us two jjajang ramen.

523
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,040
Okay.

524
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,380
Hey, you can make a hole in my wallet today!

525
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,980
Bang!

526
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,930
It rocks, huh?

527
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,780
Hey, why do you have your wallet out?

528
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,340
If your senior buys you food, you just need to say thank you, punk.

529
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,340
I see.

530
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,910
Thank you for the food.

531
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,920
But what's with your wallet? It's all worn at the sides.

532
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,080
My son's old cow leather wallet is laying around at home.

533
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,950
Do you want to use that one? You want it?

534
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,800
This is a one-of-a-kind wallet in the entire world. Is it ugly?

535
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,000
It was handed down to me from my father, but I guess I should change it.

536
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,340
That's why he held on to that shabby wallet...

537
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,400
Follow me.

538
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,360
Here. They're box tissues, but you can have them.

539
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,340
I don't give this to just anyone. Here, here.

540
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,780
Take it and go inside.

541
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,730
Here's one more.

542
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,370
Punk.

543
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,510
I'm so cool today.

544
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,550
Hae Young...

545
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,990
Jupiter and... Jup...

546
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,790
Sang Sik.

547
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,670
What is all this?

548
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:54,870
Hae Young, can you continue to be together with me?

549
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,850
Oppa...

550
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,890
I'll always be by your side.

551
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,470
Just like how I have been all this time.

552
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,070
Hae Young, look at the sky.

553
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:21,480
In order to bless our love, Jupiter and Saturn

554
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,290
have also become one like us.

555
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,320
Oppa...

556
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,580
This is a no-smoking area...

557
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,750
Gosh, whatever.

558
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,840
Yes, Mother.

559
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,900
Assistant Kim said he'd help me, but I declined.

560
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,960
I'm not the Baek Ma Tan who always relied on someone anymore.

561
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,760
It's just a studio, so I can take care of this much.

562
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,260
Don't worry.

563
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,350
I'll hang up now.

564
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,420
Power.

565
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,000
Kang Mi?

566
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,170
What is this?

567
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,410
It's so pretty!

568
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,570
But who...

569
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,090
By any chance...

570
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,960
Hae Young!

571
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,930
Why did you come out?

572
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,180
I told you to wait in the car.

573
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,880
You said the person you're meeting is dear to you.

574
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,350
I wanted to meet him and ask him to take good care of you.

575
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,730
But he's not here yet?

576
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,140
What's this?

577
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,200
- Are you Sang Sik?
- No—

578
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:18,260
Huh?

579
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,920
Oh, are you selling this?

580
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,910
How much is it?

581
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,240
80,000 won...

582
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,370
Can't you go a bit lower?

583
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,880
- No?
- That's not what I mean.

584
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,540
Why isn't Sang Sik coming?

585
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,510
[Sang Sik]

586
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,150
Sang Sik?

587
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,400
Oh, the ring.

588
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,530
What the?

589
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,470
You are Sang Sik.

590
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,800
Sang Sik!

591
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,910
- Oppa!
- Excuse me!

592
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,600
- Excuse me! Take your money!
- Oh, seriously!

593
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,200
HY and SS?

594
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,990
Hae Young...

595
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,010
Sang...

596
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,800
Wow, Ma Tan, you're really rich.

597
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,510
Anyway, you're writing off 100,000 won for this, right?

598
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,470
You did a great job.

599
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,690
Then I'll be off now.

600
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,350
The sound of thunder...

601
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,910
was coming from you.

602
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,280
I didn't even use that much energy.

603
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,170
Would you like to eat something before you leave?

604
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,060
Are you going to ask me to pay for the meal?

605
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm not that shameless.

606
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,440
Old habits die hard.

607
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,230
You must have had a lot of mosquitos at your old house.

608
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,760
Is there anything you want to eat?

609
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,920
[Basakana Chicken]

610
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,080
Well, I'm on a diet,

611
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,080
so I'll just eat the chicken breast.

612
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,420
I'll prepare some forceps for you.

613
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,740
Hey,

614
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,800
chicken tastes best when handled with bare hands and ripped into.

615
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,810
I actually had a heavy dinner.

616
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,330
Please enjoy it, Kang Mi.

617
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,120
No, you should have some, too.

618
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,580
I don't like oily foods—

619
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,700
It's really good.

620
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,690
Is that also chicken breast?

621
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,870
I'll just treat today as chicken day.

622
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,590
M-Ms. Kang Mi...

623
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,520
I'm sorry, but could you wipe your mouth, please?

624
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,740
I don't really like it when things are messy...

625
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,330
Oh, my... is it messy?

626
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,520
Stop, please!

627
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,820
I'll wipe it for you myself.

628
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,450
Okay.

629
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,800
Could you wipe the cheek area, too?

630
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,800
- Ma Tan...
- Mother...

631
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,760
It's still—

632
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,690
Thanks to you, I think I can really pull this off.

633
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,890
An innovative confession.

634
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,370
That's really too harsh...

635
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,550
What is?

636
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,780
Jupiter and Saturn have feelings, too, so she should've at least heard him out.

637
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,350
I mean, she said he was attentive and pure-hearted.

638
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:04,340
Isn't that enough then?

639
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,440
If you're with him, he buys you coffee and food,

640
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,250
takes out all the trash, eating only the radish when eating chicken,

641
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,330
and he even takes care of the dog poop.

642
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,600
Can't she give him a chance at least once at that point?

643
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,220
Why are you angry all of a sudden?

644
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,030
Who is it? A person like that...

645
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,370
There's somebody... Things don't work out for him even when the universe is helping.

♫ I hope that it was you ♫

648
