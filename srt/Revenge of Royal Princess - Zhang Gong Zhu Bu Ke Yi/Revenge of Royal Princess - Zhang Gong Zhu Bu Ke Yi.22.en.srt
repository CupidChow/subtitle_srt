3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,120
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,960
Military power can't be concentrated
in the hands of the Regent alone.

5
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,160
Who is that?

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,100
(Slave)

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,480
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,680
She is the remnant of the Han family.

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
Your Majesty.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,240
I have already said that

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,200
Han Shu cannot be kept.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,320
Han Shu...

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,680
It is impossible for Han Shu
to disobey sister's order.

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,000
The country that Her Highness pacified

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,190
can't be easily obtained by others.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,840
Your Majesty.

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,280
You can call Han Shu into the palace,

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,680
let the guards
lurk in the vicinity,

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,000
and the throwing cup as a signal.

20
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,480
If he doesn't want to rebel,

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,480
he will live in peace.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,440
Is he does,

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,720
just take him down

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,080
to save further trouble.

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,560
Okay.

26
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,480
Someone.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
Drag this person away.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,360
His Royal Highness is coming.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,390
His Majesty was almost assassinated
a few days ago.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,840
Regent, can you give an explanation
to us?

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,160
Why do you ask me to explain?

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,680
Are you afraid of exposing the matter

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,160
of poisoning Royal Princess back then?

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,360
You!

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,960
Don't talk nonsense!

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,360
I'm afraid that the Prince Regent

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,760
will overwhelm His Majesty one day.

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,320
Prime minister.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,080
You first killed Royal Princess,

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
and then slandered Regent.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,840
What?

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,700
Do you want to take control of the emperor?

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,720
Your Majesty.

44
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,800
The two of them are going to rebel.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,640
The Regent is going to rebel.

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,560
Protect the emperor.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,080
You...

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,600
Are you really going to rebel?

49
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,120
Silly brother.

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,200
I am your sister.

51
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,640
Sister.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,000
No way.

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,440
My sister is already dead.

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
In the twelfth year of Yongyun,

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,080
there was an epidemic in the palace.

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,720
I stayed by your bedside for seven days

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,520
before I rescued you.

58
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,000
In the twentieth year of Yongyun,

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,320
Prince Duan's son hurt you on purpose.

60
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,520
I broke his arms and legs

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,760
on the pretext of horse racing with him.

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,680
Later, I was beaten 20 times
with a cane by my grandfather

63
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,000
because I didn't want to admit my mistake.

64
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,600
Sister.

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,920
Is it really you, sister?

66
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,960
Sister.

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
Li Xie.

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
Sister.

69
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Why are you still alive?

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,680
Why can't you just die
in that tomb?

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,400
I knew you were my sister.

72
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,000
But so what?

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,560
You still didn't take me seriously.

74
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,440
Li Xie.

75
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,080
You are my dear brother since childhood.

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,080
Do you know what you're talking about?

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
You spoil me.

78
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,520
You spoil me.

79
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,280
Sister, I know you do.

80
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,960
But do you know how afraid I am of you?
