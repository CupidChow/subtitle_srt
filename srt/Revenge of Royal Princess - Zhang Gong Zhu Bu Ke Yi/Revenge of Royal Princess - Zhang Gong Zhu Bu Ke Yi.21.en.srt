3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,360
Shu, stop it.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,560
I am tired.

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,720
(Why can't I exert my strength?)

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,560
What about the soften powder?

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,080
Your Highness.

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,960
You know what?

9
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,400
I should be the one
who looked like her the most.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,310
But

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,080
why did you appear?

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,240
I won't make it quick.

13
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,280
What about

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
giving me

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,360
your skin?

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,600
Sister.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,880
Your Royal Highness,
Princess Yong'an is missing.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,560
Xie Yugui.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm going to

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,840
peel off your face completely.

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
From here.

22
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,200
It will be more complete.

23
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,320
Remember.

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,320
Don't shake your hands.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
Otherwise,

26
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,160
it won't be a whole.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,960
Don't you think I dare?

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,560
How dare you!

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,040
Shu.

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,960
Keep her.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,760
I need her.

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,440
Xie Yugui.

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,560
Kill me if you dare.

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,360
No worries.

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,120
Don't you like your face the most?

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,720
Xie Yugui.

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,000
You witch!

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
You have to die!

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,560
The Prime Minister's Mansion
has so many medicines.

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,000
Tell me

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
how you poisoned me.

42
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,120
I don't know

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
what you are talking about.

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,200
Did you use that drug on Li Xie?

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,440
What do you mean? I have no idea.

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,720
What are you doing?

47
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,440
Don't move.

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,160
I am applying you medicine.

49
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,320
Of course such a good-looking face

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,360
cannot be ruined.

51
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,480
It's the best honey.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
Presumably

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,720
poisonous insects

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,800
would love to have a bite.

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,440
No!

56
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,120
Please kill me.

57
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,600
I'm not that complice.

58
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,520
I didn't do it.

59
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
I don't know.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,160
It wasn't me.

61
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Yao.

62
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,800
What are you doing?

63
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,680
Dad.

64
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,960
Do I look good?

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,480
Yao, tell me.

66
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,760
Who hurt you like this?

67
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,840
It wasn't me.

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,160
Li Yanchu, why are you everywhere?

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,200
Yao.

70
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,640
Han Shu

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,120
has to die.
