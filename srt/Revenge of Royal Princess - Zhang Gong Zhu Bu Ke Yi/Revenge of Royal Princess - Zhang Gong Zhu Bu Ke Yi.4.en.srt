=Revenge of Royal Princess=

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,540
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,240
Her Highness hit the tenth ring
with three arrows.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,640
Sister.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,040
Do you know what you did wrong?

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,280
No.

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,240
Look at the letter.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,880
It's...

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,400
fake?

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,600
I have taught you for so long

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
to make you capable
of assisting the emperor.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,240
But you didn't even manage to do this.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,480
Sister.

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,360
Since you call me sister,

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,280
you have to be worth it.

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,800
Don't cry.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,240
Sister.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,280
Sister.

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,240
Hold on.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
What's up?

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,360
I have something to discuss with you.

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,360
Brother wants to try boys lately.

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
But those outside may not be reliable.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
He has his eyes on Han Shu.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,640
Sure.

26
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
So, what is he going to

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,880
give me in exchange?

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,640
The fields outside the city,

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
several popular shops in the capital,

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
and the chef who is even better
than that of the imperial kitchen.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,320
And that sparrow screen bow

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
you've always wanted.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,080
How dare you!

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,920
I would rather die

35
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,480
than be that kind of person.

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,080
Someone!

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,880
Ask Brother to find someone else.

38
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,760
Han Shu

39
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,960
is my exclusive plaything.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,800
All right.

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,860
(After three months)

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,640
Steady yourself.

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,120
Show me.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,720
Sister.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,440
Well done.
