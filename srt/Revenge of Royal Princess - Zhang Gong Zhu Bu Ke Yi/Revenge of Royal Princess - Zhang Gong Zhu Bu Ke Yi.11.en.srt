3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,840
I have been imprisoned by you
for so long.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,560
It's time for you to taste
what it's like.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,560
Han Shu.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,080
I am still a kid.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,920
Don't do this in front of me.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,560
Sister!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,080
(The person who poisoned me
may hurt Li Xie.)

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,080
(I can't let him know who I am now.)

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,560
You look so much like my sister.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,800
Let's go.
I will take you back to the palace.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,440
Han Shu.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,840
I will take this woman back
to the palace for a few days.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,840
Let's go.

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,600
Xie Yugui.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,680
Has anyone ever told you that

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,000
you look a lot like the Royal Princess?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,120
I dare not

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,400
compare with the Royal Princess.

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,600
Right.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,840
Your submissive look

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,320
is totally different

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,600
from my arrogant elder sister.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,560
By the way,

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,680
can you shoot arrows?

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,040
No.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,400
Then stay in the palace.

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,280
You may excuse yourself now.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,760
Miss Guo.

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,000
Everything the Royal Princess loved

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,560
during her lifetime is here.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,680
Thank you so much.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,640
Thanks to the help from the Gu family
all these years.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,280
Not at all.

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,960
I also have to thank Prime Minister Guo

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,200
for promoting me.

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,560
The Gu family is indeed the lackey
of the Prime Minister.

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,160
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,880
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,240
Sister.

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
Sister.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,240
I miss you so much.

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,160
Sister.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,080
Sorry.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
I didn't protect you well.

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,920
(No.)

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,960
(It's not the time yet.)

49
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,000
This is my sister's favorite hairpin

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
during her lifetime.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,840
Your Royal Highness,
His Majesty calls you into the palace.

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,720
I see.

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,200
Are you Sister?

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
Your Royal Highness.

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,920
Who gave you permission
to wear her clothes?

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,840
His Majesty.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,520
Take them off.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
How dare you!
