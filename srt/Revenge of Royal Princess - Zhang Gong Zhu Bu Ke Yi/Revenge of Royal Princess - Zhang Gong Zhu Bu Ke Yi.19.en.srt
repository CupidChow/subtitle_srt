00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,540
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,680
Witch

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,360
or disaster?

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,560
It is because of you that Royal Princess
cannot rest in peace.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,800
Really?

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,080
But Royal Princess didn't say that to me.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,480
No more nonsense.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Royal Princess let me ask you

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,200
why do ou aim at me

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,640
and Regent all the time.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,160
Is there any wild ambition?

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,200
Royal Princess won't let you
convey such words.

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,240
This is

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,160
the peacock bow that was buried
with Royal Princess.

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Isn't it lost?

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,760
This is Royal Princess's favorite
peacock bow when she was alive.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,520
It was taken away before.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,000
Prime Minister Guo.

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,920
If you don't watch your words,

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,360
Royal Princess will also take you away.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
Does sister have anything to tell me?

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,120
(Idiot)

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,480
Never mind.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,680
I am glad that you are back.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,240
Han Shu.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,760
Just now Guo Yao wanted to
attempt suicide for you.

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,440
Even I was moved by her infatuation.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,080
You have been infatuated with sister
and haven't married for many years.

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,480
I will make a decision for you.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,600
How about getting married with Guo Yao?

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,480
Great, Your Royal Highness.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,200
No need.

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,560
Your Majesty don't need to
worry about my affairs.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
Your Majesty.

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,240
As long as I can stay
with His Royal Highness,

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,680
I am willing to be a maid even.

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,640
What a perfect match.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
Right, Your Royal Highness?

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,040
Sister!

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,120
Come here.

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,680
Kneel down.

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,440
Your Royal Highness.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
This is Dr. Cheng who treated
Royal Princess back then.

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,840
Greetings to Your Royal Highness.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,480
Back then, Royal Princess

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,040
had shown signs of physical exhaustion.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,360
What did you say?

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
When I visited Royal Princess
for the last time,

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,760
she had less than three days to live.

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,760
Your Royal Highness.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,920
I also found out that...

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,480
Say it.

54
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,080
The assassin back then

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,370
was Royal Princess's confidant.

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,800
Shu.

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,320
Why are you here?

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,750
You knew you were going to die.

59
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,520
You know it all?

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,400
You are only concerned about Li Xie,
your younger brother.

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,160
You used your own life
to set up a trap to save me,

62
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,080
in exchange for me being devoted to you

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,000
and working for the Li Royal Family.

64
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,160
My presence was a mistake.

65
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,360
I shouldn't have been there.

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,000
Good for you, sister.

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,680
So what if I did it?

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,480
What do you want to do?

69
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,720
How dare you!

70
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,680
You forced me to do this.

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,640
And you have to take it.
