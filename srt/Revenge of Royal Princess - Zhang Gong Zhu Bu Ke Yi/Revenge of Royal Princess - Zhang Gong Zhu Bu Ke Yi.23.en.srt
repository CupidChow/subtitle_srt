3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,880
I knew you were my sister.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,280
But so what?

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,840
You still didn't take me seriously.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,800
Li Xie.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,520
You are my dear brother since childhood.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,520
Do you know what you're talking about?

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,000
Sister.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,240
Look.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
Back then,

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,600
the current situation was turbulent,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,040
you helped me ascend the throne
with your own strength.

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,320
But you raised Han Shu step by step.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,840
Do you know how scared I am?

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,160
Sister.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,040
Sister.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,720
I miss you so much, sister.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,920
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,720
You got the wrong person.

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,480
Sister, sorry.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
Only when you are dead
can I truly love you.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,600
Your Majesty.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,560
Only the blood sacrifice of Xie Yugui

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,480
can the people of the country
be protected

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,760
and Royal Princess be rest in peace.

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,080
No matter you are Xie Yugui or Li Yanchu,

28
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,840
you have to stay in this tomb forever.

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,160
I thought that as long as you left,

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,960
I would be able to firmly hold the country.

31
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,120
But you left me Han Shu,

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,000
the one I hate the most.

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,160
Sister.

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,520
You are never softhearted.

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,920
Why is he an exception?

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,760
Li Xie.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Is that what you think of me?

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,240
Sister.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
You could have lived a few more days.

40
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,880
But you got too close to him.

41
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,520
So you have to die.

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,880
So it was you

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,200
who poisoned me?

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,520
You hate me that much?

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,240
Sister used her life
to let me be loyal to you.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,120
But you poisoned her?

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,160
Li Xie.

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,960
Good for you.

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,560
You played a trick on me

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,240
even before I died.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,760
And I am so stupid.

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,160
I thought we loved each other.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
So I did everything

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
to keep you safe.

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,240
But it's still no match

56
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,960
for your jealousy.

57
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,760
So what are you going to do?

58
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,280
Kill me

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,280
for Han Shu?

60
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,800
Or do you want to be an empress?

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,840
Li Xie.

62
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,160
I love you

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,800
and protect you.

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,160
Yet you never understood me.

65
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
I never wanted the throne.

66
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
I wish you

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
a long life

68
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,080
on your icy dragon throne.

69
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,720
The Regent sought power to usurp the throne

70
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,320
and held Princess Yong'an hostage.

71
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
Take him down now,

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,320
no matter he's alive or dead.

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,840
Come someone!

74
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,160
Hunt them down!
