=Episode 17=

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,120
Heavenly Hound Eclipse,
yang waning and yin waxing.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,320
Take Princess Yong'an as a sacrifice

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,400
to comfort Royal Princess in heaven.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,400
Take her down!

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,800
Xie Yugui.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,880
Don't even think about coming out

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,640
once you're in.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,360
I will take care of His Royal Highness.

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,160
Your Royal Highness.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,840
Let me go, dad.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,080
Your Royal Highness.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,640
Han Shu doesn't like you at all.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,760
Why are you doing this?

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,320
Your Royal Highness.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,240
Why are you here?

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,440
Untie me.

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,560
Stop wasting your efforts.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,200
The tomb was designed by sister herself.

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,160
This funeral room

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,000
is exactly the same as the main room,

23
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,200
without air holes

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,640
and light.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,160
After a few hours

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,800
we would suffocate to death.

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,560
Then why are you still in?

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Do you

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,560
want to die?

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,760
Are you doing this for me

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
or for Royal Princess?

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,680
Seriously,

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,920
I am quite curious.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,040
Li Yanchu saved you at that time

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
only to pave the way for Li Xie.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,720
Are you really willing to be
the lackey of the Li family

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,280
without any complaints?

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,480
I once promised a person

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,440
to protect what she sheltered,

40
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,240
to love the people she loved.

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,360
I will never

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,080
put my country in danger

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,320
in my lifetime.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
I promised her

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,440
and I would never break my promise.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,680
Follow me.

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,280
Who are you?

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,080
How do you know about the blank door?

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,200
Whoever you think I am.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,880
Li Yanchu.

51
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,840
You are by my side,
but why do you keep hiding from me?

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,080
If I hadn't kept you back then,

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,560
if I hadn't entered here today,

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,600
would I have lost you again?

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,680
It hurts.

56
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,560
Xie Yugui, Li Yanchu.

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Why are you lying to me?

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,640
Han Shu.

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,240
I have my own reasons.

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,680
Sister.

61
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,960
When I thought I was going to
die here,

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,880
my mind was full of you.

63
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,560
Sister.

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
Let's get married?

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,600
Let's get married?

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,560
Enough?

67
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,560
If so,

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,040
just stop it.
