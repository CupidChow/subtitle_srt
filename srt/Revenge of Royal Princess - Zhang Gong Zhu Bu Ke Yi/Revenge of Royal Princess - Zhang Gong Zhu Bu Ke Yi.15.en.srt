Han Shu

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,760
stood me up again.

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,360
Xie Yugui.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,960
Would you like to hang out with me?

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,320
Well.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,040
You look so much like my sister.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,320
It's too ostentatious for you
to go out like this.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,080
Wouldn't it be more ostentatious

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,280
for Your Majesty to go out like this?

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:40,980
Let's go.

(Zuixianju Tavern)

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,040
You look so beautiful.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,200
Save it.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,960
Let's drink.

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,760
In the past, Royal Princess and I

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,680
often ran out of the palace
to drink like this.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,760
Really?

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,680
Yes.

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,640
Sister could hold her liquor.

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
To be honest,

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,160
I was afraid of the dark when I was a kid.

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,800
Sister told me stories

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,200
and coaxed me to sleep.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,080
If I was being bullied,

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,040
she would ask him to race a horse.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,200
Guess what happened?

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,640
What?

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,600
She took the opportunity
to kick the man off the horse.

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,760
And his limbs were all broken.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,360
You look so beautiful.

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,640
Nice staff.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,440
- You!
- You are courting death.

35
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,560
Give it to me.

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,120
Please spare my life!

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,840
Piss off!

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,200
How dare him covet my beauty?

39
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,320
You'd better not lose

40
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,520
such an important thing.

Li Xie.

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,360

This is the peace buckle that
I prayed for three months.

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,880
Keep it well.

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,440
Look good?

47
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,080
Sister, let's play together.

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,040
Sister.

I am Shu.

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,400
Sister, don't go.

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,160
Sister.

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,560
Why are you here?

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,400
Are you having nightmares?

56
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,680
Why are you not her?

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,160
Say you love me.

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,720
I love you.

59
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,520
King Regent.

60
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,960
Get out.

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,440
You are not allowed to come in

62
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,680
without my order.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,760
I tried on the makeup

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,960
you made on me earlier.

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,920
Look alike?

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,760
Shu.

67
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,520
Don't speak to me

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,800
in her tone.

69
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
This round doesn't count.

70
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,960
Once more.

71
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,120
Your Majesty just stole
my five chess pieces?

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,720
But even so,

73
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,600
you will definitely

74
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,680
lose this round

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,120
within ten steps.

76
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,560
Sister taught you so much,

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,920
but you haven't learned anything
except cheating.

78
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Stop it!

79
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,720
Once more.

80
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,160
Your Majesty.

81
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,360
Come on.

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
I don't know if I should tell you
something or not.

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,880
Then don't.

84
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
Today I passed by the back garden

85
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,600
and accidentally ran into

86
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,520

87
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,560
