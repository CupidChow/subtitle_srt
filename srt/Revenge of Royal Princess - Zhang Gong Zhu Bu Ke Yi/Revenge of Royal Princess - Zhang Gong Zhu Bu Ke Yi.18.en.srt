3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,240
Everyone says that

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,840
a couple should treat each other
with courtesy,

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,280
and there should be mutual help and relief
in time of poverty.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,120
Is it true that only if you marry me

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,000
can I have you forever?

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,920
Han Shu.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,680
Do you know what you are doing?

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,080
Sister.

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,280
I got you.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,320
Untie me.

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,160
You are the prettiest person

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,720
I have ever seen in red.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Especially today's set

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
is the most gorgeous.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,400
Sister.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,360
Since you rescued me
from the execution ground,

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,520
I can never leave you again.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,320
Let's get married today.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,840
How dare you!

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,360
Don't cry.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,960
(One month later)
Sister.

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,240
Sister.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,360
Don't ignore me.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,920
Sister.

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,520
You stepped on my dress.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
- Let me go.
- Sister.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
Let me go.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,960
Sister, I won't cry now.

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,720
Sister.

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,760
Sister, try it.

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,360
Take a try.

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,880
Sister.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,240
Sister.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:49,920
Sister.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,880
Sister, what are you reading?

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,920
Sister.

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,440
Sister.

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,560
Sister.

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
Let me choose for you.

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
I am combing my hair.

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
Why are you giving me this?

44
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,240
Hairpin.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,680
Punish me, sister.

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,760
The whip...

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,680
Are you here to apologize?

48
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,080
I haven't used it for a long time.

49
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I wonder if I would...

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,360
Kill me, sister.

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,800
Why should I listen to you?

52
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,520
Don't call me sister again.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,730
Others would think it horrifying.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,480
Yan?

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,360
Your Majesty.

56
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,040
Now King Regent died in the tomb
with the witch.

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,800
How to deal with the military power
of King Regent?

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,720
Your Majesty.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,600
Now that His Royal Highness is gone,

60
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,680
what should I do next?

61
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,400
Your Majesty, I am begging you.

62
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,480
I am willing to marry King Regent.

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,600
King Regent died for love with that witch.

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,680
What does it have to do with you?

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,880
It's not your turn to attempt suicide.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,000
Get up.

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,120
Now that Princess Yong'an is dead,
why can't I?

68
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,840
Miss Guo, why are you saying

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,880
that I am dead?
