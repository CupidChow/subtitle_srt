00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,260
=Revenge of Royal Princess=

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,540
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,120
Where did that person come from?

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,840
There is mud on his shoes.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,640
Last night, it rained only in the
village outside the south of the city.

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,680
So, he came in from the south.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,200
Yes.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,160
What about that man?

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,560
He has calluses between thumb and index.
This means he's good at using the sword.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,880
(Token)
He has a serpentine badge with him.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,000
He works for the Prime Minister.

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,480
Your Majesty,

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,880
(Li Xie, the Emperor)
Han Shu cannot be kept alive.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,450
(Prime Minister Guo)
Since you ascended the throne,

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,440
the Royal Princess has been attending to
state affairs behind the scenes.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,520
Now, she went against your will

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,760
and brought Han Shu
out of the execution site.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,560
Rumors are spreading in the capital

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,000
that Han Shu is a threat, Your Majesty.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Well.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,560
I have no say in my sister's affairs.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,120
Your Majesty.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,840
Say it to her yourself.

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,440
Well...

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,880
I am afraid of being beaten.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,720
Please excuse me for leaving,

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,760
Your Majesty.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,560
Support forward and pull back.
Pull the bow steadily,

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,640
and release the bow decisively.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,960
Sister.

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,800
You have never taught me
to shoot arrows like this.

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,600
Is he your brother or am I?

33
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,240
Stop it.

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,360
I offered to teach you earlier.

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,400
But you refused to learn
because your hands hurt.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,320
Today just practice here

37
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
what I taught you before.

38
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,400
Well.

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,800
I recently discovered
a very nice patisserie.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,840
So, I bought it.

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,760
Really?

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Yes.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
Sister treats me so well.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
Sister.

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,240
Practice for one more hour.

46
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,720
I am in a good mood today.
It's for you.

47
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,200
Come here.

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,720
Change my clothes for me.

49
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,800
Remember my usual makeup look?

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,760
Yes.

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,840
Hold your hands steady.

52
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,120
When did I use this color?

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,040
I only use the brightest one.

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,480
Yes.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Do one thing for me.

56
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,520
Yes.
