=Episode 9=

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,080
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,480
King Regent blocked the official road

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,920
and mobilized the Eagle Guards

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,440
to track down a thief in the whole city.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,840
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,200
Shut up.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,720
Who provoked him?

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,040
Not courtiers.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,440
It was because the tomb of
the Royal Princess was robbed.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,000
How is my sister?

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,440
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,160
The coffin of the Royal Princess
is safe and sound.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,880
Stop.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Take off the hat.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,360
I'm so ugly that

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,680
I'm afraid to scare you.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,600
No more nonsense.

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,400
Go.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,520
Wait.

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,520
How did you get hurt?

23
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,360
My husband, Gu Yan, was killed

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,360
by gangsters a few days ago.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,160
I was also injured.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,720
Everyone in the city knows about this.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,240
Your Royal Highness, the whole city
has been checked.

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,160
(This is a sword wound.)

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,680
(I failed to rob the tomb.)

30

(I can only go back to the Royal
Princess' Mansion)

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,320
(to get some precious things.)

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,440
My clothes.

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,560
Make that expression again.

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,120
(If I want to find out who poisoned me,)

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
(I can't reveal my identity now.)

36
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,760
I...

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,240
I don't know what you're saying.

38
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,160
Someone get in here!

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,880
Stay with me

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,960
from now on.

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,160
Stay with him?

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,040
After Sister passed away,
he held her body for several days,

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
and no one dared to approach him.

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,960
It was I who separated them,

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,520
and buried my sister.

46
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
Otherwise,

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,520
how could he survive till today?

48
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,040
Yes.
