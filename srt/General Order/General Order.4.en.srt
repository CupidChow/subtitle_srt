2
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,480
It's a bunch of junk!

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,400
All is useless!

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,440
Who exactly is this Lu Li?

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,440
Why did he

6
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,880
have my suitcase?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Who is it?

8
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,720
It's me.

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,280
It's late, and what's wrong?

10
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
You'd go out with me tomorrow.

11
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,000
No.

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,960
Why?

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,320
Why did you leave me alone

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,820
but to investigate yourself?

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
It's far from the Ministry.

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,320
And there are a few people along.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,640
Your safety is concerned me.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,130
It makes sense a bit.

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,310
Did you find any clues today?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,060
There was no one named Wen

21
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,080
among the scholars.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,280
What should we do then?

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,200
We can only look for other clues.

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
You just said

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,560
where would you take me tomorrow?

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Go to the Palace.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,520
What?

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,540
His Majesty wants to see you.

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,360
Just have some rest early.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,520
By the way,

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,200
why did you say you wanted to be taken?

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
Well...

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,560
I mean

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,920
I want to make more friends.

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,330
You coughed badly.

36
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,640
Come on to have some rest.

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
Fine.

38
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:29,960
You're coughing badly.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,000
Hurry up and have some rest.

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Don't worry about me.

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,960
I won't show it up if knowing this.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,560
Master, it's not your fault.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,720
Surprisingly, she could unlock it.

44
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,000
You know it's a Pandora's box!

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
Am I right?

46
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,470
I can't figure it out.

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,440
Why does Granny Ke, whom

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,310
my grandfather spoke of look so young?

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,510
In my book,

50
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,350
I think,

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,700
she might be a descendant of Granny Ke.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,560
And you just took the Box to her

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,830
in person.

54
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,580
It could be quite a story!

55
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,800
She...

56
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,280
The point is she's

57
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,660
Dai Yu's wife.

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,920
Once I think of my grandfather's thing

59
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,260
falling into Dai Yu's hands,

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,280
I...

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,610
I just feel quite angry.

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,770
Well...

63
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,640
I have a trick.

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,090
That will make you overwhelm Dai Yu.

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,640
Also, that'll bring the Box

66
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,600
back to our manor.

67
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
Speak it out!

68
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,520
Will it work?

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,840
As far as I know,

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,450
the General's wife has

71
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,880
lost her memory

72
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,920
since she was poisoned.

73
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,100
Now, it'll be the best opportunity.

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,320
There is no other way at the moment.

75
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
Let's do as you said.

76
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,160
Before I brought the Box

77
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,320
to them,

78
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,120
I took a treasure out in secret.

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
It's the right time to make use of it.

80
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
Jiu,

81
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
you're still the clever one.

82
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,280
Such a crystal-clear gem like this,

83
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
it must be valuable.

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,600
Exactly.

85
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,840
When you meet His Majesty later,

86
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,080
you should be well-behaved.

87
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,680
General Dai,

88
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,160
the Empress wants your wife.

89
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,560
Ms. Dai.

90
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,670
I pay respect to you.

91
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
You two have just married.

92
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,040
Are you comfortable living here?

93
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,080
Your Highness,

94
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,920
I feel ok.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,920
I really care about

96
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,480
the General's marriage.

97
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,200
At first,

98
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,880
I thought the General would marry

99
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,480
Captain Mo's daughter.

100
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,480
(Mo Xiaoxiao)
They lived together.

101
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,240
I truly favored

102
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Xiaoxiao.

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,280
She's Lady Dai.

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
Xiaoxiao.

105
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,880
I will speak frankly.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,280
You two grew up together.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
Did you never fall in love?

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Your Highness,

109
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,600
There's only sibling affection

110
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,200
between us.

111
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,240
Your Highness,

112
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
Miss Mo is so young now.

113
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,480
Even if she falls in love with him,

114
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,720
how will she speak it out?

115
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,240
Just be frank before me.

116
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,040
Xiaoxiao,

117
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,200
If you truly have affections,

118
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,220
I can also go with the flow,

119
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,000
ordering the General to marry you.

120
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,800
Lady Dai, suppose you wouldn't mind

121
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,200
having one more person

122
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,840
to wait on the General together.

123
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,320
Your Highness,

124
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,480
I can't have the final say

125
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,640
for the General's affairs.

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,140
Moreover,

127
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
Miss Xiaoao, who is

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,490
a noble girl.

129
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,240
How could she be a concubine?

130
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,880
Speaking of this,

131
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,050
There's neither a matchmaker's words,

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,640
nor the deal

133
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,720
between you and Dai Yu.

134
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
It's hard to say

135
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,540
who the wife is, or

136
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,850
who the concubine will be

137
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
between you and Xiaoxiao.

138
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,200
If

139
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,840
Xiaoxiao will be the wife,

140
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,320
and you'll be the concubine,

141
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,800
will it please you?

142
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,760
I have admired Wan'er for a long time.

143
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,160
Besides her, I have no
other girls in my heart.

144
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,240
I

145
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,700
pay respects to you, Your Highness.

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,940
The General's Token witnessed that

147
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,640
Wan'er is my wife. I knelt

148
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,800
in front of Su

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
and married properly.

150
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,600
You came to me

151
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,080
just in time.

152
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,160
You're joking, Your Highness.

153
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,520
His Majesty wants my wife.

154
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,240
I came here to ask my wife to go there.

155
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,080
Your Majesty!

156
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,800
Raise your head.

157
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,510
(Site of Xinwu Tomb)
Be very careful!

158
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,740
I tried my best to beg for this chance.

159
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,260
(Sun Duo, a student)
I won't fail you!

160
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Su Ke.

161
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,510
Sun Duo.

162
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,180
Su Ke.

163
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,430
Sun Duo.

164
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,720
It's you!

165
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,720
I finally met someone I never knew!

166
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,800
What's wrong?

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
I'm getting older.

168
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,320
I'm not as healthy as before.

169
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,160
- Well...
- Missed you, Su Ke.

170
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,160
Don't stand and talk.

171
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,360
Sit over there. Let's go.

172
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,120
Sit here.

173
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,760
Have your seat.

174
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Dragon chair, seriously?

175
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll sit here.

176
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,450
Do you get used to it?

177
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,080
It took me a long time.

178
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,520
Not as comfortable
as I was at school.

179
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,080
You still haven't told me

180
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,010
why is your hair all white?

181
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
And how did this beard grow out?

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,220
I've been here too long.

183
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,090
I'm already old.

184
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,720
Su Ke, how long have you been here?

185
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,000
I've been here for

186
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,960
a week. How about you?

187
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,680
I've been here for

188
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,100
twenty-eight years.

189
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,050
Twenty-eight years?

190
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,880
How can there be such a big difference?

191
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,910
Have you seen the others?

192
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,220
The others?

193
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,830
Nobody.

194
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,640
Ming Ting,

195
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,520
His Majesty granted something to eat.

196
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,460
He wanted to share with Su.

197
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,400
He also prepared some for you.

198
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,080
Please move to the side hall to enjoy.

199
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,400
I appreciate His Majesty's kindness.

200
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,000
No need for that.

201
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
Ming Ting, relax.

202
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
I'd be with you to wait together.

203
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,820
Sun Duo,

204
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,400
I'm telling you that

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,700
when I first came, it was so scary!

206
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,520
Someone tried to kill me.

207
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,840
Who dared?

208
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
- I'm telling you.
- Who?

209
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,000
Someone who can

210
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,360
fly in the sky.

211
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,320
You know that?

212
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,640
I've only seen it in TV dramas.

213
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,840
I can't stand staying here.

214
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,100
I almost got killed!

215
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Drink less!

216
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,880
Su Ke.

217
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm ok.

218
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,630
I need to go home.

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,280
- You got drunk.
- No.

220
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,160
Stop drinking.

221
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
You didn't drink it.

222
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,000
Leave the wine alone!

223
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,360
You can't have double eyelids.

224
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
You must have single eyelids.

225
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,560
Alright.

226
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,120
I'll drink this cup to the bottom.

227
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,240
Just wet your lips.

228
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,720
Nonsense!

229
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,240
Cheers!

230
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,330
I'm telling you, Sun Duo.

231
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
I'm looking for a way back.

232
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,270
Once I find it...

233
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Su Ke.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,840
I'll

235
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,600
take you away with me.
