=Episode 13=

2
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,420
Your Majesty,

3
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,980
I've sent people to invite Su.

4
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,820
Just burn

5
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,820
all of these things!

6
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,620
The target has arrived.

7
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,340
It's useless.

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,100
I got it.

9
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,080
Miss.

10
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,940
Why will I be chosen as an official?

11
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,180
Miss, why not stay here?

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,460
Or, I'll fail the general.

13
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,380
You'd better go back to Su Mansion.

14
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,100
Suppose you'll really leave

15
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,540
this mansion?

16
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,780
You're a good girl.

17
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,420
But I can't give you an explanation

18
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,900
about so many things

19
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,340
at the moment.

20
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,260
In the coming days,

21
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,680
you need to take good care of yourself.

22
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,220
You can't trust others easily.

23
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,460
Don't do the way I did,

24
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,060
marring someone who

25
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,100
only wants to use you

26
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,780
and cheat you.

27
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,780
At last, you're

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,900
almost killed.

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,860
Lady, you're right.

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,380
I could be a better match for you.

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,740
I should've been a warrior.

32
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,820
Indeed, you've got wronged.

33
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,660
Now, the city is in peril.

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,580
If you could be able to

35
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,840
serve the Emperor, that would be best.

36
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,220
It's been a long time waiting.

37
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,900
Time to go.

38
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,420
The decree from the Emperor.

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,780
Su Wan'er, daughter of Su He,

40
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,380
is virtuous and talented,

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,740
and also knowledgeable.

42
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,900
She shall be hired as an instructor

43
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,260
to enter the Palace immediately.

44
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,660
That's all.

45
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,780
I'll obey

46
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,860
what His Majesty ordered.

47
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,180
Go ahead.

48
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,340
Got it.

49
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,980
Come on, have your seat.

50
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,980
See, too much etiquette

51
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,020
has to be observed here.

52
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,420
Although I'm now the Emperor,

53
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,380
I can't do whatever I like.

54
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,540
I make you feel not to be at home,

55
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,620
that'll upset you.

56
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,740
Never mind.

57
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,420
Anyway,

58
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,220
I feel at ease to

59
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,180
be with my friend.

60
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,620
And,

61
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
it's much better than where I lived

62
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,420
with tasty food

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,980
and better accommodations.

64
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,580
If you like here,

65
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,620
just stay.

66
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,740
I'll guard you.

67
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,620
Come on.

68
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,020
Su Ke,

69
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,140
I heard that

70
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,500
you and the general quarreled.

71
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,540
Would I come to help you with it?

72
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,060
Forget it.

73
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,420
Anyway, I'll have

74
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,180
nothing to do with him.

75
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,100
I have to go back, sooner or later.

76
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,780
Finding a way back early

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,340
that really matters.

78
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,940
Relax.

79
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,340
I've sent my men for it.

80
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,420
I definitely

81
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,540
take you back.

82
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,660
Don't worry about it.

83
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,700
Why is it so far?

84
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,540
Wait.

85
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,340
Are you the guy who told me

86
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,060
Liu arrived back then?

87
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,900
Instructor,

88
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,060
you got drunk.

89
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,220
Impossible!

90
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,620
How could you be here?

91
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,300
Are you from the general mansion?

92
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,460
You got me wrong, for sure.

93
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,540
- Su.
- Impossible!

94
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,580
Su, I have a pressing issue!

95
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,980
Just stand by.

96
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,300
You come here.

97
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,820
Su!

98
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,380
It's really important to you!

99
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,580
Fine!

100
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
Mingting...

101
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,500
I fear Mingting will die soon.

102
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,780
Now, he's been badly treated,

103
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,580
being asked to attend the Meeting.

104
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,580
And he's willing to ask for death.

105
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,860
Su,

106
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,100
nobody but you can stop him!

107
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,740
Su!

108
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,980
What are you saying?

109
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,380
(Dai Mansion)

110
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,900
(Dai Mansion)

111
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,340
Su.

112
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,820
As for the Meeting,

113
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,900
in name, it's a feast,

114
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,060
but something's different, in fact.

115
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,700
Lu Li gave us three trials.

116
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,540
If someone could successfully pass,

117
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,260
they would get the greatest treasure.

118
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,510
It's the Tongtian Treasure Mirror.

119
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,340
There are always hundreds of talents

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,620
fighting for it till their death.

121
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,060
Mingting can't

122
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,060
last long till the end.

123
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,540
Su,

124
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,940
I've long heard about your disputes.

125
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,300
That day,

126
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,140
I saw Mingting

127
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,300
having a good talk with the Emperor.

128
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
Su, you got him wrong, for sure.

129
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,540
Maybe,

130
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,220
someone is pretending to be him.

131
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,780
Su,

132
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,820
no one else but you can stop him.

133
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Xiaoxiao,

134
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,100
thank you for telling me these things

135
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,340
(Dai Mansion)

136
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,300
The Gate will be sealed at midnight.

137
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,160
Stay if there are no important matters.

138
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,980
Look at you, it's not in accordance with etiquette.

139
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,340
You truly value etiquette!

140
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,420
If I say I'm here to save you,

141
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,380
will it count as an important matter?
