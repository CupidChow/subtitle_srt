2
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,820
(Dai Yu, General of Wu)

3
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,620
(One Day Ago)

4
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,160
General, a message.

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,230
Another woman was killed.

6
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,800
Who?

7
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,940
(Han Qing, DC)
I've confirmed it.

8
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,350
It's Su Wan'er,
the Minister of Rites's only daughter.

9
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,830
Is she Su He?

10
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,670
Exactly.

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,950
I've compared the picture to that of

12
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,040
Su Wan'er's relatives for checking.

13
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,810
Her looking almost resembles
the six previous victims.

14
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,000
I could make sure
Su Wan'er's death,

15
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,680
I'd overturn for my father,

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,480
or I would know where he hid.

17
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,580
(Su He, Minister of Rites of Wu)

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,960
Su,

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,760
your daughter's
death is a myth.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,270
She can't be laid to rest simply.

21
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,070
Han Qing.

22
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,440
Open the coffin!

23
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,120
I want to perform an autopsy.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,240
Nonsense!

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Dai Yu, won't you attaint
my daughter's purity

26
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,360
if you open it?

27
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,720
If so,

28
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,800
I have to do it by
the General's Order.

29
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,900
(The General Token)

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,000
The General's given
three jade Tokens.

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,560
Once it's broken,

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,910
it's as if the Emperor's here in person.

33
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,600
All ministers must obey the order.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,500
(The General Token)

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,110
Broken. As if the Decree's presented.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,270
Today, I'll marry your daughter.

37
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,830
And I'll also give her a grand burial

38
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,050
in the name of a general's wife.

39
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,280
Miss Su, please forgive my rudeness.

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,980
(Su Ke, a student of
an archaeology club)

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,880
- Back to life!
- Resurrection!

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,960
Come on, go! She's risen!

43
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,580
- Go in a hurry!
- Run quickly!

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,200
My little hottie,

45
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,070
you...

46
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,010
are you filming?

47
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,510
Wan'er!

48
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,470
You're still alive!

49
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,800
My daughter came to life again!

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
- Hold on, madam!
- Madam!

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,320
This guy is not my daughter at all!

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Well...

53
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,030
I felt so sorry, guys.

54
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,190
- When she was laid to rest...
- So sorry.

55
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,520
- it wasn't that!
- Sorry to bother!

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,110
- Sorry.
- But, why

57
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,160
does she look exactly like the miss?

58
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,450
Are you one of us or a ghost?

59
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,190
What's the following line?

60
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,630
I'm just an intruder.

61
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,080
I should've been at...

62
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,620
(Archaeological site of Xinwu's Tomb)

63
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,820
(The General's Token)

64
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,260
(The General's Token)

65
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,180
(The General's Token)

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,390
(Really?)

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,160
(I've really time-traveled!)

68
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,480
(How nonsense it is!)

69
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,000
I want to know

70
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,880
what year is it now?

71
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,670
The 20th year of Jingwu's Reign.

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,720
General!

73
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,040
It's...

74
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,880
- It's not a dream.
- Su.

75
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,790
Your daughter has come back to life,

76
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,000
so I want it to be a wedding.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,790
- What happened?
- I'll take away.

78
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,070
Dai Yu!

79
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,430
Wan'er!

80
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,760
- I said sorry.
- Miss!

81
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,640
What a nonsense!

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,480
Master.

83
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,190
I'm telling you that

84
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,550
you can't afford to try anything!

85
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,070
I'm a girl with kung fu.

86
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,950
I want to go home!

87
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,390
Open your mouth!

88
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,510
(No signs of poisoning)

89
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,230
- (Have I misled?)
- Miss!

90
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,230
Miss!

91
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,580
(Yingao, a servant girl in Su Mansion.)

92
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
General.

93
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,670
Take her to bathe and change.

94
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,460
(Dai Mansion)

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,070
(Is he a real general?)

96
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,270
(So rude to me!)

97
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,640
(Made a move on me!)

98
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,000
(He seems to be the wrong kind of man.)

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,280
Assassin!

100
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,790
Come to protect the general!

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,790
General, are you alright?

102
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,670
Back off!

103
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,560
General,

104
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,590
The saber definitely belongs here!

105
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,270
Someone dares to run espionage here!

106
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,830
Our opponent is really something.

107
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,230
You just brought Su Wan'er here.

108
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,670
The killer followed you to show up.

109
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,390
Will we take Su Wan'er somewhere else?

110
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,910
No.

111
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,640
Just keep her here.

112
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,190
Remember,

113
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,780
what we want is the killer,

114
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,910
then to overturn for my father.

115
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,040
(Are you kidding me?)

116
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,070
(Others who time travel live in luxury)

117
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,160
(going right in ancient times.)

118
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,880
(But I came here to be hunted.)

119
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,550
(I already suck!)

120
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,480
Miss!

121
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
Are you ok?

122
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,350
I told you that you got me wrong.

123
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,070
I'm not your miss, really.

124
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,510
You indeed look exactly like

125
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,160
our miss!

126
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,630
What do you think of

127
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,510
Su Wan'er?

128
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,440
This Su Wan'er person

129
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,830
speaks and acts rudely

130
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,350
with a weird dress code.

131
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,510
She's not the real Su Wan'er.

132
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,550
Are you sure?

133
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,880
I've confirmed that

134
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,070
she didn't get poisoned.

135
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,720
Why does she resemble Su Wan'er so much

136
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,590
and still lay in her coffin back then?

137
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
I have no idea.

138
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,900
Miss!

139
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,110
Time to get up!

140
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,790
Yingtao, stop yelling!

141
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,350
Just allow me to sleep a little longer.

142
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,340
Yingtao, be good!

143
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,850
Yingtao,

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,350
just sleep with me for a little while.

145
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,520
Why are you here?

146
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,490
And why didn't you say anything?

147
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,260
I warn you that

148
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,080
you can't bear any magical thinking!

149
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,640
We've already been a couple.

150
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,640
It should all be reasonable

151
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,440
if I want to do things like that?

152
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,710
Nonsense!

153
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,030
I have nothing to do with you!

154
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,670
Did I say yes to it?

155
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,520
We need to make a deal.

156
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,040
You can't

157
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,320
make any moves on me.

158
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,590
And

159
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,030
I'm not your real Su Wan'er.

160
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,910
Whoever you are,

161
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,440
that really doesn't matter to me.

162
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
But, from now on,

163
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
you're my real Su Wan'er.

164
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,030
Why is that?

165
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,470
That's because

166
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,550
you resemble her so much.

167
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,230
Do you think how long you'll live on

168
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,670
after leaving my mansion?

169
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,160
You...

170
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,250
What do you mean?

171
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,000
The assassin arrived yesterday,

172
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,910
apparently targeted you.

173
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,840
All people believe
you're Su Wan'er,

174
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,320
also, the killers are included.

175
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,010
You're frightening me.

176
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,710
The deal I spoke of is so simple.

177
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,030
You just stay with me,

178
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,840
being my real Su Wan'er.

179
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,400
I can make sure you'll be safe.

180
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,850
What do you think?

181
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,520
General, the madam arrives.

182
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,350
(Hanfu is just for me, really.)

183
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,470
(I should be part
of the Hanfu Club)

184
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,910
(when I was in my school days.)

185
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,520
(What are you looking for?)

186
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,940
(Checking if there are assassins)

187
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,440
I want to thank you

188
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,910
for what happened yesterday.

189
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,040
For what?

190
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,520
For saving me.

191
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,360
General.

192
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,390
We arrived.

193
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,720
Xiao.

194
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,300
(Xiao Buwen)

195
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,200
It's you!

196
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,150
Why did you come to me?

197
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,240
I just got married.

198
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,600
I especially bring some wine

199
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,910
to you with my wife.

200
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,760
Congratulations!

201
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,120
I'll take it.

202
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,360
Xu Ming.

203
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,190
Xiao,

204
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,840
why was it here?

205
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,280
Days ago,

206
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,030
he advised a few words in court,

207
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,110
that upset the Emperor.

208
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,200
So he got demoted and was sent here.

209
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,800
Xu,

210
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,630
these dossiers are almost due.

211
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,640
Why are you still airing them?

212
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,280
Xiao,

213
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,730
As long as I stay here,

214
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,880
(Xu Ming)
I'll do my part.

215
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,420
Just go and ask him

216
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,480
if you want something.

217
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,240
I need to taste the wine.

218
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,230
It's up to you, Xu.

219
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,110
What on earth are you looking for?

220
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,160
For the cause of your death.

221
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,200
Stop kidding me.

222
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,080
Are you investigating

223
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,810
that of real Su Wan'er's death?

224
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,040
Yes.
