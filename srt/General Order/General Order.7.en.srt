2
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,880
Miss, come on. Wake up!

3
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,480
It's been so late in the morning.

4
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,460
Miss!

5
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,760
Stop yelling! Let me sleep in a while.

6
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,960
Miss! Wake up!

7
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,680
Xiaoxiao prescribed and sent it here.

8
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,720
I must remind the General to have it.

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,000
Thank you for your effort.

10
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,580
Miss.

11
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,660
Yingtao.

12
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,440
Bring me some chile peppers.

13
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,380
Miss,

14
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,720
what will you do?

15
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,440
It's homemade pepper spray.

16
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,530
Pepper spray?

17
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,770
There are no wolves in the city.

18
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,200
I mean lechers.

19
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,940
If I have this thing,

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,830
even the most skilled one can't endure.

21
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,220
In this way,

22
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,980
we can feel at ease to go out.

23
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,880
Take me the clothes.

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,620
Miss.

25
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,200
Where are you going?

26
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,300
I'm thinking

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,560
I need to go out to buy some food

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,000
to make some Rock Sugar Pear Soup.

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,600
Rock Sugar Pear Soup?

30
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,450
What's that?

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,630
It's something that tastes really good.

32
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,140
But its main purpose

33
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,480
is to relieve cough.

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,280
I got it.

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,920
It turns out you do it for the general.

36
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,180
You're naive.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,080
Don't talk nonsense.

38
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,680
He caught a cold out of saving me,

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,300
and his cough got worse.

40
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,840
So I thought of thanking him.

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,140
That's all.

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,740
Alright.

43
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,780
If we go out like this,

44
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,080
and the general knows it,

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,760
will we be ok?

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,040
We'll come back right after buying.

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,320
We won't be found.

48
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,900
(My secret remedy, which's)

49
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,500
(surely more effective than Mo's.)

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,640
Let's go!

51
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,040
- We do like this.
- Quickly.

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,900
Isn't this not so good?

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,100
I think it's fine.

54
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,560
I've bribed the mansion's guards.

55
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Just after me.

56
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,400
So, here you go.

57
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,220
General,

58
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,140
I found your lady climbing over

59
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,360
with her maid.

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,960
What a troublemaker!

61
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,280
General, take care of yourself.

62
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll take you the medicine.

63
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,540
It doesn't matter.

64
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,040
Where are you going, General?

65
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,400
I need to follow them.

66
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,740
Miss.

67
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,840
Are you green-eyed?

68
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,800
Absurd!

69
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,400
Because Xiaoxiao sent him the medicine.

70
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,980
Bullshit!

71
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,240
It's not the way you look at it.

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,660
Miss...

73
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,540
Can you make the soup

74
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,080
by using it?

75
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,380
I need to add some herbs to it.

76
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,480
That would be better to relieve.

77
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,520
Good luck to the general.

78
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,640
He could get you a considerate lady.

79
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,280
Nonsense!

80
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,040
Who is considerate to him?

81
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,520
I just think,

82
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,480
he's someone I can get along with.

83
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,960
Funny?

84
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,180
It's you, Dai Yu!

85
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,160
What are you doing here?

86
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,660
I warn you that

87
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,040
you better keep away from me!

88
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,020
Yingtao,

89
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,280
see, everything's ok now.

90
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,940
We keep being alert when returning

91
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,360
without accidents, that'll be ok.

92
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,660
Then let's be careful!

93
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,040
Don't let the General find out!

94
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,560
Speak of the devil!

95
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,360
It's not your lucky day.

96
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,680
I'll show you how the spray works!

97
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,520
Help!

98
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,240
Help!

99
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,740
Come on! Help!

100
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,680
Go now!

101
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,960
Kidnapping in broad daylight!

102
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,640
Come on! Help!

103
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,160
Go to help her now!

104
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,560
No need for that!

105
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,020
I want a damsels-in-distress story.

106
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,680
Why did you get them kidnapped?

107
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,960
Sorry, Wan'er.

108
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,000
How odd you want to learn from him?

109
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,000
Why are you avoiding me?

110
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,500
You go back!

111
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,520
You just make it clear before me.

112
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,860
- I won't fail you.
- Master!

113
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,760
Is that right?

114
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,780
Yes.

115
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,100
Come to me!

116
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,780
No!

117
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,080
Help!

118
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,300
Help!

119
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,340
I have no other choices!

120
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,540
Help!

121
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,780
Nobody here can save you!

122
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,320
- I'd get people.
- No one can help.

123
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,400
Help!

124
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,140
Jiu!

125
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,300
So,

126
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,200
Lu Chen got those two guys.

127
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,920
And they even got the wrong one.

128
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,040
It's the way he always does it.

129
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,580
Lady, why did you buy so many pears?

130
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,780
I know.

131
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,100
It's dry these days.

132
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,800
Can't I buy some pears to cool down?

133
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,560
Whatever, lady.

134
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,120
Cool down!

135
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,820
Lady...

136
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,060
Can I...

137
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,240
Cool down.

138
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,600
Pretty sweet.

139
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,840
Master, better have some tea to relax.

140
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
And,

141
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,280
that girl looks pretty good.

142
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,320
No one is allowed to speak of it.

143
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,520
If someone dares to tip-off,

144
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,400
I'll kill him!

145
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
Well...

146
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,040
Master, what should we do then?

147
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,720
So what?

148
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,080
I can't just let it go.

149
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,460
Let's go.

150
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,400
I must save a damsel in distress.

151
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,180
- Win her favor.
- Yes!

152
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,580
I need to take her and the Box

153
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,760
back to the Manor.

154
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,860
I'd sent those two to

155
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,760
take her back.

156
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,600
Get another two guys.

157
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,880
I can't trust them.

158
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,500
I'll do as you said.

159
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,960
- Quickly.
- Alright.

160
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,080
I found you favored the pears so much.

161
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,020
So, I asked my maids to buy you more.

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,380
You better let your maids do

163
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,660
things like this in the coming days.

164
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,400
You can't slip away.

165
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,640
Thank you.

166
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,060
Well...

167
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,040
Is there any clue about Wen's matter?

168
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,440
Not yet.

169
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,080
I have an idea.

170
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,040
We need to come to His Majesty.

171
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,660
His Majesty is in charge of

172
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,240
every year's exam.

173
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,500
We compare the papers from that year

174
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,400
with the handwriting in the letters.

175
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,200
There should be discoveries.

176
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,980
All papers have been stored here.

177
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,360
To my surprise,

178
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,080
the one you spoke of is not here.

179
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,600
Could it be he has changed his name?

180
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,260
(Palace Examination Candidate)

181
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,080
This handwriting...

182
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,220
(Xu Ming, twenty-two years old)

183
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,740
Your Majesty,

184
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,200
what do you

185
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,960
think of Xu Ming?

186
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,840
About Xu Ming person,

187
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,520
he's upright.

188
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,820
After being an official,

189
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,240
he's always been very low-key.

190
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,320
And,

191
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,360
he has no contact with the Dai family.

192
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,200
So, I think,

193
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,060
he shouldn't have done bad things

194
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,480
to frame Marquis Dai.

195
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,880
It's too late.

196
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,480
You two better stay here

197
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,360
to have some drink with me.

198
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,120
Your Majesty, you're snowed under.

199
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,640
I don't have the heart to bother you.

200
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,540
I'm leaving with my lady.

201
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,580
Never mind.

202
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,580
A few days ago,

203
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,830
someone sent me some tasty food.

204
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,910
I want you two to taste it with me.
