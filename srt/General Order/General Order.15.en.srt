2
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,860
According to Han Qing's investigation,

3
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,660
the eunuch was trapped to

4
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,900
the desolate courtyard

5
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,240
out of years of heavy drinking.

6
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,060
I fear it'll be long

7
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,040
to interrogate them.

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,260
So,

9
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,420
we need to go our separate ways.

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,680
I'll go to persuade the Emperor.

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,920
You'll come to that eunuch.

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,200
We'll meet outside the palace at noon.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,940
Alright.

14
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,800
That place is a prison in the palace.

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,340
It's inappropriate for you to go there.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,420
I'll handle it as soon as I can.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,520
Then, I'll come to you.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,300
But,

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,680
you left without permission last night.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,920
I fear the Emperor would

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,440
punish you.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,440
Never mind.

23
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,360
We have affection.

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,000
He might let me go.

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,820
Your Majesty,

26
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,200
the instructor is here.

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,800
You go ahead.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,340
Got it.

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,620
Su Ke.

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,760
you came all the way to the general.

31
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,240
Do you know what the consequences will be?

32
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,200
I heard that

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,400
Mo's daughter told you

34
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,900
Dai would be on his way to the Manor

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,300
for the Meeting.

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,760
Did you worry about him,

37
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,080
right?

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,300
Yes.

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,400
Indeed, I'm worried about him.

40
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,960
Will you punish me for this?

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,160
I was told that

42
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
I could do whatever I liked

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,040
in this world.

44
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,960
Suppress me in the name of the emperor.

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm telling you

46
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,720
I'm the Emperor!

47
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,750
You promised you to stay here with me,

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,700
ignoring Dai Yu.

49
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,240
But you went back to his mansion.

50
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,880
It's the crime of deceiving me!

51
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,040
I should've convicted you!

52
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,620
Su Ke,

53
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,080
I don't mean that.

54
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,660
I know

55
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,780
you know everything, and

56
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,920
can do everything.

57
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,960
It seems to be true now.

58
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,340
Do you know what Dai Yu

59
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,280
told me today?

60
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,120
He said

61
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,560
his disgraced father is Cao Jian.

62
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,320
I ask if you know about it.

63
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,940
General!

64
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,420
It's none of my business.

65
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,960
Don't ask me, and I know nothing!

66
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,240
Please, let me go!

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,340
Please, let me go!

68
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,360
General, let me go!

69
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,420
Let me go!

70
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,450
I really don't know anything!

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,900
General!

72
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,400
Let me go!

73
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,900
I have important things to do.

74
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,920
Just buy you a little time.

75
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,040
Think about it carefully!

76
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,300
General!

77
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,920
What exactly happened to my father?

78
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,520
Cao Jian was convicted of raping girls.

79
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,600
Do you believe it?

80
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,870
Why didn't you help him?

81
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm now the Emperor.

82
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,680
I also have to give the officials

83
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,980
all the people and this world

84
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,040
an explanation!

85
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,900
Fine! For officials,

86
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,940
all the people,

87
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,160
and this world!

88
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,250
If you are determined to investigate,

89
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,320
how could you not clear his name?

90
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,170
Su Ke.

91
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,280
Unless it's you...

92
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,000
No.

93
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,880
Unless you're unwilling to do so.

94
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,000
Your Majesty, you're so connected.

95
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,020
You even knew all of what

96
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,640
Mo Xiaoxiao told me.

97
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,700
Cao Jian is a high-ranking official.

98
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,000
How couldn't you make it clear?

99
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,280
Where exactly did Cao Jian go?

100
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,480
Who is the real killer?

101
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,240
Do you know or not?

102
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,800
Or,

103
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,560
for the so-called big picture,

104
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,180
you have the heart to get your friend,

105
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,900
your brother stained!

106
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,520
Zip your hole!

107
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,400
Of course, I believe

108
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,200
Cao Jian is innocent.

109
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,840
I also thought about helping him.

110
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,920
But the evidence was hard.

111
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,080
He also confessed himself.

112
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,560
Every indication told me he did it.

113
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,320
So, I had no other choice.

114
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,600
Even if the murderer is not Cao Jian,

115
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,800
that one is now also on the run.

116
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,800
You'd better stay in the palace.

117
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,960
Don't run around!

118
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,280
Su Ke.

119
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,960
There's something which

120
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,880
I think you are aware of it.

121
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,160
Actually, I...

122
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,120
Your Majesty.

123
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,880
Now, I've been the general's lady.

124
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,440
You'd better have some self-respect.

125
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,220
Get out of my way!

126
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,460
General, it's a restricted area.

127
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,380
You can't trespass!

128
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,720
You'd better go back.

129
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,420
I'm a warrior in active service for a

130
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,200
long time. It's inevitable to be rude.

131
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,600
Now, I want to take my lady back.

132
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,360
Who dares to stop me?

133
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,620
General, you can't trespass!

134
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,520
General!

135
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,700
General!

136
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,620
General!

137
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,640
You can't get in!

138
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,940
General!

139
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,880
My lady is ridiculous.

140
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,090
She offended you, Your Majesty.

141
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,320
I came to apologize.

142
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,220
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

143
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,160
Please, let my lady

144
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,560
go back with me, Your Majesty.

145
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,820
General Dai,

146
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,240
are you worried about Ms. Dai?

147
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,000
But I heard that

148
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,160
you and Wan'er are not married, right?

149
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,680
Without a matchmaker or betrothal,

150
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,560
what kind of couple you are?!

151
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,800
In my book,

152
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,640
you can't bug Wan'er anymore.

153
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,940
Or,

154
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,760
let her make her choice.

155
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,640
How about it?

156
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,960
So,

157
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,240
are you willing to stay in the palace,

158
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,960
or go back to his place?

159
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,000
Your Majesty,

160
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,760
although the general and I

161
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,640
were not married in his mansion,

162
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,160
before that,

163
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,880
we two

164
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,960
were married in a small house.

165
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,680
That was the happiest day

166
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,640
of my life!

167
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,440
I've been the general's lady.

168
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,720
So, I should've gone back with him.

169
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,880
Your Majesty, please

170
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,320
you allow us to go back home.

171
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,480
You...

172
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,660
Fine!

173
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,720
Just remember, General Dai,

174
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,520
your father has already been convicted.

175
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,080
If you want to overturn the case,

176
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,800
all people will surely criticize us!

177
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,580
General Dai,

178
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,080
you'd better not involve Wan'er in.

179
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,760
Your Majesty, none of your concern.

180
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,240
I swore by the General Token back then.

181
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,600
I'll never fail her.

182
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,960
I have to

183
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,920
leave.
