2
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,920
Have you gone out for some drinks?

3
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,440
It's late with heavy dew.

4
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,320
What if you catch a cold?

5
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,440
Your life is not up to you.

6
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,220
My healthy is none of your business.

7
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,440
If Mo Xiaoxiao didn't let me know,

8
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,420
I couldn't know

9
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,640
you were willing to ask for death.

10
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,520
You're a man of few words.

11
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,700
When it's time to speak,

12
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,200
you say nothing.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,180
But when it's time to shut up,

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,680
you become talkative.

15
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,600
You can explain when I suspect you.

16
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,100
The less you say,

17
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,280
the angrier I get.

18
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,160
You did it because you never explained.

19
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,040
Look at you,

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,120
you're silent again.

21
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,080
What are you doing?

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,900
What will you do?

23
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,620
I'm talking to you!

24
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,800
Have you heard me?

25
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm so worried!

26
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,600
Put me down!

27
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,640
Put me down!

28
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,840
Put me down!

29
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,920
Put me down!

30
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,520
Put me down!

31
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,600
Han, look.

32
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,800
Have they reconciled again?

33
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
It's hard to say.

34
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,520
Clearly, he wants to send her back.

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,580
If you were right,

36
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,780
how would they sleep in separate beds?

37
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,740
But it's always the way

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,200
they sleep!

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,140
Yes!

40
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,600
The general's life is tough.

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,980
Don't move!

42
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,740
Deserting your post.

43
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,860
Sneaking out in the palace at night.

44
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,100
Drinking excessively without reason.

45
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,480
Harassing court officials.

46
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,040
Su Ke,

47
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,760
you always hang out when you're here.

48
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,960
Still do that when you're in the palace.

49
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,160
How dare you!

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,360
So what?

51
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,600
Even if you drive me away now,

52
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,720
I still won't leave!

53
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,420
Speak the truth that

54
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,560
are you still hiding something from me?

55
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,320
Wait until you wake up tomorrow,

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,640
I'll tell you everything.

57
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,720
Lady, you got up.

58
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,320
Why didn't you go back?

59
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,600
You didn't sober up.

60
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,920
I fear you might cause some trouble.

61
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,840
How could that be?

62
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,800
You're already awake,

63
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,560
you'll come to me in the courtyard.

64
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,520
I'll take you to someone else.

65
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,340
Head up!

66
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,360
Lady, do you recall this person?

67
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
- It's you!
- Lady.

68
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,900
Lady, don't kill me!

69
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,720
What on earth is going on?

70
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,860
Speak out!

71
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,860
A few days ago,

72
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,880
a eunuch gave me a sum of silver,

73
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,000
and he also said

74
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,200
a gray-headed man would come to you.

75
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,120
There would be an assassin to kill him.

76
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,440
I was asked to take the body away.

77
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,840
I was promised to enter the palace.

78
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,480
I lost my conscience,

79
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,080
being momentarily possessed.

80
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,080
Lady, don't kill me!

81
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,460
Lady, don't kill me!

82
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,780
General!

83
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
Lady, don't kill me!

84
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,620
Please, don't kill me!

85
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,320
That gray-headed man is

86
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,180
Lu Li.

87
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,480
Did he die?

88
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,960
It's reported he indeed passed away.

89
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,820
Now it seems

90
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,000
the news was false.

91
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,380
Did you invent all of these things?

92
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,020
I'm not that capable.

93
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,280
My father, Lu Li, invented them.

94
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,740
It's my suitcase!

95
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,660
It belongs to my grandfather.

96
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,880
How could it be yours?

97
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,500
(No wonder Lu Chen)

98
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,520
(got my suitcase!)

99
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,960
(It turns out his grandfather is Liu!)

100
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,560
(Who did come to kill Liu?)

101
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,400
I heard from Mo Xiaoxiao that

102
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,320
you get the Mirror through the Meeting.

103
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,500
What's that?

104
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,540
I've never seen it.

105
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,440
The treasure of Luli Manor,

106
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,120
capable of containing heaven and earth.

107
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,920
(Liu came here.)

108
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,520
(He should want to tell me something.)

109
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,960
(It seems that to find the answer,)

110
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,720
(I have to go to Luli Manor.)

111
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,980
Lady,

112
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,360
come with me to the study.

113
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,880
I'll show you something.

114
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,920
Where did you get it?

115
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,360
From my father.

116
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,600
What on it is my father.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
As you said,

118
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,200
is he your father?

119
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,040
He's my friend!

120
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,580
Lady,

121
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,720
stop joking!

122
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,060
I mean it!

123
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,320
I'm serious.

124
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,080
So, in your book,

125
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,880
you and my father are old friends.

126
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,500
Now,

127
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,840
Cao Jian is your father.

128
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,680
That means

129
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,820
he was here even earlier than me

130
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,000
for over 20 years?

131
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,300
Lady,

132
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,480
what does time travel mean?

133
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,800
I can't make it clear in a few words.

134
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,840
Where's your father now?

135
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,280
What exactly happened before?

136
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,060
16 years ago,

137
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,600
many girls were killed in this city.

138
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,080
One day, he went to meet the Emperor,

139
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,920
after that, he disappeared.

140
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,840
Afterwards, the people in the city

141
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,080
spread rumors, saying

142
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,020
the marquis killed the girls.

143
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,560
He then fled to escape punishment.

144
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,360
The emperor sent people to search here.

145
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,840
They finally found the weapon,

146
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,920
as well as the picts of the girls!

147
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,200
You've also seen the picts.

148
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,480
They're all similar to you.

149
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,400
Impossible!

150
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,940
I know him.

151
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,580
He's honest and straightforward,

152
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,780
absolutely impossible to commit murder.

153
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,880
I also firmly believe it was not him.

154
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,720
So, I've been on it for these years.

155
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,340
Well...

156
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,960
Is there any new clue?

157
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,600
Han Qing has gone to look for it.

158
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,480
Alright.

159
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,480
If it really doesn't work,

160
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,680
I'll ask His Majesty for help.

161
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,400
If His Majesty can help me with it,

162
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,880
then my father's injustice

163
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,280
will soon be brought to light!
