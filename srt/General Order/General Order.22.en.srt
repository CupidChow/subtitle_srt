2
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,690
Here's the final Trail.

3
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,460
Nothing valuable exists here.

4
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,780
How could the Mirror be put here?

5
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,760
Wan'er, look!

6
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,810
There's a wooden box out there!

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,690
Is there a sort of trick?

8
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,860
Lu Li is unpredictable.

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,350
We'd better be cautious.

10
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,310
It's my turn.

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
Be careful.

12
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,900
(To my dear friend, Su Ke)

13
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,620
(To my dear friend, Su Ke)

14
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,060
He simply opened it like this?

15
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,850
To my dear friend,

16
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,060
Su Ke?

17
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,460
Su Ke,

18
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,420
if you could read it,

19
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,290
it'd mean I failed to meet you.

20
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,180
We've been friends for half a lifetime.

21
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,180
I also feel happy.

22
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,930
Next, it'll be the main topic.

23
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,470
Su Ke,

24
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,490
watch out for Sun Duo.

25
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,930
Does the Mirror refer to this letter?

26
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,420
Is there a way of time-travelling

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,130
in this letter?

28
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,620
Give me the letter.

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,180
Who the hell are you?

30
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,730
Why did you have a musket?

31
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,420
Now, I'll tell you the truth.

32
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,470
Your Majesty?

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,980
Sun Duo?

34
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,570
Your Majesty...

35
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,830
Don't move!

36
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,130
Give me the letter!

37
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,900
Go and get it!

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Do it now!

39
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,550
Speak it out!

40
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,520
Remember,

41
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,130
if you want to return to the modern era,

42
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,230
you must do so on the next full moon,

43
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,430
holding the General Token.

44
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,280
Because, on that say,

45
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,710
you held the Token

46
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,850
to take us time traveling here.

47
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,920
And no one else but you

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,210
can take us back.

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,770
Liu,

50
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,920
it turns out that the Mirror

51
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,340
is just a letter!

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,240
I never thought Liu really figured out

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,370
the way how to go back.

54
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,190
Sun Duo,

55
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,370
calm down!

56
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,260
We've got the way how to bo gack.

57
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,140
Let's go back together.

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Is that ok?

59
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,230
Why do you always want to

60
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,980
go back every day?

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,140
In this place,

62
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,930
I'm the Emperor,

63
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,400
who overwhelms all under heaven!

64
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm no longer that poor student!

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,170
Su Ke, do you think

66
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,770
I'll go back again?

67
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,890
General Dai,

68
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,420
take me the General Token.

69
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,700
Or, nobody can survive!

70
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,370
Take it to me!

71
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,060
(The General Token)

72
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Don't move!

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,740
Sun Duo,

74
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,760
did you kill

75
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,740
those girls?

76
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,860
They're innocent.

77
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,370
Why did you kill them?

78
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,860
Because of you!

79
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,740
Come on, say I love you!

80
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,820
Your Majesty,

81
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,770
I love you.

82
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
It's as if you're kidding me.

83
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,300
Say it again.

84
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,610
Your Majesty,

85
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,450
I love you.

86
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,580
It's not the way I want you to do.

87
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,770
It's as if you're joking.

88
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,070
You just call me

89
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,700
Sun Duo.

90
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,770
Say it again.

91
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
You should say

92
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,700
Your Majesty, Sun Duo,

93
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,490
I love you.

94
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,760
Stop calling me His Majesty.

95
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,330
Just Sun Duo, instead.

96
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,490
Sun Duo,

97
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,910
I love you.

98
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,750
You...

99
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,450
Head up!

100
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,630
Smile.

101
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,420
You look pretty while smiling.

102
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,120
Smile!

103
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,980
Such a beautiful face!

104
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,540
Why don't you smile?

105
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,740
Next one.

106
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,100
What about Liu?

107
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,860
Did you kill him or not?

108
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,030
You said it.

109
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,420
For these years,

110
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,540
I couldn't feel at ease.

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,440
Because Liu got me concerned that

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,980
he'd ruin my reign.

113
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,740
So, you picked me as a bait,

114
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,650
luring him to the capital.

115
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,610
I'm telling you that

116
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,300
you can't clean

117
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,860
in Liu's death!

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,840
Sun Duo,

119
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,760
how can you treat your friends

120
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,820
who truly cares about you like this?

121
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,770
I choose to be

122
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,310
an emperor.

123
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,330
I'd rather fail the world.

124
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,210
The world can't betray me, understand?

125
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,700
So, now, you want to

126
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,700
kill me?

127
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,250
Su Ke,

128
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,940
I don't want to do it.

129
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,690
Another chance for you, instead.

130
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,710
Follow me.

131
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,420
I can grant you an extravagant life.

132
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,880
Is that ok?

133
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,500
If you dare to make any move,

134
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,890
I'll break this Token.

135
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,740
If so, no one can return!

136
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,210
Su Ke,

137
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,570
I'll buy you more time

138
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,480
to think of it.

139
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,820
I can wait for you.
