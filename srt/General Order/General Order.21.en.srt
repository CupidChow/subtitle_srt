00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,300
(The Site of General Xinwu's Tomb)

3
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,240
Go through them.

4
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,260
Look at those patterns.

5
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,760
Why did you come so late, Su Ke?

6
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,900
Come over here!

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,240
Liu, I'm here on time!

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,360
Of course!

9
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,880
Guys, be extremely careful!

10
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,500
I tried so hard to beg for this chance.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,840
I'll never be the club's drag.

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,980
Alright.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,300
Liu.

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,880
You take the tools to them.

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,040
- Alright.
- Slowly, a bit.

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,500
(General Xinwu passed away.)

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,160
The 47th year of Jingwu's Reign,

18
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,760
General Xinwu died.

19
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,920
Well...

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,320
Alright. Go out there.

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,420
Hello!

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,380
Hi!

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,640
- Attention!
- Got it.

24
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,700
(The General Token)

25
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,980
(The General Token)

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,740
(The General Token)

27
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,980
Miss, why are you still in your bed?

28
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,440
The Trail is about to start.

29
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,660
I...

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,500
Come on, take me my clothes!

31
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,820
Guys!

32
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,920
Today, a paper test is for you.

33
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,760
You'd answer the

34
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,800
questions prescribed.

35
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,220
I came from a family of academics.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,240
This paper test is time-wasting.

37
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,040
Brag even if you haven't had the test.

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,520
You might be clobbered with facts!

39
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,680
Guys, look at this line.

40
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,820
(Moonlight scatters before the bed.)

41
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,290
Moonlight scatters before the bed.

42
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,280
Moonlight scatters before the bed.

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,320
(It's truly in line with Liu's pattern!)

44
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,640
(I give it up!)

45
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,790
(His literacy ceilings might be low.)

46
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,520
Alright. Guys, write your answers.

47
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,400
Suspected to be frost on the ground.

48
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,320
Good job!

49
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,180
Although there're only five words,

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,080
it shows a sense of loneliness.

51
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,400
Lu Li, it's amazing!

52
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,440
Nonsense!

53
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,960
It's not what he wrote!

54
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,360
Li Bai wrote it.

55
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,120
- Li Bai?
- You knew him?

56
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,800
I knew a little about him.

57
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,880
Time to show your answers!

58
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,180
I'd better

59
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,960
to be the first to challenge.

60
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,180
(A lone star dims outside the window.)

61
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,020
Moonlight scatters before the bed. Then,

62
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,200
A lone star dims outside the window.

63
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,040
What do you think of it?

64
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,000
I thought you're more capable than us!

65
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,640
Listen up!

66
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,000
Hurrying to and fro after raining.

67
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,120
Before the bed links to after raining.

68
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,680
What a good line!

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,920
Time to show what General Dai wrote!

70
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,540
(Suspected to be frost on the ground.)

71
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,740
It's interesting.

72
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,840
Suspected to be frost on the ground.

73
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,940
Great.

74
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,520
Good!

75
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,560
- Good job!
- Well done!

76
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,570
What a nice line!

77
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,660
Good job!

78
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,370
Perfectly matched!

79
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,760
Dai's work is vigorous and melancholic,

80
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,170
directly expressing his true feelings.

81
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,340
It's indeed a masterpiece for the ages!

82
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,260
Alright. Next one.

83
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,220
(Moonlight scatters before the bed.)

84
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,340
(Suspected to be frost on the ground.)

85
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,500
How come they're the same?

86
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
- Yes!
- Cheating!

87
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,360
- Cheating!
- (Why he knew it?)

88
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,800
Two guys, the same answer. How come?

89
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,580
There should be a collusion!

90
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,880
They must have known in advance!

91
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,160
How odd two guys give the same answer?!

92
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,820
Master, look...

93
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,240
If so,

94
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,160
you two are all winners!

95
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,360
Man!

96
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,120
Bestow the two guys with wine!

97
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,980
Dai Yu!

98
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,160
Time's up!

99
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,820
Give me the antidote!

100
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,340
Help!

101
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,420
Guys!

102
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,000
I've discussed it with the master.

103
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,060
Both General Dai and

104
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,200
Prince Tufei

105
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,420
are all winners!

106
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,160
Just now,

107
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,170
I gave the antidote to you guys.

108
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,500
You two

109
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,700
come with me.

110
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,480
I'm very curious about that

111
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,500
how did this Prince Tufei

112
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,000
know the answer?

113
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,640
He might be one of Luli's old friends.

114
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,100
I'm not so sure about it.

115
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,860
Here it is.

116
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,280
It's off-limits in our Manor.

117
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,940
No one else but the Manor's owner and

118
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,840
the warriors who're in the Trail aren't

119
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,360
allowed to be here.

120
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,600
The Mirror is right inside.

121
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,860
Let's go.

122
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,040
Well...

123
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,320
Wan'er, you better wait outside with me.

124
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,940
Negative.

125
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,320
I must get the Mirror!

126
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,240
It's pretty dangerous inside.

127
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,520
- (Liu knew it!)
- Since it was made,

128
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,380
no one had ever entered.

129
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,980
- (It's for me!)
- What's inside?

130
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,760
- (Clues for me!)
- What if?

131
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,580
I got the nerve.

132
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,460
Fine, I'd go with you, too.

133
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,720
To see what the Mirror looks like.

134
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,860
After you.

135
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,300
What does it look like inside?

136
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,240
Lady, watch out!

137
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,780
Slow down.

138
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,840
Wait.

139
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,680
It's so dark!

140
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,320
Where are we?

141
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,600
What's this?

142
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,900
A flashlight.

143
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,040
I got the batteries in the Pavilion.

144
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,620
Impressive!

145
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,280
- I also want it.
- Go now!

146
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,280
What's this place?

147
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,760
Slow down.

148
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,560
Sister!

149
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,520
Why is there a fire here?

150
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,780
Is there something living here?

151
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,000
We'd better not go in, ok?

152
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,020
- Stop yelling!
- We'd return!

153
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,160
Let's go in and take a look!

154
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,500
