00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,140
General Dai,

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,890
you're later than I expected.

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,840
I can't imagine you really got

5
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,630
Mo convinced.

6
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,940
Such an old fart,

7
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,180
he does want to rebel!

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,360
Sun Duo,

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,460
I came to you today

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,690
for an explanation.

11
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,540
Su Ke,

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,220
how absurd! You're so naive!

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,290
What's the explanation for it?

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,610
I'm telling you that

15
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,650
I'm not part of you guys.

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,800
I've been in this palace, a mixed-bag

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,910
for 28 years.

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,140
If I hadn't learned my business,

19
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,690
I'd die violently. Do you understand?

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,330
You can't seek to do hard out of this!

21
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,560
Today,

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,930
I'll wipe you out

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,190
for the people all under heaven!

24
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,820
Fine!

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,580
Alright!

26
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,580
General Dai, you are

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,260
righteous man.

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,650
And you're patriotic,

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,820
the same as your father!

30
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,930
I'll take you to him today!

31
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,050
Don't you think I'm

32
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,730
less prepared?

33
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,010
I should've let you go.

34
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,060
But the only thing I can give you.

35
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,930
It's to take you to death!

36
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,110
Get them!

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,460
Dai Yu, watch out!

38
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,590
Dai Yu!

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,420
General Dai,

40
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,670
You think you can hide your

41
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,100
illness, cough from me?

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,190
In fact, I've already known

43
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,270
it's your soft spot.

44
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,360
I especially prepare this

45
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,620
pollen for you.

46
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,030
Plus,

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,440
(The General Token)
it's just for

48
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,060
luring you guys here.

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,130
It's completely useless to me.

50
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,730
Bring all back to the starting point?

51
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,340
Not gonna happen!

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,010
Why?

53
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,980
I never wanted to hurt you.

54
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,930
Everything I did is

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,850
all for you!

56
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,600
Dai Yu!

57
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,320

59
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,700
You get up!

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,600
Get up!

62
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,740
Lady.

63
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,170
You're an idiot.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,300

65
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,170
