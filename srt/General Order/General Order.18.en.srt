2
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,530
So that's how it is!

3
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,250
It turns out that you

4
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,370
married her.

5
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,530
Exactly!

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
Father.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,980
Leave it alone.

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,050
Who the hell did it, trapping you here?

9
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,340
Since I entered the Palace,

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,140
the Emperor had confined me here.

11
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,820
The Emperor?

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,650
Is it Sun Duo?

13
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,370
What happened between you and Sun Duo?

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,780
As you saw,

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,370
The time we time traveled

16
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,860
was different.

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,980
(16 years ago)

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,330
Your Majesty, the person arrived.

19
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,640
You go ahead.

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
Got it.

21
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,820
Cao Jian.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,970
Take your seat!

23
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,410
I know you've come here already.

24
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,750
Liu.

25
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,410
Why have you become so old?

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,500
I know it's your first instinct.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,690
I was the first to be time travelled.

28
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,550
I've been here for 20 years.

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,730
20 years?

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,330
What have you been through?

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,560
I...

32
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,710
He

33
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,980
runs a grocery store.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,490
- For novel items.
- Is that true?

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,260
He's well-off now.

36
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,420
If I didn't enter his stall by accident,

37
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,260
I thought I'd never see him.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,180
Liu, amazing!

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
Sun Duo.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,980
What happened to you?

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,850
Why have you been an emperor?

42
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,260
Well, I...

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,730
It has a long story.

44
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,200
When I first time traveled here,

45
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,470
I fell to the Eastern Palace,

46
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,100
meeting the Crown Prince.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,070
The former emperor was seriously ill.

48
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,540
The Prince was about to take the throne.

49
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,850
He asked me to help him with plans.

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,650
After I helped him kill his opponents,

51
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,630
he dared to

52
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,370
kill me, either.

53
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,260
All is about tactics, plots,

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,620
we were intrigued all day long.

55
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,820
Forget it.

56
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,830
Let it go off.

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,460
By the way,

58
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,690
after many years of separation,

59
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,820
I want to give you a gift.

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,320
What's this?

61
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,130
It's the design of a musket.

62
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,550
The court is dangerous.

63
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,340
You'd use it to keep you safe.

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,680
Liu!

65
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,120
You didn't even give me any muskets!

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,850
Liu,

67
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,830
thank you!

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,910
No more formalities. We're friends.

69
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,810
Cao Jian, what will you give me?

70
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,240
Leave me alone.

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,320
I don't even have enough military funds.

72
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,420
I have nothing.

73
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,210
Say something about yourself.

74
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,530
I'm so miserable.

75
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,010
When I woke up,

76
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,400
I was fighting

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,700
at the border.

78
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,420
I was almost killed.

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,290
Thanks to Dai, he saved me.

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,770
Then, I followed General Dai.

81
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,010
After that, he was seriously injured.

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,260
He feared foes would invade out of this.

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,760
So,

84
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,490
I was ordered to pretend to be him.

85
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,010
It had lasted

86
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,540
for ten years.

87
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,930
So I'm always masked when I go out.

88
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,460
How tough!

89
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,550
Yu,

90
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,700
although I'm your adoptive father,

91
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,420
I always see you as my real child.

92
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,060
You've lived a hard life

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,540
for the past few years.

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
You're wrong.

95
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,980
I'm incapable of making you suffer losses.

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,650
Although I'm your real child,

97
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,450
I always see you as my real father.

98
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,420
Father,

99
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,680
for the past few years,

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,020
what's going on with those killed girls?

101
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,860
The third girl was killed this month.

102
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,820
I've seen her in Sun Duo's place.

103
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,420
For those girls,

104
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,820
they resembled Su Ke.

105
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,980
Is the real killer Sun Duo?

106
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,420
I heard he sent a pic to the Ministry,

107
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,170
setting off a massive search.

108
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,050
If nothing unexpected happens,

109
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,330
those three died because of him.

110
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,630
Negative.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,020
I have to examine myself.

112
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,800
Ask him to give us an explanation.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
You can't come to him.

114
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,740
He's been lured by power.

115
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,650
If we just come to him,

116
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,820
I'm so worried...

117
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,980
How could that be?

118
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,300
Even if he killed those girls,

119
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,830
I believe in him, who couldn't

120
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,770
hurt us, his old friends.

121
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,520
Please, listen to me.

122
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,700
We'd better leave here right now!

123
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,490
You wait here for me.

124
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,870
I'd come to him alone.

125
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,150
You!

126
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,170
What should I do?

127
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,120
Sun Duo.

128
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,020
So many girls have been killed.

129
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,170
Did you do that?

130
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,860
Cao.

131
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,420
We've known for a long time.

132
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,490
Don't you believe in me?

133
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,100
You sent the pic to the Ministry.

134
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,890
Then, those girls were killed.

135
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,650
Those all resembled Su Ke.

136
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,170
Was that a coincidence?

137
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,580
Look, we three have all been put here.

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,260
Su Ke must be here, too.

139
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,370
Am I right?

140
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,960
I took the pic to the Ministry,

141
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,420
because it was to find Su Ke.

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,880
Isn't this also something we

143
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,650
have always been concerned about?

144
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,610
But why did you kill them?

145
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,750
Cao.

146
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,020
I don't want to tip it off.

147
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,640
I did so,

148
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,820
because I wanted to make Su Ke safe.

149
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,100
Sacrifice, to some extent,

150
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,490
is a must.

151
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,440
Sun Duo.

152
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,920
You killed the innocent as you wish.

153
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,370
I can't watch on the sideline!

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,930
Guards!

155
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,700
Sun Duo!

156
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,140
Sorry, Cao.

157
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,650
I tried hard to take the throne.

158
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,100
How can I let you ruin my thing?

159
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,580
You're wearing a mask to pretend,

160
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,820
you'll never be allowed to put it down!

161
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,820
(Although Sun Duo did it,)

162
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
(I can't let Yu know at the moment!)

163
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
I

164
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,890
don't know who did it.

165
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,330
Why did Sun Duo keep you here?

166
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,610
Sun Duo has

167
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,490
been lured by power.

168
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,770
You mustn't confront him!

169
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,800
Plus,

170
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,740
Liu once said

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,330
If there's one of us

172
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,610
leaving here,

173
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,100
all of the rest

174
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,860
will leave together.

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,140
So,

176
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,490
you must come to find Liu.

177
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,140
Only he knows how to time travel back.

178
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,580
Cao.

179
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,140
Liu

180
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,210
has died.

181
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,170
How could that be?

182
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,720
Father!

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
Father!

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
Cao.

185
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,230
Liu died before me.

186
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,860
I saw it myself.

187
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,980
After you've been trapped,

188
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,490
Liu set up the Luli Manor.

189
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,420
This time,

190
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,650
we're right about to go there, seeing

191
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,610
if there are any clues left for us.

192
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,490
Then there's no time to lose.

193
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,020
You need to go now.

194
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,210
But,

195
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,060
before that,

196
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,570
you have to find another one.

197
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,450
Who?

198
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,010
Liu once said

199
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,420
the site of our internship

200
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,100
was the Tomb of General Xinwu.

201
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,100
So,

202
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,250
you must find that person!

203
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,940
The person is General Xinwu.

204
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,980
And find his General Token,

205
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,940
which is the key

206
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,130
to the time travel.

207
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,740
Father.

208
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,250
I'm General Xinwu.
