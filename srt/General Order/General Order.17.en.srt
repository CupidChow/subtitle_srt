2
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,530
It's you, Ms. Xiaoxiao!

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,900
How odd you know me!

4
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,100
Surprisingly, you recognized me!

5
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,290
You're in Eastern Zhao Kingdom's dress

6
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,140
with the Token bestowed by the Emperor.

7
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,820
You should be Mr. Lu Chen, who's

8
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,210
been highly praised by the Emperor.

9
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,820
You said it!

10
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,780
It's getting cold.

11
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,010
Why did you take a break here?

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,050
Xiaoxiao.

13
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,290
You got me impressed once I saw you.

14
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,330
I fear things are unknown in the future.

15
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,390
And I'll be lovesick.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,100
So, I came to express my feelings.

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,860
I appreciate your heartiness.

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
I have something to do.

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,540
So, I'm leaving.

20
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,690
If we're fated to be a couple,

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,730
we'll finally meet,

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,610
no matter how far we're apart.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Xiaoxiao.

24
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,920
About this thing...

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,490
I'll leave this

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,850
cloak for you.

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,000
You take it to keep warm.

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,010
You're surely considerate.

29
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,130
Even if we're miles away,

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,980
there should be someday we reunite.

31
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,980
When the Meeting is all over.

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,620
I must come back to her.

33
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,820
Have a taste.

34
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,010
How is it, tasty?

35
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,820
Lady, you're really ingenious!

36
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,010
I can do more things.

37
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,800
Like Chuanbei and white fungus soup,

38
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,620
and pumpkin and pine nut porridge...

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,920
In the coming days,

40
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,820
I'll make some for you.

41
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,950
Just let me in!

42
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,180
Wan'er!

43
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,340
Here!

44
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,820
I'm here!

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,180
Here I am!

46
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:35,870
Let me in!

47
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,280
Sister!

48
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,510
Yummy!

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
Sister!

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,130
You made it yourself?

51
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,270
Wan'er, you're virtuous and gentle.

52
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,320
You're as wise as fair.

53
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,440
You're pretty and knowledgeable.

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,280
- Have it both ways.
- Stop.

55
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,460
If you have something to say, say it!

56
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,100
It's too official, isn't it?

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,770
I'm kin to you!

58
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,010
Stop nonsense!

59
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,260
We're not as close as you imagined.

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,280
Master Lu,

61
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,770
when have you been kin to my lady?

62
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,700
None of your business!

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
Sister.

64
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,000
I especially came

65
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,580
to say goodbye to you.

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,650
Will you go back?

67
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,350
Today,

68
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,050
once I can meet you in person,

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,110
what I never did is done!

70
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,820
Time to go back for the Meeting.

71
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,490
Have you seen Xiaoxiao?

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,170
Xiaoxiao!

73
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,480
I warn you that

74
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,740
you've had my sister as your lady.

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,980
You can't put any move on Xiaoxiao!

76
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,930
Well...

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,860
You broke into the Palace

78
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,580
last night, right?

79
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,670
Come here, sister.

80
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,610
It was so risky!

81
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,370
I lost my way as I got there.

82
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,860
And I saw there was a dungeon.

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,670
There was a black-masked man

84
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,820
confined inside.

85
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
So horrible!

86
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,850
Well...

87
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,170
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,890
I mean, it was so risky!

89
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,890
Are you sure it was a black mask?

90
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,490
It might be so.

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,540
It's my father!

92
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,790
Take me there!

93
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,820
- Soup!
- Wait!

94
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,110
Here it is!

95
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,540
Why are there so many guards?

96
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,610
Nobody was here last night.

97
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,740
I'd lure them away.

98
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,890
It's my turn.

99
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,120
You have the General Token, right?

100
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,420
Now, it doesn't work here.

101
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,510
Come on!

102
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,070
Lu Chen.

103
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,860
Leave us alone.

104
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,450
You go to your Manor first.

105
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,170
We'll meet out there.

106
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,280
Wan'er.

107
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,640
I believe we're fated.

108
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,770
We'll meet at the Manor!

109
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,600
You have to go with her!

110
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,540
Don't let my sister down!

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,890
Of course, I'll never do that.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,840
Thank you.

113
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,770
Mr. Guards,

114
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,830
I'm Lu Chen from Luli Manor.

115
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,610
The Emperor bestowed the Token himself.

116
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,550
I have something important to tell him.

117
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,300
How can I get to the main hall?

118
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,950
Mr. Guards,

119
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,860
look!

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,350
See the clouds in the sky!

121
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,330
As if my true feelings for Xiaoxiao.

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,260
Each of them had an affectionate look.

123
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,740
What do you think we could be a couple?

124
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
What are you doing?

125
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,110
Buddies.

126
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,040
Look,

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,280
as for this Token,

128
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,610
is it made of pure gold?

129
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,300
Could it be fake?

130
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
I have no idea.

131
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,320
Have a look at it.

132
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,650
You're all idiots. Go back now!

133
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,700
Man your post!

134
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,050
I'm keeping an eye on you!

135
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,370
Father!

136
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,040
Who are you?

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
Father!

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,980
Are you my father, really?

139
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,300
- Yu...
- Father!

140
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,910
Is that you?

141
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,440
Are you Yu?

142
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,580
Yes, exactly!

143
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
It's me!

144
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,260
- Yu...
- Father!

145
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,440
Are you aware of

146
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,650
I've found you for the past 16 years.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,540
Where have you gone?

148
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,420
Yu!

149
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,740
Cao!

150
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,980
Are you Su Ke?

151
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,650
Cao!

152
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,980
Su Ke!

153
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,770
Father!

154
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,680
Father!

155
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,420
What the hell is going on?

156
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,330
How did you become like this?

157
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,630
Su Ke!

158
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,650
Father!

159
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,180
She's my lady.

160
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,810
What?

161
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,620
What's going on

162
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,500
between you and Su Ke?

163
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,620
Cao,

164
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,210
as for what happened,

165
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,860
