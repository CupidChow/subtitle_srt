2
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,500
(Dai Mansion)

3
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,920
Speak it out!

4
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,360
Alright!

5
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,800
I want to tell you that

6
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,200
for the past few years,

7
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,040
I've been living in a drunken stupor.

8
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,300
As for fortunes and

9
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,440
sinister things,

10
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,600
I almost forgot them.

11
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,520
But for Marquis Dai's affairs,

12
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,000
I've always kept them in my mind.

13
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,680
It was 16 years ago.

14
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,440
He came to meet the Emperor.

15
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,680
After that, he disappeared.

16
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,000
The Emperor said Dai went out.

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,040
But I knew

18
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,760
he didn't come out at all!

19
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,100
He didn't go out?!

20
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,040
You're talking nonsense!

21
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,000
He really didn't come out!

22
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,240
He failed to leave the Palace!

23
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,560
(Father, what on earth...)

24
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,540
Miss,

25
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,600
Mr. Lu wanted

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,800
to meet you.

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,860
I got it, and you go ahead.

28
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,440
It's late, and tell me what you know.

29
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,800
Or, you'll be taught a lesson!

30
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,440
Wan'er!

31
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,380
there's no need for formalities!

32
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,560
It's as if we have relationships.

33
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,380
Stop trying to get close to me!

34
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,380
If you have something to say, say it!

35
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,560
What kind of person is Ms. Xiaoxiao?

36
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,520
How could I meet her?

37
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,080
Wan'er,

38
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,190
could you tell me where she is?

39
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,720
Do you mean Mo Xiaoxiao?

40
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,480
Exactly!

41
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,480
I met a girl in the palace that day,

42
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,580
who has celestial grace,

43
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,520
as if a fairy is coming down.

44
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,710
As for her figure...

45
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
Wake up!

46
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,840
She's with the Empress in the palace.

47
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,020
At this moment,

48
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,920
maybe she's in the harem.

49
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,920
If you want to win favor from her,

50
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,120
just break into the palace now!

51
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,180
Ms. Xiaoxiao!

52
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,240
Are you seriously going there?

53
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,520
You're insane!

54
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,080
I'm Lu Chen from Luli Manor.

55
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,440
The Emperor allows me to go in freely.

56
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,200
I have something important to discuss.

57
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,240
It's about diplomatic affairs.

58
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,640
How can there be a prison here?

59
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,720
And there's someone here.

60
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,780
This...

61
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,180
Buddy.

62
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,440
Do you know where the harem is?

63
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,440
What should I do now?

64
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,140
A slight bias will

65
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,180
lead to a thousand miles of error.

66
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,400
If missing her,
I'll never have her.

67
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,920
I must wait for her here today.

68
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,640
What are you doing here?

69
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,080
Drowning your sorrows in wine?

70
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,880
I've interrogated that eunuch.

71
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,840
According to him,

72
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,520
my father went to the palace.

73
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,600
After that, he never came out.

74
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,120
If he told me the truth,

75
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,380
I feard...

76
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,000
If so,

77
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,160
the Emperor must be part of it!

78
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,520
Lady, mind your words.

79
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,380
I surely believe Cao Jian is innocent.

80
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,280
(Sun Duo, you didn't
change while lying.)

81
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,080
I tested the Emperor in his study.

82
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,280
He concealed the truth from me.

83
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,520
If so,

84
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,040
why did the Emperor choose to conceal?

85
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,600
It seems

86
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,160
the capital is in great peril.

87
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,200
Rather than that,

88
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,000
we might as well be part of the Meeting.

89
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,700
Lady,

90
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,220
it doesn't make any sense!

91
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,740
I...

92
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,080
I can't put you in peril.

93
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,760
I want to be with you.

94
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,120
And,

95
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,280
Liu used to

96
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,560
live in Luli Manor.

97
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,240
Although he...

98
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,700
Well...

99
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,200
He's so smart.

100
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,840
He might have already found something.

101
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,080
And left me some hints for us.

102
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,080
In this way,

103
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,760
We might be able to uncover

104
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,480
what happened 16 years ago.

105
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,240
Whatever you choose to do,

106
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,880
I'll do whatever it costs

107
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,040
