2
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,720
No need to be so particular

3
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,040
about limits between us here.

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,440
Have a taste.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, I'll take the first bite.

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,440
How is it?

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,360
Yummy.

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,480
I especially asked the chief to make it.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
Let me peel another shrimp for you.

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,680
I appreciate your kindness.

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,480
And I'll do it for her.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,320
This is also delicious.

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,400
Just taste it.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,880
Yummy!

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,560
I mean it.

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,560
Much better than what we have at home.

17
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,320
Lady.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,200
Twenty-year-old aged vinegar.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,480
I think you should favor it so much.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,840
You can read my mind.

21
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,800
Have some water.

22
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,680
This is really delicious!

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Why didn't you have anything?

24
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,680
Come on, general!

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,040
Just ask our chiefs for improvements.

26
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,840
Lady, eat slowly.

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,600
Or you'll be choked.

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
Why didn't you say anything?

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,880
Angry?

30
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,490
Mingting.

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
Su.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,200
Xiaoxiao.

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,760
Where are you up to? It's late.

34
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,450
The Empress wants me.

35
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,400
Mingting.

36
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,080
Have you felt better?

37
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,360
I sent my men to take you the medicine.

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,920
Did you take it on time?

39
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,200
I feel better a bit.

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,920
Thank you for your effort.

41
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,160
I got another super herb today.

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,160
I'll take it to you someday.

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,440
Thank you.

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
Let's go.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,760
We go our separate ways.

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,680
And keep your distance.

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,440
Is anyone there?

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,600
Your Majesty.

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,200
Send the letter to the Office and

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,680
ask them to deliver what I wrote

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,320
to Luli Manor.

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
I got it.

53
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,160
General.

54
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,920
I've made the token's purpose clear.

55
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,410
For entering the Ministry's warehouse.

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
Ministry of Justice?

57
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,980
(The Imperial Exam, Minister Xu Ming)

58
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,060
(Romance of Lady Lian)

59
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,180
(The Imperial Exam, Minister Xu Ming)

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Wait. I'd get prepared for it.

61
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,000
Guard all the exits!

62
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,360
Do not let anyone go!

63
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,920
Got it!

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,360
You four guys follow me.

65
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,200
- Got it!
- Got it!

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Xu.

67
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,560
It's you, General Dai!

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,160
It's late, and why did you

69
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,880
come to me?

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,120
Xu.

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Do you know what a musket is?

72
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,080
Well...

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,200
You got me confused.

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
What's the musket?

75
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,560
Did you know Chen Xiaolian?

76
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,560
Chen Xiaolian?

77
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,600
I've never heard about her.

78
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,080
What's wrong with you, general?

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
Xu,

80
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,720
you said you didn't know her.

81
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
Why does your handwriting

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,640
exactly match Wen's?

83
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,960
Well...

84
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,520
What does it imply?

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,480
It shows 16 years ago,

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
you killed Chen Xiaolian, and

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,200
framed my father.

88
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,640
Well... General,

89
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,840
you need to mind what you said.

90
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,000
You'll get me executed if saying so.

91
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,160
You have distinguished service
and are renowed.

92
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,920
You can't afford to talk nonsense

93
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,960
to get me wronged!

94
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
You said we don't have any evidence?

95
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,570
What if we find evidence?

96
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,080
Do whatever you want.

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,560
It doesn't matter.

98
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,040
As long as I can clear my name.

99
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
What's this?

100
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
It's a metal detector.

101
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,440
Haven't seen it, have you?

102
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,080
If you can't find any evidence,

103
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,960
there would be divine consequences!

104
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,760
I'll request the Emperor to judge.

105
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
Let her go!

106
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,640
General Dai,

107
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,560
you'd better not move.

108
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,240
Or...

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,000
I told you to let her go!

110
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Joking!

111
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Xu,

112
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,700
I thought you were a good guy.

113
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,730
Lady,

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,240
I failed you.

115
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,430
Xu Ming,

116
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,120
I advise you to surrender.

117
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,760
On what grounds?

118
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,320
You forced me into the corner.

119
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,200
And still expect me to surrender!

120
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,560
Drop your sword!

121
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Put it down!

122
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,960
What do you mean by forcing you?

123
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,710
You killed guys.

124
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,840
And you even framed others.

125
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,240
It's all your fault.

126
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,080
No!

127
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,830
As long as I can benefit from it,

128
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,310
I'll do the right things right.

129
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,000
So, you admit it that

130
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,720
you framed our family,

131
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,600
as well as my father.

132
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,000
Exactly.

133
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,240
I did it.

134
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,440
Xu Ming,

135
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,200
it's an affair between us.

136
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,480
You can't hurt the innocent.

137
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
You let my lady go!

138
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,560
You two are

139
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,880
truly a deep and abiding love.

140
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,040
What do you want?

141
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,760
Take this bottle of drug.

142
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,560
Or,

143
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
you'll be laid to rest with

144
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,480
what happened 16 years ago.

145
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,400
Or,

146
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,320
I'll take your lady with me

147
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,360
to be buried.

148
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,320
Give me your choice.

149
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
Come on!

150
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,240
Don't take it!

151
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,400
- Don't do it!
- Take it!
