00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,860
Wonderful!

3
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,700
Beat him!

4
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,810
Good job!

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,690
Great!

6
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,740
Good!

7
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,920
If you don't buy, just come to get me!

8
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,880
General Xinwu...

9
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,470
Is he the General Xinwu, isn't he?

10
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,560
Why was he here?

11
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,640
The General Xinwu, right?

12
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,600
I've heard you had a relapse.

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,440
It seems you'll ask me for death.

14
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,320
Look, what did you pick?

15
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,000
Are you insane?

16
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,660
(Gosh!)

17
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,540
He doesn't know how to use it.

18
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,720
Are you here asking me for death?

19
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,980
You have nimble feet.

20
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,440
Dai Yu, just turn it around!

21
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,580
Facing outward!

22
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,160
You dare to run!

23
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:52,260
- Great!
- Good!

24
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,980
Once I can beat you down,

25
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,080
I'll achieve fame and success!

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,400
Pull it back, the one on top!

27
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,680
The one on top!

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,140
Pull back!

29
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,840
Pull the crescent-shaped one below.

30
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,260
The one beneath it!

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,280
Back! Quickly!

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,700
Go to die!

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,350
Luli Manor's man is impressive!

34
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,260
It really lives up to its reputation!

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,080
- The first time I
- All-inclusive!

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,140
saw someone successfully put my

37
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,280
grandfather's musket into use.

38
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,480
In my book,

39
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,640
the girl off the stage

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,080
really saw it through!

41
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,260
You mean Wan'er?

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,940
Do you know that girl?

43
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,540
Yes, and she's my friend.

44
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,260
And she opened the Box

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,480
which my grandfather left to me.

46
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,120
She's really somebody!

47
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,320
Look! You didn't know

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,320
how to use it, but still picking it!

49
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,000
I almost felt scared!

50
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,240
Because I trusted you!

51
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,740
Wan'er!

52
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,140
Wan'er!

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,760
What are you two doing here?

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,920
Have your seat!

55
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,040
What are you waiting for?

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,520
Taste our specialty, the cake!

57
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,140
Thank you!

58
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,050
I have nothing for you!

59
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,460
Well...

60
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,500
Sister.

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,630
Today, I want to

62
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,970
ask you for something.

63
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,020
Speak it out.

64
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,980
How did you know

65
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,840
the way of using the musket?

66
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,120
Since my grandfather made it,

67
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,560
he'd never let anyone else know.

68
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,940
Those masters have worked on it for

69
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,800
some days, but knowing nothing.

70
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,730
All I know is how to use it,

71
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,160
but its structure is a stranger to me.

72
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,040
Only the likes of your grandfather

73
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,440
could make it.

74
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,580
Lu Chen, could you please

75
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,400
take me to his room?

76
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,700
Those masters said

77
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,960
he always kept himself in the Pavilion.

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,600
Nobody was allowed to enter.

79
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,780
Well...

80
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,080
Could you take me there?

81
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,920
He might leave something behind for us.

82
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,980
Well...

83
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,440
It's off-limits in our manor.

84
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,200
Without those masters' permission,

85
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,040
no one is allowed to get in.

86
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,900
But,

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,760
if you want to be there,

88
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,480
I can take you there in secret.

89
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,880
But...

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,680
You mean Xiaoxiao?

91
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,800
Exactly!

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,300
I can give you my word that

93
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,360
I'll put in a good word for you!

94
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,600
Thank you for your great kindness!

95
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,180
I'll go there, too.

96
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,800
I never said I'd take you with us.

97
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,080
Lu Chen,

98
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,730
things are tough in the Pavilion.

99
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,760
He can protect us if he's there.

100
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,800
I can also guard you!

101
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,720
It'll be a great help if you're safe.

102
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,860
Alright.

103
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,580
Anyway, you're

104
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,560
a pawn in our team.

105
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,700
Let's go!

106
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,660
Go!

107
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,340
Time to go.

108
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,200
Here it is!

109
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,300
It's the Pavilion.

110
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,680
My grandfather always kept himself here.

111
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,880
When he was out, a new thing was out.

112
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,960
Why is it so messy?

113
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,920
Someone was here just now.

114
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,880
Someone else broke into this place.

115
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,500
(Gun Barrel, Bullets)

116
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,560
Su Ke,

117
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,240
I hope, one day,

118
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,680
you can meet the Mirror

119
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,790
(The Collision of Nature and Embroidery)

120
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,840
which I left to you

121
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,920
at the Meeting.

122
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,900
(Liu)

123
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,080
What are you thinking about, lady?

124
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,280
I'm wondering if

125
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,440
the truth will come out

126
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,960
after passing the Meeting?

127
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,280
I gave you my word that

128
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,720
I'll let you know our story.

129
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,720
If I say to you that

130
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,880
I don't belong in this world,

131
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,400
will you believe in me?

132
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,320
Whatever you say,

133
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,480
I'll always believe in you.

134
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,320
Lu Li,

135
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,080
the Emperor,

136
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,920
your father,

137
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,960
and me

138
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,640
don't belong to this world.

139
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,960
We time travelled

140
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,960
from another time and space.

141
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm Su Ke,

142
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,680
from a world

143
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,360
far, far in the future.

144
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,880
I want to know

145
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,120
what your world is like.

146
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,720
It might be hard for you to imagine.

147
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,580
People

148
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,240
can fly in the sky.

149
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,620
There are no horses but

150
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,840
cars on the road.

151
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,460
from the capital to the Dongzhao Kingdom

152
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,120
only takes half a day.

153
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,920
The nights there

154
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,160
can be as bright as day.

155
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,760
Living in such a world,

156
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,360
must be very happy.

157
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,400
You'll return

158
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,880
after passing the Meeting,

159
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,560
right?

160
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,080
Anyway, I still have you by my side.

161
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,160
I'll always be with you,

162
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,440
no matter how much time we have left.

163
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,760
I won't let anyone hurt you.

164
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,690
I will definitely make sure you

165
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,880
return safely to your world!

166
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,920
