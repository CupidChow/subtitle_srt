2
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,000
Lu Chen, you're just a paper tiger!

3
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,840
It's so long for you

4
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,150
to go to the bathroom!

5
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,360
I have to pull you back.

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Lu Chen,

7
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,480
I think you're right.

8
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,590
What I saw myself

9
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,000
is not real, to some extent.

10
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,840
Maybe,

11
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,270
as long as I wake up,

12
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,910
it'll be back to the starting point.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,400
It feels like I'm in a dream.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,120
Dai Yu,

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,680
you're a liar.

16
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,040
I shouldn't have fallen in love.

17
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,240
Sorry.

18
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,590
General, it's done!

19
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,510
Take the lady's belongings.

20
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,470
I got it.

21
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,530
Miss, you're awake.

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,440
Yingtao,

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,470
why did I come back?

24
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,910
Miss, the general

25
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,160
sent you back last night.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,880
I was so worried about you.

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
You can't afford to

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,360
leave me alone,

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,390
just go out yourself!

30
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,310
Is that ok?

31
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,560
Dammit! That Dai person!

32
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,750
Why did you send me back?

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,240
You've been my wife.

34
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,190
But you got drunk late at night.

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
What a disgrace!

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,750
I'm not one of your members.

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,910
Never try to suppress me with your rules!

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm asking you again.

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Why

40
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,440
did you kill my friends?

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,720
I did kill many people.

42
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,830
But I surely didn't know

43
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,470
who your friends were.

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,320
What a kind of person you are.

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,240
How can you live with it,

46
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,720
saying this?

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,270
Don't you think you have to explain?

48
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,390
We're a couple.

49
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,670
What's an explanation for?

50
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,950
Alright.

51
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,550
I got it.

52
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,750
From the very beginning,

53
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,960
you wanted me to be with you,

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
that was all for the case,

55
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,470
finding where your father was.

56
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,110
From beginning to end,

57
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,750
you just capitalized on me.

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,110
You fear I'd leave, and

59
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,470
you had no way to continue it.

60
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,880
So, you killed my friends, right?

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,910
What exactly do I mean to you?

62
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,320
Dai Yu, say something!

63
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,270
You need to know that

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
I didn't kill any of your friends.

65
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,790
If you keep talking nonsense,

66
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,230
I'll break this marriage!

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,790
No need for that.

68
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,480
I'll leave.

69
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,230
Miss, the pears are sent here.

70
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,550
See, these pears

71
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,390
are all very fresh!

72
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,920
After you two make up,

73
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,320
just do it again!

74
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,550
It means taking the cherry on top.

75
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,350
Take the cherry on top?

76
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,530
Pears!

77
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,880
- Miss!
- Divorce!

78
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,670
I'm leaving on my own.

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,530
Who do you think you are?

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,130
- Miss!
- I don't care!

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Well...

82
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
Miss!

83
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,950
Well...

84
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,480
Pears!

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,930
Yingtao, what's wrong with her?

86
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,320
I don't know, either!

87
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,440
But it feels like

88
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,570
the lady wants to divorce him.

89
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,690
What should we do?

90
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
If so,

91
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,770
will the general be the first one

92
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,940
who's been divorced from his lady?

93
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,280
What a great humiliation!

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,070
Absurd!

95
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Remember,

96
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,090
it can't be announced in the mansion.

97
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,720
Come on, pick them up!

98
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,070
Master!

99
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,160
Master!

100
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,640
Master, where are you?

101
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,720
Master!

102
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,920
Master!

103
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,790
Master!

104
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,670
Master!

105
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,350
Master! What happened?

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
I'll...

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
Come on! Help me!

108
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,660
I took a piss but was kidnapped.

109
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,510
These kidnappers are too ruthless!

110
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,000
They took all your clothes away!

111
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,620
Where's Wan'er?

112
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,120
Wan'er...

113
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,640
According to the innkeeper,

114
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,550
a general took her away.

115
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,640
A general?!

116
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,670
Help me up!

117
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
Dai Yu!

118
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,390
He kidnapped me yesterday.

119
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,670
Master, we didn't have any evidence.

120
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,830
Even if it were Dai Yu,

121
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,200
we surely had no way!

122
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,110
Kidnapping doesn't matter.

123
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,550
I can't afford to let Wan'er suffer.

124
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,230
- Yes.
- She should return.

125
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,760
If he treats

126
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,510
Wan'er the way he treats me,

127
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,540
I must save a damsel in distress.

128
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:22,510
Negative.

129
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,390
We are not in Dongzhao Kingdom.

130
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,000
Even if you go, you have no way.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,060
What should we do then?

132
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,230
I can't afford to do anything, seeing

133
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,350
Wan'er to suffer.

134
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,040
Absurd!

135
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,760
You just want to take the chance

136
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,070
when the couple quarrels.

137
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,790
Nonsense!

138
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,520
Take the chance when they quarrel?

139
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,790
I just want to free...

140
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,950
Alright.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,070
An innocent young lady!

142
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,230
- Yes.
- And I don't...

143
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,720
Something between me

144
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,630
and Wan'er

145
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,560
is that kind of

146
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,000
sibling-like friendship.

147
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,480
I already Xiaoxiao

148
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,890
in my heart.

149
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,920
- So pretty!
- You said it!

150
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,390
You want to care for every girl equally.

151
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,950
As for the Meeting,

152
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,350
I think

153
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,050
you should be duty-bound to

154
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,390
compete with others

155
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,790
for our country.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,270
I wonder if you

157
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,730
and all the ministers

158
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,670
have any objections?

159
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,950
No objection!

160
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,380
It's my great honor to

161
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,750
fight for our country.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,880
I'll never fail the mission for sure.

163
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,580
The general has won much favor.

164
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,020
But the Emperor orders him to die.

165
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,280
Could it be that he still cannot forget

166
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,430
the great crime committed by Lord Dai?

167
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,790
Try to guess what the Emperor thought.

168
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,150
You want to be executed, right?

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,840
Mingting,

170
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,200
I took a break at the Empress's palace,

171
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,320
knowing you're asked to the Meeting.

172
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,710
Is that real?

173
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,590
The Emperor just issued the decree.

174
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,110
The harem already knows!

175
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,410
Interfering in state affairs

176
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,480
is very inappropriate.

177
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,790
It's a moment of crisis.

178
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,670
You're still pretending.

179
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,640
You haven't been cured.

180
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,150
This trip is likely a one-way journey.

181
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,520
How could he make things so difficult?

182
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I also heard

183
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,440
His Majesty frequently summons Su.

184
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,750
Could it be...

185
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,110
Xiaoxiao, speak cautiously!

186
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,320
Don't involve my lady in it.

187
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,710
His Majesty has issued the decree.

188
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
That means he made up his mind.

189
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,400
I'm also willing to do my part.

190
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,800
It's also my duty

191
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,400
to be a minister.

192
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,150
