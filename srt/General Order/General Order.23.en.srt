2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,690
I really can't figure it out that

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,480
the Emperor of Wu is

4
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,980
someone who harms the loyal and good!

5
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,730
And Wan'er,

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,360
have you two been in a

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,010
complex, entangled relationship?

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,460
Now, our opponent gained the upper hand.

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,290
If we just simply take action,

10
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,140
it's as if striking a stone with an egg.

11
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,990
Wan'er.

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,370
If you need my help,

13
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,820
our Manor will definitely

14
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,500
do whatever we can do.

15
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,140
Lu Chen,

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,430
thank you.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,540
It's lucky for me

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,260
to make friends like you.

19
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,100
But for this thing,

20
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,930
we have to handle it ourselves.

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,350
And,

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,230
I don't want to get your Manor

23
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,220
involved.

24
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,050
So, what should we do now?

25
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,220
The most important thing is

26
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,960
we need to think about

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,010
how we should do next.

28
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,650
After Sun Duo was back on the court,

29
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,290
he must be on high alert.

30
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,140
He took the General Token away.

31
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,730
We must get it back!

32
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,370
If such a villain keeps

33
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,930
ruling this country,

34
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,900
all under heaven will surely suffer!

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,840
General,

36
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,360
in line with your health condition,

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm so worried about it.

38
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
It doesn't matter.

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,820
I'm the general.

40
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,320
I should do my part for all.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,730
It's my duty.

42
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,540
For those extremely evil,

43
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,340
I won't let any of them go!

44
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,930
Alright, we'd go back together.

45
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,130
And we also bring this emperor to

46
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,650
where

47
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,340
he's supposed to be.

48
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,460
(The General Token)

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,670
Are there any words on the general

50
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,370
in the city these days?

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,290
Your Majesty,

52
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,060
there's no sign of General Dai.

53
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,980
Send my message

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,290
to get more patrol guards to

55
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,260
be on high alert!

56
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,830
Got it.

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,710
Halt!

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,710
Inspect!

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
Where are you from?

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,290
Outside of the gate.

61
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,370
Go. The next one.

62
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,350
Come over here.

63
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,630
What are you doing here?

64
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,570
Come here.

65
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,950
- General.
- You can go.

66
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,570
It seems the city is heavily guarded.

67
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,460
If you keep staying here,

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,620
I fear you'll be in peril.

69
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,060
My mansion must also be heavily guarded.

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,520
Han Qing,

71
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,290
take Yingtao to the inn, waiting.

72
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,430
I'll take my lady

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,150
to stay outside of the city tonight.

74
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,390
We'll sneak into the palace tomorrow.

75
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,100
- General.
- My order!

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,880
Miss!

77
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,930
Yingtao, do as he ordered.

78
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,180
Wait for me in the inn!

79
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,470
Alright.

80
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,660
Where are you going?

81
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,120
To my relatives.

82
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,490
You go ahead.

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,680
Lady,

84
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,650
are you worried about what'll happen?

85
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,300
Lady, no need to worry about it.

86
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,820
I'll take the Token back tomorrow

87
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,610
whatever it costs!

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,300
Compared to the General Token,

89
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,820
I'm more worried about you.

90
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,740
You fear I'm about to die?

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,610
Just like that day,

92
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,210
the same as when I took the poison,

93
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
right?

94
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,140
Sometimes, I thought

95
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,700
if I could be born in this era,

96
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,740
not time traveling

97
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,890
to be your lady,

98
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,420
that would be a very happy thing, right?

99
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,020
I can have your words.

100
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,740
That's enough.

101
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,490
Before meeting you,

102
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,370
I always lived in pain.

103
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,370
My father suffered an unjust accusation.

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,300
My family

105
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,740
was also despised by all people.

106
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,260
Nothing I could do but many battles,

107
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,890
cases and countless searching

108
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,370
I have to be in

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,740
for the elusive truth.

110
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,140
Because only by doing so,

111
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,980
can I preserve our glory.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,370
But after meeting you,

113
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,980
I just found

114
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,580
besides pain, there's more in the world.

115
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,150
Lady,

116
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,370
Is there also pain

117
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,490
in your world?

118
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,490
How should I put it?

119
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,370
We have a lot of pressure out there.

120
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,580
We have to take exams,

121
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,980
finding jobs,

122
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,050
buying houses and

123
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,370
paying off mortgages.

124
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,330
Speaking of these things,

125
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,100
you won't fully understand.

126
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,930
How to express your feelings

127
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,310
if you fall in love with someone

128
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,980
in your world?

129
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,140
In my world,

130
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,210
I'd be outspoken, letting them know.

131
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,980
In general,

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,860
I'd say I love you.

133
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,610
I love you?

134
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,330
I love you, too.

135
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,330
Who are we waiting for?

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,840
Xiaoxiao.

137
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,700
Xiaoxiao?

138
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,260
She'll help us go into

139
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,930
the emperor's bedchamber.

140
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,280
Mingting!

141
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
Xiaoxiao,

142
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,310
have you read the letter

143
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,150
I wrote to you?

144
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,470
Yes.

145
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,860
Is what you wrote true?

146
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,740
Exactly!

147
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,450
The current emperor

148
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,020
has long been replaced.

149
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,650
I've let my father examine your letter.

150
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,500
In fact, he's also doubted it.

151
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,210
He's removed the guards around it

152
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,620
as you requested.

153
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,570
Thank you, Mo.

154
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,500
You just follow this path to his

155
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,890
chamber through the harem.

156
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,650
There're fewer guards along the way.

157
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,950
Xiaoxiao,

158
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,940
thank you.

159
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,060
Sister Su,

160
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,300
and Mingting,

161
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,180
I want you two to return safely.

162
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,390
Thank you.

163
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,640
Let's go.
