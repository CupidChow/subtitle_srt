2
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,860
Come here, Sun Duo.

3
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,140
Come here, and you can't be alone.

4
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,220
Let me introduce.

5
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,770
It's our club's newcomer.

6
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,610
Sun Duo.

7
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,180
- Guys, welcome him.
- Welcome.

8
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,660
- It's Cao Jian.
- Hello.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,940
- It's Liu.
- Liu.

10
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,870
Hello, Sun Duo.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,890
Alright. Today,

12
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,520
all members have been here.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,430
Let us

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,480
take a photo as a memento.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,740
- Great.
- Good.

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,760
Come on.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,000
Three, two, one.

18
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,760
Su Ke.

19
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,080
It turns out that

20
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,960
you protected me.

21
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,920
Now,

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
I should come to shield you.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,680
Is that ok?

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,120
General, relax.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,360
His Majesty's having a meal.

26
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,160
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
I heard my wife yelling

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,640
when I was outside the hall.

29
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,160
I see my wife is quite drunk.

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,320
I'm worried about her.

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,320
Sorry to offend you.

32
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,000
Please allow me to take my wife back.

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,150
To where?

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,000
Home.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,240
- Time to go.
- Go home.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,080
Time to go home!

37
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,960
(Finally,)

38
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,200
(I got you.)

39
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,500
I'm telling you that

40
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,340
buddy...

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,340
I'm a loser, really.

42
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,860
Am I not kind and lovely?

43
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,860
Someone actually wants to kill me!

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,180
Am I not beautiful and graceful?

45
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,940
I'm forced to

46
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,860
wait on my husband with another one.

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,300
And she wants me to be a concubine!

48
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,460
It's unfair!

49
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,260
Honey!

50
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,380
I promise you that

51
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,820
you're my only wife in my mansion.

52
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,620
The General's Mansion...

53
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,380
It's you!

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,340
I'm telling you that

55
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,180
You're a virgin, and I need to

56
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,460
make use of it, not suffering a loss!

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,580
I have to

58
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,420
strike first to gain the upper hand!

59
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,100
Honey!

60
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,960
Stop it, honey!

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,060
What's wrong?

62
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,530
Rejecting me is everything to you.

63
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,180
And you never said no to others.

64
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,100
Honey.

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,820
Let's go back to keep going.

66
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,300
Is that ok?

67
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,460
Well... Go back.

68
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,180
After that, I can do everything I like?

69
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,740
Leave me alone!

70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
How is it going about

71
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,780
what I've told you?

72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,660
I'm still on it.

73
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,580
Alright.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,110
- General.
- Let me know.

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
I got it.

76
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:18,870
Han Qing.

77
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,010
Is your injury healed?

78
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,020
Much better!

79
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,000
No need to worry about me, lady.

80
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,930
What happened to your face?

81
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,180
Got hit by someone.

82
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,700
Who did it?

83
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,620
What did His Majesty say to you?

84
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,490
Su Ke.

85
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,030
Now, I am

86
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
the Emperor

87
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,250
of this country.

88
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,840
I need to examine it carefully

89
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,120
what I said

90
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,310
and did.

91
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,160
So,

92
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,860
you can't afford to

93
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,040
tip my real identity off

94
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,200
to anyone else.

95
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,650
I got it.

96
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,680
He just asked me about

97
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,600
how is my father going, and

98
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,920
whether I'm accustomed to living here.

99
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,080
That's all.

100
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,040
You didn't slip out, right?

101
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,760
How could that be?

102
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,960
I just said I lost my memory.

103
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,800
Covered it up!

104
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:12,930
Let's go.

105
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,760
You need to accompany me somewhere.

106
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,450
Where?

107
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,440
A copper stall.

108
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,810
You were supposed to go to the stall,

109
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,460
but to the Treasure Pavilion instead.

110
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,300
You said it.

111
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,190
Why's the Copper Stall?

112
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,860
In general, the barrel of a musket

113
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,480
is made of brass.

114
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,560
So, we need to

115
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
go to the Copper Stall to check it out

116
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,140
if anyone has recently bought brass.

117
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,360
Then, there will be clues.

118
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,600
Why have they yet to come?

119
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,280
Such a valuable thing!

120
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,640
Don't they want to take it back?

121
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,960
They're on their way here.

122
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,210
The carriage is here!

123
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,930
Hurry up, get ready to welcome them.

124
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,700
But it seems they're not coming to us.

125
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,960
Where are they going?

126
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,800
I don't know.

127
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,640
Come on.

128
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,600
Hurry up!

129
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,740
(The Copper Stall)

130
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,800
Come on, take a look!

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,080
Right here!

132
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,990
Guys,

133
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,360
what are you about to look for?

134
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,120
I want to ask you that

135
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,640
has anyone come here recently,

136
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,080
buying a large amount of brass?

137
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,640
Well...

138
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,400
It seems there really is.

139
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,480
There's someone who's

140
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,840
at the southernmost end of Ping'an Alley

141
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,730
in the southern area of this city,

142
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,600
buying brass from me.

143
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,620
They've bought it several times.

144
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,340
What were they doing here?

145
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
Master,

146
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,440
do you think what we're doing

147
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,760
count as peeping or not?

148
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,000
Nonsense!

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,120
What's wrong with you?

150
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,380
You came up with this lousy idea!

151
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,640
You drove me to pursue Su Wan'er.

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,540
Don't mention 'steal' to me again!

153
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,320
Master.

154
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,680
If you don't go to

155
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,320
poach from this Yama Dai,

156
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
you won't bring the Box

157
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,760
back to our manor.

158
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,010
Thank you.

159
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,870
Fine.

160
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,660
Let's move to another one.

161
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,240
Wan'er!

162
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,960
Wan'er!

163
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,280
Master.

164
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,130
You did a hard job following me!

165
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,240
Not too bad.

166
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,880
You're so alert to see it through.

167
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,160
Sneaking around is what you're best at.

168
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,670
You...

169
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,720
I'm not here for you.

170
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,440
I'm here for Wan'er.

171
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,480
Wan'er.

172
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,140
I was so abrupt last time.

173
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,280
Suppose,

174
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,430
you must be

175
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,820
the descendant of Granny Ke, right?

176
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,240
When my grandfather was alive,

177
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,470
he always spoke of Granny Ke.

178
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,440
It seems

179
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,680
we've been friends for generations.

180
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,160
I want to thank you for

181
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,280
helping me retrieve my suitcase.

182
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,200
I was quite rude before.

183
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,020
I suppose you also noticed that

184
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,220
you left in a hurry,

185
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,660
so you missed a precious item.

186
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,870
I specially came here

187
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,200
to return the item.

188
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,580
A treasure?

189
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,640
What's that?

190
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,560
The treasure you spoke of

191
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,090
is this thing.

192
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,400
Such a crystal-clear gem!

193
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,600
It's a masterpiece of the world.

194
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,880
Suppose you fail to find it out,

195
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,720
you surely...

196
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,000
Thank you.

197
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,160
Master, you really have a big heart.

198
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,480
You sent the treasure to me and

199
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,000
never give it up.

200
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
Do you have anything with it?

201
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,820
Wan'er is my wife.

202
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,040
Of course, I'm part of it.

203
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,540
Look, you'd keep going.

204
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,480
I'll leave you alone to the carriage?

205
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,520
The irrelevant one should've left.

206
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,200
I'm leaving!

207
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,000
But I'm not the irrelevant one!

208
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,120
