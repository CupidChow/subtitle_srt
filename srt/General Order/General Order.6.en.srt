2
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,600
Are you guys here

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,180
to buy bamboo from me?

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,600
I just want to ask you about

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,220
did you buy a batch of copper ingots?

6
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,420
Why

7
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,660
do you want to ask me about it?

8
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,080
I want to make some copper mirrors.

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,440
I heard from the copper stall owner

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,060
you bought all the copper ingots.

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,640
So, we came to you to ask

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,220
could you share some with us?

13
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,200
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,540
One of my relatives runs a stall.

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,860
So I did this for those guys.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,060
Where are the copper ingots?

17
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,280
Leave them alone.

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,340
Come to help me with it.

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,680
Sorry to bother you.

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,500
We've been on it for all the day.

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,880
I've been exhausted.

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,740
The point is there are no clues.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,460
Did you notice their house just now?

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,740
What's up?

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,780
There's no bed

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,040
in their house.

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,160
And no stove, either.

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,820
Possible if they were single.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,020
But for a family of three,

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,500
It feels like something is missing.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,260
So, he was lying.

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,320
Yes.

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Suppose they hired

34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,500
that woman and child.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,500
The whittling bamboo on the side

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,040
should be the real owner.

37
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,220
How did you know?

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,820
I saw it through his actions,

39
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,100
strong and powerful.

40
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,620
He should be trained since he was born.

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,460
Could he be the murderer?

42
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,580
It's still uncertain now.

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,940
Don't alert him yet.

44
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,580
I'll find a way out.

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,420
(Where's he?)

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,940
(I wanted to discuss it with him.)

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,300
(This Dai Yu person,)

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,260
(who stole my picture in secret.)

49
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,580
(Could he have fallen for me?)

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,060
(Wang Qiaoyun, from Nanyang City)

51
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,580
(Are these the picts of )

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,580
(the previously killed women?)

53
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,620
(The deceased, Su Wan'er, Nanyang City)

54
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,460
(The deceased, Su Wan'er, Nanyang City)

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,340
Since your daughter came back to life,

56
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,560
alright,

57
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,780
a funeral may turn into a wedding.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,660
I'll take my lady away.

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,660
And she'll feel at ease to be with me,

60
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,300
keeping playing Su Wan'er.

61
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,920
I can make sure you're safe.

62
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,980
What do you think of it?

63
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,620
Lian'er.

64
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,330
I miss you so much, Lian'er.

65
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,000
(It turns out every murdered woman,)

66
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,740
(who resembles me.)

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,840
I was told to be protected,

68
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,260
that was a lie.

69
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,500
(They actually use my life as bait.)

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,040
General,

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,580
the lady feels upset.

72
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,800
She doesn't want to see you.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,020
Why?

74
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,700
I have no idea.

75
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,140
Anyway, she cried for a long time.

76
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,230
General.

77
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,160
Lady.

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,580
- Lady.
- Leave her alone.

79
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,780
Maybe she wants to be isolated.

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,900
Everything will be ok.

81
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,480
Fine.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,440
Just let me know

83
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,740
if my lady comes out.

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,760
I got it.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
Miss,

86
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,980
the general has gone.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Yingtao,

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,820
I want to go out for a while.

89
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,060
If I don't come back,

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,660
you go back to Su Mansion yourself.

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
Miss.

92
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,800
(It seems no one can be trusted.)

93
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,940
(I have to rely on myself.)

94
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,900
(I must find the guy
who made the gun.)

95
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,200
(Maybe,)

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,740
(there might be clues to go back.)

97
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,240
Who are you?

98
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,280
What are you doing here?

99
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm asking you

100
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,060
where did you hide the copper ingot?

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,980
Did you make the musket or not?

102
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,100
Don't come over!

103
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Stay back!

104
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,280
Back off!

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,960
Are you ok?

106
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,380
Why did you come here alone?

107
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,380
Do you know how dangerous it was?

108
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,080
Do you know you're playing with fire?

109
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,420
It's my business.

110
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,620
It's none of your concern.

111
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,180
What do you mean?

112
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,060
I've seen all the picts in your room.

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,140
You married me out of your case.

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,040
You did it for a reason.

115
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,740
I also have my things to do.

116
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,580
Let's just be like this.

117
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,440
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,520
It's my fault.

119
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,580
I have to say that

120
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,700
I did think so at first.

121
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,080
But,

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,460
I really see you as my real lady, and

123
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,660
I can't have the heart to get you hurt.

124
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,580
I'm also willing to use my own life

125
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,820
to make you safe.

126
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,620
Please trust me again.

127
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,400
Is that ok?

128
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Let's go.

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,020
Time to go home.

130
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,620
I feel exhausted.

131
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,900
(Dai Mansion)

132
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,920
What's this?

133
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,540
It's a sedative soup.

134
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,100
You go ahead.

135
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,900
Was that person the murderer?

136
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,640
No.

137
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,440
I have fought with the murderer,

138
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,580
who couldn't be such a nobody.

139
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,700
Did you find any new clues?

140
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,620
I found a token from him.

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,140
I've sent my man to be on it.

142
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,740
I heard from Xu Ming,

143
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,100
who spoke of your father's affairs.

144
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,960
Relax.

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,460
I'll be with you for the case.

146
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,520
Lady,

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,500
at present, the point is

148
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,060
you need to have some good rest.

149
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,780
Don't hang around anymore.

150
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,760
Lie down.

151
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,040
