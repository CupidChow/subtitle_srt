2
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,380
Dai Yu,

3
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,480
you've tried for over a decade.

4
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,080
Your dad can soon clear his name.

5
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,960
Don't take it!

6
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,160
Never do it.

7
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,920
Dai Yu!

8
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,920
Don't take it!

9
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,560
General Dai!

10
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,040
Dai Yu!

11
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,360
Dai Yu!

12
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,200
General Dai!

13
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,360
Dai Yu!

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,040
Dai Yu!

15
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,040
Let my lady go!

16
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,220
Dai Yu!

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,070
Dai Yu!

18
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,540
Your Majesty.

19
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,200
Are you all right?

20
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,180
I can't imagine the vicious murderer

21
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,520
is Xu Ming!

22
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,360
I really misjudged him!

23
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,640
- My servant!
- Here!

24
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,280
Take him out!

25
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,380
I got it!

26
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,360
Weren't you poisoned?

27
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,960
I didn't really take it.

28
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,640
Did he hurt you?

29
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,120
The case of Marquis Dai

30
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,950
(The deceased)
can rest in peace.

31
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,160
You take the evidence to me tomorrow.

32
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,680
I should announce it to the world

33
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,520
to clear the name of the Dai family.

34
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

35
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,740
Mingting,

36
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,240
time to let your obsession go.

37
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,760
And time to serve this country.

38
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,960
It's what a general should do!

39
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,500
I

40
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,200
won't fail you for sure!

41
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,640
His Majesty has left already.

42
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
You just stay here alone.

43
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,440
What are you waiting for?

44
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,360
Why didn't you show up?

45
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,520
I fear someone will overthink it.

46
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,580
See, the case has been settled.

47
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,800
You've taken the revenge.

48
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,480
Why are you so upset?

49
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,440
You don't know how

50
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,920
to laugh, right?

51
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm asking you that

52
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,560
why you didn't let me take that drug?

53
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,580
You were worried about me,

54
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,740
right?

55
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,800
Thank you.

56
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,680
Forget it.

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,340
We've already cut a deal.

58
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,760
And it's been prescribed, right?

59
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,180
Well...

60
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,880
Now, the case has been settled.

61
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,560
Look,

62
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,520
are we still a couple?

63
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,600
Will you...

64
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,100
Well...

65
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,520
You're my real wife.

66
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,440
Without my permission,

67
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,600
you're not allowed to leave me alone.

Keep eating.

Lady, have more.

81
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,200
What's wrong with this couple?

82
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,760
Why do I feel weird?

83
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,860
I read something in a book,

84
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,290
it said for the newly married couple,

85
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,340
don't be reserved with each other,

86
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,660
hesitating a lot.

87
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,640
At this moment,

88
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,310
if someone gives them a push,

89
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,690
things will work out!

90
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,880
How?

91
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,800
Wait and see.

92
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,040
General, the carriage is ready.

93
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,980
By the way,

94
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,300
I heard others say,

95
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,860
before ministers go to court,

96
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,500
their ladies help them with their dress.

97
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,780
I wonder if

98
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,420
the general could be such lucky.

99
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,540
For such a trivial matter,

100
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,820
lady, no need to do it yourself.

101
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,540
It doesn't matter.

102
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,100
Just help him with his dress, right?

103
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,700
I'll do it.

104
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,620
