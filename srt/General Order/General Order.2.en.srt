=General Order=
=Episode 2=

2
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,320
Are you investigating

3
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,090
what caused Su Wan'er to die?

4
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,280
Yes.

5
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,240
Better if there's a computer.

6
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,200
Do like this,

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,440
you'll be exhausted.

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,760
Boddy,

9
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,860
are you busy with your things?

10
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,440
Miss...

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,120
No.

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,800
I should call you
General's lady.

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,060
I don't care.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,400
Is the general on a case
from 16 years ago?

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,220
16 years ago?

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,770
What's the case?

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,680
You knew nothing about it?

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
What was that?

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,200
Throw in a little gossip.

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,520
Come on, tell me something.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,150
It was the General's father, Lord Dai,

22
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,520
with the title of Martial Hero Marquis.

23
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,270
16 years ago,

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,680
people found he abducted young girls,

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,760
and brutally murdered them.

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,720
He was reviled as
the Lustful Marquis.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,280
(Could Su Wan'er's death)

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,920
(be linked to Dai Yu's father's case?)

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,400
After it was exposed,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,680
Lord Dai ran from the law.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,160
The Emperor planned to punish the whole.

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
But Dai went to the battlefield instead

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,240
achieved numerous military successes.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,770
That greatly pleased the Emperor and

35
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,400
specially granted Dai

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,440
three General Tokens.

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,680
I heard of them before.

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
Lady,

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,600
you really have a bad memory.

40
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,760
The General married you

41
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,440
with the help of a token.

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Well...

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,580
What about the remaining two?

44
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,640
One of them was used
to ask the emperor

45
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,920
to pardon the Dai family.

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,040
And the other one

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,480
is kept in the General's Mansion.

48
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,440
(Exactly.)

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
(Site of Tomb)
(I was holding it.)

50
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,660
(The General Token)
(then I got here.)

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,240
(Could the key to going back)

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,480
(be the General's Token?)

53
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,640
Go for it!

54
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,790
Come on!

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,160
Leave it, lady.

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,160
I can do it myself.

57
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,400
What do you mean?

58
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,760
You just leave so many items to a girl!

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,800
I'm talking to you!

60
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,920
Could it be that you're jealous?

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
You should be aware of your status.

62
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,160
You are the general's wife.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,440
You got pissed off, really!

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,560
Take these yourself if not so!

65
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,950
- Miss.
- I'm exhausted!

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,680
You're nobody!

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,520
A general like you, are you kidding?

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,600
Always bullying a weak woman like me!

69
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,440
I won't endure

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800
what you imposed on me at all!

71
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,680
Miss, what's wrong?

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,200
Why are you so angry?

73
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,400
Yingtao, remember this,

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,840
you'd never find a man like him!

75
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,080
Scheming and petty,

76
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,130
knowing nothing about tenderness!

77
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,180
He should've been a Scorpio!

78
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,400
A Scorpio?

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,640
Miss, you're talking about

80
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,720
I really can't understand again.

81
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,720
General,

82
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,200
I've all checked what

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,580
the dossier you brought back yesterday.

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,820
Among the six victims

85
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,320
only Chen Xiaolian

86
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,450
(Chen Xiaolian)
her mum were alive.

87
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,340
Where is she?

88
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,600
The older woman has an adopted son who

89
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,680
runs a noodle stall outside the city.

90
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,040
An adopted son?

91
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
General.

92
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,700
Messsges from the Eastern Zhao Kingdom.

93
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,520
The owner of Luli Manor died last night.

94
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
This time, you take over

95
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,520
Baima City with a tactical gambit.

96
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,880
It's a great achievement for the ages!

97
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,720
I feel very pleased!

98
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,240
Your Majesty.

99
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,720
I just did my part.

100
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,690
(The Emperor Wu)
General,

101
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
have you ever heard about

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,240
affairs of the Eastern Zhao Kingdom?

103
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,340
I

104
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,420
just learned about it.

105
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,460
This time,

106
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,130
the Lord Lu Li passed away.

107
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,280
I have decided

108
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,840
to personally pay my respects.

109
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,720
Luli Manor is full of myth, unknown.

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
Your Majesty, you must not go there!

111
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,640
It's rumored that a great treasure

112
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,080
is hidden out there.

113
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,900
If I could take advantage of it,

114
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,400
wouldn't it

115
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,480
help me

116
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
unify the world?

117
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
Your Majesty,

118
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,720
I have received the news that

119
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,880
Luli Manor will host
the Grant Gathering.

120
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
At that time,

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,640
it won't be too late to make a decision.

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
Your Majesty!

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,080
Enough!

124
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,320
I always have the final say!

125
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
Tell me about your things.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I heard you used the General's Token

127
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,430
to marry Su He's daughter.

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,840
Is it true?

129
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,640
Indeed.

130
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,120
One day,

131
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
you'd bring your wife here,

132
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,320
so I'd have a look and examine

133
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,930
whether the Token deserves

134
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,640
your lady.

135
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,360
(The Token is the key to time travel.)

136
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,240
(But the mansion is vast.)

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,640
(Where could it be hidden?)

138
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Lady,

139
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,320
it's late at night.

140
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
You're dressed so lightly.

141
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,590
Be careful not to catch a cold.

142
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,820
Well, I just

143
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,680
couldn't sleep.

144
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,720
So I went out for a walk.

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,880
I'm okay.

146
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm surprised you're okay!

147
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,560
Han Qing saved me.

148
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
Commander Han, hold on!

149
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,200
I'll help you with the concealed weapon.

150
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
Relax.

151
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,620
I was told by the doctor that

152
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
you're safe.

153
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
Hold on.

154
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,880
It's almost done.

155
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,600
It's the ammunition of a musket.

156
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
What's that?

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,120
It's a weapon that uses gunpowder

158
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,620
to shoot out pellets,

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
injuring people.

160
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,360
I've been in battles for many years,

161
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,320
I fighted for many years,

162
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,880
You recognized it, amazing!

163
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,920
(Muskets don't exist in this era.)

164
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
(Could there be other time travelers?)

165
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
- Go ahead.
I got it.

166
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,320
How do you feel?

167
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,040
I appreciate your kindness,

168
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,240
I feel much better.

169
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,120
I thought about it all night.

170
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,280
I've made up my mind

171
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,320
to be with you.

172
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,690
With me for what?

173
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,680
For investigation.

174
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,920
I mean it.

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,560
The masked guy caused me trouble.

176
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,560
Han Qing is also injured because of me.

177
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,520
I really can't stand it anymore!

178
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,640
I got really pissed off!

179
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
From today,

180
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,040
I'll join you to be in the case.

181
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,120
I'll find this scoundrel

182
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,360
whatever the cost!

183
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,380
(Chen's Noodle Stall)

184
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Guys,

185
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,120
what would you like to eat?

186
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,640
Boss, what tasty things do you have?

187
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,120
Bring me all the best dishes!

188
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,000
I have the best vegetarian noodles.

189
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,400
Two bowls!

190
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,380
Alright, please wait a moment.

191
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
I don't want it.

192
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,490
It's not for you.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,840
Boss,

194
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,480
there's something I'd like to ask you.

195
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
Asking for directions?

196
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,160
Give me one penny

197
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,150
if you want to know directions.

198
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
You're practically a pay-to-win player!

199
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,600
It feels like we're playing house.

200
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,240
There's no sense of achievement at all!

201
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
Your turn.

202
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
Wait and see.

203
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,480
Lian'er,

204
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:00,960
is that you?

205
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,210
Lian'er!

206
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,710
I miss you so much, Lian'er!

207
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
What a heartless girl you are!

208
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,880
You said you were going to find Wen.

209
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,310
Why did you disappear without any clue?

210
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,440
- Come in quickly!
- Mother!

211
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,340
- I miss you, too!
- Come, Lian'er!

212
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,000
Lian'er!

213
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,960
Who's this guy?

214
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,360
He is...

215
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,620
Must be your sweetheart, right?

216
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,750
Truly a talented and handsome guy!

217
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,840
Come on!

218
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,760
Take your seat!

219
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,520
Mother.

220
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,120
What are you doing here?

221
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,920
He first came to our family,

222
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,760
but you left him alone.

223
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,760
Mother,

224
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,040
I...

225
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,440
I lost my memory.

226
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,800
So I don't remember anything.

227
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,120
No wonder

228
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,080
you haven't come back all these years!

229
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Are you okay?

230
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
I'm fine.

231
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,560
Mother.

232
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,480
Can you tell me more about Wen?

233
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,880
You little girl,

234
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,920
always talking about him all day long.

235
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,120
Think about that heartless man,

236
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,040
what's good about him?

237
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,320
I just want to know

238
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,840
how he betrayed me.

239
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,600
So I can learn from it.

240
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,080
If you really want to know about it,

241
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,540
you must promise me one thing.

242
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,520
No problem.

243
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,600
Alright.

244
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,400
You...

245
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
You need to get married first.

246
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,160
Well...

247
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,240
Marriage is a must when investigating?

248
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,120
I took you away from the forest.

249
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,160
I was so rude.

250
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,080
I'll make it up to
you with a wedding.

251
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,800
Who wants you to make it up?

252
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,300
(Joy)

253
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,880
First, bow to heaven and earth.

254
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,520
Heaven and Earth as witnesses.

255
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
You're going to be a happy union.

256
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,600
Bravo!

257
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,720
Second, bow to the parents.

258
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,680
Truly wonderful!

259
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,120
Two families united forever

260
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,360
with descendants over generations!

261
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,540
Bravo!

262
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,820
Great!

263
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,080
- Good!
- Bow to each other!

264
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,840
Harmony like a zither and harp,

265
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
lasting forever!

266
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,780
Wonderful!

267
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,640
- Good!
- Completed!

268
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Is there anything missing?

269
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,440
Girl, kiss each other!

270
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,000
Come on, kiss each other!

271
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,040
Come on, kiss!

272
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,950
Well...

273
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,920
Hurry up, make it quick!

274
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,200
Come on!

275
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,800
Well, but I...

276
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,160
- Just kiss!
- No, but!

277
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,290
- A real man?
- Shy?

278
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,880
Come on, kiss!

279
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,080
Kiss!

280
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,890
Kiss!

281
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,880
Kiss!

282
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,720
Kiss!

283
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,930
Kiss!
