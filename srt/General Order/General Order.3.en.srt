2
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,040
It seems you dreamed about something?

3
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,000
Honey, you look somewhat happy.

4
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,190
It's none of your business.

5
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,790
You turn around.

6
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,940
Do as I said.

7
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,630
Now,

8
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,110
you two got married.

9
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,910
That really makes me feel at ease.

10
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,320
In the coming days,

11
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,800
you two just live your good life.

12
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,560
Yes, we will.

13
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,190
The things you want to know

14
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,910
are all hidden in it.

15
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,510
Lian'er,

16
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
you promise me that

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,320
take good care of yourself.

18
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,110
Mother,

19
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,750
I will.

20
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,000
Alright.

21
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,720
You just go ahead.

22
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,310
Go now.

23
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,030
(If you're my real Lian'er,)

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,830
(that would be great!)

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me wait and see

26
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,320
about this Wen,

27
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,750
what kind of person he really is.

28
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,270
The way you are doing things

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,390
is more and more to be in our lines.

30
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,360
Being influenced by surroundings.

31
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,980
Come on, look!

32
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,110
(A Love Story)
It turns out Wen passed the exam.

33
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,670
It was the 4th year of Jingwu's Reign.

34
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,550
It's 16 years

35
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,160
from today.

36
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,280
That's to say,

37
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,750
once we can find

38
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,640
the list of scholars that year,

39
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,440
we'd definitely find Wen.

40
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,510
Halt!

41
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,880
Where will you be up to?

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,770
The old site of the Ministry of Justice.

43
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,580
You... Take me with you!

44
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,630
Dangerous out there.

45
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,470
You go back first.

46
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,720
You don't keep your word!

47
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,670
Men always

48
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,670
blurt out lies!

49
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,110
You're a real general.

50
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,830
How odd you go back on your word!

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
Miss,

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,000
did you quarrel with the general again?

53
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,790
He promised to take me with him.

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,670
Finally, he left me alone.

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,600
He is concerned about your safety.

56
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,920
Recently, more guards are put here.

57
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,550
Not even a mosquito can fly in.

58
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,880
You know

59
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,640
even Commander Han...

60
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,350
How's Han Qing doing now?

61
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,640
Miss, he's still recovering.

62
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,110
But he can barely get out of bed.

63
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,910
Yingtao,

64
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,200
about the bullet taken from him,

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,040
is it still there?

66
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,070
Yes.

67
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,280
Take it to me.

68
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,000
Plus,

69
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,250
is the copper stall in this city

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,160
far from here?

71
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,770
Miss,

72
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,320
why are we going to the copper stall?

73
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,480
For the case.

74
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,070
Miss, you don't know the way.

75
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,110
Why are you walking so fast?

76
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,600
Yingtao,

77
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,110
what's this place?

78
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,460
(Duobao Pavilion)
Duobao Pavilion!

79
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,480
The things inside

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,830
are all rarely to be seen!

81
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,040
Go in and take a look!

82
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,230
Miss, aren't we here for a case?

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,320
You always lose patience.

84
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,480
Girl!

85
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,720
Girl!

86
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,950
Come and take a look here!

87
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,390
I...

88
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,480
It's new in our store.

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,600
It's Rose essential oil soap.

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Take a look!

91
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,790
You're as beautiful as a fairy.

92
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,350
- (So exquisitely)
- If you use it,

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,510
and with this pink rouge,

94
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,440
you should be absolutely beautiful!

95
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,670
Isn't it a lipstick?

96
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,950
A lipstick?

97
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,950
All right.

98
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,270
You said it.

99
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,640
You apply it to your lips.

100
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,640
It's how a lipstick goes!

101
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,440
What a good name!

102
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,400
(Gosh!)

103
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,110
(Why are these things here?)

104
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,440
Do you like it?

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,980
(Lu Chen, the Owner)
Our Manor made it.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,880
There is no other stall.

107
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,390
You said

108
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,950
your manor made all of them?

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
Exactly.

110
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Where's your home?

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
(Lu Jiu, a servant)
You never heard?

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,880
Is it very famous?

113
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,260
It is quite interesting.

114
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,950
Well...

115
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,720
You invented all of them?

116
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,480
I'm not that capable.

117
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,150
My grandfather made them.

118
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,320
(Is he also a modern person?)

119
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,350
Buddy,

120
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,920
Luckily, we met today.

121
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,110
Can you

122
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,440
take me to meet your grandfather?

123
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Miss, you must be joking.

124
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,320
He passed away a few days ago.

125
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
All people knew it.

126
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,550
What you spoke of

127
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,390
is insulting our manor, right?

128
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,990
Died?

129
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,280
Young master,

130
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,760
the guy is so rude.

131
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,600
We can't get entangled.

132
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,320
(Site of Xinwu Tomb)
Liu,

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,670
give the tool to everyone.

134
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,350
Wait.

135
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,440
It's my suitcase.

136
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,040
Miss, you must be joking.

137
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,550
It's the treasure of our manor.

138
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,710
The Pandora's box.

139
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,110
How odd you recognized it!

140
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,880
Of course!

141
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,570
My suitcase, indeed!

142
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,300
The Pandora's box, nonsense!

143
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,640
You insist on claiming it as your own.

144
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,510
You have a nerve!

145
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,350
How can you speak like this?

146
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,510
But it's definitely...

147
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,920
Do you know Liu?

148
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
Have you seen him?

149
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,760
Do you know him?

150
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
Do you know where he is?

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,600
Never heard of this person.

152
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,320
Think about it carefully.

153
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,170
- How dare you!
- I mean it!

154
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,070
- You lied to me.
- Let go of him!

155
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,000
- Take her out!
- Don't lie to me!

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,480
Or, how would my suitcase be here?

157
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,350
Who dares!

158
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,040
Look,

159
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,550
it's the famous Yama Dai!

160
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,550
I wonder why she behaves so strangely

161
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,770
uttering wild words.

162
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,360
It turns out Dai is backing her up!

163
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,410
She's our lady.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
So you have no right

165
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,350
to get her out of here.

166
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,280
Miss, can you return the fan to me?

167
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,840
Sorry.

168
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,150
The time's right.

169
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,960
You keep going.

170
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,700
What do you want to do?

171
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,880
It's up to our lady.

172
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,640
He took my suitcase.

173
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,330
Our lady said you took her things.

174
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,960
Hand over the things.

175
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,840
We'll confront each other face-to-face.

176
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,390
Here it is!

177
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,960
It's one of the

178
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
inherited treasures of our manor.

179
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,470
The Pandora's box.

180
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,960
Crafted with exquisite skill.

181
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,110
It's been displayed for decades.

182
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
If our master didn't steal it out,

183
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,440
you wouldn't see it in your lifetime.

184
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,670
Such a precious thing.

185
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,000
How could it be yours?

186
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,230
Crafted with exquisite skill?

187
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,110
It's exactly what I bought online

188
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,440
for ninety-nine yuan.

189
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,880
It doesn't even deserve

190
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,350
to be your high-end synonym!

191
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,330
And you probably can't open it, right?

192
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,360
Of course!

193
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
Such a treasure is not so easily

194
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,040
to be opened.

195
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,750
Its mechanism is extremely complex.

196
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,790
My grandfather favored it

197
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,110
the most.

198
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,080
There are many mysteries inside.

199
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,760
To be honest,

200
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,080
many intricate tricks are included,

201
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,440
interlocking with each other.

202
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,230
Our seniors failed to open it

203
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,850
after decades of studying.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,900
How could a girl like you open it?

205
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,590
If you can really open it...

206
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,660
- She really did it.
- Really!

207
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,890
I did it.

208
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,480
What is it?

209
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,830
Well...

210
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,200
It's impossible!

211
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,000
How did you do it?

212
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,670
I told you

213
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,080
it's mine.

214
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,510
You must have opened it by accident.

215
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,590
It belongs to my grandfather.

216
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,550
How could it be yours?

217
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,200
If I can make it clear

218
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,550
what's inside this box,

219
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,790
that would count as evidence, right?

220
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,230
You just saw it.

221
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,070
It doesn't count.

222
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,960
You're the master.

223
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,760
It's rather unbecoming, isn't it?

224
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,120
What does it have to do with you?

225
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
I was asked to give it to its owner.

226
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,610
It absolutely cannot be her.

227
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,080
You want evidence?

228
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Fine.

229
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,180
I'll show you.

230
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,800
You put your hand

231
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,400
underneath that piece of clothing.

232
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,230
There's a wish charm.

233
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
You have a try.

234
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,150
Is it really there?

235
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
Yes, it's there.

236
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,390
She said it!

237
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,470
Do you believe it now?

238
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,080
You have to say what is on it.

239
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Then I'll believe in you.

240
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,710
Better not.

241
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,790
Negative. Do as I said.

242
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,660
I really...

243
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,850
Speechless.

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,940
(I have to be taken this year.)

245
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,150
Something on it is...

246
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,510
I,

247
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,430
Su Ke,

248
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,880
have to be taken this year.

249
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,030
What does this mean?

250
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,230
Yes, what does it mean?

251
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,390
Are you

252
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,470
