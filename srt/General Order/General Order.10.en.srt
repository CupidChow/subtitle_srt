2
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,500
Is the lady getting him dressed?

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,220
Come on, have your seat.

4
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,220
I'd put the hairpin on for you.

5
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,070
Come closer to me.

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,050
Is the lady tidying his hair?

7
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,640
Well... It...

8
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,700
It hooks the hair.

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,460
- Lady, watch out.
- Wait.

10
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,930
You better ask the emperor for a leave.

11
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,370
Lady, it's late.

12
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,980
- Let me do it.
- No need.

13
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,130
I feel it's better.

14
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,180
Thank you for your effort.

15
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Let's go.

16
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,190
Lu Chen came from the Luli Manor

17
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,820
to pay respects to Your Majesty.

18
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,130
The Meeting is impending.

19
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,160
The owner ordered me to invite you.

20
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm hoping, Your Majesty,

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,180
you'll ask your talents to show up.

22
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,770
Come on. No need for formalities.

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,260
The Meeting

24
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,820
is a grand event among various nations.

25
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,770
How could our country miss it?

26
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,540
After I discuss it with all ministers,

27
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,900
I'll surely give you a reply.

28
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,010
Since you've sincerely invited me,

29
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,900
I'll certainly respond with sincerity.

30
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,430
Come on.

31
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,630
Dammit. You Dai Yu person!

32
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,910
You dared to steal my spotlight

33
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,130
by using this method.

34
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,710
Your Majesty.

35
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,290
Take this token to Lu.

36
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,100
Lu,

37
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,590
you shall go in and out of this palace

38
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,850
as you wish

39
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,370
with this token.

40
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,010
I appreciate your kindness.

41
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,180
The Meeting is impending.

42
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,340
Who do you think should be sent?

43
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
In my book,

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,730
you've already had your ideal person.

45
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,340
We act according to the situation,

46
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,770
and wait and see.

47
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
Xiaoxiao.

48
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,680
Mingting.

49
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,890
I can finally see you.

50
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,680
Your

51
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,980
hairpin?

52
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,260
Look!

53
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,490
He pretends to be righteous.

54
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,890
But he dates a girl in secret here.

55
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,690
Never mind.

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,260
Xiaoxiao, why did you come to me?

57
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,920
In line with the Emperor's decree,

58
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,310
my dad found a suicide note when he

59
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,770
searched Xu Ming's house.

60
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,540
There's something suspicious about it.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,300
So, he asked me to take it to you.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,980
It must be a love letter!

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Thank you.

64
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,680
What's this?

65
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,370
Xu Ming's suicide note.

66
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,860
What's on it?

67
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,540
He confessed why he killed people.

68
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,200
A singer once

69
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,100
(A Suicide Note)
betrayed him.

70
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,820
So in revenge,

71
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,170
he killed anyone who

72
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,610
resembled that singer.

73
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,860
So, that would relieve his hatred.

74
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,540
So horrible!

75
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,440
He tried to transfer to the Ministry,

76
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,700
using his position to find similar ones.

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,650
But something is weird that

78
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,300
he never spoke of

79
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,900
that singer.

80
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,460
(A Suicide Note)

81
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,650
All I can know from this note

82
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,890
is

83
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,930
it's the end.

84
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,980
When you put it that way,

85
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,890
it does seem a bit deliberate.

86
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,720
It's as if someone handed the answer

87
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,020
right in front of you.

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,650
Yes.

89
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,490
Xu Ming and my father

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,420
almost never had any contact.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,790
Even if my father, for some reason,

92
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,300
affected his career path,

93
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,440
he wouldn't go so far as

94
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,640
to put our family

95
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,170
to a dead end.

96
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,890
Could it be said

97
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,420
there could be someone else hidden?

98
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,140
Your Majesty,

99
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,300
it's Xu Ming's last will.

100
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,520
(A Suicide Note)
Between the lines,

101
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,740
I found things were too deliberate.

102
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,890
I think

103
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,890
Xu Ming has all

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,370
invented it.

105
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,680
For this matter,

106
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,260
I fear there could be someone else.

107
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,370
General Dai,

108
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,170
it's been settled.

109
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,300
I also promised you to overturn it.

110
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,650
But now you're going back on your word.

111
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,530
You have only this note,

112
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,160
which is unable to prove

113
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,820
there could be someone else.

114
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,890
Your Majesty,

115
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,520
I just don't want to let go

116
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,820
of any guilty person.

117
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,140
There must be someone else

118
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,400
hidden!

119
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,890
General Dai,

120
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,420
with the help of the evidence you got,

121
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,540
it's enough to overturn.

122
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,890
I surely

123
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,040
announce to the world that

124
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,620
your family is innocent.

125
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,770
General,

126
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,050
why not do it as it should be?

127
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

128
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,930
My father is still unknown now.

129
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,170
I think

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,140
only if we keep pursuing,

131
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,050
I can finally find my father.

132
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,060
Just like your father,

133
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,100
you're so stubborn!

134
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,180
Forget it.

135
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,380
I won't have more comments on it.

136
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,600
The Meeting is impending.

137
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,500
We still don't have an ideal person.

138
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,210
I'm wondering

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,130
what do you think of it?

140
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,720
It's my duty

141
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,210
to serve this country.

142
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,180
Your Majesty, if you want me to attend,

143
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm willing

144
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,890
to be part of it.

145
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,570
I really appreciate

146
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,000
what

147
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,500
you just spoke of.

148
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,860
Your Majesty,

149
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,620
if something goes wrong,

150
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,570
I beg you for mercy,

151
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,250
taking good care of my family

152
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,380
and my lady.

153
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,360
(If Xu Ming is really a scapegoat,)

154
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,010
(who would be the real culprit?)

155
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,620
(Someone who can order the likes of him)

156
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,210
(should be of high rank and power.)

157
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,760
(I don't know if I could)

158
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,940
(handle that dead guy.)

159
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,500
(If I really don't have other choices,)

160
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,250
(I'd ask Sun Duo for help.)

161
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,880
(Negative.)

162
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,060
(These two don't get along.)

163
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,860
(Better not to cause trouble.)

164
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,210
Why hasn't he come back yet?

165
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,940
What's up?

166
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,150
Miss,

167
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,760
I just want to say

168
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,100
you and the general are finally hooked.

169
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,420
You've learned how to care about him.

170
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,380
It's quite different from that

171
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,770
when you first came here.

172
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,860
Stop talking nonsense!

173
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,100
I don't care about him.

174
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,690
I'm just worried about the case,

175
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,300
which hasn't been settled yet.

176
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,690
Plus, the assassins!

177
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,420
Miss, relax.

178
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,860
As long as the general is here,

179
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,810
everything will be all right.

180
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,860
(So,)

181
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,280
(It feels like the assassins don't)

182
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,010
(want me as greatly as I expected.)

183
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,910
Lady!

184
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
What's up?

185
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,300
Lady, a white-haired older man wants you.

186
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,380
He said he's one of your friends.

187
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,050
A white-haired older man?

188
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,210
I don't know any of them!

189
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,810
He also left you a message.

190
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,990
He said that when you hear it,

191
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,090
you'll know who he is.

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,310
What's that?

193
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,450
Half for each one, feelings won't fade.

194
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,860
Liu!

195
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,310
(Liu would definitely say it to me)

196
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,690
(when he bought snacks.)

197
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,320
He also said

198
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,770
he figured out how to take you away.

199
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,220
Where's he?

200
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,570
Right at the door.

201
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,980
Miss! Just wait!

202
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,960
It's cold outside!

203
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,940
- Su Ke!
- Liu!

204
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,690
