2
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,430
- Your Majesty.
- What's up?

3
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,040
Someone broke into the jail.

4
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,720
Who's it?

5
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,720
Father.

6
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm General Xinwu.

7
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,800
What?

8
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,880
Yu.

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
Father.

10
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,950
It's a long story.

11
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,080
When you were framed

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,000
saying you rapped the girls,

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,440
the Emperor planned to punish Dai.

14
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,510
It was me, who goes

15
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,950
to the frontier to atone for my sins,

16
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,000
taking over many cities.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,950
So, that quelled the Emperor's anger.

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,760
From that day,

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,310
I was titled as

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,160
General Xinwu.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,120
And I was bestowed with three tokens.

22
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,030
Father.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,860
So that's how it is!

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,630
If Sun Duo didn't trap me,

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,870
you

26
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,510
wouldn't be titled as General Xinwu,

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,080
and you wouldn't have three tokens.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
So,

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,230
it's all

30
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,360
been fated.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Father.

32
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,000
The Emperor ordered to conceal the gate.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,240
You have to go now!

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,360
Father, I'll get you out of here.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,000
- Go, leave me.
- Cao!

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,200
Leave me alone.

37
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,960
It's too late.

38
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,670
You must leave here now!

39
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,630
If you were caught,

40
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,190
everything would be all over!

41
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,750
Go to Luli Manor!

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,470
And find a way out!

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,360
- But...
- No!

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,470
He can still take advantage of me.

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,030
He won't harm me.

46
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,750
Go, now!

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Dai Yu!

48
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
It's late!

49
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,190
- Alright.
- Cao.

50
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,390
You wait here for us to return.

51
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,510
Alright.

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,720
Father,

53
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,360
I'll come back to you

54
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,600
till I find the truth.

55
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,560
- Go!
- Go!

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,550
Are you all right?

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,240
I really can't make it clear that

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,910
why did the Emperor do so

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
without letting me know?

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,390
The Emperor has been lured by power.

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,330
We'd better listen to your father,

62
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,060
not confronting him.

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,520
- So...
- Lady,

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,320
no more words.

65
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,000
I understand.

66
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,490
The most important thing is

67
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,830
we head to Luli Manor

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,910
to make the whole thing clear.

69
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,960
Then, go back to save my father.

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,560
I promise you that

71
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,450
I'll tell you the truth about

72
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,270
the Emperor

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,270
and me when we

74
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,160
come to the Manor.

75
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,560
Cao.

76
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,390
Cao.

77
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,470
You woke up?

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,280
Have a look at

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
who it is.

80
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,790
It's Liu!

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Liu!

82
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,440
It's the gift

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
sent for you.

84
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,630
Do you like it?

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,880
Liu,

86
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,000
I heard you died.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I just felt

88
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,350
something was wrong.

89
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,830
And Su Ke just came here.

90
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,070
I sent the message

91
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,920
to Luli Manor.

92
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,720
To my surprise,

93
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,830
you really took the bait.

94
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,480
You're really smart.

95
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,230
See, I finally defeated you.

96
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,390
Cao Jian,

97
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,110
have you seen it?

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
It's what you'll get

99
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,390
if you try to do it against me!

100
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,270
You two are always my major threat.

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,480
Now, without you guys,

102
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,320
I can finally

103
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,270
rest easy!

104
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,630
Sun Duo!

105
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,830
You'll get what's coming to you!

106
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,670
So,

107
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,510
let's wait and see!

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,200
Su Ke,

109
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,510
it's just you

110
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
and me now.

111
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,480
Dammit! Sun Jiu!

112
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,670
Such barbarians like you

113
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,670
dared to take over my land!

114
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,200
And made wild claims!

115
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
Han Tan,

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,930
what makes you believe it's your realm,

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,770
(The Trial Ground)
based on your words?

118
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,350
Take it back if you're capable!

119
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,830
- Come on, hit me!
- You!

120
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,720
Hit him. Come on!

121
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,880
Guys, keep quiet!

122
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,830
Why did you rush things?

123
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,790
There'll be more chances

124
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,830
as the Meeting begins.

125
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,880
Welcome to the Meeting every three years

126
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,490
held at the Luli Manor!

127
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,920
Lu Li left three trials.

128
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,830
Someone who passes the test smoothly

129
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,320
will get the greatest treasure.

130
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,270
Presumably, you all know

131
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,200
I can only make sure those who pass

132
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,790
will be safe.

133
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,200
As for losers,

134
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,260
I have to say, good luck for yourselves.

135
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,270
Open the Box.

136
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,510
It's our secret poison.

137
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,670
Nobody can detoxify but us.

138
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,000
Those who pass will be given it.

139
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,390
Now, the Meeting begins!

140
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,510
The first round is attack and defense.

141
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,640
Everyone can take turns for it.

142
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,350
The defender who can hold out can pass.

143
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
Speaking of the rule,

144
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,270
Later they go, more advantage they take?

145
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,950
Exactly!

146
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,110
I'm worried about your health.

147
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,320
It doesn't matter.

148
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,920
The trial indeed gives an advantage

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,760
to those who come later.

150
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,200
But they're also in peril.

151
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,790
Guys, look!

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,160
You'd pick any of the weapons you like.

153
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,030
But only one time for each of them.

154
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,150
If someone wants to conserve energy,

155
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,790
no good ones for those who come later.

156
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,140
Dai Yu,

157
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,550
