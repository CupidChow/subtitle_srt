00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,420
(Dai Mansion)

3
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,270
Liu!

4
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,360
Liu!

5
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,470
Liu!

6
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,590
Liu!

7
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:50,790
Liu!

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,110
Get out of here, now!

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,630
He's in peril.

10
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,750
He also said that

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,000
he figured out how to take you away.

12
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,520
Without my permission,

13
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,130
you're not allowed to leave me alone.

14
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,000
Liu!

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,070
- Madam!
- Liu!

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,600
- Miss!
- Liu!

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,310
- Don't scare me!
- Miss!

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,520
- Stop pretending!
- Madam!

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,460
- It's dangerous.
- Liu!

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,320
I'd take you back first.

21
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,440
- Liu, wake up!
- Madam!

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,240
- Liu!
- Madam!

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,640
Liu!

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,710
Miss!

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,640
Open the door!

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
Miss!

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,080
You can't keep me outside!

28
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,160
What are you going to do alone inside?

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,800
Miss, open the door!

30
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,360
Please, Miss!

31
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,800
Open it, Miss!

32
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,800
Miss, where are you going?

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,910
Miss!

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,040
Don't stand in my way!

35
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,010
Don't stop me!

36
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,870
- This damned place!
- Miss!

37
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,230
- I can't stay here!
- Calm down!

38
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,070
- Where'll you go?
- Miss!

39
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,910
- Don't stop me!
- Miss!

40
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,770
Miss!

41
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,710
What happened?

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,080
Dammit! You're this kind of person!

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,030
Why did you kill my friend?

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,200
What do you mean?

45
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,280
Don't play coy!

46
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,600
I saw it myself.

47
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,510
Madam.

48
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,430
What you said confused me.

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,280
- Don't come over.
- General.

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,640
You stop!

51
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,590
Dai Yu.

52
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,600
From now on,

53
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,000
we two are like strangers,

54
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,270
going our separate ways.

55
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,470
Step aside!

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,390
You calm down!

57
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,280
Get out of my way!

58
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,230
Move aside!

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,720
Wan'er.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,160
Wan'er!

61
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,360
Have you ever known a girl,

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,550
named Mo Xiaoxiao?

63
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,720
Take me away.

64
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Now!

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,600
Did that person bully you?

66
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,830
I told you that he's not a good guy.

67
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,350
Come on, follow me.

68
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,720
He's not worth getting angry over.

69
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,080
I told you that

70
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,240
although he's a tall guy,

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,080
he's not a good man.

72
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,360
Be careful. Slowly.

73
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,030
Wan'er,

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
I found that

75
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,910
we truly are fated to meet here.

76
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,910
See, I just came to you.

77
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,520
And you just show up before me.

78
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,360
As the saying goes,

79
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,670
I'm fated to encounter a beauty.

80
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,720
Can you be a little quieter?

81
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,880
Wan'er.

82
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,920
I finally cleared the fog to

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,510
plan to find a new partner.

84
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,550
That's really good!

85
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,760
Do you charge by the minute?

86
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,040
Can you stop,

87
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,110
and zip your hole?

88
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,190
You came up with renting out the tongue!

89
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,480
Wan'er,

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
you're a business genius, for sure.

91
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,110
Think about it,

92
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,390
if we can team up,

93
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,950
we'll surely sweep across all nations!

94
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,280
But just relax,

95
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,880
I will never bully you as Dai Yu did.

96
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,640
I truly consider you a good friend!

97
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,160
But,

98
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
where are we going?

99
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,950
To your Eastern Zhao Kingdom.

100
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,600
Is that not okay?

101
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,630
Negative.

102
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,670
I still have some things to do.

103
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,510
I can't afford to leave.

104
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,650
What really gets you concerned

105
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,920
is Mo Xiaoxiao, right?

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,040
Did you know her, really?

107
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,110
Great!

108
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,140
I give you my word that we go there.

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,250
Could you do me a favor

110
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,480
to let me meet Mo Xiaoxiao?

111
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,920
What's this?

112
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,150
A sort of burnt wine.

113
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,390
Have a taste.

114
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,510
I'm the god of wine.

115
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,320
No wine can get me drunk!

116
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,110
Tasteless!

117
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,670
Impossible!

118
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,160
How could that be?

119
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,950
I always don't get along with Dai Yu.

120
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,790
But...

121
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,210
As far as I know,

122
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,950
He's been in battles for decades.

123
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,390
He never killed an innocent person.

124
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,720
What you see yourself

125
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,830
is not true, to some extent.

126
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,070
Just like

127
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,510
me,

128
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm charming and suave

129
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,270
with brains.

130
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,090
But I'm a one-woman man.

131
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,190
Do you know that?

132
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,480
And I have to warn you that

133
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,230
you can't fall in love with me.

134
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,350
I already have someone in my heart.

135
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you insane?

136
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,920
I have to make it clear.

137
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,210
I only see you as a sibling.

138
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,790
Sister.

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,790
Everything is possible in this world.

140
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,320
I just see it as a dream.

141
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,640
Nothing to care about for me.

142
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,040
All I want is to be happy.

143
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,230
That really matters.

144
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,440
Lu Chen,

145
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,640
come on!

146
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,920
Master!

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,320
Master, I...

148
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,640
It's you. You came just in time.

149
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,740
Just take good care of him.

150
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,160
Master.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
No need for that.

152
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,040
No wine can get me drunk!

153
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,210
I'd take a piss.

154
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,160
What the hell is this thing?

155
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,230
I really can't stand it!

156
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,630
Here's ok.

157
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,910
This place...

158
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,760
