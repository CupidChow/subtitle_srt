1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Anyway, if you watch the whole thing like this, that really captures the moment

2
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,380
Look at her.

3
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,380
I'm sorry.

4
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,380
You were able to run at first,

5
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,380
but now you can't.

6
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,380
Your voice and face

7
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,380
are all covered in smoke.

8
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,380
I will continue to play

9
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,380
the editing and editing clips for her.

10
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,380
I will continue to work on the electronics

11
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,380
and other sound effects.

12
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,380
It is her who has strengthened this impression.

13
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,380
Did she pretend?

14
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,380
There are various records

15
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,380
that show that.

16
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,380
Your heart rate and blood pressure

17
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,380
are all in it.

18
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,380
She can't pretend.

19
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,380
You all came in.

20
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,380
We came in.

21
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
Is the door here?

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
Let's find it.

23
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,380
Let's find it.

24
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,380
My baby.

25
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,380
Our baby with no flowers.

26
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
These are all ancient things.

27
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,380
Don't...

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,380
You are still a child.

29
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,380
Why are you still hitting me?

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,380
Don't break it.

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,380
Please put it down.

32
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,380
Please put it down.

33
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,380
Don't touch it.

34
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,380
I'm not talking about you.

35
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,380
I'm talking about the things.

36
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,380
Don't break it.

37
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,380
I know.

38
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,380
Be careful.

39
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,380
Be careful.

40
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,380
Be gentle.

41
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Be gentle.

42
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:13,040
It says, Vicious Master has taken new swords from...

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,100
Feng Zilin!

44
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,420
Feng Zilin!

45
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,040
Feng Zilin!

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,800
He could hide it under Feng Zilin's drum.

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,880
And organized arrangements for fifth Recruitment.

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,540
And Easter to protect from по Ether crash.

49
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,060
That is quite scientific,

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,880
good with the new sword.

51
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
I have entire experience

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,480
that someone will steal it from me.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,440
After the battle with Xin Jian,

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,040
five disciples were unconscious for days.

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
They were afraid that they would die.

56
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,040
They were afraid that they would die.

57
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Seven days later, they were fine again?

58
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,640
They couldn't live for seven days and they were fine again?

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,240
What does that mean?

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,960
Did they get hurt while they were recovering?

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,040
No.

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,600
Mr. Da De said that they were fine.

63
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,760
It seems that Mr. Da De doesn't know

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,080
what's going on.

65
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
How dare you!

66
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
I think I wrote a solution here.

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Come and have a look.

68
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Look.

69
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,440
Da De Ji Er Fen Zhi.

70
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
Ji Er Fen Zhi means to break up.

71
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,920
Okay.

72
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Then, Si Qi Mei Xin Yi Xie Dian Ran.

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Chi Mu Yi Di Yin Zhi Yu Mu.

74
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,320
It means to use the Bu Xiu Zhi Mu to burn the blood to make the blood.

75
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Is it that simple?

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
I have it too.

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
It was more than 800 years ago.

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
I don't understand.

79
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,560
It seems that it means to put the Bu Xiu Zhi Mu

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
into the water of Xin Jian

81
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
and then drop the blood.

82
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,560
He was afraid of the blood and ran into the Bu Xiu Zhi Mu himself.

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
I understand it like that.

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
That's right.

85
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,560
That's what it means.

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
The method is different, but the principle is the same.

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
If you put the Bu Xiu Zhi Mu in a container

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
and put Xin Jian in it,

89
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
then lock it with Phoenix's soft-lock.

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
And I have this.

91
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
I mentioned a thing called growing up.

92
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,700
This is a

93
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
look.

94
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,700
Recently, the state of Xin Jian's recovery is uncertain.

95
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Every time it grows, it is called the pre-repeated pre-expansion.

96
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,700
The Xin Jian we saw in the painting just now

97
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
is about the same as now.

98
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:33,840
Every time it grows, it is called the pre-expansion.

99
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
The informant reported that

100
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
other people, including Qing Mu,

101
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
stayed at the bar

102
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,840
and went to the Wuzhen with Zheng Ming Shan.

103
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,840
They entered the mountain yesterday, but Zheng Ming Shan did not.

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
They were at the entrance of the mountain.

105
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,840
So we were unable to enter.

106
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
Even if we went in that place,

107
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
the people there were not like them.

108
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
The business there was not good.

109
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
But it's okay.

110
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,980
They will come out and tell me.

111
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
Fengzi Ridge is the place where Xin Jian was last sealed.

112
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
It should be the place where the Bu Xiu Zhi Mu and Phoenix's soft-lock finally appeared.

113
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,980
Senior, Mr. Shen wants to stay a few more days

114
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
to study the information in the gallery.

115
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
Please take care of it.

116
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,120
We will go to Fengzi Ridge.

117
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
We will act separately.

118
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Fengzi Ridge is so big.

119
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
They came in without a word.

120
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
They did not return.

121
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
They did not leave a hiding place.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
How can we find it?

123
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
It's no use staying here.

124
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
Think about it.

125
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Xin Jian has been released.

126
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
It means that this hiding place has been moved.

127
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Although we came this time to find the Phoenix's soft-lock,

128
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
the main purpose is to let the reports believe

129
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
that we have found the Phoenix's soft-lock.

130
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
So this means that we have to act.

131
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
So this is it.

132
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Guests!

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
The tourists in front of us...

134
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
Wait!

135
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Guests!

136
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Let's have a tour.

137
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Tour!

138
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
My surname is Ding.

139
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Just call me Ding Lao Jiu.

140
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,120
I have been a tour guide for over 30 years here.

141
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
You still need a tour guide for this?

142
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Beauty, you do not know that.

143
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,260
Our place has a lot of tourist resources.

144
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,260
It's not developed yet.

145
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,260
The county has a plan.

146
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,260
It will be started soon.

147
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,260
The people in the tourism bureau have consulted me.

148
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
Our family has lived here for a long time.

149
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
What?

150
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,260
Legend?

151
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
Dating?

152
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,260
I'm not not good at it.

153
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,260
You choose me.

154
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,260
That's right.

155
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,260
One person is twenty.

156
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
You can go in or out.

157
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,260
It's not expensive, right?

158
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Let's go.

159
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
Come on, wife.

160
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,260
Water.

161
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
Okay.

162
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Follow me.

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
It's a mess.

164
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
You are more messy than anyone.

165
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
One million?

166
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Luan Ren Chu has one million.

167
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,400
He has asked for the Phoenix Ring in the first generation of Xia Gu Guan.

168
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
The news has spread.

169
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
This is the image he released.

170
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
It is said that he was afraid that people would fake it.

171
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
He only gave the outer image.

172
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
The inner image is not good.

173
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,400
This is the nightmare of the new king of the past generation.

174
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
Phoenix Ring?

175
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
After they left Mount Yewu,

176
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,540
they went to Xia Gu Guan, a place called Phoenix Ridge.

177
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,540
We asked around.

178
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,540
The mountain red explosion a few decades ago

179
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,540
did cause a lot of trouble.

180
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,540
Many ancient merchants have been there.

181
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
Is this Phoenix Ring?

182
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,540
I don't know.

183
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
I've never seen Phoenix Ring.

184
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
You've also stayed in Mount Yewu.

185
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,540
Where have you been?

186
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
There is a cave.

187
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
I can't go in without the key.

188
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Master said he would wait for the person he trusts.

189
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,540
Let that woman keep an eye on me.

190
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Luan Ren, she is very rude.

191
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Don't let her do anything behind her back.

192
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,540
Luan Ren.

193
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
I've grown up.

194
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,540
I understand what growing up is.

195
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,540
I understand what growing up is.

196
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Let's go.

197
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,540
I understand what growing up means.

198
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,540
I understand what growing up means.

199
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,540
Young Master,

200
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,540
I finally understand what growing up means.

201
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,540
Growing up?

202
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
What does that mean?

203
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
There are three records of the restoration of the new building in the court.

204
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,540
It was during the Bo Yang Zi period,

205
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
more than 800 years ago,

206
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,540
and the Meihua Yi Zhao period.

207
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
The specific locations discovered by the gods

208
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
are connected to the ancient flag shape.

209
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
And the area of the cross-country area is also getting larger.

210
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,540
That means the seven-star solid will always form

211
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
a certain shape.

212
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
So they adjust the corresponding locations

213
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
to form a fixed shape

214
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
and then the seven-star solid will return?

215
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I also looked it up online.

216
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
The seven-star solid is called the Yirita constellation

217
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,680
in the outside world.

218
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Every 280 years,

219
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
we will expose it in close range

220
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
within the range of the Yirita constellation.

221
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
We are now in the peak of this exposure.

222
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
And we are about to reach the highest point of the resurrection.

223
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
280 years?

224
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,820
The Meihua Yi Zhao period

225
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
is now about 200 or 300 years old.

226
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Isn't it 280 years?

227
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Then are they also in the exposure period?

228
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Not only that.

229
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
The three times of the restoration of the new building

230
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
are within the exposure period.

231
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
What about the close-range radiation?

232
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
I guess the close-range high-energy radiation

233
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,820
can charge the new building.

234
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
You mean the new building is receiving the energy of the mother star?

235
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,820
It's very likely.

236
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
It's very likely.

237
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
It's very likely.

238
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Maybe this is what we call

239
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
growing up.

240
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
If you keep growing up,

241
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
how scary will it be?

242
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
In short, it's important to find the Phoenix Wraith.

243
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,960
It's the building spirit

244
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,960
that is the center of everything.

245
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
Look!

246
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Old furniture.

247
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Boss, we have an appointment.

248
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
I've never seen this before.

249
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Don't move, boss.

250
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Look again.

251
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
This is our top-of-the-line meeting.

252
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Boss, help me get the interest.

253
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
The price is reasonable.

254
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
What should I do?

255
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
You've got the Phoenix Wraith.

256
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Congratulations.

257
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Look, you're not the only one who can't help.

258
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
When you get it,

259
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
I'll treat you to a good meal.

260
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Fill in this chicken.

263
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
I'm going to give it as a gift for my friend.

264
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
Okay?

265
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Okay.

266
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,240
Senior is already in Black Sand.

269
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Please go there today.

270
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,240
I have to leave as soon as possible.

271
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Help me get the interest.

272
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,240
Let's buy the tickets together.

273
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Speaking of relatives, I've lost my family.

274
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,380
Can I leave without my master?

275
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,380
In terms of experience,

276
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,380
it's longer to get the Wraith than you.

277
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,380
Hong Shan, Lu Yu can't refute it.

278
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,380
I and the Wraith have slept in the same bed.

279
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,380
If it's not longer than you,

280
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
I have to go.

281
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Black Sand is dangerous.

282
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
If it's dangerous,

283
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,380
it's more dangerous than being buried alive.

284
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
Let's go back quickly.

285
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,380
Yes, we know it's dangerous.

286
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,380
But for the Wraith, we have to go.

287
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,380
No.

288
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,520
The key is that

289
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Black Sand needs an ancient pass.

290
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
You guys are too late.

291
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
It's complicated.

292
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Stop it, bro.

293
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,660
I'm really lost.

294
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,660
I'm really lost.

295
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
Miss, he confessed.

296
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:44,220
His grandfather bought three Phoenix

297
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,220
cards.

298
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
This is very important.

299
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,220
You must deliver it safely.

300
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,220
Okay, don't worry.

301
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
Miss, Qingmu has arrived at Black Sand.

302
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
He lives in a small hotel in the city.

303
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
He's carrying a big bag with him.

304
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
Nice.

305
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Okay.

306
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Good.

307
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,220
Kill him on the road.

308
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
Then bring the stuff back.

309
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
Okay.

310
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
I'll go.

311
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,220
Okay.

312
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Okay.

313
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Okay.

314
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Okay.

315
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Okay.

316
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Okay.

317
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Okay.

318
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Okay.

319
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Okay.

320
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Okay.

321
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Okay.

322
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Okay.

323
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,920
Okay.

324
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Okay.

325
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Okay.

326
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Okay.

327
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,620
Qingmu has left the hotel.

328
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Get in the car.

329
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,620
How do you drive?

330
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,620
What's going on?

331
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,620
Go.

332
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,620
Go.

333
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Go.

334
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
Go.

335
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,620
Hey.

336
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,620
Look at the lights.

337
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,620
I've seen a lot of records here.

338
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
It's very messy. Be careful.

339
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Hide.

340
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,920
Balloon.

341
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,920
Balloon.

342
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Come in.

343
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Okay.

344
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Come on.

345
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Let's go.

346
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
What're you waiting for?

347
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
This place wants us to stay.

348
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
I will go by car.

349
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,600
I've seen everything.

350
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
There is no recording equipment.

351
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Why are you so serious?

352
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
I heard you did well.

353
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,780
That's the way things are

354
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,720
I've been only meowing

355
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,220
if I've acted carelessly

356
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,320
can I even persuade the audiences?

357
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,080
Let's eat

358
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,540
alanІ

359
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,600
What do you think I am?

360
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,560
Fake

361
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,560
It's fake.

362
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Is this a trick to trick me?

363
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,560
What Luo Ren is carrying is real.

364
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:01,560
He knows that if I take away his stuff, he won't have a horse.

365
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
Okay, you go first.

366
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Guys, come.

367
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Interesting.

368
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,560
He's dead.

369
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
He's still talking.

370
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
It doesn't feel like him.

371
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
What?

372
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Damn.

373
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
I have to take care of my wounds.

374
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Wasting time.

375
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
If I fight, I will lose a lot of time.

376
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Do you think so?

377
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,560
That's not fun.

378
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Welcome to the Black Shark Island.

379
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
I just got here.

380
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,560
I received your greetings.

381
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
I can't wait.

382
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,560
I will come to the top of the world alone.

383
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,560
See you then.

384
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Don't tell me you have a date with me tomorrow.

385
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,560
I'm going to meet Jiao Yan.

386
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm going to meet Jiao Yan.

387
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I'm going to meet Jiao Yan.

388
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,560
I'm going to meet Jiao Yan.

389
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm going to meet Jiao Yan.

390
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Jiao Yan?

391
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
I'm going to meet Jiao Yan.

392
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
Okay.

393
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
I'll go with him.

394
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
I'll buy him a horse when I'm young.

395
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560
I'll buy him a horse when I'm young.

396
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
I'll buy him a horse when I'm young.

397
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
I'll buy him a horse when I'm young.

398
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Guys, don't be so stubborn.

399
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Let's go.

400
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Let's go.

401
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
What are you doing?

402
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Guys,

403
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
the moment I think of tomorrow,

404
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
the moment I think of tomorrow,

405
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
I feel so happy.

406
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
I feel so happy.

407
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,560
This wine

408
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
is quite strong.

409
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
I don't need to...

410
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
You're right.

411
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,560
With this little wine,

412
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
how could I have locked you up?

413
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
People are always

414
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
hungry for money.

415
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
If you're hurt,

416
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
you have to eat more.

417
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Look at you.

418
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
This kind of

419
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
strong, stimulating,

420
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
mental medicine, don't eat it.

421
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
It's bad for your health.

422
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,560
This is the last time.

423
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Later,

424
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
we'll drink it in the camp.

425
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
I'll find a chance to know the chaos.

426
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
You can take the chance

427
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
to save Mu Dai.

428
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Don't worry about me.

429
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
You're quite interesting.

430
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,560
You've put your brothers down.

431
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
You've put your brothers down.

432
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
You've put your brothers down.

433
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,560
You can trust me.

434
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
You've seen it.

435
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
I know.

436
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
He was going to risk his life.

437
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
I don't want to risk it.

438
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Besides,

439
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
you're not an outsider.

440
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Your little sister,

441
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
your master,

442
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
I can't get you out of it.

443
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
If you leave like this,

444
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
what about them?

445
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I don't know.

446
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
I've been born and raised with them.

447
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
They're all good people.

448
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
They're my good friends

449
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
from heaven.

450
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
But this time,

451
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
it's different.

452
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
The report is my name.

453
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
They've never even seen a gun.

454
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
You know that.

455
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
I'm leaving.

456
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,560
Who is it?

457
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Stop sleeping. Come out.

458
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
What's wrong?

459
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
What's wrong?

460
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Master.

461
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Something happened.

462
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Tell me what you think.

463
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
What do you think?

464
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Luo Ren and Lie Bao are very close.

465
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
But my master is on the account.

466
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
He wants me to be his master.

467
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
He wants to get away from me.

468
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
I don't think it makes sense.

469
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Senior,

470
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
we took Luo Ren's zither.

471
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
We know it's dangerous.

472
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
But...

473
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
We can't just sit here

474
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
and wait for him.

475
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm not afraid of your jokes.

476
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Even if we go, we won't do anything.

477
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Standing by,

478
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
even if it's a trick,

479
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
it'll help.

480
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
I've finished what you two said.

481
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
I'll say one thing.

482
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Although I'm a little scared,

483
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
I came all the way here.

484
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
I'm not afraid of jokes.

485
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Pack up.

486
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
Let's go.

487
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Let's go.

488
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Let's go.

489
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Watch out!

490
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
Let me.

491
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
What should we do?

492
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
Should we take him?

493
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
We're not the master and the disciple.

494
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
No matter where and when,

495
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
it's the same method

496
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
for everyone.

497
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Such a big dose of medicine.

498
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,560
You're making me dizzy.

499
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
Put it on.

500
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Is it safe?

501
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Can you be more energetic?

502
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
I'm fine.

503
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Let's go.

504
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
Where's the bandage?

505
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,560
You never had a good fight, right?

506
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
You want to fight with me?

507
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,560
But I can't imagine how you fight with me.

508
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
Your girlfriend is in my hands.

509
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
There are 20 strong guards here.

510
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
And you're the only one.

511
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
You know I have a letter on me.

512
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
I really look forward to your jokes.

513
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm not afraid of jokes.

514
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Where's the bandage?

515
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Where's the thing?

516
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
I'm sorry.

517
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
I'm telling you.

518
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
If you don't learn something,

519
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
I'll kill you.

520
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
I'm sorry.

521
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
I'm sorry.

522
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Is she real?

523
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Have you seen her?

524
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
The cold and cold

525
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
has a strong will to control the cold.

526
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
If she's real,

527
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
I'll feel very uncomfortable

528
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
if I get a little closer.

529
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Chen Yang.

530
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
This is real.

531
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,560
She's controlling you.

532
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
It's just a dream.

533
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
You're so calm.

534
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:31,560
You're so

535
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
You dare to kill me!

536
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
This is real phoenix's cage.

537
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,560
I brought it here

538
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Where's the bandage?

539
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
It's easy for me to kill them.

540
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
I can't kill you.

541
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,560
You can try.

542
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Look.

543
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
I'm going to kill you.

544
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
I'll give you a little surprise.

545
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
I'll give you a surprise.

546
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,560
I'll give you a surprise.

547
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,560
Our game is over.

548
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
Promise me.

549
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
If no one is after you,

550
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
you can survive and die.

551
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,560
I'll give you a little girlfriend.

552
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,560
Hey.

553
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
Give it to me.

554
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
You stay here and watch the car.

555
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
You can use it anytime.

556
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
You can leave the car.

557
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Don't go.

558
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
This is the back door.

559
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
But they'll come in and out at any time.

560
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Be careful.

561
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Hey.

562
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Let's go.

563
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Ha ha.

564
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
You're laughing at him.

565
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,560
You're laughing at him.

566
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Ha ha.

567
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Hey.

568
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Ha ha.

569
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,560
Ha ha.

570
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Ha ha.

571
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Ha ha.

572
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Hey.

573
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Hey.

574
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Ha ha.

575
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,560
What's he doing?

576
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,560
What's he doing?

577
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
What's he doing?

578
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
What's he doing?

579
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,560
What's he doing?

580
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,560
What's he doing?

581
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,560
What's he doing?

582
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
What's he doing?

583
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
What's he doing?

584
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,560
What's he doing?

585
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
What's he doing?

586
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,560
What's he doing?

587
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,560
What's he doing?

588
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,560
What's he doing?

589
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
What's he doing?

590
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,560
What's he doing?

591
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,560
What's he doing?

592
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
What's he doing?

593
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
What's he doing?

594
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,560
What's he doing?

595
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Hey.

596
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,560
Are you scared to death?

597
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
Yes.

598
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
I'm not scared.

599
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
It's okay.

600
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,560
I've tied my hair up.

601
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
You can climb up the rope later.

602
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
You can use the rope to go there.

603
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
It's not that scary.

604
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Your main task is to attract their attention.

605
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,560
Only when I'm with Xiao Cao can I have a chance to attack you.

606
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Hurry up.

607
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
Yes.

608
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Take him down.

609
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
My heart.

610
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Go.

611
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Go.

612
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
Mu Te.

613
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,560
Mu Te.

614
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Kill him.

615
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,560
Mu Te.

616
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Hurry up.

617
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Go.

618
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Mu Te.

619
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Mu Te.

620
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,560
Mu Te.

621
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Mu Te.

622
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Mu Te.

623
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Mu Te.
