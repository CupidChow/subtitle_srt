Where is my friend?

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
Call your medical ompress

00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,580
what's that

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,200
he has a leg injury

22
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,740
I was like a big radish.

23
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,740
I was sent to the hospital.

24
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
The doctor said

25
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,740
I had to get a treatment.

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,740
I had no choice.

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,740
I could only look at you.

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,740
You were in the toilet and you were like a rabbit.

29
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,740
I was like a water flower.

30
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,740
I was like a sun.

31
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,740
I was like a pig.

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,740
I was like a clean water.

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
You're awake.

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
Are you okay?

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,740
I'm going to get a treatment.

36
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,740
What treatment?

37
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,740
He was just injured.

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,740
He was sent to the hospital.

39
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,740
Go away.

40
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,740
I'll treat you.

41
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,740
What's in the toilet?

42
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,740
I'll tell you the details.

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,740
I'm telling you.

44
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,740
That thing is like a piece of shit.

45
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,740
I was like a piece of shit.

46
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
I was like a family.

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,740
I touched his neck.

48
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,740
It was like a stick.

49
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,740
But he wasn't a stick.

50
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,740
Because it was in the water.

51
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,740
It wouldn't be in the mud.

52
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,740
And it couldn't be that big.

53
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,740
It's really weird.

54
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,740
That stick is very common.

55
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,740
How did you get rid of him?

56
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,740
I got 13000.

57
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
This thing.

58
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
You really have to apologize to me.

59
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,740
At that time, the situation was very urgent.

60
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,740
I was so scared.

61
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,740
What about me?

62
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,740
I was in a lake.

63
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,740
I was looking for the stick.

64
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
I found it.

65
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,740
I was so scared.

66
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,740
I was so scared.

67
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,740
I was so scared.

68
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,740
I was so scared.

69
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,740
I was so scared.

70
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,740
I want to see the red sand.

71
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
You said it to me.

72
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,740
When I found out that you were in the boat,

73
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,740
there were so many things inside.

74
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,740
I didn't know why someone lived here.

75
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,740
When I found out that you were in the boat,

76
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
I understood that you were in the boat.

77
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
The lake is so dry.

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,740
There are only lakes and lakes in this generation.

79
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,740
You have to check every day.

80
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,740
So it's most convenient to live here.

81
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,740
Did you find him?

82
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,740
I'm not sure.

83
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,740
But when we came from the village,

84
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,740
we saw someone.

85
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,740
Maybe it was his uncle.

86
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,740
That teacher?

87
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,740
He went to the temple.

88
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,740
But he didn't find anything.

89
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
He still needs to find clues.

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
Have some.

91
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,740
I'll go back.

92
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
I'll go back.

93
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,740
You two are so funny.

94
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,740
What are you laughing at?

95
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,740
Oh, right.

96
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,740
This is a water tap.

97
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
It's strong.

98
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,740
You can blow it when you are in danger.

99
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,740
Go on.

100
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
I'm in danger.

101
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,740
You go to rest.

102
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,740
I'll go to work.

103
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,740
Reflective

104
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,740
What is it?

105
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,740
What is your bargain gas happening here?

106
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Wait.

107
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,740
I'll try to record this.

108
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,740
Slow down.

109
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,740
Quickly.

110
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,540
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,140
My sister's little master is here too.

112
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,540
He's not going to...

113
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,140
He's not going to Hua City to interview her?

114
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,940
Brother Luo.

115
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,740
You're giving me a lesson.

116
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,740
Did you purposely not bring me here?

117
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,540
No, it's a premonition.

118
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,140
What premonition?

119
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,340
Your three brothers are in the third brother's hometown.

120
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,340
There are four of them.

121
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,940
And a daughter.

122
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,140
Brother Luo, you didn't even bring me a new one.

123
00:06:59,340 --> 00:06:59,940
Okay.

124
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,940
Just remember to help me transfer.

125
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,140
Oh, right.

126
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,740
I'm fine with Uncle Zhang's wooden belt.

127
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,140
No, I'm hanging up.

128
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
What are you looking for

129
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,940
when we're here?

130
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,540
The wooden belt is here too.

131
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,540
Is it just a coincidence?

132
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,940
I'm missing you.

133
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,340
They said you saved your sister's teeth.

134
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,540
I'm going to find you a pervert on my way.

135
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,540
You don't remember.

136
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,540
How about this?

137
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,940
I'll go back and ask my father to pay you back.

138
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,540
Okay.

139
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,540
I'll go back and ask him to pay you back.

140
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,540
Okay.

141
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,540
Okay.

142
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,540
Okay.

143
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,540
Okay.

144
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,540
Okay.

145
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,540
Okay.

146
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,540
Okay.

147
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,140
Okay.

148
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,140
Luo Ran made you a wheelchair.

149
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,140
You can go out later.

150
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:41,740
Okay.

151
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,340
What's the deal?

152
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,940
That Luo Ran...

153
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,340
Is he your boyfriend?

154
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,540
No.

155
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,540
That's great.

156
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,540
I'm relieved.

157
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,140
I think...

158
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,140
I've fallen in love with him.

159
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,140
He's so handsome,

160
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,340
tall,

161
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
and he saved me.

162
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,140
And he's even got a crush on me.

163
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,140
He's like my little brother.

164
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,140
He's like my little brother.

165
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,140
I feel so bad for him.

166
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm so sorry.

167
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm so sorry.

168
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,140
I'm so sorry.

169
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,540
You're always dancing.

170
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,140
You're always dancing.

171
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,940
You don't believe me, do you?

172
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,740
I'm kidding.

173
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,940
I'm so good at acting.

174
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,140
And after I talked to him for two days,

175
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
I found out that

176
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,140
he and your relationship

177
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
must be very long.

178
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,140
But I haven't practiced it yet.

179
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,540
I'm so lost.

180
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,340
I still feel so bad.

181
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,540
I'm so sorry.

182
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,140
You have to make me feel better.

183
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,140
I'll pay you later.

184
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,340
Two empty dishes.

185
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,140
Mr. Cao,

186
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,940
you can't be so heartless.

187
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,740
People are so slowly being transformed.

188
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,140
They've formed a group.

189
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,740
They're going to open

190
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,540
a new adventure.

191
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,740
But they won't take you.

192
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,340
They'll only make you fall in love.

193
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,740
You can take Uncle Zhang's work.

194
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,340
Don't forget.

195
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,740
There's a woman.

196
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,940
Who's the trustee?

197
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,540
Yes.

198
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
I'll be replaced by the new one.

199
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,140
I'll be in the position of the team.

200
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,740
I'll be there.

201
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Why?

202
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,340
I've never seen anyone like you.

203
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,140
I can't stand it.

204
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Or I'll be in trouble.

205
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,540
No.

206
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,740
I don't want to come.

207
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
We...

208
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,340
will go together.

209
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
Don't say that.

210
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,940
Don't say that.

211
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,340
Look at the boat.

212
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,340
It's broken.

213
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
But it looks good.

214
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,140
It's really the one with the side of the side.

215
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,340
Can you do it?

216
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,140
Be careful.

217
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,740
No.

218
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,340
You...

219
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,340
No.

220
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,140
How can we eat here?

221
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,340
Wait.

222
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
I want to go there.

223
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
You can go there with me.

224
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,940
There's someone behind you.

225
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,540
He's here.

226
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,340
He's here.

227
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,540
Over there.

228
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,940
What's going on?

229
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,740
Uncle Zhang.

230
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,740
What's going on?

231
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,340
My friend gave me some equipment.

232
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,340
The grasshopper has turned here.

233
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,740
What equipment?

234
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,340
The drone.

235
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,540
The soil detection device.

236
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
The exploration is too big.

237
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
It's still better to check it in advance.

238
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
It's really...

239
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,740
a dangerous device.

240
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,740
If it's really dangerous,

241
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,540
do you think it'll let the drone in?

242
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,140
Okay.

243
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,740
Mu Dai.

244
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,540
I'll go and collect some equipment.

245
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,540
I'll go with you.

246
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,140
No need.

247
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,140
We're going to work.

248
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,740
It's so hot.

249
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,940
Let's go.

250
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,740
Grandpa.

251
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,940
We just arrived.

252
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,940
We just arrived.

253
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,940
It's really safe.

254
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,340
We have everything.

255
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,140
We have food, drinks, and instant noodles.

256
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,140
We're cooking here.

257
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,540
Yes.

258
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,940
Did you hear something?

259
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,740
Really.

260
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,140
The person Mu Dai saw in the village

261
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
was him.

262
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
He must be there.

263
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,140
We found him right away.

264
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,140
His daily necessities are all on the boat.

265
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,540
Anyway, it's only been a few days.

266
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,540
We'll find him.

267
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,540
Don't worry.

268
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,740
I got it.

269
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,740
Luo Ren, he doesn't suit you.

270
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,740
I saw that we've been together for a long time.

271
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
It's a good reminder.

272
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,340
Don't think I'm not good at speaking.

273
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,940
Yes.

274
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
He's a good person.

275
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,740
But I knew from the first look at him,

276
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,740
his background must be very complicated.

277
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,340
On the way to Wuzhu Village,

278
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,940
I heard him calling.

279
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,140
How is the situation in Black Mountain?

280
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,540
I haven't got any news yet.

281
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,140
What are you doing?

282
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,540
I think you're good at kung fu.

283
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,540
You're good at acting.

284
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,340
The foreign workers used to work in the front.

285
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,540
What's the place in Black Mountain?

286
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
The news is spread all over the country.

287
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,140
The war zone.

288
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,740
Who's there to mix up?

289
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,740
I heard him say he's wearing a suit.

290
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,540
I think he's wearing a suit.

291
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,340
It's not a simple thing.

292
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,940
You're so scared.

293
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,140
You're not scared?

294
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,140
I'm not scared.

295
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,940
Boss Xia, don't make me talk too much.

296
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,540
I'm just a drinker.

297
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,140
You're the future boss of our bar.

298
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,140
We're not the same person.

299
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,740
I can tell he likes you.

300
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,540
That's because you hate people.

301
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,140
Do you know why?

302
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,740
Your relationship can only be liked.

303
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,340
Can't you push it forward?

304
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,940
Let me tell you why.

305
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,740
He knows it's not right for him to be with you.

306
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,540
I hate you.

307
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,740
I hate you.

308
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,140
You can have a rest.

309
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,740
I'll go to work.

310
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,340
Boss.

311
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,140
What do you mean?

312
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,740
They're in love.

313
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,140
What's your problem?

314
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,340
When will you be able to make a joke?

315
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,740
Why don't you tell me?

316
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,940
Don't think you can't afford to have two enemies.

317
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,540
If I find a wife, I'll make you rich.

318
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,140
You're my wife.

319
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
Look at the color of your clothes.

320
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,140
It's green.

321
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,740
I'll pack you up.

322
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
Be careful.

323
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,140
I'll pull you.

324
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:57,740
I'll change this.

325
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,740
It's true.

326
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,140
I'll be the one to be the boss.

327
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,540
But I'll be the one to be the boss.

328
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,740
Wait.

329
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,540
I'll break your leg.

330
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,140
It hurts.

331
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,340
It hurts.

332
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
It hurts.

333
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
It hurts.

334
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,340
You hit me so hard.

335
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:16,540
I'll...

336
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,340
What?

337
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,740
I didn't eat.

338
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,940
I ate all the noodles.

339
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,940
Wait for me.

340
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,140
Is it 13,000 yuan?

341
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,140
Is it 13,000 yuan?

342
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,140
Yes.

343
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
I'll cut you into two.

344
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:26,940
6,500 yuan.

345
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,340
Do you believe me?

346
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,140
You do it.

347
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,140
You must protect him.

348
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,140
I'll tell you.

349
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,140
He's a naughty boy.

350
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
He's a stubborn man.

351
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,340
He's a kind man.

352
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,940
He's scolding others behind his back.

353
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,540
What do you mean?

354
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,140
I think he likes you.

355
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
He likes Luo Ren.

356
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:41,940
Right?

357
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,340
You like Luo Ren.

358
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
Who likes Luo Ren?

359
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,340
I don't like Luo Ren.

360
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:45,940
You.

361
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,540
Say it again.

362
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,340
You.

363
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
So stupid.

364
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
You're so stupid.

365
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,340
Mu Da.

366
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,140
I'll go to the village with 13,000 yuan.

367
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
You stay here with Hong Shang.

368
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,340
Call me if you need anything.

369
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,740
Mu Da.

370
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,140
Are you ready?

371
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,140
Here.

372
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,140
Well.

373
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Are you still thinking about 13,000 yuan?

374
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
I told you.

375
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,540
He can't listen to you.

376
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,540
He did it on purpose.

377
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,540
Actually, I think he's right.

378
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,540
I think Luo Ren is good to me.

379
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,540
He's a little over the average.

380
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,540
But sometimes he's a little cold.

381
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,540
It seems like we have distance.

382
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
I can feel that he's actually

383
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,740
quite concerned about our relationship.

384
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,140
Can you understand?

385
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
Then what does he think?

386
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,540
He's like this.

387
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,940
He makes people guess.

388
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,940
Is he tired?

389
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,940
I'm not tired.

390
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,940
No.

391
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,340
Mu Da.

392
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,540
We have to play football.

393
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,540
You have to ask him directly.

394
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,540
I'm just asking.

395
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,540
You're so stupid.

396
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
You have to ask him directly.

397
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm just asking.

398
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,340
Yes.

399
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,540
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,540
No, no, no.

401
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,540
You have to be sorry.

402
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,540
I...

403
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,740
You have to think like this.

404
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,540
I'll give you a metaphor.

405
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,540
It seems like you've been in a dense forest.

406
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,340
You've seen Luo Ren's little tree.

407
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,940
So you want to accompany him.

408
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,940
But you have to know his idea.

409
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,540
If he's willing,

410
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
you can accompany him.

411
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,140
He'll grow up to be a big tree.

412
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,540
If he's unwilling,

413
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,540
it's useless for you to accompany him.

414
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
He can't grow up.

415
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,740
And if you accompany him,

416
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,740
what will he do on other small trees?

417
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Are you happy?

418
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Besides,

419
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,540
we have to have conditions.

420
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,940
We have to look good.

421
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,340
He's not willing.

422
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,940
You have to choose a dense forest.

423
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,940
Why do you have to be alone?

424
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,740
Right?

425
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,340
You have to remember your heart.

426
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,940
Ask him directly.

427
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,540
I don't think you're better than him.

428
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,940
I can see it.

429
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,740
You're so careless.

430
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,340
You have a point.

431
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,740
Then...

432
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,340
I'll ask him.

433
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,940
Hurry up.

434
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,940
Don't compromise.

435
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,940
Ren,

436
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,940
did you say that guy was really a research expert?

437
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,540
Why don't we prepare a big box

438
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,940
and call him out?

439
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,340
I'm thinking

440
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,340
that Xinjian has a dream.

441
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,740
We've come here

442
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,940
with the intention of dreaming.

443
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Until now,

444
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,940
the mysterious man we met

445
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,740
and his father

446
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,140
are not good at it.

447
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,140
Do you think

448
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,340
they have something to do with Xinjian?

449
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,940
That's hard to say.

450
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,540
Do you think

451
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,740
there's another Xinjian?

452
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,140
Ren.

453
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,740
Let me sit on your chair.

454
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,140
Almost there.

455
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,340
Carlyle RD will not leave.

456
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,300
Come back

457
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,420
You are too easy

458
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,900
This is not a trap

459
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,720
Another existمل

460
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,240
Your knowledge.

461
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,700
Those outside

462
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
clearer

463
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,820
And your name

464
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,580
Dangerous

465
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,580
Someone put it on the side of the dining table.

466
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,580
But there is no such thing.

467
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
These things don't look like old village people.

468
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
It's Yan Jiu Xiao's.

469
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
He...he suddenly stood up.

470
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
Yan Jiu Xiao is a hunter.

471
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,580
His daily necessities are on the boat.

472
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
He is always waiting for him.

473
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
I am here.

474
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,580
Come.

475
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,580
Don't waste your time.

476
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
He is the one who set up the tent.

477
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
How do you know?

478
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
I looked at uncle's profile picture.

479
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
I saw his personal information.

480
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
I set up his birth date and social status.

481
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,580
I left it behind.

482
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
There should be a photo of the head of the phone.

483
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
I found it.

484
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
Did you see it?

485
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,580
Everyone in the industry knows.

486
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
There must be a pillar in the place where the pillar is.

487
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,580
Today, I just want to tell Jiu Xiao.

488
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,580
This place is full of treasures.

489
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
If this is the case,

490
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Jiu Xiao will never be punished for money.

491
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,580
Punish for money?

492
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,580
Isn't their house very rich?

493
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,580
I am curious.

494
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Do you see?

495
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,580
I have never seen such a big house.

496
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,580
I have been here for 70,000 days.

497
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
It is the first time I have seen it.

498
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,580
So big?

499
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,580
I think he is not a good son.

500
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,580
I have prepared everything.

501
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
I just want to guarantee you that

502
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,580
this guy has a pillar in his body.

503
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,580
He is still going down.

504
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,580
He can't let him run away.

505
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,580
What happened?

506
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,580
He is also a criminal.

507
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,580
This old man is convinced of him.

508
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,580
At first, he is quite normal.

509
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
He said he was going to go to jail.

510
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,580
He just wants to get sick.

511
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Jiu Xiao.

512
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,580
Run.

513
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
That man is so scary.

514
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,580
The old man.

515
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
The old man is still in the village.

516
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,580
Anyway, I just hope they can take my clothes back.

517
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,580
I haven't changed my clothes for days.

518
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
You wear mine.

519
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
I will get it for you.

520
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
Your pants are too long.

521
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,580
I will wear them...

522
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,580
What's wrong?

523
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
Something is coming to us.

524
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,580
What? Don't be scared.

525
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,580
Cai Baoling.

526
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,580
It's my uncle.

527
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,580
What Cai Baoling?

528
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
It's the first time you see me.

529
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,580
I have worn it.

530
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,580
Everyone in our family has it.

531
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,580
It's really my uncle.

532
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,580
Are you sure it's Cai Baoling?

533
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm sure.

534
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,580
I'm familiar with this sound.

535
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,580
Uncle.

536
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,580
Go.

537
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
It's weird.

538
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,580
Why did uncle come there to get the clothes back?

539
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,580
Why didn't he come to us directly?

540
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
He heard it.

541
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
He's gone.

542
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,580
Mother.

543
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
Who are you?

544
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,580
Is it Xinjian again?

545
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,580
I don't know.

546
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,580
But he was crazy just now.

547
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
What Xinjian?

548
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,580
Let go of me.

549
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
I don't have Xinjian.

550
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
Let go of me.

551
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Bad guy.

552
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,580
What are you doing?

553
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
Bad guy.

554
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,580
Bad guy.

555
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,580
You are all bad guys.

556
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,580
You think you should all die here?

557
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,580
Why did you disturb the Water God?

558
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
It's not good.

559
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
It will be good.

560
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,580
It will be good.

561
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
It will be good.

562
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,580
Old man.

563
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,580
Do you remember who I am?

564
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Do you remember?

565
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
I'm Jiang Zhao.

566
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
Jiang Zhao.

567
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
Jiang Zhao.

568
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
Jiang Zhao.

569
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,580
You are Jiang Zhao.

570
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,580
Help.

571
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,580
Help.

572
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,580
Help.

573
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Help.

574
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
Help.

575
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,580
Help.

576
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,580
Help.

577
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,580
Help.

578
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Help.

579
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,580
Help.

580
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,580
Don't kill me.

581
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,580
You are the Chief.

582
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
You are the chief.

583
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
Release the fire.

584
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Release the fire.

585
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
Quickly, release the fire.

586
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Release the fire.

587
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,580
Release the fire.

588
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
Release the fire.

589
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
Do you have the seal?

590
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,580
Yes, sir.

591
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,580
The seal?

592
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,580
Yes, sir.

593
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,580
One, three.

594
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,580
Let's go, sir.

595
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,580
Five, four, five, four, six, seven, eight.

596
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,580
Are you okay?

597
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
Yes, sir.

598
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,580
Yes, if you want to do something like this,

599
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,580
just treat me like this.

600
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,580
Why are you going to burn the firewood?

601
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
Water is also a sign of retribution.

602
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,580
We will never have a firewood stove in our village.

603
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,580
We will be destroyed.

604
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
We will be destroyed.

605
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Why are you burning the firewood?

606
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,580
Water is also a sign of retribution.

607
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,580
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you.

608
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,580
I'm giving him a gift.

609
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Water is also a sign of retribution.

610
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
I'm telling you, it's so hot.

611
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,580
This is the worst.

612
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
I'm burning the firewood.

613
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
It's so hot.

614
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
It's so hot.

615
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
I thought I was driving.

616
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,580
But we didn't see any cars this way.

617
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,580
The last time, Jiu Xiao accidentally fell down.

618
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,580
The old man who was so quiet came up again after he got down.

619
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
This is the last time.

620
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
He can't get in the house if he's holding the house.

621
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
We will get down and burn his house.

622
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,580
Let's go.

623
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,580
This is the last video.

624
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,580
But how long ago was this video?

625
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
I didn't see any cars.

626
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,580
First, he might have left the car.

627
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Then why is his car here?

628
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,580
So, the second possibility is that the car is still on the side of the lake.

629
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,580
You didn't see it because you left the lake

630
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,580
and went to the place you were looking for.

631
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,580
So these things should be on the car.

632
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,580
Could it be that the old man almost didn't have anyone

633
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
to take him away?

634
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,580
Where did my uncle go?

635
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,580
Mu Dai, do you remember the nightmare I had?

636
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,580
My uncle didn't go to the lake because he was scared.

637
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
Don't.

638
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,580
The doctor said he had a good idea.

639
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,580
Didn't you call him two days ago?

640
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,580
If you push the clock,

641
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,580
he should have been scared by the water.

642
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,580
That's right.

643
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,580
No.

644
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
He came up.

645
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,580
Why did his phone turn off?

646
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,580
Don't think about it.

647
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,580
Go to the lake tomorrow and see.

648
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
Then you'll know.

649
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,580
What about him?

650
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
Why can't you keep him in your mind?

651
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,580
Just watch him.

652
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,580
If you're fine tomorrow,

653
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
just let him go.

654
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,580
Okay.

655
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
No.

656
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,580
I'm sorry.

657
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,580
No.

658
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,580
If the village of Wuzhu really killed the gang,

659
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
would you regret it?

660
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,580
If they were alive,

661
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,580
I wouldn't regret anything.

662
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,580
But there are only a few of them.

663
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,580
The one you're holding back is the village.

664
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
The one you're holding back.

665
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,580
The one you're holding back.

666
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
The one in the village.

667
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,580
Jiangzhou, come and eat some fish.

668
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,580
Wash your hands and eat.

669
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,580
How could you do that?

670
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,580
Jiangzhou,

671
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
I made some fish for you.

672
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,580
Please enjoy.

673
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Thank you.

674
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Don't be polite.

675
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
I'll cook it for you.

676
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,580
It's okay.

677
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Kids are like that.

678
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,580
Everyone, please come down and have some water.

679
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
Come on.

680
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,580
Take a rest.

681
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,580
Let's go to his dad.

682
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,580
Huo, take a rest.

683
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,580
Have some water.

684
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,580
Come down.

685
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,580
There's a small room here.

686
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,580
There's a small room.

687
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,580
There's a small room.

688
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,580
There's only a few of them.

689
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
The one you're holding back.

690
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
The one in the village.

691
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:34,060
Either way I wish you more peace and happiness.

692
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,020
No matter how much time passes by ...

693
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,640
If I never steal myself from you

694
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,240
I will nesse the words of death

695
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:55,200
Whatever you slightly say

696
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:02,560
Next Episode

697
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,080
What's this cardboard?

698
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,640
ThisFOA is constant.

699
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,280
The bigger the size, the bigger the boundary.

700
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,200
This is Lake Xin, so it's red.

701
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
The area around is the island.

702
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
The ground is soft and the tide is red.

703
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Yes, green and blue can be safe.

704
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Blue is more dangerous when it's yellow.

705
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,200
If it's red, it might be dangerous to be alone.

706
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,200
This is the location of the day you and Hongsha met.

707
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,200
My uncle can drive the car so close to Lake Xin.

708
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
He should have a similar software to help him.

709
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,200
If your uncle's car is still there,

710
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,200
he might be in this green area.

711
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,200
I remember before, this is a big red.

712
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,200
We often came to pick up the sand.

713
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Was it really my fault?

714
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Go this way.

715
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I'll go ahead.

716
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Get in the car.

717
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
We're looking for it. Be careful.

718
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
If it's dangerous, we'll get it.

719
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Hongsha, you can observe here.

720
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,200
If it's dangerous, remind us immediately.

721
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Be careful.

722
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Let's go.

723
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I'll go this way.

724
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I'll go this way.

725
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I'll go this way.

726
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
I'll go this way.

727
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
I'll go this way.

728
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
I'll go this way.

729
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
I'll go this way.

730
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I'll go this way.

731
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
I'll go this way.

732
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
I'll go this way.

733
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
I'll go this way.

734
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I'll go this way.

735
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
I'll go this way.

736
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
I'll go this way.

737
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
I'll go this way.

738
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Be careful.

739
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
You'll get the sand.

740
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Luo Ren, this way.

741
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Be careful.

742
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Is this the car of Uncle Hongsha?

743
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Luo Ren,

744
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
isn't this car limited to one lane?

745
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Yes.

746
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
We thought it would stop.

747
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
But it's soft at the bottom.

748
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
It's limited to one lane.

749
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
This is the scary part.

750
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
It's pretty scary.

751
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
There's a old stick in it.

752
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Don't worry.

753
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,200
I checked it just now.

754
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
There's no one here.

755
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Maybe Uncle Hongsha should leave by himself.

756
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
He's already gone.

757
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
We're going to find him.

758
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
He's already gone.

759
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Don't cry.

760
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
It's better to leave after the meal.

761
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Okay.

762
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
I saw that thing.

763
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,200
It's there.

764
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
What's wrong?

765
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,200
Is it Dad?

766
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Dad?

767
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
There's no problem in the safe zone.

768
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
I saw it.

769
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
It's not from us.

770
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Is there anyone else?

771
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Yes.

772
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
Cao Pengpeng.

773
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
You're not playing with me.

774
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
The hunter is coming.

775
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,200
What?

776
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
He went to the interview with the master.

777
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Why did he find the right person?

778
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
It's just that

779
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
he's not a natural person.

780
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
He's a natural person.

781
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
He's lost his phone.

782
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
So he's lost his power.

783
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
I want to talk to my master.

784
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
Luckily, he didn't stop me.

785
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
It's not convenient to talk to him.

786
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
He's got a ghost.

787
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
If anyone can look at him,

788
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,200
it's fine.

789
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Yes.

790
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Hurry up.

791
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Why?

792
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
It's a long way.

793
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Cao Cao is here.

794
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,200
My friends.

795
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Cao Yuan is here.

796
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Cao Cao, hurry up.

797
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
He's doing it with his strength.

798
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
He's going to run away.

799
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Cao Cao is here.

800
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Be careful.

801
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
What's wrong?

802
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
I'm so excited.

803
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
My car.

804
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Dad.

805
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,200
Can you hear me?

806
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,200
Where can I hear it?

807
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Hurry up.

808
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,200
The phone.

809
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
The phone.

810
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
Where is he?

811
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,200
Cao Cao is in the way.

812
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I think he's coming down from this hole.

813
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
I've seen you all.

814
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,200
What's wrong?

815
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Hello, Cao Cao.

816
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
I...

817
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Brother Cao, step down.

818
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
No.

819
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,200
No, no, no.

820
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,200
You have a gun in your head.

821
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
What's that?

822
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I'm so sorry.

823
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm sorry.

824
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I'm sorry.

825
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,200
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,200
I'm sorry.

830
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
I'm sorry.

834
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
I'm sorry.

835
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
I'm sorry.

836
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
I'm sorry.

837
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
I'm sorry.

838
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
I'm sorry.

839
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,200
I'm sorry.

840
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,200
I'm sorry.

841
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,200
I'm sorry.

842
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I'm sorry.

843
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I'm sorry.

844
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,200
I'm sorry.

845
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,200
I'm sorry.

846
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
I'm sorry.

847
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,200
I'm sorry.

848
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,200
I'm sorry.

849
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm sorry.

850
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,200
I'm sorry.

851
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
I'm sorry.

852
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,200
I'm sorry.

853
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,200
I'm sorry.

854
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
I'm sorry.

855
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,200
I'm sorry.

856
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
I'm sorry.

857
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,200
I'm sorry.

858
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,200
I'm sorry.

859
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,200
I'm sorry.

860
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200

I'm sorry.

868
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,200
