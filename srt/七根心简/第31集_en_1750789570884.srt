00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hi.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,800
You said this Fangfang will not be affected by the seventh star

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,320
Now it's a double

4
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,320
I saw light in the tree in my dreams

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
Now Fangfang is covering him

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Is the star in the tree?

7
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,120
I don't think it's possible

8
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,320
Our first six stars are so dangerous

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,720
The seventh one is so put down and let us take it

10
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,120
How do I know if I try

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,920
How about it

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,920
The star seems to be really in it

13
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Really

14
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
I said

15
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Be careful

16
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I'll cut it down

17
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:29,920
It appeared

18
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Be careful

19
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Don't cut it out

20
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,920
What can he do if it comes out

21
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,920
If it's a gift, it can be used as a tree

22
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,920
What's wrong

23
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,920
I just checked the monitor of the new room

24
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
The color of the new room is still changing

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Shouldn't the magic of qi qi be recreated

26
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,920
I hope it's just a reaction

27
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Mudan

28
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,920
This one is too comfortable

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,920
I always feel something wrong

30
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Then let's not rush back

31
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
I've been in Fengzi Forest for two more days

32
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,920
I asked my big brother to send the new star of Li Xi

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,920
There should be new clues in the seven re-arranges

34
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,920
The color seems to be a lot lighter

35
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,920
Come on

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm pretty strong

37
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Come on, I'll send you a family reunion

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,920
One, two, one, go

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
I

40
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,920
These seven are put together

41
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
Why are they together

42
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
The seven re-arranges are put together

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Why are they together

44
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Little Red Gang, cut the blood, quickly

45
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Come on

46
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Don't stand there

47
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Let's see if we can see the water this time

48
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Come on

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Come on

50
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
I'm dead today

51
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
I'm going to lock you up

52
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Isn't it life-saving

53
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Take it

54
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Big brother, take care, I'll be right there

55
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
I'm dead

56
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
I'm going to lock you up

57
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,920
So what you see this time is different from before

58
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
The water shadow

59
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
It was all about the cross dog before

60
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Why is this river like this

61
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,920
Before the water should have released the memory of the cross dog

62
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
This time different

63
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Seven roots

64
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,920
It should have released the memory of the dog

65
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,920
The water shadow

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
The water shadow

67
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,920
The water shadow

68
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Seven roots

69
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
It should have released more critical and more important memories

70
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Why does it look like the last round of seal state

71
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Yes

72
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
They are wearing ancient clothes

73
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
And very familiar

74
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
I remember

75
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,920
Last time we went to the lawsuit

76
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,920
That Yu Qiaoran didn't take a picture of them

77
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Isn't it like this

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
What are you talking about

79
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
I'm the only one who's worried about this dead memory, right

80
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
What is dead memory

81
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,920
In the records left by the lawsuit

82
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
It's not dead memory

83
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Do you remember

84
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Xin Jian will grow up

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
I analyze

86
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Every time he grows up

87
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,920
His energy will be strengthened

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,920
In contrast, the way to subdue him will also change

89
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Maybe in the right time

90
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Just pull him into the tomb

91
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Just use the phoenix to lock him up

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
But

93
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
When it comes to the plum blossom

94
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
The difficulty becomes greater

95
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
He wrote a letter

96
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,920
With this return

97
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,920
It's not easy to do

98
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Then except for death

99
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Can completely seal him

100
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
Do we have no other way

101
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
This way

102
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Die to seal him

103
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
If we can't seal him, we have to die

104
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Look at this game, how clever

105
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Just a few of us

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Nine deaths in a lifetime

107
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Nine deaths

108
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm for a lifetime

109
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
This nine deaths still let me die

110
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Why die

111
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm not that stupid

112
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
All have to die

113
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,920
The end

114
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Know director

115
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
What do you think

116
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I think it's a good job

117
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
I think it's a nice job

118
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
It would be better if my dream comes true

119
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
However

120
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
It seems that it has a hard time

121
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
But then

122
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
We had a veryNotch

123
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,320
The first index will continue to fluctuate.

124
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,920
At this time, it may cause extreme weather and natural disasters in some areas.

125
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Please reduce outdoor activities as much as possible.

126
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,520
Uncle Guan said he was on his way here.

127
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
He told us not to be discouraged.

128
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,320
Don't be discouraged?

129
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,120
What's the use of being discouraged?

130
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,120
They have a flowery smile, a mother with a child, and a phoenix.

131
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
They're all going to die.

132
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
What about us?

133
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,920
We're empty-handed. We don't deserve to die.

134
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
Where are you going?

135
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Come back.

136
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,120
Drink it.

137
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
Choose what you want to eat.

138
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,120
We won't have time to drink it anyway.

139
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,120
Cheers.

140
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,520
Come on.

141
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,520
The night will be broken.

142
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,920
The thoughts will be specific.

143
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,320
With the memories of warmth,

144
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,720
I'll hold you in my arms.

145
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
In this city,

146
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,720
the road is slowly getting lonely.

147
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Someone will believe that you are here.

148
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Maybe fate is too complicated.

149
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Drink the red tea.

150
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Happy birthday.

151
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,720
The stubbornness and courage

152
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,720
are only in this body.

153
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
In the memories,

154
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
those times are not enough.

155
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,720
There will be light that slowly

156
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,720
will change you.

157
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,720
The road of life is cruel and cruel.

158
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,720
But there will be someone

159
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
who can hear your voice.

160
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Mu Dai.

161
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Where is she?

162
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
13000.

163
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Cao Peng Peng.

164
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Happy birthday to you.

165
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Happy birthday to you.

166
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,720
Happy birthday to you.

167
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Happy birthday to you.

168
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Happy birthday, Red Sand.

169
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Happy birthday.

170
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Why didn't you tell us your birthday?

171
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
I'm not going to say anything.

172
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,720
I'm just thinking that you're all in a bad mood.

173
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,440
I don't want to bother you with this little thing.

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm also afraid.

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
I'm afraid this is the last birthday I have.

176
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,880
No.

177
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,960
I just don't understand.

178
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,480
When I was a kid, you always told me

179
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,280
that good people have good help.

180
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,720
We've been doing just and right things.

181
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,640
But why is God so unfair?

182
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,960
Why did we end up like this?

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
I don't understand.

184
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,720
You're right.

185
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,200
You're so down-to-earth.

186
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,280
We haven't celebrated our birthdays yet.

187
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,760
It's almost the half-year.

188
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,680
Since we celebrated your birthday first,

189
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,760
we should celebrate it together, right?

190
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,200
Yes.

191
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,960
Right?

192
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,320
And I ran three convenience stores

193
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,680
to get you these cakes.

194
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,080
I prepared some vinegar.

195
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,160
But you must take them.

196
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,880
Happy birthday.

197
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,440
It's not hard to celebrate birthdays.

198
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,440
Wipe your tears.

199
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,120
Make a wish.

200
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,240
Make a wish? Okay.

201
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,440
Come on, make a wish.

202
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,400
I hope we can find a new way to break the heart.

203
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
How can I marry this?

204
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
I'll marry my own.

205
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,120
Okay.

206
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,120
I hope we can live in peace

207
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
without any troubles.

208
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
We'll be together for many years.

209
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,200
Even if we have white hair,

210
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,000
we can celebrate birthdays together

211
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,720
and go out together.

212
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,320
Happy birthday!

213
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,360
Happy birthday, Ye Hushan!

214
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,560
Happy birthday!

215
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,000
Come on, let's drink.

216
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,960
Let's drink.

217
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,760
Let's drink.

218
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,640
Let's drink.

219
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,360
Come on, let's drink.

220
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,200
It's time to celebrate.

221
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,320
Come on, let's drink.

222
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,240
Come on, let's drink.

223
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,840
Cheers!

224
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,960
I think Cao Panpan is right.

225
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,120
We've been on the right path.

226
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,360
Good people should have good results.

227
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,920
It shouldn't be like this.

228
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,240
Yes.

229
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,440
It shouldn't be like this.

230
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,680
I won't accept it.

231
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,480
Don't you think the seal of the heart

232
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,280
needs a lot of power?

233
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,760
What power can the dead have?

234
00:14:39,600 --> 00:15:03,720
Mo�

235
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,600
Get off.

236
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
A useful prank on you.

237
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,280
Mo�

238
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Don't be discouraged.

239
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
There are more difficult ways than the difficult ones.

240
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
For this reason, I bought my favorite

241
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,440
whole family's bucket of food to feed everyone.

242
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Look at you all.

243
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
You all look so sad.

244
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Good morning.

245
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Where's Xiao Luo?

246
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
He said he was going for a walk. I don't know where he's going.

247
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
You all...

248
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Hey, do you want to try it?

249
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,440
You can connect to the exit in 10 seconds.

250
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
500 yuan in bonus.

251
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Let me do it.

252
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Are you ready?

253
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Yes.

254
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Start.

255
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Time's up.

256
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
You're not being polite.

257
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
You're so confused.

258
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Even if you draw a line with the answer,

259
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
it's impossible to do it in 10 seconds.

260
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
How is that impossible?

261
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Just one second is enough.

262
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
One second?

263
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Let me see.

264
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
You're not following the rules.

265
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
We can draw like this.

266
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
We can do it.

267
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,440
The rules say we have to connect to the exit.

268
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,440
No one has to follow the lines.

269
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
In the face of death,

270
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
there's only one way to die.

271
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Only by jumping out of the trap

272
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
can we find the new way.

273
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
What is this?

274
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
What's your route?

275
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
I'll walk and walk.

276
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:34,400
If the

277
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
There's a way out of this house.

278
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Where?

279
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Let's make it clear.

280
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
We will not take any chances.

281
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
But we can't give up, right?

282
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Even if we want to give up,

283
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
when the miracle tree arrives tomorrow

284
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
and Xing Jian escapes,

285
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
will he let us go?

286
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,440
And they have figured out

287
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
our relatives, family, and friends.

288
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm really worried

289
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
they will do it against them.

290
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
We lack phoenixes and the devil of the night.

291
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
We can't find the way out.

292
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
We can't find the way out.

293
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
We can't find the way out.

294
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
So we have to figure out a way out.

295
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
What's your idea?

296
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
My idea is

297
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
to make a living.

298
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Make a living?

299
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
The meaning of living is

300
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,440
to attract Xing Jian into our body

301
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
and use our body

302
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,440
to make a living phoenix and the devil of the night.

303
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Who?

304
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Who?

305
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
Well,

306
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
I think

307
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
you are right.

308
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
You are indeed

309
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,440
a living phoenix and a phoenix.

310
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,440
So you mean we can make a living?

311
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
No, no.

312
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I'm not an ancient man.

313
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,440
I don't dare to guarantee it.

314
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,440
But it's a different kind of opportunity.

315
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,440
There is a chance of a victory.

316
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
How much success

317
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
can a victory have?

318
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
If it's not a success, it's a failure.

319
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Half of it is 50%.

320
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,440
50%.

321
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
I'll do 50%.

322
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm 100% better than you.

323
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
Right?

324
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
I'm willing to do it.

325
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
I'll do it, too.

326
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
There's no other way.

327
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
We, the plum blossom family, do this.

328
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Who else can do it?

329
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
Right, master?

330
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Then I'll do it.

331
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
I'll go tomorrow.

332
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Okay.

333
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,440
I'll go tomorrow.

334
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
Come on.

335
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
I'm willing to do it.

336
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Mom, I ordered a massage chair for you.

337
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
Yes, I'm worried about your waist.

338
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
And my dad's neck.

339
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Hello, Uncle Zhang.

340
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
How's the business in the store?

341
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Don't go to Hu's store to buy goods.

342
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
He has nine bottles.

343
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Eight bottles of wine are fake.

344
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
If you can't come, you can hire some workers.

345
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
No problem.

346
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I just want to tell you.

347
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,440
If I can't come back this time,

348
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,440
you can sell the things in my room.

349
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,440
If you don't want it, you can throw it away.

350
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
I don't have a disability.

351
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
The bank card password is locked.

352
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
You can tell Pingting.

353
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,440
Okay, that's it.

354
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Uncle Zheng.

355
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
It's okay.

356
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Bye.

357
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,440
Are you done?

358
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Yes.

359
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Why?

360
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
You don't want to call Hongyu?

361
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
I've been thinking about it.

362
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
I decided not to call him.

363
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
I said too much.

364
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
I'm afraid he'll think too much.

365
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,440
I think it's okay.

366
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
People will be better.

367
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Everyone will be fine.

368
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Thank you.

369
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,000
Dongjian

370
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:54,240
Take Young Master and Lady Meng to thené

371
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,680
It's very challenging.

372
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,560
I really don't understand.

373
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,560
This is a secret room.

374
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,480
Just a single visit

375
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,760
and it's over.

376
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,840
Why do we have to come here?

377
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
What's the origin of the place?

378
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,080
According to the book,

379
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,400
the place where the secret room is sealed

380
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,840
is the origin of the place.

381
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,640
I think there must be a reason for it.

382
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,920
Just do it.

383
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,600
That's right.

384
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,560
That's right.

385
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,880
It's such an important thing.

386
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,360
Shouldn't we have a sense of ritual?

387
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,240
Forget it.

388
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,480
I'm not stupid enough.

389
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,280
It's so heavy.

390
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,160
Is it this tree?

391
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,080
Yes.

392
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,240
Is this the one

393
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,200
that was used

394
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,800
tens of millions of years ago?

395
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,200
Okay.

396
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
It made a sudden snowfall.

397
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,480
are social life with Peking????

398
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:39,160
Just like in a horror movie

399
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,860
Also plays a bad act

400
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,660
Cause they even made that blockbuster

401
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,300
Do you understand?

402
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,720
Love, believe, I believe I'd be on

403
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,480
And I'd like to know

404
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,420
Hey hey hey hey

405
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:58,640
Hey hey hey hey

406
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,080
at me

407
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:05,100
HEY HEY HEY

408
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,560
Oh oh

409
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,160
Oh, buddy

410
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,860
Slowly be memories

411
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,300
The only thing I hope to see

412
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,480
Slowly embrace you

413
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,080
Pcke up the sales of Extension

414
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,880
With the future of the city

415
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,940
I hold hold to your hand

416
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,300
Until the world lets go

417
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,060
This is so beautiful

418
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,420
It's like am usted

419
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,420
I'm in love.

420
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,420
Look at the future, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

421
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,420
I just want to be with you slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly

422
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,420
I really don't want to destroy the atmosphere now.

423
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,420
But should we do something?

424
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,420
It's really quite a destroy atmosphere.

425
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,420
Come on, it's time.

426
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,420
You go first.

427
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
I'll go first.

428
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
I'll go first.

429
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
Uncle Wen, what if...

430
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,420
What if I have any problem?

431
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
Don't be soft.

432
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,420
Hmm.

433
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
Hmm.

434
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,420
Little wifey, it's been ten minutes.

435
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,420
How do you feel about your first shot?

436
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,420
I don't think so.

437
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,420
You don't feel it?

438
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Hmm.

439
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Do you two have any different feelings?

440
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,420
Oh, my neck hurts a little.

441
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Did you get a shot?

442
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,420
Basically.

443
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,420
How do you feel?

444
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,420
I don't feel anything.

445
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,420
I feel like the fire is pretty warm.

446
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,420
Do you have any different feelings?

447
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,420
What do you feel?

448
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,420
I don't feel anything.

449
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,420
I just feel hungry.

450
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
What do you want to eat?

451
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
I have.

452
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
I want to eat.

453
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
That's it.

454
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,420
I don't feel anything else.

455
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,420
That means you don't feel anything.

456
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
Uncle Wen.

457
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
You...

458
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
You're on the card now?

459
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
No.

460
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,420
My car is still at the old man's house.

461
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,420
I have nothing to drive back.

462
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,420
I've been changing it for a long time.

463
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,420
You don't feel anything?

464
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
You're talking about this car?

465
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
Uncle Gui.

466
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,420
I'll leave it to you.

467
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
If I die,

468
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
can I let my daughter raise it?

469
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
But there's one thing.

470
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
You love chicken.

471
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
Can you remember it?

472
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
No, no, no, no.

473
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Then help me take care of Aunt Hong.

474
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,420
No, no, no.

475
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
You don't feel anything.

476
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
You're still here.

477
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,420
You're entrusting this and that.

478
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,420
You don't feel like it's a good thing?

479
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
You scared me to death.

480
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
I was so nervous.

481
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
I'm sweating.

482
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,420
I tell you, this is a great moment.

483
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
Can you?

484
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,420
This is a moment of experience.

485
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,420
Just you two.

486
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,420
It's so beautiful to see the sky floating here.

487
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,420
Come and take a picture with us.

488
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,420
How beautiful it is.

489
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,420
Come on, come on, come here.

490
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,420
Come on, come on, come here.

491
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
Come here.

492
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
I'll take this as a good thing.

493
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
It's okay.

494
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
It's a good thing.

495
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
It's okay.

496
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,420
It's okay.

497
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,420
It's okay.

498
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
Come on, come on.

499
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Come on, come on.

500
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,420
I'll help you.

501
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,420
Is there anything else?

502
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,420
Come on, come on.

503
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,420
Hurry up.

504
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Come on, come on, come here.

505
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,420
Come on.

506
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,420
One, two, three.

507
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
Three, two, one.

508
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,420
Stop.

509
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
Okay.

510
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
Look at it.

511
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Come on, change the style.

512
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
I think he's good at that.

513
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
It's much better than that.

514
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
Come on, change the style.

515
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,420
No, move.

516
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
Change the style.

517
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
Move.

518
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Can you hear me?

519
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Move a little.

520
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,420
This is...

521
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Where is this?

522
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
What is this place?

523
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,800
Aren't we taking photos?

524
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
We're in the photo.

525
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,060
Hong Tai, are you feeling unwell?

526
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm fine.

527
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
It's a monster.

528
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,180
Let's separate and disturb them.

529
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,780
Don't waste your energy.

530
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,420
Zhang Guanghua?

531
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,420
It's you.

532
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,380
Welcome to...

533
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,860
my world.

534
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,220
No.

535
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
He's not Zhang Guanghua.

536
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,020
If I'm right,

537
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,260
you're the seventh heart.

538
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,580
You're right.

539
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,140
And you're not.

540
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,700
The seventh heart.

541
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,700
As an old man, I've been completely activated.

542
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,660
You've successfully put the heart into your own body

543
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,660
under my arrangement.

544
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
In the face of death,

545
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,420
there's only one way to get out of it.

546
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,420
Only by jumping out of it

547
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,420
can you find the new path.

548
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
So that person arranged it for you.

549
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,420
The seventh heart.

550
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
That's right.

551
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
It's all thanks to you, Wu Xingang.

552
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,420
It's easy to understand.

553
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,420
So what is this place?

554
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
How do I describe this place?

555
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Your body is still in the distance.

556
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,420
You're just in the environment I created for you.

557
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,420
To be more precise,

558
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,420
I'm in your...

559
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
brain.

560
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,420
You want to mess with our brains?

561
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,420
Get out!

562
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,420
I was wondering why the seventh heart was so small.

563
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,420
Who's waiting here?

564
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,420
It's too much.

565
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
It wants to turn us into idiots.

566
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,420
I'm warning you.

567
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
Let us out!

568
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
I want to pull the strings!

569
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,420
Idiot.

570
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,420
Because all of you have something in your minds

571
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
that you want.

572
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,420
What do you mean?

573
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,420
All along, you've been dealing with the single heart.

574
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,420
But the seventh heart was originally together.

575
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,420
This kind of condition appeared during the time of Boyang Zi.

576
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,420
It was turned into a large army by you humans.

577
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
The fourth heart is gone.

578
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Where is it?

579
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,420
I can still tell you.

580
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,420
To be united,

581
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,420
you need to practice martial arts.

582
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,420
And there are five elements in practice.

583
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,420
All of these are in our brains.

584
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:53,340
When we finally completed the

585
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
five elements,

586
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
we will be alive.

587
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:01,420
After seven days, we will be fine.

588
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,420
These five elements are in the hands of the five disciples of Da De.

589
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
Smart.

590
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,420
The five elements are in the blood.

591
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
They are in the brains of you.

592
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:18,420
In the depths of consciousness.

593
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:23,420
You mean the five of us are the descendants of the five disciples of Da De?

594
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
That's right.

595
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,420
But there are many descendants of Da De.

596
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,420
They are everywhere.

597
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:48,020
You are the most complete of the five elements in the body of the five-dimensional

598
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,020
I will arrange for you to be together.

599
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,020
To get involved in this matter.

600
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
Dad!

601
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,020
It is also destined that you came here.

602
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,020
Help us complete this puzzle.

603
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
Can you hear me?

604
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
Can you see me?

605
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,020
We are finally going to complete the mission.

606
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:50,020
All of you humans will be trampled by me.

607
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,020
Since you are so anxious, let's get started.

608
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Luo Xiao Da.

609
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Luo Xiao Da.

610
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
Hou Sha.

611
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
Pang Pang.

612
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Yi Wan San.

613
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,020
Luo Xiao Da.

614
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
Hou Sha.

615
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,020
Pang Pang.

616
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,020
Yi Wan San.

617
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
Mu Dai.

618
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
Where is this?

619
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
Where are my friends?

620
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,020
It's the starting point.

621
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,020
Your friends are also at their starting point.

622
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
What are you playing at again?

623
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,020
Poor humans.

624
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
Your world is one-sided.

625
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,020
You can only move forward.

626
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
You can't turn back.

627
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,020
But this is the beginning.

628
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,020
See?

629
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,020
Your life is here.

630
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,020
Your regrets can be fixed.

631
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,020
Your trauma can be healed.

632
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,020
Your life can be saved.

633
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,020
I...

634
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,020
I...

635
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,020
I...

636
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,020
I...

637
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
The past is the past.

638
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,020
I like my life now.

639
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,020
I don't need to start over.

640
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,020
Is that so?

641
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
Don't worry.

642
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
I won't force you.

643
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,020
I'm just giving you a chance.

644
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,020
You decide your life.

645
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,020
I'm sorry.

646
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,020
Ohhh.

647
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
Oh.

648
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,020
Oh.

649
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,100
En- down.

650
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,020
En-down.

651
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
Nab.

652
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
Let go.

653
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,020
It is totally within limits.

654
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,020
That'sSimBarry.

655
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,020
He's about to leave.

656
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:21,160
Hey, little uncle, I have a little problem.

657
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,340
Can you help me get a car?

658
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,380
I know the car won't come in.

659
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,920
I know the car won't come in.

660
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,160
I mean you can get me a cattle car, a horse car, a donkey car, whatever car you want.

661
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,580
I'll pay you a lot of money.

662
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
OK?

663
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,680
If I can't, I'll write you a letter of praise and give you a prize.

664
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,400
It's so shameful to get a stamp on the wall, right?

665
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Tomorrow morning?

666
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,080
Little uncle, can you hurry up?

667
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,480
You'll be there in an hour.

668
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
I'll be very happy.

669
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,760
Tomorrow morning is the fastest.

670
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,280
OK, OK, OK, anyway, you hurry up, OK?

671
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,600
I beg you.

672
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Be careful of the heat in the mountains at night.

673
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,200
Be careful of the heat.

674
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,560
OK, I'll be careful.

675
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
OK, thank you.

676
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Bye bye.

677
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
What's going on?

678
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
What's going on?

679
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
In front of me

680
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
People are looking at me

681
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,160
Two sides

682
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,200
One side is the main

683
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,200
One side is waiting for you

684
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
This game

685
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Has no end

686
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,200
It carries the traces of the past

687
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You are my soul

688
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I am your match

689
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I become you

690
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I feel your every breath

691
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Then continue to cherish the sky

692
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Cross the line of life

693
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Tell me the end

694
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,800
The soon-to-be gentle appearance

695
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
In the mind

696
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,800
The face of the star is over

697
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,800
In the dark

698
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,800
The flower is clear

699
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Tell me the end

700
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,600
The soon-to-be gentle appearance

701
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
In the mind

702
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,600
The face of the star is over

703
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,600
In the dark

704
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,400
The flower is clear

705
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Tell me the end

706
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,400
The soon-to-be gentle appearance

707
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
In the mind

708
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,400
The face of the star is over

709
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,400
In the dark

710
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,400
The flower is clear

711
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,200
In the dark
