00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Fatty.

31
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Fatty.

32
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
Fatty.

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Help!

34
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Help!

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,000
Qin Shan, put the knife down.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't come over.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Fatty.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Fatty.

39
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
Fatty.

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,480
If you can't find your friend, then get lost.

41
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Why do you have to come to die?

42
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
No.

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,800
My friend is here.

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
How can I get lost?

45
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
If I leave, I won't be able to talk.

46
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
How about this?

47
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,240
If I leave now,

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
will I still be able to get lost?

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Where's Qin Shan?

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Where's the wooden bag?

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They're all dead.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What?

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Say it again.

54
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Where's the wooden bag?

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
I'll say it again.

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
They're all dead.

57
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,200
One of them was hit by a stone and was buried alive.

58
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
No.

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
No.

62
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Ya Feng.

63
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Ya Feng.

64
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Lao Ruo.

65
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
Relax your body.

66
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Don't move.

67
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Otherwise, your arm won't last long.

68
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Come on.

69
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
Come on.

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Come on.

71
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I'll hold the rope.

72
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Take out the rope and tie it to your waist.

73
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Come on.

74
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Tie it.

75
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Why do you think Ya Feng likes Qin Shan?

76
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
He always wants to find a rich man.

77
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Who knows?

78
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Maybe he's had enough fun and wants to marry a rich man.

79
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Do you know?

80
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I heard that Ya Feng is the one who's after Qin Shan.

81
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Really?

82
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
What do you think he's after?

83
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Is it because Qin Shan is trying to get him to marry him?

84
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Qin Shan

85
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Does it hurt?

86
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
If it hurts, turn your head around.

87
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
What's wrong?

88
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Will my finger fall off?

89
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
No.

90
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
It's done.

91
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I found that you always wear full gear.

92
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
I'm used to it.

93
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
I have no change.

94
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
It's much more comfortable to hug you again.

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
They seem to have a hat on.

96
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
It hurts.

97
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
It hurts.

98
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
They have a big bone.

99
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
I'll apply hand cream on them every day after I go back.

100
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
And I'll make beautiful nails.

101
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Mudai.

102
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Thank you for saving me.

103
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
If it weren't for you,

104
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I would have been dead.

105
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I can save you, right?

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
I can protect you, right?

107
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
It's a small thing.

108
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Don't worry.

109
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Luo Xiaodong.

110
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
It's best if you never get hurt.

111
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
How did you fall?

112
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Me?

113
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I heard someone calling for help.

114
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Then they led me here.

115
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
I saw the grasshopper being tied up.

116
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Something was hanging in his mouth.

117
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I knew there was someone in the cave.

118
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I wanted to hit him with the stone.

119
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
He was hiding behind that stone.

120
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
I just aimed at the foot and fell down.

121
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,200
It's the same trick.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
It seems that the whole thing was planned by Qingshan.

123
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Yafeng is his accomplice.

124
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Yafeng?

125
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Qingshan just kidnapped Yafeng.

126
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
I saved Yafeng when I saw Yafeng.

127
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Guess what?

128
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
He pushed me down.

129
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Then...

130
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
would they...

131
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
The grasshopper is still up there.

132
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Why did Qingshan do this to us?

133
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
We have no grudge against him.

134
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
The grasshopper is his cousin.

135
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
What do you think?

136
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Xinjian.

137
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
I tested Yafeng with blood.

138
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
He didn't react.

139
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Qingshan didn't use Xinjian's power to control his spirit.

140
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Maybe...

141
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
it was just a simple brainwashing.

142
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
What about the grasshopper?

143
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Will they harm the grasshopper?

144
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Don't worry.

145
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
He's the safest one so far.

146
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
He used the flip board trap to deal with us.

147
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
He was completely dead.

148
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
And he was tied up with the ring.

149
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Maybe he was tied to Xinqin's bedside table.

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Xinqin's family was there.

151
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
They didn't kill him.

152
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
But now...

153
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
the most worried is Yi Wan San.

154
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Yi Wan San...

155
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
could it be...

156
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I said it randomly.

157
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
I just think we're trapped here and can't get out.

158
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
We can't save him.

159
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
What if we can never get out?

160
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
Don't be sad.

161
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Think about it.

162
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
You're trapped in such a desperate place.

163
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
You're trying to save yourself.

164
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I believe they must be the same.

165
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Don't forget.

166
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
We still have red sand.

167
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Thank you.

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Thank you.

169
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Hello.

170
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
How far is Cao Jia Village from here?

171
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Cao Jia Village?

172
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
It rained heavily last night.

173
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
The road collapsed.

174
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
You two followed this path and kept going.

175
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
It took about two hours.

176
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Two hours?

177
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Yes.

178
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
That's too far.

179
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
I shouldn't have come.

180
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
That's right.

181
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Boss,

182
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
which way is the collapsed road you mentioned?

183
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I want to ask if I can turn from the mountain to the village.

184
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Turn to the village?

185
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Yes.

186
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Miss, you're so brave.

187
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
The mountain is dangerous.

188
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
It rained heavily last night.

189
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
There are falls everywhere.

190
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
You should walk safely on the road.

191
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
It's safe.

192
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Will I get lost on the mountain road?

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
No.

194
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
The road is long.

195
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
If you get lost,

196
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
you can go to the highest place.

197
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
You can see Cao Jia Village.

198
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Okay.

199
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Thank you.

200
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Be careful.

201
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Cao Jia Village

202
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Cao Jia Village

203
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Cao Jia Village

204
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Cao Jia Village

205
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
You buried him.

206
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Yi Wan San.

207
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Yi Wan San

208
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Yi Wan San

209
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Yi Wan San

210
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Yi Wan San

211
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Yi Wan San

212
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Yi Wan San

213
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Yi Wan San

214
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Yi Wan San

215
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Yi Wan San

216
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Yi Wan San

217
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Yi Wan San

218
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Yi Wan San

219
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Yi Wan San

220
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Are you okay?

221
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
How do you feel now?

222
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
I almost fell down.

223
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
I almost fell down.

224
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
I almost fell down.

225
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
I almost fell down.

226
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I almost fell down.

227
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
I almost fell down.

228
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Let's go to sleep.

229
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Okay.

230
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Slowly.

231
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Why are you here?

232
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Luo Ren called me and said you were lost.

233
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Luo Ren called me and said you were lost.

234
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
He went into the village yesterday.

235
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
I can't reach him now.

236
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I haven't arrived yet.

237
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I just entered the village.

238
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I just entered the village.

239
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I met you halfway.

240
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Right.

241
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Qingshan.

242
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Qingshan is in trouble.

243
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
That heart knot.

244
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
I'm afraid it's not on him.

245
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Little Boss.

246
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Little Boss.

247
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Look at your fighting skills.

248
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
He may have a mind of his own.

249
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Can I fight hard?

250
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
I need to rely on some wisdom.

251
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
What kind of wisdom do you have?

252
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm just a heartless,

253
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
ill-intentioned,

254
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
and dark-hearted person.

255
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
I...

256
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Forget it. I'm not going to change.

257
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm pretending to be dead.

258
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm going to kill you.

259
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm going to kill you.

260
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
I tried to climb out of the village.

261
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
But I couldn't.

262
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I was buried again.

263
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
When you woke up,

264
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,200
you saw yourself in Luo Ren's car.

265
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Were you excited?

266
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Yi Wan San.

267
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Hang in there.

268
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
You can't die.

269
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Ah!

270
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Qingshan!

271
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Yi Wan San!

272
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
Yi Wan San!

273
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
What do you mean?

274
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
What do you mean, I didn't?

275
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Who would have seen

276
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
how weird you were?

277
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
You were so excited.

278
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I thought I was already dead.

279
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
I was wrapped in a milk carton.

280
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
But Erhuai,

281
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I'm not talking about you.

282
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
You're so good at wrapping.

283
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
You wrapped the milk carton

284
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
more carefully than you did.

285
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Don't hit me!

286
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
It hurts everywhere.

287
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
See?

288
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I don't want to kill you.

289
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Only God can help me fix you.

290
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Yes.

291
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm not delicate. You're delicate.

292
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
You're the most delicate.

293
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Then you take it off.

294
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Wrap it again.

295
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
You did a good job.

296
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
You did the best.

297
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
I like it when you do this.

298
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Now that I think about it,

299
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
the day that the boss

300
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
didn't contact Luo Ren,

301
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I think she's in trouble too.

302
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
What should we do now?

303
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Should we call the police?

304
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Do you have any evidence?

305
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
The people of the Cao family

306
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
must have been following Qingshan.

307
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Who do you think we are?

308
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
It's the middle of the night.

309
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Now it's time to find Luo Ren.

310
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Are you sure that the new card

311
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
is really with Qingshan?

312
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Although I'm not 100% sure,

313
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
she has a big problem anyway.

314
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Don't you think

315
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
it's different from usual?

316
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
We were framed by the police.

317
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Cao Fang was lured back

318
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
to the Cao Village by a letter.

319
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
They were in a relationship.

320
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Then the boss and I came to find her.

321
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
We bought insurance in advance.

322
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
We didn't offend anyone.

323
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
We were found dead.

324
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
Now the boss is also in a relationship.

325
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Then Luo Ren came to us.

326
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
We were also in a relationship.

327
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
Fortunately, you were lucky

328
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
to not be a fool

329
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
and enter the village.

330
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Otherwise, you would have been

331
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
confused by Qingshan's

332
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
shameless face.

333
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
The result will be the same as them.

334
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
You will be in a relationship.

335
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I'll book a alarm.

336
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Is it necessary to book an alarm?

337
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
In a dark and gloomy environment,

338
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
it can make people lose their judgment

339
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
and further break down their emotions.

340
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
So it's very important to sit down.

341
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
I've searched all the places

342
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
you just found.

343
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
I can get out of here.

344
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Really?

345
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
I'm so hungry.

346
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I'm not that hungry

347
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
if I put my pants tight.

348
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Help me try it.

349
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Okay.

350
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,200
It's really better than the floor.

351
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Is the net too big?

352
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Will I fall down?

353
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
I said

354
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
this bed was made for you.

355
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
It's not made for me?

356
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Where do I sleep?

357
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Here.

358
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Sleep together?

359
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
I've been taught since I was a kid

360
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
that girls can't sleep together.

361
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,200
I can't sleep together.

362
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,200
I've been taught since I was a kid

363
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
that girls can't sleep together.

364
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
And I can't sleep with boys.

365
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
Whatever.

366
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
But I think

367
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,200
it's not a big deal.

368
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Do you like to eat steamed buns?

369
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
It's very fresh.

370
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Add some crab powder.

371
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
The skin is covered with soup

372
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
and you can eat it with a straw.

373
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
It's delicious.

374
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
I want to eat roast duck.

375
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Roast duck with crispy skin and crispy meat.

376
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Stop talking.

377
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I'm hungry.

378
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Go to sleep.

379
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Maybe tomorrow

380
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I'll have a good time.

381
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,200
I'll see you tomorrow.

382
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
I'll have something to eat today.

383
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
You're making fun of me again.

384
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I'm so poor.

385
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
I've never been so poor in my life.

386
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Let me see.

387
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Does it hurt?

388
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Youren.

389
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Don't take advantage of others.

390
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Okay.

391
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I'll sleep if I don't take advantage of others.

392
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
It's good to have a rope bed.

393
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
It would be nice if the rope could be softer.

394
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
It hurts.

395
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Raise your head.

396
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
The cliff is like a pyramid.

397
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
We walk through the pain and struggle.

398
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
The dream is in your hands.

399
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Go to sleep.

400
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
See the future.

401
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,200
I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe.

402
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I just want to love you slowly.

403
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Love slowly.

404
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Love slowly.

405
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Love slowly.

406
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Looking forward to.

407
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
We walked slowly.

408
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Love slowly.

409
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Love slowly.

410
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Love slowly.

411
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Why are you looking at me like that?

412
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
You idiot.

413
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Do you know?

414
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
When you slept last night,

415
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
you didn't just snore but also drooled.

416
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
What?

417
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Nonsense.

418
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Really?

419
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Forget it. I won't tease you anymore.

420
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Get up and exercise.

421
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Prepare to eat.

422
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
You are drawing a big picture again.

423
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Where did you get the food?

424
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Close your eyes.

425
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Don't open your eyes.

426
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Open your mouth.

427
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Open your mouth.

428
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Chocolate.

429
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
A little snack will not make you hungry.

430
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
It will heal you.

431
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Why didn't you take it out last night?

432
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
I was so hungry last night.

433
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
We don't know how long we will be trapped here.

434
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Of course we plan to eat it.

435
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Okay.

436
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Did you eat it?

437
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
I ate it.

438
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
How about you?

439
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Did you sleep well last night?

440
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
Not bad.

441
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Sleeping on this rope is better than sleeping in the water.

442
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
In the water?

443
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
It rained last night.

444
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
I slept for half an hour and woke up suddenly.

445
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
At first, it was full of water.

446
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Fortunately, the rain stopped and the water was gone.

447
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
The water went away very quickly.

448
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
It's the water here.

449
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
There is soil here.

450
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
And there should be no stones below.

451
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
So the water can go so fast.

452
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
The cave is very deep.

453
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,200
The height of the mountain should be close to the ground.

454
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,200
If there is soil below, it means that it can be dug.

455
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
What?

456
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
The road.

457
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
The road?

458
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
The road.

459
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
The road.

460
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,200
The road.

461
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
The road.

462
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
The road.

463
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
How many years do you have to dig?

464
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Really?

465
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
Really.

466
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Hello.

467
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Hello.

468
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Hello.

469
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,200
What are you doing?

470
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Is this Cao Zhen's house?

471
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
You mean Jin Hua?

472
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Yes.

473
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
Yes.

474
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Ni.

475
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Ni.

476
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Your leader is here to see you.

477
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
What?

478
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Leader.

479
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Leader?

480
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Hurry up.

481
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
My name is Maria.

482
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,200
I am the local manager of the Central District of the Western Human Resources Insurance Company.

483
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Hello.

484
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Central District?

485
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Local manager?

486
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Manager Ma.

487
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Manager Ma.

488
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Manager Ma.

489
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Why are you here?

490
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Sit down.

491
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Okay.

492
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Here is the thing.

493
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Our customer service department received a call from a client named Henry.

494
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
He said he wanted to buy insurance for himself and his sister.

495
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
He told Jenny to be your employee.

496
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
I called you but I couldn't get through.

497
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,200
I asked the colleagues in the night market and I found out that you were at a wedding in your hometown.

498
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I was afraid that the client would wait too long and it would be a burden.

499
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
So I went there on purpose.

500
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I brought some information and needs of the guests.

501
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
I will make you a selection match.

502
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
This...

503
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Thank you so much.

504
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Manager Ma, please come and visit us.

505
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
It's so warm.

506
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
This is the power of our team.

507
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Manager Ma, please drink first.

508
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,200
I will go to the room and check the client's information.

509
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Please drink first.

510
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Please drink first.

511
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Jenny.

512
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Leader, Lin Shuang.

513
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
You are quite happy here.

514
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Are you going to have a wedding?

515
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Yes.

516
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,200
I haven't seen so many wedding in the city.

517
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,200
The wedding in the city is held by wedding companies.

518
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
It's the same if you see too much.

519
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
It's better in your mountains.

520
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
It has its own characteristics.

521
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Of course.

522
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,200
There are many old ceremonies in our mountains.

523
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
We have to hold the wedding for three days just for the wedding.

524
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
The wedding?

525
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Yes.

526
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm a little hungry after hearing you say that.

527
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Manager Ma, you can stay and have the wedding.

528
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Is it convenient?

529
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Yes.

530
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
It's so lively and fun.

531
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
This soup is so interesting.

532
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Drink some wine before you leave.

533
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Drink some wine before you leave.

534
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Why do you have four friends?

535
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
The groom and the bride have been orphans since childhood.

536
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,200
The four grandmothers and the bridesmaids are the parents of the widows.

537
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
When will the bride enter the city?

538
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
From here.

539
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
The groom will take the place and the bride will take the place.

540
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Place?

541
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Yes.

542
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
It's the rule of our village.

543
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
The oldest place is reserved by the oldest person in the village.

544
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,200
The groom and the bride will go to the old man's house to get the place.

545
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
After the place is reserved,

546
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,200
the groom and the bride will take the place for a week.

547
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Then they will give it to the groom.

548
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
The groom and the bride have to pay the place first.

549
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
I see.

550
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Uncle, uncle.

551
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Hurry up.

552
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Where is Qingshan?

553
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
I see.

554
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Eat more.

555
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Jinghua.

556
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Jinghua.

557
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Have you seen Qingshan?

558
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
No.

559
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
She will be here soon.

560
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Qingshan is missing.

561
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Hurry up and find her.

562
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Okay.

563
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Leader, sit down.

564
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
I'll find her.

565
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Come here.

566
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Help me find Qingshan.

567
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
You go to the city.

568
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Zhu's mother.

569
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Zhu's mother.

570
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,200
You sit down first.

571
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Help me find Qingshan.

572
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Hurry up.

573
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Go.

574
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Hurry up.

575
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Go.

576
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
Today is my wedding day.

577
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
We are brothers after all.

578
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Even if you can't go to work,

579
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I hope you can come.

580
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
You are my cousin after all.

581
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Cang Tu.

582
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
I'll send you off after two days.

583
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
I can only help you alone.

584
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
I can't help anyone else.

585
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Qingshan.

586
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Sister Jinghua.

587
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
We are waiting for you to pick up the food.

588
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
What are you doing?

589
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
I have packed up.

590
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
I'll be right back.

591
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Hurry up.

592
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Is this human-made?

593
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
This piece of stone came out.

594
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
This piece of stone came out.

595
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Just leave it.

596
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Mudan, come and look.

597
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
The upper layer of this stone is deliberately arranged.

598
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,200
The upper layer of the gap is against the lower layer of the stone.

599
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
So the knife has to be pushed in from the stone gap.

600
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
There is still a stone below.

601
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,200
So did someone deliberately accumulate it into this?

602
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Then there may be an exit below.

603
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Mudan.

604
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
I found this exit.

605
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
What about you?

606
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
What are you doing?

607
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
I'm not afraid.

608
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
Do you still think that I'm joking about digging a hole?

609
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
I don't think so.

610
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
Then you can dig the rest.

611
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,200
I'm tired.

612
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I'm so pitiful.

613
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
My boyfriend asked me to dig a stone.

614
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
My hand will fall off.

615
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Okay.

616
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Move aside.

617
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
I found it.

618
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
I really like you.

619
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
I'm sorry.

620
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I'm sorry.

621
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Is it delicious?

622
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
I'm full.

623
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Now I have all the strength.

624
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
It's time for me to show off.

625
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Digging a stone is not allowed.

626
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Mom, you're not ready.

627
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
Dad.

628
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Are you okay?

629
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
I'm fine.

630
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm sorry.

631
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
I'm sorry.

633
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
I'm sorry.

635
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
I'm sorry.

637
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
I'm sorry.

638
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
I'm sorry.

639
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
I'm sorry.

640
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
I'm sorry.

641
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm sorry.

642
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
I'm sorry.

643
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
I'm sorry.

644
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
I'm sorry.

645
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
I'm sorry.

646
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
I'm sorry.

647
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
I'm sorry.

648
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
I'm sorry.

649
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm sorry.

651
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
I'm sorry.

652
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
I'm sorry.

653
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
I'm sorry.

654
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
I'm sorry.

655
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
I'm sorry.

656
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
I'm sorry.

657
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
I'm sorry.

658
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
I'm sorry.

659
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
I'm sorry.

660
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I'm sorry.

661
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
I'm sorry.

662
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
I'm sorry.

664
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
I'm sorry.

665
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
I'm sorry.

666
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
I'm sorry.

667
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
I'm sorry.

668
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
I'm sorry.

669
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
I'm sorry.

671
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
I'm sorry.

672
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Tell me the truth.

674
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,200
The soon-to-be gentle breath.

675
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
In my mind,

676
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,200
the memories of being in the dark

677
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,200
are gently passed by.

678
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,200
Tell me the truth.

679
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,200
The soon-to-be gentle breath.

680
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
In my mind,

681
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,200
the memories of being in the dark

682
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,200
are gently passed by.

683
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,200
And I'm in the dark.

684
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Thank you for watching.
