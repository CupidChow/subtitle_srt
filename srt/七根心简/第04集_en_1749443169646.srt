00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 12

2
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Come in.

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hongyi, what did he do just now?

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You all know.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm Li Yaqing.

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What I'm trying to do is to kill Huo Zihong.

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
She's my twin sister.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She shouldn't have died.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I should be the one who died.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This matter...

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I have to start from Zhang Guanghua.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Zhang Guanghua.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Zhang Guanghua?

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I've asked Wan Feng and Huo about it.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You seem to have no connection.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I've asked Zhang Guanghua about a child.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
At that time,

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
he was a rich man.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's normal for me to ask about such a thing.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
At that time,

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Zhang Guanghua was a little boy.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He had a good looking and a good school.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He was very romantic.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He was so sad that his family didn't believe him.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And he was so obsessed with me.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm serious.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
When I was pregnant,

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
he disappeared.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I was so sad.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
At that time, I knew how stupid I was.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
My parents were very disappointed with me.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The city was small and the salt was too much.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They took me to the hospital to see my children.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They took my children away.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Be careful.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you dizzy?

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Have some water.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll make you some noodles.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My father couldn't swallow this breath.

42
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He used his attention to take Zhang Guanghua away.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Later, he accepted the gift and gave it to me.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But the atmosphere in the house

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
can't go back to the past.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The dishes are ready.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why don't you move the chopsticks?

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's not good.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Dad, you should eat more vegetables.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm full.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You two eat.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm busy.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm ashamed.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't mind him.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's all my fault.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
One day,

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Mom made braised pork.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I suddenly got a call.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It was Huo Zihong who called.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Grandpa Hong,

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
you mean

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the girl who was abducted came back by herself?

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Someone was watching her.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She was abducted secretly.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then, that couple got out of the car.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Before they died,

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
they told her the real situation.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
She moved back to the Luo Lake

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and lived in the front yard.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She found my phone on the phone.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, she tried to call me.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, my God.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why is it so dark?

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let me see.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's too similar.

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh, my God.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's the same.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Maybe it's snow and farmland.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Although it's the first time we meet,

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
we are not together.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We've never been apart.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Zihong, come here.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I was aware that

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was in a good mood.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It was a good thing.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It was a great joy.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It would completely change

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the reality of my family.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I thought about it.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I would choose a good day

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to push my sister out of the cage

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and give my parents a surprise.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then,

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
it was the day

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
we were born.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Zihong,

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you are so beautiful.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Get up.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm still a little scared.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's okay. Get up.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Is this your house?

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, no.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's my dad's cake.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Get up.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Don't be nervous.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Just relax.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Just take care of yourself.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Take off your clothes.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll be busy later.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't be scared.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll hide in the closet.

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is this okay?

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's okay.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Remember,

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you are Li Yaqi now.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I am Huo Zihong.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do what you should do later.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Go.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Go.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Go.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yaqi,

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
get me some hot water.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Here you are.

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What are you doing?

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Come on.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Give me some water.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You little...

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Are you okay?

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What should I do?

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's wrong with you?

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What are you doing?

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't come over here.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't come over here.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't!

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't come over here.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't!

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't come over here.

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't come over here.

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I was so scared.

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I thought,

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I can't go out.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't go out.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I was so scared that I was late.

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Later,

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I lost consciousness.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I lost my mind.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Later,

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
that person

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
was really in danger.

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
When I woke up,

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I heard him exit.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
When I got out of the closet,

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hongyi,

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
he appeared in front of me.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
My parents and my sister's brother.

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hongyi,

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
he was hanging in the middle of the room.

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hongyi,

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
that person was crazy.

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I went out in the basement.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I went out.

162
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't come over here.

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You must be kidding me.

164
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I was so in love with him.

165
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was so in love with him.

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I could use such a cruel method

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
to kill me and my family.

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I kept asking myself,

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
why did he do this to me?

170
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Did you call the police?

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Before,

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I was blind.

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I didn't think about anything.

175
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But later,

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I suddenly felt

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
that the soul was burning.

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I had to kill him.

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I had to kill this monk.

180
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I had to kill him when he was so cruel.

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I had to kill him.

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was blind.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hongyi,

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I was so in love with him.

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He didn't come home that night.

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He went to the inn.

187
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I followed him all the time.

188
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I bought a car and a car.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I was so in love with him.

190
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I was so in love with him.

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I was so calm.

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I was so in love with him.

193
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I didn't find out anything.

194
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I was so in love with him.

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was so in love with him.

196
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The last place to go

197
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
was the big hole.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This monk

199
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
was so cruel.

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He could even eat in peace.

201
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What are you doing?

202
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Put it down.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What are you doing?

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Find a way back.

205
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The enemy is still 3 minutes away.

206
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Please leave the area where the enemy is.

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The enemy is still 3 minutes away.

208
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Please leave the area where the enemy is.

209
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Please leave the area where the enemy is.

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Mom.

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Aqin.

212
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How could it be you?

213
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How could it be me?

214
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Why did you say it was me?

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Why did you kill me?

216
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why didn't you let me go?

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why did you kill them?

218
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Why?

219
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't want to kill you.

220
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I really don't want to kill you.

221
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't know why.

222
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why did you do this to me?

223
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You are lying.

224
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You are lying.

225
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Mom.

226
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You are a devil.

227
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Go to hell.

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Mom.

229
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Mom.

230
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I am not Zhang Guanghua's opponent.

231
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Later, I was not aware of the power of the main sword.

232
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But maybe it was my family who used me in their lives.

233
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Mom.

234
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Later, I was afraid of going up with the hula on the edge.

235
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I was there for a night.

236
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I thought about it for a night.

237
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I didn't kill anyone.

238
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But Zhang Guanghua's death was caused by my sister.

239
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And once I go back,

240
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I will tell the police everything.

241
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Then I will have a relationship with Zhang Guanghua.

242
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And I will not only be in that place at that age,

243
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but also be in the world.

244
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Even my parents will be told a lie.

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
After the dawn, the sun rises.

246
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I suddenly felt that God has given me a chance to be reborn.

247
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So, you are not afraid of death?

248
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I am afraid of death.

249
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So, you want to be named by the trade union?

250
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The murderer is dead.

251
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The family's revenge is also gone.

252
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Everything in the past is gone.

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You are a new identity.

254
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The beginning of the new is the best arrangement.

255
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You know the ending of Zhang Guanghua.

256
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You should ask Feng Hu to find out.

257
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I want to see someone die and see a corpse.

258
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
If I don't get a true faith, I won't be afraid.

259
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What about Uncle Li?

260
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Have you ever thought about him?

261
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No.

262
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Not at all.

263
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I just want to make Li Tan happy.

264
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So you never liked Uncle Li.

265
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is it just a play?

266
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Then you said the same thing to Uncle Li.

267
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I saw him leaving without saying a word.

268
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Aunt Hong, don't you think it's too much?

269
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He will think that his life is just a joke.

270
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's good that you lie to him.

271
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's because Li Tan has been in a lot of trouble for the rest of his life.

272
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't want him to waste his life on me.

273
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't want him to waste his life on me.

274
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

275
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I have to tell you what Aunt Hong should say.

276
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm tired.

277
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You can go now.

278
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm tired.

279
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You don't have to leave me.

280
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Or you won't be able to act.

281
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
He will know the truth.

282
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
He will know it too.

283
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It seems that the truth is revealed.

284
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But there is a reason.

285
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It seems that it doesn't help you.

286
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What are you going to do next?

287
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There is no result for the investigation.

288
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The result doesn't make people satisfied.

289
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Let's take a step forward.

290
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I think I should go back to the small business.

291
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

292
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You are more warm with Ping Ting.

293
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm happy to know you.

294
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
See you next time.

295
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

296
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

297
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

298
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

299
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

300
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

301
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

302
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

303
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

304
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

305
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

306
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

307
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

308
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

309
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

310
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

311
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

312
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

313
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

314
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

315
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

316
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm going to go back to the small business.

317
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You.

318
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm going to go back forever.

319
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I think that something is getting worse.

320
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I don't want to let you down now.

321
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You.

322
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I think that something is getting worse.

323
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I can't believe that because of my cowardice and escape,

324
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,600
so many people were in trouble and even had a hard time.

325
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,000
I feel ashamed for this easy life.

326
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,400
Hongyi decided to return to the Demon Lake and finish the unfinished business.

327
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Don't worry about me. I will take care of myself.

328
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:29,800
I should have this courage to face the past, the present and the future.

329
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,400
The Demon Lake

330
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Ping Ting.

331
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Ping Ting!

332
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Ping Ting.

333
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Tong Ying didn't let me go to her.

334
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
I still can't reply.

335
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Why are you still not answering my messages?

336
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Let's talk about the report.

337
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Hello?

338
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Hello, Dorgon.

339
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Sorry, I've been busy with the important things after I came back.

340
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,400
I didn't pay attention to the phone information.

341
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
It's okay. How is Ping Ting?

342
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
Not too good.

343
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Last night, I almost lost my Hu Lan.

344
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,400
I want to escape.

345
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
You have so much strength.

346
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Just like my uncle.

347
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,400
He is very energetic and he is a good person.

348
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Fortunately, there is nothing to worry about during the day.

349
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
But when it's night, the position will be weird.

350
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
The nurse just gave him a shock.

351
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
He should be fine now.

352
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Hu Lan is also a fake.

353
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,400
Then will the Demon Lake be able to eat the medicine?

354
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Yes.

355
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
It's not a long-term miracle.

356
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
But now, except for him,

357
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
I have no other way.

358
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Then...

359
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
What should we do?

360
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,400
It's okay.

361
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
He has a different body.

362
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
He looks like a different person.

363
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
He looks like he is reborn.

364
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Hello?

365
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Hello, Uncle Wan.

366
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Do you remember me? I'm Mu Dai.

367
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Yes, I do.

368
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Miss Mu.

369
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Let's talk about the rules first.

370
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,400
I need to pay first before I get the information.

371
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
Uncle Wan,

372
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
the most important thing is the client.

373
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Right?

374
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
I'm like a client in your life.

375
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Am I your potential client?

376
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Then I can introduce you to the client.

377
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
They have a big client.

378
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,400
You should keep me and talk to me about free service.

379
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
Shouldn't we?

380
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Yes, you should.

381
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,400
Miss Mu is right.

382
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Okay.

383
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,400
What do you want to talk to Uncle Wan about?

384
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
You know,

385
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,400
you have been to the Demon Lake, right?

386
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,400
You know this case is a bit weird.

387
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
I just want to say that you have sold Uncle Wan.

388
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,400
Do you know any reliable people?

389
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,400
For example,

390
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
you can study experts of supernatural phenomena.

391
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I'm thinking about finding experts in the medical field.

392
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Right?

393
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Hello, Uncle Wan.

394
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Are you still here?

395
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Gu Nishu.

396
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
This person is called Shen Mukun.

397
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
He is a super natural phenomenon research expert.

398
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
He is also very interested in the ancient mysterious and alien people.

399
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
He is known as the Kun Ge.

400
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
He is a great expert in the field of Tianwen.

401
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,400
He is a very good expert in ancient books.

402
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
He is a great expert in general.

403
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
You are right about this.

404
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Hello.

405
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
Hello, Mr. Shen.

406
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Uncle Kun.

407
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
Hello.

408
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,400
I am Mu Dai, a friend of Wan Fenghe.

409
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I introduced him to Wan.

410
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
He told me about it.

411
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
This little Wan is so true.

412
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,400
I've been busy with writing books recently.

413
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Well, since you are his friend,

414
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I'll give you five minutes.

415
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Okay.

416
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Okay.

417
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
That's the way it is.

418
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
I want to ask you

419
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
if you have ever encountered

420
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
that kind of person

421
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
in your usual research.

422
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
He is controlled by some kind of power.

423
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
He is also a bad guy

424
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
who is a little bit weak.

425
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,400
And he can also

426
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
make others suffer.

427
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,400
You are so vague.

428
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
Maybe I am a little bit lacking in expression.

429
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Listen to me.

430
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
You should ask me

431
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,400
what you are certain of.

432
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
What kind of person, what kind of person,

433
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,400
what kind of place, what kind of time,

434
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
what kind of place.

435
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
What kind of person is different from others?

436
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
That's the way it is.

437
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
You just said

438
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
human skin.

439
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
Yes, yes, yes.

440
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
They all have a human skin on them.

441
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,400
They are quite fair.

442
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Fair?

443
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
How many, how many,

444
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
do you have a size?

445
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,400
I have.

446
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Let me see.

447
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
23.5 cm long,

448
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
5 cm wide.

449
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
The step is not correct.

450
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
This is a long strip.

451
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
This size is

452
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
quite long.

453
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
I think it's

454
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
quite special.

455
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
It's just a very strong heart.

456
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Very special.

457
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
When you look at your reaction,

458
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
you don't read at all.

459
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
You don't even know the history.

460
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Right?

461
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,400
The size of the ancient cemeteries

462
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
is determined by the times.

463
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Long strip is one strip.

464
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
According to the current volume,

465
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
the size is about 23.5 cm.

466
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,400
23.5 cm x 5 cm.

467
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
That is the size of

468
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
all the cemeteries in the cemeteries.

469
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
You

470
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
told him

471
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
that the capacity

472
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
can be

473
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
changed.

474
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Then

475
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
make people

476
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
feel at ease.

477
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
Do some

478
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
work.

479
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
Right.

480
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
People think

481
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
that

482
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,400
making people feel at ease

483
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
is

484
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
23.5 cm.

485
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
I have heard

486
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
this story.

487
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
I have.

488
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
I have.

489
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
I have recorded it.

490
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
Right.

491
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
But my brain

492
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
can't adjust to that channel.

493
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
I...

494
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
I have to go and check the notes.

495
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,400
I have to go and check the notes.

496
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Okay.

497
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Wait for me.

498
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Where is the little hole?

499
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
What?

500
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
I am the wooden belt.

501
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Right.

502
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
So you call it the little hole?

503
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
If

504
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
I still talk to you

505
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,400
and

506
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
make you feel at ease,

507
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
it means

508
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
he really

509
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
treats you as a friend.

510
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Right?

511
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Yes.

512
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,400
As you live,

513
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,400
you have to

514
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
change your life

515
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
and

516
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
change your heart.

517
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
You have to

518
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
change your life

519
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
and change your heart.

520
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
I am hungry.

521
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
I am going to

522
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
change my heart.

523
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,400
Change your heart?

524
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Let's

525
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
start.

526
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
You said

527
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
the person

528
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
called Shen Guen

529
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
heard this thing?

530
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
He

531
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
posted a record

532
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
on his laptop

533
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
more than ten years ago.

534
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
The detective?

535
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
The image of the description.

536
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
What is he

537
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
from?

538
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
From

539
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
what person's mouth

540
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
knows this thing?

541
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
It seems to be...

542
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
I found it!

543
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
I found it!

544
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Something happened to you!

545
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
How did you

546
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
put the light on?

547
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
How did you know?

548
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
Stop it!

549
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
Bring the right hand!

550
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Luo Xiao Dao!

551
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Hurry up!

552
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Stop it!

553
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Luo Xiao Dao!

554
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Luo Xiao Dao!

555
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Luo Xiao Dao!

556
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Be gentle!

557
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Be gentle!

558
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Luo Xiao Dao!

559
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Hello?

560
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
What happened just now?

561
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Nothing.

562
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
I just fell down

563
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
and got scared.

564
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
Who's coming to pick me up?

565
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
What are you doing?

566
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
Why is your voice

567
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
so far away?

568
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I'll be closer.

569
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Are you sure?

570
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
Nothing.

571
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
By the way,

572
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
what did you say

573
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,400
about Shen Guen?

574
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Nothing.

575
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
He was in the north

576
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
ten years ago.

577
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
He heard it

578
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
in the tourist agency in the north.

579
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
It's a rumor.

580
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Mom.

581
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
What are you doing?

582
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Your blood is almost dried.

583
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
You can't do this.

584
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
You can't do this.

585
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
You can't do this.

586
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Okay, okay.

587
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Take it.

588
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
You're so deep.

589
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
What are you going to do

590
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
if you get infected?

591
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Are you hurt?

592
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Is it serious?

593
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
It's okay.

594
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
I'm just skin-drying.

595
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
I'm a big doctor.

596
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
What's wrong?

597
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Ping Ting.

598
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
It's serious.

599
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
She's going to be infected.

600
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
And

601
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
she's not a normal person.

602
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
She actually

603
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
uses strategy.

604
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Strategy?

605
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Yes.

606
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
She's going to break the light first.

607
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Then she'll be on the roof.

608
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm glad I got the chance.

609
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
What are you going to do now?

610
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
I just hit her with a real machine.

611
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Then the nurse gave it to me.

612
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Ping Ting is in this state.

613
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
I don't dare to let anyone get close to her.

614
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Do you need help?

615
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
It's okay.

616
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
She's like this.

617
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
You can't find anyone.

618
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
I can.

619
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,400
You?

620
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Forget it.

621
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Ping Ting is in danger now.

622
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Luo Ren.

623
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Can't you see me?

624
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Or can't you see my skills?

625
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Now she's getting older.

626
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
You're injured again.

627
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Ping Ting is sick again.

628
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
You want to find someone to help her.

629
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
You're not just a helper.

630
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
You're a member of the help.

631
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Who do you think is more suitable for me?

632
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
It's not suitable.

633
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
You're still in the army.

634
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
It's troublesome.

635
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Who said I was going to help with the medical care?

636
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
I have a condition.

637
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
What condition?

638
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
You know I'm in the army.

639
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
Then you can get the ticket for the return.

640
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
There's no problem with the ticket.

641
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
You have to keep it.

642
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
No problem.

643
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Mu Tai.

644
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Thank you.

645
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
We're friends.

646
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,400
We can't be friends.

647
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
You're so nice.

648
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
See you later.

649
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm here.

650
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
I brought a box.

651
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Let me do it.

652
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Okay, thank you.

653
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Luozhan.

654
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Sorry.

655
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,400
I can't pick you up.

656
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,400
I need to go to the army.

657
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
It's okay.

658
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
You're a member of the help.

659
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
I don't like it.

660
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
I'll give you a treat.

661
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,400
It's still slippery when you change your medicine in the morning.

662
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,400
I know.

663
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
You're so good at it.

664
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,400
I'm so exaggerated.

665
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Let's go.

666
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Pingting.

667
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Here.

668
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
This is a new one.

669
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
This is the opening.

670
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
The food is usually delivered from this hole.

671
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
The food is always delicious.

672
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Here.

673
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Pingting.

674
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
What's wrong with him?

675
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
He hasn't bathed in the morning for many days.

676
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
I should get back to work.

677
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Pingting.

678
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
Pingting.

679
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,400
This is Sister Mu Dai.

680
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
She's here to help you.

681
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
I'm sure she'll be okay.

682
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Let's go.

683
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
Let's go.

684
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Is it fun?

685
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Is the water cold?

686
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Pingting.

687
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Come here.

688
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
I'll get you some water.

689
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Pingting.

690
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Pingting.

691
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Pingting.

692
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Pingting.

693
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Pingting.

694
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,400
Pingting.

695
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Pingting.

696
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Pingting.

697
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Pingting.

698
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Pingting.
