00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 1

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 2

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 3

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Episode 4

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Episode 5

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hurry up. I'm not feeling well.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's wrong with your hand?

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Nothing.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sorry.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You guys are just being silly.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You want to leave without even apologizing?

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It happened so suddenly.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Shouldn't we be forgiven for our mistakes?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Mistakes?

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You said you saw the wrong person when you were in the prison.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What did you say when you were in the prison?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He's the one who killed the criminal.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Who gave you the confidence?

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay. Just say it.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're just being silly.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Forget it.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why should I?

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have no friends.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm wronged by you.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've hurt you.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Can you take responsibility?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're just being silly.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm not even going to fight.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm going to sue you.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Just wait.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're such a fool.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You didn't even say anything.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How could you be so stupid?

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You want to fight?

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come on.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What's wrong?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't be so serious.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Stop!

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you guys leaving?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Come and visit me.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why are you stopping me?

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You're just being silly.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm so mad.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What's wrong?

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What are you talking about?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The police just reminded me of something important.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Why should I chase him?

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He broke my heart with fire.

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Can I not chase him?

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So why did he break your heart?

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He told me he had a dream.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He dreamed of...

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He dreamed of Zhang Tong.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I said it again.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's my fault.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I said that the two of you were the same.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You didn't kill him.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He was so innocent.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He broke my heart with fire.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Can I not chase him?

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's wrong with his wound?

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He...

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This is it.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I chased him for a long time.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was bleeding.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I pressed him on the ground.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He was so hurt.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
His face was burned by a fire.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It was like a burn.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It was just a scar.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What?

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There was a scar on his face?

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think it was a snake.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Snake?

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Think about it.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The 13000 and the wooden things.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They said they were the murderers.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They were the murderers.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They were so cruel.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They were so mean.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Son.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Forbidden words, epiphyllate word.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Bad不過為 salty.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hearticism.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you mean the planting of the heart?

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's giving you a fine idea.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's afraid of blood.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's why we need to narrow it down.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What do you mean by the popper's blood Cotton and Wuyi?

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,460
And we won't lose them..

101
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,620
You can't lose that person.

102
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,100
You can't lose every one of you now.

103
00:04:45,100 --> 00:05:01,780
You proved to be wrong.

104
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,480
Hello.

105
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,160
The enemy is on the left side.

106
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,980
The rest of the bodies are on the right side.

107
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,220
On the left,

108
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,600
a southern Damog —

109
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,440
its main objective is to find a side插.

110
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,680
No one saw that.

111
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,760
gostog

112
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:29,520
stair up

113
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Why are you here?

114
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
You're not used to it?

115
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Someone helped me to walk around.

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Is Xinjian on the market?

117
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
It's weird.

118
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Xinjian is not in her body.

119
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
She has no physical traces.

120
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
But she was afraid of the blood of 13,000 before.

121
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
I'm a little confused.

122
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
We'll figure it out.

123
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Find out.

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,520
You're in a good mood.

125
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Or what?

126
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Isn't it like this every time?

127
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
From morning to evening,

128
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,520
find out the truth and find out the truth.

129
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Come on.

130
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Let's eat more.

131
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
You're so thin.

132
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Let's eat more so we can grow taller.

133
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
Come on.

134
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Let's have another bite.

135
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Have another bite.

136
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Mom, I'm hungry.

137
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Are you a hungry ghost?

138
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Did you just have lunch?

139
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
I'm hungry.

140
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Look over there.

141
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Go over there.

142
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Go over there.

143
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Go.

144
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
I've been running away all day.

145
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm so...

146
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Some kids are the ones who are heartless.

147
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Some are running away.

148
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Why?

149
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Maybe...

150
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
they have a lot of problems.

151
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Problems and love are all about one thing.

152
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
To love someone,

153
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
no matter how troublesome you are,

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
you're their treasure.

155
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
To love someone,

156
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
no matter how obedient you are,

157
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
you're always in trouble.

158
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
Get out!

159
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Get out!

160
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Get out!

161
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Here, have your favorite fries.

162
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Yes.

163
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Here.

164
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Here.

165
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Did you find your mom?

166
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Someone told me she died.

167
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
I heard she jumped to death.

168
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
After what happened recently,

169
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
I'm afraid I've heard these words.

170
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Yes.

171
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
Mo Lian,

172
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
do you need help?

173
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
If I'm all alone,

174
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
I'd be better than you.

175
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Don't forget,

176
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
we have a big house.

177
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
It's called Manfeng Lake.

178
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
I don't remember her name.

179
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
She loves wearing red and high heels,

180
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
living in a building in the Old City.

181
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
But that building was already wasted.

182
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,520
Then she got sick and fell ill.

183
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,520
She was so sick that she couldn't take care of her doctor.

184
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
That's better.

185
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
It's not a big day.

186
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
It's not hard to get in from the hospital.

187
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
But, Mu Dai,

188
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
have you ever thought about

189
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
why you found her?

190
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
Do I need to know?

191
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
I mean,

192
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
you want to find her

193
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
and make her your girlfriend?

194
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
No.

195
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I just

196
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
want to go back to the place

197
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
and see my future.

198
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
I asked her

199
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
why she was so hungry

200
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
and wanted to get dirty clothes

201
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,520
and get water in the ground.

202
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
I ate very little every time.

203
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
I loved more than other kids.

204
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
I would get water in the ground

205
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,520
but it was too much.

206
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Love is so much,

207
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
it's so much in the stomach.

208
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
But these four words

209
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
are still very sad.

210
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Every child, mother,

211
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
why can't they

212
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
have the same love as them?

213
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
I don't understand.

214
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,520
I won't take your hand off.

215
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Okay, I'm going home.

216
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Are you having fun today?

217
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Yes.

218
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Then you should go home.

219
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm going to play with my son.

220
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Okay.

221
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
No, I'm going to play with him.

222
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
There is no newbie on Ma Chao.

223
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
It seems that he is also right.

224
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Because if Ma Chao is a survivor,

225
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,520
then he is too weak

226
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
to compare with the previous one.

227
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Look, you know it very well.

228
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
You are so good at playing with your brother.

229
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
You can't beat the newbie.

230
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm called Jin Zhu.

231
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Is it newbie?

232
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
Newbie?

233
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Xi You Ji has said that

234
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Sun Wukong can become

235
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
many of himself

236
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
but he can't compare with the previous one.

237
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
So, is there

238
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
a newbie on Ma Chao?

239
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
But after your blood

240
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
is not enough to stand,

241
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
so the original form is closed.

242
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
What you said is quite interesting.

243
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Then when will this newbie

244
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
be released?

245
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
This is the key.

246
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
The thing about the wooden belt

247
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,520
seems to have a plan and a plan.

248
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
And the thing about the 13000

249
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
can't be arranged in advance.

250
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Then it's temporary.

251
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
The scene arrangement.

252
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Then let's go back and check the monitoring.

253
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Maybe we can find some clues.

254
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
If the red sand is the right one,

255
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
then should we

256
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
try to make 13000 yesterday

257
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
and bring those people with wooden belts?

258
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Come on.

259
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
Thank you.

260
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
I know what I said

261
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
before.

262
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I just want to ask you a new question.

263
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Don't worry.

264
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
I won't hurt you.

265
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Okay.

266
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Who did this?

267
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Have you seen them?

268
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
I've never seen these three girls.

269
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Think about it yourself.

270
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
I really have no idea.

271
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
You said you've seen them last time.

272
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Last time?

273
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Do you still remember when you were on the bridge?

274
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
How many girls did you see?

275
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Do you still remember

276
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
the face of the girl?

277
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Why didn't you remember

278
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
the name of the girl?

279
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Then maybe

280
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Zong fire?

281
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Maybe they understood

282
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
that you killed her.

283
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
So,

284
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,520
what you see in the matter

285
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
is technologies

286
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
and provided such an important clue.

287
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
We've already known about the recent situation.

288
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,520
You can sign here and go back.

289
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Thank you for your cooperation.

290
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
If there's any problem,

291
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
I'll contact you again.

292
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Great!

293
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Ma Chou has been monitored by the police.

294
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Just wait and see.

295
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
If you want me to say it,

296
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
my little sister has already been punished.

297
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
I'll give you a happy ending.

298
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Ma Chou, are you okay?

299
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,520
It doesn't matter if you're in trouble.

300
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
It's only a matter of a thousand and three.

301
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I hope you have good news.

302
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
What good news?

303
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
How is it?

304
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
How else can it be?

305
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
The traffic police has all the rules.

306
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
They don't let you read anything.

307
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,520
But who am I?

308
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
I'll immediately change my strategy.

309
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
I'll use this sharp tip of the electric breaker

310
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
to find one by one.

311
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
You're right.

312
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
We have new employees.

313
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Take it.

314
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Zai Ting.

315
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Did you see that?

316
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Everyone is watching.

317
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
It's this woman.

318
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
I'm not writing anything.

319
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,520
If she really doesn't write anything,

320
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
she won't even look at the cover.

321
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
She's obviously looking at it.

322
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
She's leaving the post.

323
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Is there any other ten-point?

324
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Stop!

325
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Don't you see?

326
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,520
I'm not going to let you go.

327
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I'm not going to let you go.

328
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
I'm not going to let you go.

329
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
I'm not going to let you go.

330
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Stop!

331
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Don't you see her?

332
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
She's wearing a red dress.

333
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
She's so smart.

334
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Yes.

335
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
She's so good with her.

336
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
She's so handsome.

337
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
It's really weird.

338
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Do you think this new hairstyle

339
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
is made of red?

340
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
It's made by my mother.

341
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
Wudai.

342
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
It's been two years since your mother's mother's death.

343
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
And she's been in the construction company.

344
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
She's not even able to see the face.

345
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
Are you sure?

346
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
It's just a feeling.

347
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
She's wearing red heels and shoes.

348
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
She wears red shoes.

349
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,520
And

350
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
I don't know how to see the face.

351
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
But when I see her,

352
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
I can't help but feel like I can't stand it.

353
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,520
Do I still need to do something?

354
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,520
You've done a great job.

355
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
No more.

356
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,520
You're going to say it so soon?

357
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
But

358
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
I'm not done yet.

359
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,520
You can't leave the game alone.

360
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
And others are waiting for the game.

361
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Others?

362
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Those

363
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
are the same as me.

364
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Then will I see them?

365
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Yes.

366
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Because you're not lonely.

367
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,520
One day,

368
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
I'll never be separated.

369
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,520
DINGUims

370
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
Ding Guohua

371
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,520
blood-stained interaction cremation

372
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,520
and high blood cycle around the body

373
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,520
I give you a duty to turn to the bookstore.

374
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
The bookstore?

375
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,520
Such a rich doctor went to the bookstore?

376
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
No.

377
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Look down.

378
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Your mother hurt her.

379
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,520
She resigned after a long time.

380
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,520
But she didn't seek your mother's responsibility.

381
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,520
And your mother's surname.

382
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm sorry.

383
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,520
She's dying.

384
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Will she know my mother's whereabouts?

385
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,520
She must be with your mother.

386
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Don't worry.

387
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,520
She's a good doctor.

388
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
Is Dr. Ding Guohua here?

389
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Who is it?

390
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
What do you want?

391
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
You're Dr. Ding Guohua, right?

392
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
What do you want?

393
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I have some medical information.

394
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Oh, you're sick.

395
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,520
I'll go over there.

396
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Sit down.

397
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Which one is sick?

398
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I'll go with my mother.

399
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Who?

400
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
I'll go with my mother.

401
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
How long have you been sick?

402
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
A long time.

403
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Then, where is your heart?

404
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,520
You told her that Ling Zhuang had a heart attack.

405
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
It's a bad sign.

406
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
What's his name?

407
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
He's Xiang Silan.

408
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,520
You told her that, right?

409
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,520
Do you know where he is?

410
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,520
I don't know.

411
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Xiang Silan.

412
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Ling Zhuang had a heart attack.

413
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
He was shot from the top.

414
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
It's okay.

415
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I've cured him.

416
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
I've cured him.

417
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
You're not a good doctor.

418
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
You're a bad doctor.

419
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,520
You're a bad doctor.

420
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Be careful.

421
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
I can't talk.

422
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
I can't talk.

423
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,520
I can't talk.

424
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Dad.

425
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Dad.

426
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Dad.

427
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
I'm his daughter.

428
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Dad.

429
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Dad.

430
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
It's me.

431
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Dad.

432
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Actually,

433
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
he's always been a patient.

434
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
I'm busy with work.

435
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I can only take care of him by his side.

436
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
He's not sick enough.

437
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,520
He's always confused.

438
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
When he's confused,

439
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
he likes to treat people.

440
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,520
We're all confused.

441
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,520
When did he get sick?

442
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,520
About 20 years ago.

443
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
At that time,

444
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,520
he started to mislead all the patients.

445
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
He said that

446
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,520
he could only control his illness.

447
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
He wanted to lie.

448
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,520
He was a famous doctor.

449
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,520
So he mislead many people.

450
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
Including your mom.

451
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I want to resign.

452
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,520
I told you.

453
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Your situation will get worse.

454
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
I'm doing my best.

455
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
You're doing your best.

456
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
You mean,

457
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
you can't cure him?

458
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Your illness

459
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
is not good enough

460
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
for the medical examination.

461
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Mom.

462
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
It's okay.

463
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,520
It's okay.

464
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
I can't cure him.

465
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
What happened next?

466
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
Did you find out

467
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
what happened next?

468
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Actually, one night,

469
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
my dad suddenly found out about this.

470
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,520
He was very scared.

471
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
He said he wanted to take all the medical equipment

472
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,520
and find the hospital.

473
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
But the next day,

474
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
he suddenly changed.

475
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,520
He was so cunning.

476
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
He was so mean.

477
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,520
He even wanted to lie.

478
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
I was too young at that time.

479
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
I couldn't help it.

480
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,520
I could only watch him

481
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
with a serious look.

482
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,520
He was so mean.

483
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
My mom was the most serious one.

484
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
He was treated by the hospital.

485
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
He was finally ill.

486
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
One day,

487
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
my dad...

488
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Did you see his face?

489
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
Did you see his face?

490
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
Did you see his face?

491
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,520
What else can we do?

492
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
He is so strict.

493
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
He can't see anyone.

494
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
He must tell me the truth.

495
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
If you don't, you can't leave.

496
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Don't go.

497
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
Don't go.

498
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
Don't look at me.

499
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
You can't look at me.

500
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
You can't look at me.

501
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,520
What do you want to eat in the restaurant?

502
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
How much do you want to eat?

503
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
You can eat whatever you want.

504
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
You want us to follow you

505
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
to the end.

506
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
You are so mean.

507
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
We are going to...

508
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Did you see that?

509
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Did you see that?

510
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
You are still a girl.

511
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,520
You can't take the pot.

512
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
What are you doing?

513
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
You are not talking.

514
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
That's right.

515
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
You are going to catch me?

516
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
You are going to catch me?

517
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Let go of me.

518
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Let go of me.

519
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,520
I have a mouth in my mouth.

520
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
I have a blood in my mouth.

521
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
I am going to...

522
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Miss, Miss.

523
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Miss, Miss.

524
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Miss, Miss.

525
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Calm down.

526
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,520
There is something wrong here.

527
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
There is something wrong.

528
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
I don't know.

529
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I don't know.

530
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
I don't know.

531
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
There is something wrong.

532
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
There is something wrong.

533
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I will find another doctor for you.

534
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
I will cure you.

535
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Let go of me.

536
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Let go of me.

537
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
Let go of me.

538
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
This is not a rumor.

539
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Don't get angry.

540
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
Don't get angry.

541
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Go back.

542
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
I will go back.

543
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
I will go back.

544
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
Go back.

545
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,520
What are you doing?

546
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,520
What are you doing?

547
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Go away.

548
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Go.

549
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Let go of me.

550
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Let go of me.

551
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
I saw the emergency.

552
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
He was busy with his business.

553
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
The doctor told me

554
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
that he had a large skin on his back.

555
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
But my dad was just bitten.

556
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Then,

557
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
you haven't seen him?

558
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
After a long time,

559
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
I saw a person who looks like

560
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
a person from the same color

561
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
in the Teng Ma Hotel I went to.

562
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
But it shouldn't be.

563
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Because his skin is good.

564
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
Teng Ma Hotel

565
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
is a very famous hotel.

566
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
Teng Ma Hotel.

567
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
Teng Ma Hotel.

568
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,520
We use the moon to check the signs.

569
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
What's wrong?

570
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,520
What's wrong?

571
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Where are you?

572
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Where are you?

573
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
There was a wind.

574
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
I saw a big head

575
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
floating with it.

576
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
You were in a fantasy, right?

577
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
It's impossible.

578
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Did you see it?

579
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,520
It's too much.

580
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
It's too much.

581
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
You thought you were in a TV show?

582
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,520
Even if you were in a TV show,

583
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
you were in a comedy show.

584
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
You are so scary.

585
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,520
You can't control it.

586
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
I'm afraid.

587
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
I'm afraid.

588
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
I'm so nervous.

589
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Look.

590
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
This is the Big Sister of Wuyi Pavilion.

591
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
I didn't expect that

592
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Big Sister of Wuyi Pavilion

593
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
would have a youthful moon like you.

594
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
You are so old.

595
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
You are here to check the signs.

596
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
Did you find Song Tie, Ma Chao?

597
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
And the 13,000 people.

598
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Yes.

599
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Ma Chao is here.

600
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Song Tie.

601
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
This one.

602
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,520
Liu Yile.

603
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
I remember it clearly.

604
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Liu Yile.

605
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
It was the one that was in my pocket.

606
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I know.

607
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,520
People who came to the Ma Pavilion

608
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
were blown by the wind.

609
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,520
The wind is important.

610
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Wind?

611
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
Our new sign is also

612
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,520
a strange wind.

613
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,520
It's a kind of mark.

614
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
People who came to the Ma Pavilion

615
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
thought they had a heart attack.

616
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
But the result was a heart attack.

617
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,520
A heart attack was planted.

618
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,520
A heart attack?

619
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
I have an idea

620
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
to trigger the shooting.

621
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Don't tell me

622
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
that the Ma Pavilion

623
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,520
is like the big group.

624
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
It's like a group of people

625
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
kneeling down there.

626
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,520
It's quite suspicious.

627
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,520
What kind of mark is this?

628
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Just put me in it.

629
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Here it is.

630
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,520
It's strange.

631
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
It's orange.

632
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Other places are all black.

633
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
It's like a big group of people.

634
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
It's all black.

635
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Canyang Hua, down!

636
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
Chase!

637
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Are you okay?

638
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
No, master.

639
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
I'm fine.

640
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Don't go.

641
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Wudan, where are you?

642
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
I'm missing.

643
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
I have a distance limit.

644
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
Don't worry.

645
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
He might come back.

646
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Let's go.

647
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
Okay, let's go.

648
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
What's wrong?

649
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
It's a storm.

650
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
A storm?

651
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,520
No, it's not a normal storm.

652
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
My bones are cold.

653
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,520
I have to practice the spine.

654
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
I have to do it.

655
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Master, I'll help you.

656
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Okay.

657
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,520
Master, I'm really sorry.

658
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
If I'm right,

659
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,520
the Ma Pavilion is a cover.

660
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
It's like a cold storm.

661
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
It affects others.

662
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Tell me quickly.

663
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,520
It's like a virus.

664
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
A virus?

665
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,520
It's not a normal thing.

666
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,520
It's a chance to use it.

667
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,520
A new virus?

668
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
A new virus?

669
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
Then it's okay.

670
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
A new virus.

671
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Let's avoid it.

672
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Yes, it's weird.

673
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Why are you here?

674
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Do you think

675
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
the spine is cold and the body is numb?

676
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Much better.

677
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,520
What virus did you say?

678
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
What's the effect?

679
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,520
The third wave is blind.

680
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
It's a strong version.

681
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
The third wave is blind.

682
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
The person who is blind is blind.

683
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
It's like a blind person.

684
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
It's like a blind person.

685
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,520
I have to understand it.

686
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,520
As far as I know,

687
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
there are many people on the scene

688
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
when the car accident happened.

689
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
In the South,

690
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
there are two people

691
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
who came to the Ma Pavilion.

692
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
They were affected.

693
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Xiang Salan is also on the scene.

694
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
He invited these people.

695
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Although they don't know each other,

696
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
it's not possible that they can't make it.

697
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,520
But they gave the same evidence.

698
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
The same is true for the wood-towering.

699
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
It's even higher.

700
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
You are still on the scene.

701
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
The wood-towering is not on the bridge.

702
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Xiang Salan and the wood-towering

703
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
can have the same effect.

704
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
It affects them.

705
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,520
So, Brother Luo said,

706
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
my master

707
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,520
is like a sudden Chu.

708
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
The feeling is the impact.

709
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
The poison is not dead.

710
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
You let him go.

711
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,520
But he still uses this method.

712
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
You are wrong.

713
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Mu Dai left home for so many years.

714
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Xiang Salan,

715
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
he doesn't want to be his real son.

716
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
The reason he is dealing with him

717
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
is because he is exposed.

718
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
When did I expose him?

719
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,520
You and Zhang Tong have been here.

720
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Zhang Tong is in trouble.

721
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
But you are not.

722
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Xiang Salan must be very dangerous.

723
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
And you.

724
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
Your blood is on the Ma Pavilion.

725
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
You are exposed.

726
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
I am exposed too?

727
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
So, he is dealing with us in a big way?

728
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
You said

729
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
he is like a machine gun.

730
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
I think so too.

731
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
Those who are curious about the body

732
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
will be attacked by the master

733
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
and be hit by the mark.

734
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
So many years.

735
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
So many names.

736
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Xiang Salan

737
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
must be walking in the county

738
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
and pretending to be harmless.

739
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
But he knows

740
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
what he said when he left.

741
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,520
After these words are spoken,

742
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
he will become a evil.

743
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,520
The Ma Pavilion

744
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
The Ma Pavilion

745
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
The Ma Pavilion

746
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
Coming.

747
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Where?

748
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Where?

749
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
What is the location?

750
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
We will go to the point.

751
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Come with me.

752
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
Jiajuan, Jiajuan's blood is like this.

753
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
There are still 100 meters left.

754
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
50 meters.

755
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
40 meters.

756
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
30 meters.

757
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
20 meters.

758
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
10 meters.

759
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Yes.

760
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,520
The Ma Pavilion

761
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520

763
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I didn't expect that he left.

764
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,520
This game is more fun.

769
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520

No!

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,520
Love is so much.

778
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
The old man is so much.

779
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
But these four words

780
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
still hurt people.
