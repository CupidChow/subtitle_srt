1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 3

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's quite fat, and the stew is good too.

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Fatty, we're eating quite well.

5
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No need to add any more dishes.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What dishes?

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She's my soul mate.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The life-saving Qiang Xin Zhen.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The lighthouse in my life.

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If she has a phone, I'll take her to my bed.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Cang Tang Hua, where's Yang Hong Sha?

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She's out shopping.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Then get in the car first.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We'll go to her house.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I promised her house.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll stay there for a few days.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I got a call.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My master is seriously ill.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're a grandchild.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Can you go in?

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He has to be the one to light the fire.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll go.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's go.

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Finally, I'm free.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Unimaginable.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The iron knife department has a new spirit.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
They won't let me get in the train.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I've been with Third Uncle for a few days.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I lied to you.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Cai Huo!

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Listen to me.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, I'm leaving.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I haven't given him a name yet.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So don't yell at him.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Otherwise, it won't be easy to change.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How pretty.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have no time to go see my master.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't be anxious.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let me hug you.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Is it dangerous to go to Hei Sha?

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Tell me the truth.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's a bit dangerous.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Take me to my master.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay?

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Lu Xiao Tao.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You have to be okay.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Put on some lipstick.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Fight with someone.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Be quick.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't let anything happen.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you hear me?

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I heard you.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You have to keep me safe every day.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Where you go, where you sleep,

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
you have to tell me.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do you hear me?

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I heard you.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
After my master's poem is done,

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll go to you.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No matter where you are,

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
no matter how much he talks about you,

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
do you hear me?

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I heard you.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't go.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We love each other and look forward to it.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We walked through all the times together.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Cai Ye Wang, take her away.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Take her away, Lu Xiao.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I just want to hug you slowly.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Master, have a drink.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I drink.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You drink.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I drink.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What's wrong with you?

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's wrong?

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nothing.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I know you all dislike me.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Master,

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm happy that you can take me with you this time.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not from a rich family.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't expect to be invited to our master's house.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll go and see what the door looks like.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, what's your background?

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't hide it from us.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I heard it.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My ancestors were rebels.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They were mixed with the soil and starry sky.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm the descendant of the rebels.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's right.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What era is it?

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You can't even come out.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What does your ancestors have to do with you?

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You have to evaluate a person

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and see what he is like as a person, right?

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When did you come out?

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's what you said.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you don't think so,

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
why are you hiding it from me?

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's all Luo Ren's fault.

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Luo Ren didn't tell you because he was afraid you would think too much.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Luo Ren, why didn't you tell Cao Fan?

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, why didn't you tell him?

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Even if he chased the starry sky on the team,

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
you wouldn't suspect him, would you?

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're right.

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm the one who helped him think of things.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm the one who's thinking of things.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll have a brother in my heart.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He's right.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I didn't think too much.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You didn't think too much?

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Luo Ren thought too much.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Luo Ren thought too much and thought I would think too much.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So he hid it from me.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I really thought too much.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's the way it is.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Master,

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
do you think I'm a good teacher?

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What do you think Master Tai's students are interested in?

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Their character, appearance, or star?

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Master probably values the original method more.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Original method?

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
About eight years ago,

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I had a friend named Wen Wen.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She had an accident.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I felt bad about it.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then my red dress told me to go to the temple to listen to the sound of the rice.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It was there.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I met the master who came to travel.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Luo San,

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I dreamed about Wen Wen again last night.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She doesn't blame me at all.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I feel so sad.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If only I could be with Wukong.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I could help him.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Little girl,

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you said you wanted to learn martial arts.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why?

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
My good friend was killed by a bad person.

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If I could learn martial arts,

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I could protect him.

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What about now?

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Do you still want to learn?

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes.

148
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I thought Master was very close to me.

149
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Like red dress.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I felt so sad.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know why.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Then I told Master all my feelings.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You lost?

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes.

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're so lucky.

156
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
People say the ancestors gave food to the ancestors.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But you didn't.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You just put the spoon in your mouth.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
My master always wanted to have a disciple.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He saw me crying and said he wanted to learn martial arts.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He wanted to have a disciple.

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He wanted to have a disciple.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I wanted to learn.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's the principle.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're still the same.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're so lucky.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't think I have one.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why don't you?

169
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do you want to buy a chicken?

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why would I buy that?

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to eat chicken.

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Then why did you want to buy a chicken today?

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I didn't think much.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I saw the scenery and the environment.

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I saw his eyes.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I thought I had to buy it.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This is the principle.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Do you understand?

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I may be a little lucky.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If I were lucky,

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I would only have a principle with this animal.

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't have a principle with Master.

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You have one with Master.

184
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If you don't have a principle,

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
can we meet Master Tai again?

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're so smart.

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm so lucky.

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm so lucky.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He's just going to sit in my car.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you want him to fly outside,

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
you don't mind if he can catch up.

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
How about we put him in the car?

193
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He's so handsome in a high-speed car.

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
A super car.

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
How about we see where it's convenient later

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and buy him a cage to put in the back seat?

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay.

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll go with you.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's dangerous, okay?

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's okay.

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You guys are good.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hello, Jinwo.

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm on my way.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We'll meet tomorrow night.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The plan has changed. I've reached the interest.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I need to send the letter and the transfer.

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Tell them I'm on my own.

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Why?

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
To report to the police.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Are you okay, Xiaobao?

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What do you mean, Luo Ren?

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He woke up after he had a cough.

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Wait for me.

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Is Xiao Yu in the police?

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Is she really in the police?

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes. She has a passport and used one of them.

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I know you're out there.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll arrange for you to go home.

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Where is she now?

221
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can you find her?

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll try. She just got here.

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There shouldn't be any big movements.

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But she'll find you sooner or later.

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
After all, you hurt her eyes.

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's good.

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Let's go find her.

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll let you know when I get the letter.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And,

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
take care of your son.

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What do you mean?

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Find a way to protect your girlfriend.

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't let Li Bao have a chance to use her to deal with us.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Peanuts, melons, fresh fruit.

235
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Is there anything you need?

236
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I got a letter.

237
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Honglei, where's the next stop?

238
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Next stop?

239
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Lamping Mountain. What's up?

240
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll pick you up at the next stop.

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I have something to talk to you.

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Just keep doing your work.

243
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We'll meet at the last stop.

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Hong Sha and the others are back in Lixi.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
They can't get on the bus.

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So I booked a ride for them.

247
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm afraid this is going to be a pain.

248
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're going back to Yunlin with me?

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What about your business?

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's a long story.

251
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay.

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We'll go back and see our teacher.

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
How's the clothes?

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The clothes are nice.

255
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm a person.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Shu Bai, what do you want to talk to me about?

257
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I want to talk to you about my past.

258
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
At that time,

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I went abroad with my family.

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
After a few battles,

261
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I went to Black Desert.

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You know Black Desert.

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's a mess there.

264
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If you can't go there,

265
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you can stay there forever.

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
At the beginning,

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I was so poor.

269
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I could only work hard.

270
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
My boss knew my background.

271
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
He always worked hard.

272
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He even gave me the hardest work.

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I was so tired for a long time.

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I couldn't eat well.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I finally fell ill.

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I should have come back at that time.

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But I was so angry.

278
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
When he came back,

279
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
he laughed at me.

280
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Then someone introduced me to boxing.

281
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Boxing?

282
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Boxing competition?

283
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Have you watched fighting games?

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
When someone was blocking,

285
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
you were fighting in the ring.

286
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You were beaten to death.

287
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I practiced a lot of fighting skills.

288
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But I still loved it.

289
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Black Boxing is a high-quality sport.

290
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So even if you can't cut the ground,

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
you can still do it.

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I think

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm a man of the bottom.

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I will never fight to death.

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What is fighting to death?

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
To die is

297
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
to kill someone

298
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
in the ring.

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then the game can end.

300
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But fighting to death

301
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
is more difficult.

302
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The money you get can be doubled.

303
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I offended you.

304
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I offended Yanzu.

305
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yanzu gave me the medicine.

306
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If you lie to me, you will be beaten to death.

307
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's lucky.

308
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That day,

309
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Qingmu and Yourui came to the arena

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
to recruit security.

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
They are the security guards

312
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
of the international hotel.

313
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Protect the guests and the hotel assets.

314
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Qingmu

315
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
invited me to join.

316
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Sounds good.

317
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes.

318
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
In such a dangerous place,

319
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
there is a safe job.

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think it's good.

321
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So I agreed to join.

322
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Soon,

323
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I have a group of very good friends.

324
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We often go to the forest training base

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to train.

326
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The weather is also very good.

327
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Eat more.

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
We are on a night trip.

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We will arrive in Yunlin tomorrow afternoon.

330
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Brother, buy a rose for sister.

331
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How beautiful is sister?

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Five yuan for one.

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No need. Thank you.

334
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Brother, buy one.

335
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Only five yuan.

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I will buy it for you.

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's not expensive.

338
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I think sister likes it.

339
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Here you are.

340
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This flower...

341
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
No need.

342
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I will buy it for you.

343
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why don't you buy a rose?

344
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You will tell me.

345
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
After joining the security guard,

346
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
we live in the base.

347
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's convenient for daily training.

348
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The last hotel in the world

349
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
is called Tap See.

350
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We often go to get a bottle of wine.

351
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There are some beautiful girls.

352
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's drink together.

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hello.

354
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hello.

355
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Hello.

356
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There are some beautiful girls.

357
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I like them.

358
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It suits you.

359
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Where?

360
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
There.

361
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Hello.

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What kind of beautiful girl is this?

363
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You must like her.

364
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Someone is jealous.

365
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Look, she is so elegant.

366
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
How can she be so beautiful?

367
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think so too.

368
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You can't touch her.

369
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Be careful.

370
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't hurt yourself.

371
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's not my fault.

372
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I have a girlfriend.

373
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You can try it.

374
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
As soon as possible.

375
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The competition begins.

376
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Hello.

377
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't you feel tired?

378
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Smile.

379
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Hello.

380
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Hello.

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Don't you buy me a drink?

382
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You don't look like the kind of person

383
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
who needs someone to buy you a drink.

384
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I think I'm beautiful today.

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I even read a friend's article

386
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
saying that I'm beautiful today.

387
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I read a friend's article saying that

388
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
many people will be nice to me today.

389
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But no one cares about me.

390
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I guess all the girls are more beautiful than me.

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's because you dress too formally.

392
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If...

393
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If you are like her,

394
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
it will be much better.

395
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hello.

396
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Can I borrow your clothes?

397
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
My clothes?

398
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Yeah, I'll give you my jewelry.

399
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
No, I can't.

400
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
These are real diamonds.

401
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
No, no, no.

402
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Just take them.

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Let me borrow your clothes.

404
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, this is yours.

405
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Come here.

406
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Let's go.

407
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Wait for me.

408
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
How are you?

409
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Cheers!

410
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Cheers!

411
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Miss, may I try those with drink?

412
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I only drink with him.

413
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Can I try now?

414
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Is it good?

415
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I should buy you a drink.

416
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You can order for me.

417
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Cheers!

418
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You don't want to say

419
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
that you didn't give me roses

420
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
because you gave a beautiful girl

421
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
who you can't forget.

422
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Did she give you a rose as a gift?

423
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Why did she say that?

424
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I can't.

425
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I haven't finished yet.

426
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
We were happy to drink together that day.

427
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
We were happy to drink together.

431
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I want to get the jewelry back for her.

432
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Is Nina still inside?

433
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Don't come in.

434
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
She's dead.

435
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
She's Nina.

436
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
She's in need.

437
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The whole family

438
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
depends on her.

439
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
She has a daughter.

440
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
She asked me

441
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
how much it was to send her daughter

442
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
away from Eisha.

443
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
She wanted her daughter to go to a safe country.

444
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
To study.

445
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
To go to college.

446
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
She didn't want her

447
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
to be like herself.

448
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
She doesn't have the hope

449
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
to find Zeng Li.

450
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The person who killed her was Liebong.

451
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You're like me.

452
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Because she's just a simple girl who used her own jewelry to change into different clothes.

453
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
She's the successor of the Black Sand and Black City families.

454
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
She can take whatever she wants.

455
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
She doesn't need to exchange anything.

456
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
In her eyes, she's just a dancer.

457
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
She should take her own stuff.

458
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm the one who hurt Nina.

459
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
If I didn't ask her to change into different clothes,

460
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
she wouldn't have died.

461
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's okay.

463
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm tired.

464
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You should go to sleep.

465
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Liebong's family is the third generation of the Black Sand family.

467
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
She's very fierce.

468
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
She's very kind.

469
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
She's very kind.

470
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
She's very kind.

471
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
She's very kind.

472
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
She's very kind.

473
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
She's very kind.

474
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
She's very kind.

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
She wants to get our hotel, but she's rejected.

476
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
This makes her very angry.

477
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
She's having a violent attack on our hotel.

478
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
She wants to take everything from the hotel.

479
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That woman is too scary.

480
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
But the scene was chaotic.

481
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
We had to run away.

482
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Ready, set, go!

483
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I don't know what I was thinking at the time.

484
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
But I still couldn't help but save her.

485
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Maybe it's a kind of fate between you two.

486
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I never regret saving her.

487
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
She's the cutest girl in the world.

488
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Do you know what my dad said?

489
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
At that moment, I felt the world was getting gentle.

490
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Tasha was not safe.

491
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
After the hotel was gone,

492
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
the police wanted us to help her.

493
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
But we rejected it.

494
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And it was a terrible thing.

495
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We sent Tasha to her uncle's house.

496
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
We thought it would be safe.

497
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But that bastard

498
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
lured Tasha to the police.

499
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And then?

500
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The police called me.

501
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
They said we made her feel embarrassed.

502
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
They gave me a deal.

503
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
They wanted to buy me a win.

504
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
If I could help her win,

505
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and make her happy,

506
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
they would return Tasha to me.

507
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Tasha!

508
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Congratulations.

509
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I told you.

510
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I never take people's lives.

511
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I told you he's not that honest.

512
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
He would definitely make a move.

513
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I won this game.

514
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I was too stupid.

515
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
How could he not have a substitute?

516
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
He didn't make a move to buy me a win.

517
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
If he did,

518
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I would be very upset.

519
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Did you leave?

520
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
He let me go.

521
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
He let me go back.

522
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And wait for his gift.

523
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
What gift?

524
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Tasha's hairpin.

525
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
It's stuck in my heart.

526
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Let's go.

529
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
This is not your problem.

530
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I want to test Baozi's ability.

531
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
How could you not ask me to do this?

532
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I knew he wouldn't like it.

533
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Cheers.

535
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
There it is.

542
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What's going on?

543
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Peng Peng.

544
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Sir, Brother Meng.

545
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
What's going on?

546
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's a man.

547
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Sir,

548
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
even though I don't understand

549
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
who's going to be our test subject,

550
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
my results show that

551
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But I think you and Master Tai have seen my performance all the way.

552
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I passed the test.

553
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Luo Zui.

554
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Well, I'll get off at the next stop.

555
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You continue to sit in the clouds.

556
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
We'll pick you up when we get there.

557
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Why?

558
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
This is the test of the master.

559
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Test?

560
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Yes.

561
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You two can only change bags.

562
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll be the only one who can play the three-sword game.

563
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Good for you.

564
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
What?

565
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
You don't want to be a star?

566
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I might be a star two years ago.

567
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
But now I only want to be a member of the right faction.

568
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Wait for him.

569
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Come on.

570
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He's the one.

571
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
He's the one.

572
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Come on.

573
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Come on.

574
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Come on.

575
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Come on.

576
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Good.

577
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Okay.

578
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh, right.

579
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Wan San sent me a message.

580
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
She said she could come to Lixi tonight.

581
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
She also said she couldn't manage my old chicken.

582
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I have to hurry up and get her a name.

583
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Any suggestions?

584
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Fried chicken.

585
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Get in the car.

586
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
No, it's not that obvious.

587
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You're not going to leave her a psychological mark?

588
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Chicken is just food.

589
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I gave her this name to remind her of her true nature.

590
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
How about Cao Fang?

591
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Cao Fang?

592
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Just like me.

593
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
We walked a long way before.

594
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Then because of you, I was in a hurry to get rid of myself.

595
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Help me.

596
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Okay.

597
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's settled then.

598
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Luo.

599
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Come on.

600
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Come on.

601
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Come on.

602
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Come on.

603
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Come on.

604
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Come on.

605
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Come on.

606
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Come on.
