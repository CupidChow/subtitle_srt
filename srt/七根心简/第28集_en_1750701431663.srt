Episode 05

3
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Mudan!

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mudan!

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Mudan!

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mudan!

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Fengfeng!

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mudan!

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mudan!

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mudan!

11
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Mudan!

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mudan!

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No!

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let her go.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't involve anyone else in our business.

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Luo, aren't you a brave little child?

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Things between you and me will always affect your loved ones.

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's see, your daughter, your brothers.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There's no reason she should be an exception.

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So?

21
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you want to kill her, you have to get through this first.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is that a promise?

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Have you ever killed a man?

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I've never killed a man.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've never killed a man.

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I've never killed a man.

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I've never killed a man.

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is that a promise?

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Have you ever killed a woman before?

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Remember what you said to your daughter?

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Daddy will always protect you.

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now what happened?

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And your brothers?

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You guys barged me and tried to kill me.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They're all dead, but you're still alive.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now here we are.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
After all those promises,

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you're still gonna break it this time.

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There's always something to keep in mind

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There's no reason to hold on to it

41
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,600
I don't need sweet

42
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
The unknown adventure and mystery

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Will eventually come back

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If you're still strong

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We'll be together forever

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
After the storm, I'm afraid to die

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The security guards are watching us.

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In case of an accident,

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
we need a security guard's code, right?

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't wait for me to eat.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Qingmu, take her away.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hurry!

53
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Go!

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't you want a revenge?

55
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Just kill me!

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Daddy!

57
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm a very reasonable person.

58
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There's two here.

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can only take one.

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Listen.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Only one.

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Decide.

63
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Qingmu!

65
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Qingmu!

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
She's in there.

67
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's going on?

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What do you mean?

69
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Qingmu!

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What do you mean?

71
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Stop it.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is a hospital.

73
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Can't you see?

74
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Listen to her.

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I thought she was shot four times.

76
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But the wound is different from the gun.

77
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And there's no bullet in her body.

78
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So I told the doctor it was a public accident.

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It was purely an accident.

80
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it serious now?

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's better than being shot.

82
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But it's also a coincidence.

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Here.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She doesn't have bullets in her body.

85
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Laura was here to save you.

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And gave you a little hug.

88
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And then he took one, two, three, four.

89
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Four bullets.

90
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't you want to know if he's dead?

91
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let me tell you.

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Of course he's not dead.

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I told you.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
His death is never my intention.

95
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Too bad you missed.

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Lauren's face when he met Tasha.

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It was very interesting.

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Tasha?

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh.

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't you remember?

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Told you.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have trump cards up in my sleeve.

103
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Mommy!

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Mommy!

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mommy!

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Mommy!

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Mommy!

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Mommy!

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What's your name?

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Tasha Linda Emma.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What's your favorite name?

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Where are you from?

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm from wherever you say.

114
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Who's your favorite person in the world?

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's Mommy.

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What happens if someone bullies Mommy?

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Kill her!

118
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Good girl.

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Go play.

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Isn't she so cute?

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
One day you'll be just like her.

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Loyal and obedient.

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You want me to kill Lauren?

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're so wide-eyed.

125
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have to think about it.

126
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
With all your grand debut.

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's all.

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's time to go see Lauren.

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Any words for him?

130
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh.

131
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Pretty.

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Give it back to me.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I know this.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's his.

136
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's Law's.

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Law gave a token for your love?

138
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was wondering.

139
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What gift should I give to Law?

140
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Tell him I can't go back.

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If I miss him, I'll blow him away.

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Like he saw me.

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No.

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Your girlfriend must be Alice in Wonderland.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No.

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No.

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Where's the band-aid?

148
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's have a talk.

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What's wrong with your band-aid?

150
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm fine.

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Law.

152
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We've always been at odds with each other.

153
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Your abilities are not matched for mine.

154
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And your fatal weakness?

155
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's been easily distracted by appearances.

156
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The moment you saw that here being you and your guys

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
couldn't wait to take revenge.

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Every one of them died at the end.

159
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The moment you saw the old lady's body.

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You just rushed back.

161
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Leaving your girl with me?

162
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Law.

163
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're totally messed up.

164
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're always peeping beneath me.

165
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Law.

166
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But now.

167
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have to make a deal.

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There's a favor.

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I need you to do for me.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Your little beauty will be safe for the next ten days.

171
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And I need you to fetch something.

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
In exchange for her.

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What is it?

174
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Ha ha ha.

175
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
A broken man's hook?

176
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
How do I know where it is?

177
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's your problem.

178
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll wait for you in the dark.

179
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Li Yuanbao.

180
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Don't you dare hurt the band-aid.

181
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I will never let you go.

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Doctor.

183
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Get him out of the hospital.

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Out of the hospital?

185
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He's not fully recovered.

186
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes.

187
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He's going to the hospital now.

188
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You're badly hurt.

189
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Can you hold on to him?

190
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I only have ten days.

191
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This woman is too bold.

192
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
She's going to be a phoenix.

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
She knows that's a new star.

194
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So she has to start over.

195
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Ten days?

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Where can I find her in ten days?

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Even if I find her, can I give it to her?

198
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Does she have a trading address?

199
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Black Shark.

200
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Brother Luo.

201
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The old man who went to the hunting newspaper.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He's in charge of the trade.

203
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Isn't that a dead end?

204
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I have no choice.

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Black Shark.

206
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Do you dare to think about it?

207
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That place is my master's uncle.

208
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Or the level of Qingmu.

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's why I dare to go.

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can't hang out here.

211
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We are all in the same boat.

212
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If it weren't for the full participation, we wouldn't have made it.

213
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's right.

214
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And we've had such a big problem.

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Do we have to tell Uncle Guan?

216
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm in a hurry.

217
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You guys are using fake chicken as bait.

218
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't you have any conscience?

219
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hurry up and leave.

220
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
No, you're looking at it.

221
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Look at what you're holding in the back.

222
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's all painted.

223
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Do you think it looks like a big rooster?

224
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You think I'm a blind man?

225
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It looks like it.

226
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Why is there a Brazil turtle?

227
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Whose?

228
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Mine.

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Take it away.

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Even if you take a chicken.

231
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're so talented.

232
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Hurry up and leave.

233
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What are these?

234
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know.

235
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't know.

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know.

237
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't know.

238
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't know.

239
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't know.

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't know.

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't know.

242
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Who are these people?

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Uncle Guan.

244
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Why are you here so soon?

245
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Of course.

246
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I just walked around.

247
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Such a big thing happened.

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I have to be here to cheer.

249
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I have already told Wan Feng Huo.

250
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Let him focus on the place called Feng Excellent.

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The place called Excellent.

252
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
My mom and my friend told me that.

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:56,600
The Phoenix

254
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Don't kick.

255
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Don't kick.

256
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Don't kick.

257
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Cao Fang Fang is missing.

258
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
Brother Luo said that when he saw her for the last time,

259
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
the hunting leopard was also there.

260
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
The worst possibility is that now Fang Fang has been

261
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
cooked by the hunting leopard.

262
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
This woman really did everything she could.

263
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
She's a chicken.

264
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,600
She killed my master Tai.

265
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
She helped my master to hate me.

266
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
She ate my Cao Fang Fang's pain.

267
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
She's not Luo Ren's enemy.

268
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
She's a bastard.

269
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
I don't have anything to do with her.

270
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I have to go.

271
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Welcome to the black market.

272
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
How is it?

273
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
Is it comfortable living in my house?

274
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Your house?

275
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
My house?

276
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
If you come here two years earlier,

277
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,600
you can see the real hunting leopard

278
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
walking in the villa.

279
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Not now.

280
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,600
Because Luo Ren's helpers burned my house.

281
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
But it doesn't matter.

282
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Even if it's a waste, no one will be touched.

283
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Mine is still mine.

284
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Yes.

285
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,600
No one can take anything from you.

286
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Whether it's a necklace or a villa.

287
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Including my life,

288
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
no one can take it.

289
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
My master.

290
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,600
I thought he was an old man.

291
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
But I didn't expect that

292
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,600
after I became a useless person,

293
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
he gave me such a big surprise.

294
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,600
He promised to live in the world for a long time.

295
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,600
The future generations will suffer.

296
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
The late king will be in trouble.

297
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,600
I can't die after I become a star king.

298
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Star king?

299
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
You are a star king?

300
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Of course.

301
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,600
But not those low-class followers.

302
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
The traditional star king.

303
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,600
My main character is the hero of the East Sector, Cheng Zheng.

304
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,600
My family was building a famous house.

305
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
It was 200 years ago.

306
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,600
The murder case of Lin Xue

307
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
was the East Sector case of Dong Yi.

308
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,600
The late king was in a state of crisis.

309
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,600
He couldn't invest.

310
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,600
So my grandfather asked Hainan to move to Aishah.

311
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
After I was born,

312
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,600
my grandfather sent many people to the capital

313
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,600
to find the letter.

314
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,600
He found a man who was possessed by the letter.

315
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Is it appropriate for you to do this?

316
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
To steal the letter from the star king?

317
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Him?

318
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Not everyone can be called a star king.

319
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
He is just a delivery man.

320
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,600
He used his body as a container to deliver the letter to me.

321
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I have been working with him for a long time.

322
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
This process is painful.

323
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
But I enjoy it.

324
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,600
I want to be reborn in the fire.

325
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
It's wonderful.

326
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,600
So, you brought me here.

327
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,600
How are you going to deal with Luo Ren?

328
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Do I look so shallow to you?

329
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Revenge is just a moment.

330
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,600
My real purpose is to be a beautiful star.

331
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
How can I be satisfied with this?

332
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,600
I want to bring them all to me.

333
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
And...

334
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,600
I will be their master.

335
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Yin Yun Xiang, Yin Yun Hou.

336
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Yin Ling Feng, Yin Ling.

337
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Bang Yin Ling.

338
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,600
This is a sign.

339
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Yun Ling.

340
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Our master is not in Yun Ling.

341
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Okay, okay, okay.

342
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
Give me a look.

343
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Hurry up.

344
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Name, background.

345
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Background.

346
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Please help me remember the south.

347
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Okay.

348
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
North. South north.

349
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
South north.

350
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Yan is the Yan of Yan.

351
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
South north south north south north south.

352
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
It's Fei.

353
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Yun of Yun.

354
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Ling is Ling.

355
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Zhi.

356
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Zhi is the same.

357
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Up and down.

358
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Watch.

359
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Four.

360
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
The sign is the one that plays mahjong.

361
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Yes, I know.

362
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Sign.

363
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
The building is the building of the building.

364
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Gi of north is south fly,

365
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,600
It sounds so familiar.

366
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
But there is no DNR at this plain.

367
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Our eldest brother was DNR.

368
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
It's difficult for him,

369
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
so he removing it himself.

370
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Leng of Len would mean,

371
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
in your house.

372
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
The name of building

373
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
on your monitored album, right?

374
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Yes, yes.

375
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
But he didn't write directly.

376
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,620
I was going with

377
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,600
World Y Ten Great Target Ten's

378
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,120
The nine generations, the ten generations, the eleven generations, the twelve generations,

379
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,280
the four words in the four generations of Yin family

380
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,120
are the four palaces of the government.

381
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,680
Shen Sun, let me think about something.

382
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,760
My master's big gate is not on it.

383
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,360
But these four words are the four palaces of the government.

384
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,560
It's been a long time since these words have been fulfilled.

385
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,760
The Wuzhen is right under the Yunling.

386
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
The north of Yan is south of the north.

387
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,360
The Yin family is in the north.

388
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,000
The Wuzhen is in the south.

389
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,720
My mother's brother said that the Wuzhen is a letter.

390
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,720
In ancient times, people sent letters through the big Yan.

391
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,960
The red Yan was a letter.

392
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,400
The north of Yan was south of the north.

393
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,000
My mother's brother also said that the map was lost.

394
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,520
Map?

395
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,000
Yes, he meant the map of the Wuzhen.

396
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Not only these,

397
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,600
the case of the East Snow Red Mei in Xiamen City

398
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,800
mentioned five martial arts masters who were in danger.

399
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,720
The masters of the Wooden Belt called them Meihua and Jiuniang.

400
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,120
They are all Meihua.

401
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,000
So the Wooden Belt's sect

402
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
has always had a connection with the New Year's Day.

403
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
Paper?

404
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,600
What is this paper used for?

405
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,600
Get out!

406
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Hmm?

407
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Remember, I want exactly the same.

408
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Yes, madam.

409
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
To myself!

410
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Why are you calling me by my name?

411
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Don't talk to me about boxing. If you talk to me about it, I'll be mad.

412
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
I'm hanging up.

413
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
No key.

414
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Uncle Gu, look at this.

415
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
This is made of wood.

416
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Look, look.

417
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
So clever.

418
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Could this be the work of the woodcutter's ancestor?

419
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Who?

420
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
The woodcutter's ancestor.

421
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,600
It is said that the wood he made can fly for three days and nights without falling to the ground.

422
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,600
This...

423
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Brother, I...

424
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
We get lost in the mountains during the day.

425
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
The temperature is so low at night.

426
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,600
How did the woodcutters change their direction that day?

427
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Brother, you know this place best.

428
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
You must know it, right?

429
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:17,180
This

430
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,180
This

431
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,180
I won't lose.

432
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
But, it's hard to do it without you.

433
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,180
I can't go with you.

434
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,180
But it's okay.

435
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,180
I'll go to the mountain to help you.

436
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
I'll help you cut the back.

437
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Be careful.

438
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,180
Left, up, three, right, down, four.

439
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,180
Oh, my God.

440
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Mr. Chen, be careful on the road.

441
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,180
It's amazing.

442
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,180
It's not a steam engine, it's not a combustion engine, it's not solar energy.

443
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,180
No battery.

444
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
The wisdom of ancient people is so powerful.

445
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
Lu Ren.

446
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,180
Be careful on the road.

447
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,180
Don't get too cold.

448
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Thank you.

449
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,180
Thank you.

450
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
Thank you.

451
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,180
That

452
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,180
The yard.

453
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,180
Let's go and have a look.

454
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,180
Let's go.

455
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,180
The door is open.

456
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,180
The door is open.

457
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,180
The wooden bag should have been brought here by the bat.

458
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,180
What does this mean?

459
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,180
Hey, get on.

460
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,180
Who?

461
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,180
Cao Fang, do you have a sense of security?

462
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,180
Can a place like this, a machine like this, be a case like this?

463
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
This is the secret hole of our school.

464
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,180
Light and light.

465
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Even if it's a machine, it can take away the evil.

466
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,180
In my opinion, it's a case-like thing.

467
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,180
Sima Dao or Ma Yi.

468
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
The door is open.

469
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
We pressed it a few times.

470
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,180
My grandfather told me about some ancient machines.

471
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,180
I think you're right. This should be a password case.

472
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
But it just came out.

473
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,180
It should be that we didn't press it right.

474
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,180
It automatically returned to its place.

475
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,180
So the number we just pressed should be the password number.

476
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,180
It seems that the password is eight words.

477
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,180
Under the cloud,

478
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,180
the court is L.

479
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,180
Before, my mother told me that the key was hidden in the house.

480
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,180
I always thought that the key was the key.

481
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,180
It can be a secret.

482
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
I know.

483
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,180
If the map and the key were all set up for this,

484
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,180
the first one-twenty map is the Yin Village and the Wuzhen.

485
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,180
The map with the Wuzhen is the Yin Village.

486
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,180
The key is the Yin Village.

487
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,180
The key is the Wuzhen.

488
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,180
The key is the flower in the house.

489
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,180
The North and South Flies are all Yin people.

490
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
They sent us a message.

491
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,180
The message is eight words.

492
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,180
Under the cloud, the court is L.

493
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Yes.

494
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,180
Find the eight words.

495
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Cloud.

496
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,180
Cloud.

497
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,180
It's open.

498
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
Cloud.

499
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
I'll just leave a person.

500
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,180
There should be a way ahead.

501
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Forget it.

502
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,180
The seven stars in the sky.

503
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,180
The eight cities of the cloud are from the seven stars in the sky.

504
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,180
Look at the mountain. It looks like a phoenix.

505
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,180
It must be that phoenix.

506
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,180
Don't say that. It's a coincidence.

507
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,180
It looks like a picture when I was a kid.

508
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,180
So the star was born on this tree.

509
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,180
This should be the star-gazing platform of the Yin Village.

510
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,180
The star and star-gazing platform came from the seven stars in the sky.

511
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
They didn't do it.

512
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,180
How did they dig the star?

513
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,180
It's not their fault.

514
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,180
They didn't know the star was so dangerous.

515
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,180
Maybe they thought it was some treasure.

516
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,180
This person was hanged to death.

517
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,180
This is a knife.

518
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,180
This is a live burrow.

519
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,180
He pushed it into the water.

520
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,180
It should be that after the star entered the water, a lot of strange things happened.

521
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
What is this?

522
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,180
This should be an exaggerated planning technique.

523
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,180
It's to show that the star is very powerful.

524
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,180
This is the disciple of Da De leading him to fight against the star.

525
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,180
It's a wood-gazing platform.

526
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,180
This is the wood that can trap the star.

527
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,180
So the wood-gazing platform is the first material of the star.

528
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,180
I'll take a picture first. I'll send it to you later.

529
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,180
If you think so,

530
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,180
the sixth and seventh stars are the core of the human.

531
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,180
How can the human heart harm people?

532
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,180
Knife, rope, fishing, smoke, soil,

533
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,180
and the tongue are all the surface objects.

534
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,180
The one who pushes the bar behind

535
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,180
is always the human heart.

536
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,180
Yes, they say that you should be honest.

537
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,180
If the human heart is broken,

538
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,180
then all the bad things will come.

539
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:17,180
So the Phoenix's cage was built with silver.

540
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Just like this.

541
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Is there anything else?

542
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
Be careful.

543
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,180
There's something else in there.

544
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,180
What is it?

545
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,180
I don't know.

546
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,180
It's a little scary.

547
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,180
What is it?

548
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,180
There's something else in there.

549
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,180
Oh my god.

550
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,180
What is it?

551
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,180
Be careful, Cao Xiong.

552
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,180
You...

553
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,180
It's okay.

554
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
Bye.

555
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,180
It's not that scary.

556
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:56,180
The

557
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
stood?

558
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
The stood?

559
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,220
Two, one, four, four.

560
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,320
Is this a memorial tablet for the five humans up there?

561
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,360
Little Erhuo, I'll give you six words.

562
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,700
Being smart and smart.

563
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,400
If I'm not wrong,

564
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,100
these five people are the same as you.

565
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,700
They also fought against Guo Xinqian.

566
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:25,400
They are the five warriors of the Red Sleeves of the Eastern Snow.

567
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,820
They are also the people in the cave of Caojia Village.

568
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:36,260
So they are the ancient Phoenix Squad.

569
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,660
What a coincidence!

570
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,060
They are also three men and two women.

571
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,820
That's right.

572
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,260
The one who fought against Guo.

573
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,700
That Cheng, isn't that me?

574
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,540
I think there's one...

575
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
Then I'm that...

576
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,940
Yes, there's one who's named after the sea.

577
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,340
You were born by the sea.

578
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,260
If you say so,

579
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,500
then this girl is quite like me.

580
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,900
Her posture is not easy to make fun of.

581
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,180
And on this arrow,

582
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,020
there seems to be a small bell.

583
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,620
It's the same as me.

584
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,220
Wait.

585
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,620
Do you think this is the kind of design

586
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,140
that is connected to the five doors?

587
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,620
That is, the five doors can only be opened

588
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,100
when the strength is at the same time.

589
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,060
How about we try it?

590
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,020
Each of us will be responsible for one door.

591
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,900
Push it in at the same time.

592
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,460
Okay.

593
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,260
I'll push that one.

594
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,180
Push each one.

595
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,820
I'll push this one.

596
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,460
Wait.

597
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,220
I'll push the little boy.

598
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,020
I'll push this one.

599
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,340
Okay.

600
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,060
I'll push this one.

601
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,820
Are you ready?

602
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,220
One, two, three.

603
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,540
Hmph!

604
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
Okay.

605
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,580
Just remember us.

606
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,320
We would never pretend to be someone else.

607
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,700
That's correct, drumming children.

608
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,180
Dream on.

609
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,820
My dreams happen.

610
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,920
I'll be by your side.

611
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,180
I'll listen to it.

612
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,620
You had better remember who you are.

613
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,820
I'm no longer who I used to be.

614
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,320
I'm waiting for you

615
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,320
This game

616
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,820
Has no end

617
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:11,320
It carries the traces of the past

618
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,320
You are my soul mate

619
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,320
I'm your match

620
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,320
Yeah

621
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,820
I'm waiting for you

622
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:32,320
I feel every breath of yours

623
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Then I continue to cherish the sky

624
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,320
The flower is clearly visible

625
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,320
Tell me the end

626
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,320
The soon-to-be gentle breath

627
00:43:48,320 --> 00:44:10,960
In my mind, the

628
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:19,320
screen communicate with an Motion

629
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:26,320
And I dashing through in darkness

630
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,660
The screenYEAR

631
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,820
Tell me the end

632
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,820
即将温柔的浮现

633
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:53,820
在脑海中轻轻一闪而过的负面

634
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,820
而我在黑暗间
