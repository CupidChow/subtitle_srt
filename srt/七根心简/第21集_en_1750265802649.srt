I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can continue.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I can't get the second one.

This belongs to Mr.Pu

19
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
I haven't seen you for a long time.

20
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,260
Have you been home for the past two years?

21
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
My brothers

22
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
My brothers

23
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
will never be able to go home.

24
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
I don't deserve to go home.

25
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
Luo

26
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
I went to Lixi to find you.

27
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
I knew you opened the bar,

28
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,260
became a boss,

29
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,260
and made new friends.

30
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,260
I heard that

31
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,260
you found a pretty girlfriend.

32
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,260
I heard that you were sweet.

33
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,260
Congratulations.

34
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
Congratulations too.

35
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,260
You forgot about us.

36
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,260
You forgot about your cute little girl.

37
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,260
You left us

38
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
and went to your beautiful life.

39
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,260
I didn't.

40
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,260
I will never forget.

41
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Ha Sha

42
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
Dad

43
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,260
What are you doing?

44
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Is it good looking?

45
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,260
Li Bao killed her to make me work for you.

46
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
Sorry.

47
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,260
The day you were so strong,

48
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,260
I thought you were going to die.

49
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,260
You said a lot of things to me.

50
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,260
You said that Luo Ye was going back to this place.

51
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,260
So

52
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,260
you left me here.

53
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,260
Isn't this bad?

54
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,260
It's hot here.

55
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,260
Luo, you are a smart man.

56
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,260
You can still be a legend at that time.

57
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
I will never forget.

58
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
I will never forget.

59
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
I will never forget.

60
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
I will never forget.

61
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
I will never forget.

62
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,260
I have never thought that

63
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,260
my mom would be so happy and happy.

64
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,260
I only have to wait for my food.

65
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,260
Do you think I want to live?

66
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,260
The one I hate is me.

67
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
Luo

68
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
I won't dare to say it.

69
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
Because it's too much.

70
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,260
I came back to the old factory.

71
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,260
And you still look like a ghost house.

72
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,660
The local people dare not come near.

73
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,660
I remember he was hit by a few walls.

74
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,060
You even hurt his eyes with a knife.

75
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,060
But I never found his body.

76
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,260
He was hit so much.

77
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,660
Maybe he took his body away.

78
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,260
I thought so too.

79
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
If he still has a breath,

80
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,060
what if his men save him?

81
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,060
You should know that without his life,

82
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,260
I can't live.

83
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
So,

84
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,060
I burned his old factory.

85
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,460
I bought their ashes in the small wooden house in our factory.

86
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,060
There is no ammunition.

87
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,320
Testifying?

88
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,980
But later, I looked at the newspaper,

89
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,640
it became more relaxing.

90
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,640
He also has all the powers he has.

91
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
I know.

92
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I've checked everything.

93
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
I think...

94
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Everything is over.

95
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Maybe...

96
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I should go home.

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
I'm so tired.

98
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
I want to go back to my wife.

99
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Qingmu.

100
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
You suddenly met me.

101
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
What happened?

102
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
I think Li Pai is still alive.

103
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
What?

104
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Something strange happened recently.

105
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Someone was dug up by the death of Liu Yus.

106
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
The ashes were scattered.

107
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
The ashes were everywhere.

108
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Are you sure?

109
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
He was injured so badly.

110
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
How could he still be alive?

111
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Don't you know his heart?

112
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Except for Li Bao,

113
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
who could have done such a serious and serious injury?

114
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Li Bao, who could have done such a serious and serious injury?

115
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Nanguai came to me.

116
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
If he hadn't died,

117
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
he must have found a way to get me.

118
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
He sent me to death.

119
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Luo,

120
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
no matter what you think,

121
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I've decided to take revenge on you.

122
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
I'll help you to make a boat.

123
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
I'll take the boat to Lama and then turn around.

124
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
I'll quickly recommend you to take the boat to Lama and then take the boat to Lama.

125
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
I'll take the boat to Lama.

126
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
When?

127
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
After the time.

128
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Are you going to be with me?

129
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Okay.

130
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Then you have to promise me one thing.

131
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
This time,

132
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,640
we'll all come back together.

133
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Remember that.

134
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
From now on,

135
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
Luo,

136
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
if we don't kill Li Bao,

137
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
we won't have a peaceful life.

138
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Not only you,

139
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
but also your friends who you love,

140
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
will become the one who killed Li Bao.

141
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,640
They will become the next killer.

142
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
I forgot to tell you,

143
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
I'll break up with them.

144
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
I'll break up with them.

145
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
This is like a teacher in the mountains,

146
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
and the elephant is sold in a shop.

147
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
The grass is like a treasure.

148
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Among these three,

149
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,640
there must be one who is a actor.

150
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
But I'm not able to do it.

151
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Okay, boss.

152
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
You really go out?

153
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
I promised Luo Ruan

154
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
to report to the security guard ten o'clock.

155
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
You really don't go with me?

156
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
I don't go.

157
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
This is the 20th anniversary of the earthquake.

158
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
Why are you kidding?

159
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
You've learned a lot.

160
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Just take it as a training.

161
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
What about me?

162
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
How can I follow you?

163
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
I'm a girl.

164
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
I'll run to the mountain alone

165
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
when the sun is down.

166
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
I'm scared.

167
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
You're not scared?

168
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
What about me?

169
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I don't know kung fu.

170
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
I run slowly.

171
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
I'm still young.

172
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Even though I'm a boy,

173
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
I'm afraid of the dark.

174
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Then you have to be careful.

175
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
You're the only one left here.

176
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
If I were Luo Dan,

177
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,640
I wouldn't be afraid of kung fu.

178
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
You

179
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
will be gone

180
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,640
when I come back.

181
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Bye.

182
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Kung fu.

183
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
You really don't go?

184
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I don't go.

185
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Really?

186
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,640
I really don't go.

187
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Do you want to eat it?

188
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I don't go.

189
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Don't regret it.

190
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Bye.

191
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,640
I'm going to the mountain.

192
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm going to the mountain.

193
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
I'm going to the mountain.

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,640
I'm going to the mountain.

195
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
I'm going to the mountain.

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640

I'm going to the mountain.

00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
I'm going to the mountain.

I'm going to the mountain.

210
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
I'm going to the mountain.

211
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
I'm going to the mountain.

212
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm going to the mountain.

213
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm going to the mountain.

214
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm going to the mountain.

215
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm going to the mountain.

216
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
I'm going to the mountain.

217
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
I'm going to the mountain.

218
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
I'm going to the mountain.

219
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
I'm going to the mountain.

220
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I'm going to the mountain.

221
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
I'm going to the mountain.

222
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
I'm going to the mountain.

223
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,640
I'm going to the mountain.

I'm going to the mountain.

226
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm going to the mountain.

227
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,640
I'm going to the mountain.

228
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,640
I'm going to the mountain.

229
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm going to the mountain.

230
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
I'm going to the mountain.

231
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
I'm going to the mountain.

232
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I'm going to the mountain.

233
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640
I'm going to the mountain.

234
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
I'm going to the mountain.

235
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
I'm going to the mountain.

236
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I'm going to the mountain.

237
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
I'm going to the mountain.

238
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
I'm going to the mountain.

239
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
I'm going to the mountain.

240
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
I don't think I can defeat influence out there.

241
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
I don't think I can defeat influence out there.

242
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
I also find it like a 댓.

243
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
There are ghosts at all times here.

244
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,640
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

245
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,640
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

246
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,640
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

247
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,640
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

248
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,640
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

249
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,640
I know I can get through this.

250
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Sahbama!? Sahbama!?

251
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Nah Nhe haunting dream

252
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Hmm, hmm, hmm!

253
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Whoa!

254
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Hello?

255
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm telling you,

256
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
my grandpa told me that

257
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,640
he cares about the seven-legged heart-shaped movements

258
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
of the Tai.

259
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Hmm, hmm, hmm!

260
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Hello?

261
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Hello?

262
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
You just mentioned

263
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
the relationship between

264
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,640
the Tai and the heart-shaped movements.

265
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,640
I'm suspecting

266
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
that the seven-legged heart-shaped movements

267
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
are related to the Tian Kui.

268
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
The Tian Kui...

269
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
The seven-legged...

270
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
The alien?

271
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
The alien?

272
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
The alien?

273
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
The alien?

274
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
The alien?

275
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
That's too big.

276
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
I guess

277
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
the seven-legged heart-shaped movements

278
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
are related to the Tian Kui.

279
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
It depends on the fate of the case

280
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
to find out whether the heart-shaped movements are related to the Tian Kui.

281
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
If you say so,

282
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
then the seven-legged heart-shaped movements

283
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
should be related to the Tian Kui.

284
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
There are five people in the reality.

285
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
Five?

286
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Do you remember

287
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
the man that Xiang Si Lan mentioned?

288
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
That man

289
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
asked me to do it.

290
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
He said

291
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
this game

292
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
can't be played by you alone.

293
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
And others are waiting for the scene.

294
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Xiao Luo Guan,

295
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
I'm telling you,

296
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
this game

297
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
might be more difficult.

298
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Did you notice that

299
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
he would run away to find someone else?

300
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,640
And he would change their mind.

301
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
So this game is better.

302
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
Do you understand?

303
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Is there anything strange

304
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
happening in your mind?

305
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
What do you mean?

306
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,640
It's even more advanced.

307
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,640
It's even more advanced.

308
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
He might use a plan.

309
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
For example,

310
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,640
to make a move.

311
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Why is Mu Dai not coming home?

312
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
He's so nice.

313
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
He's so nice.

314
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
He's gone.

315
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
He's been playing with his phone for so long.

316
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
He's not waiting anymore.

317
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
He's gone.

318
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
This is an unreliable woman.

319
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
You know I'm afraid she'll hit me.

320
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,640
I don't know if she'll protect me.

321
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
You...

322
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
I'm sorry.

323
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm here.

324
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
Who are you?

325
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,640
Who are you?

326
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
Who are you?

327
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
Don't shout.

328
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Help us.

329
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,640
You are...

330
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Ya Feng?

331
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Are you really...

332
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Ya Feng?

333
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,640
Can you save me?

334
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Don't believe them.

335
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Don't believe them.

336
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Hurry up.

337
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
We can't make it if we don't leave.

338
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Go.

339
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Boss Xiao.

340
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
Boss Xiao.

341
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Boss Xiao.

342
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Boss Xiao.

343
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,640
You're so stupid.

344
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Boss Xiao.

345
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
Boss Xiao.

346
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
Boss Xiao.

347
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Mr. Chen.

348
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Give me the bowl.

349
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
Boss Xiao.

350
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
Is it enough?

351
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
No, no, no.

352
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,640
I've taken four.

353
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
I've taken five.

354
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
Five?

355
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:58,920
The high- high source스

356
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,980
Sorry.

357
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:14,140
A heavy attack shot the statusings on this platform.

358
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Sorry for causing health problems to other employees during this time.

359
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
Hello?

360
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
Hello, Lu Ren?

361
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
I've finished the task.

362
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
I'll be back tomorrow.

363
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
I'll call you right away.

364
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,140
I'll take you to the forest.

365
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
What's going on?

366
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
I saw him in the group.

367
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
Didn't he go to the prairie with 13000?

368
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,140
Yes. Because of the prairie,

369
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
he and 13000 were looking for news.

370
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
But now, it's too late.

371
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
It's been 11 hours.

372
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,140
I'm in the prairie now.

373
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,140
I should have come to give you a night.

374
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,140
It's okay. You're still not well.

375
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
If I'm missing, I'll be in the prairie.

376
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,140
Pei Pei Pei, can you say something?

377
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,140
Hurry up. Send me the location of the peasant.

378
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,140
I'll go in later.

379
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,140
I'll take WeChat's number. If I'm missing, you wait.

380
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,140
I'll be back.

381
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Qingshen.

382
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
Just sit here on the platform.

383
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Two tables.

384
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,140
Look.

385
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Okay. I got it.

386
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
The rain is so heavy.

387
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,140
What if it doesn't stop?

388
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,140
What should we do?

389
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Shi'er, if it rains in the prairie,

390
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,140
it's a storm.

391
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
We can't be idle.

392
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
We can't be idle.

393
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
We can't be idle.

394
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,140
Okay.

395
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,140
May I ask if Cao Qingshen is at home?

396
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Yes.

397
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,140
May I ask if you have anything?

398
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,140
You're Cao Qingshen?

399
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
Yes. I'm Cao Qingshen.

400
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,140
I'm here to ask for a friend.

401
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,140
I came here yesterday.

402
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,140
Qingshen, I'll talk to you later.

403
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,140
I'll talk to you later.

404
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,140
Then, please.

405
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,140
It's okay.

406
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
Come. Let's talk here.

407
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,140
The guest from the banquet came here

408
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,140
to see me, right?

409
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,140
Yes.

410
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,140
They left early in the morning?

411
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,140
Yes.

412
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,140
They told me that they would leave in two days.

413
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,140
But I didn't expect it to be so fast.

414
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,140
The accommodation we just had

415
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,140
came here this morning.

416
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,140
They're gone.

417
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,140
You are...

418
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,140
I'm Luo, a friend of Cao Yanhua.

419
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,140
I came here yesterday.

420
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,140
I was late.

421
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
I thought they were waiting for me here.

422
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,140
I didn't expect it.

423
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,140
They live in a very spacious apartment.

424
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,140
I'm a little bit idle here.

425
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,140
But the environment

426
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,140
must be very nice.

427
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,140
It's really nice.

428
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,140
Brother Luo,

429
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,140
I don't think this word

430
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,140
is of any use.

431
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,140
How about this?

432
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,140
You stay here tonight.

433
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,140
Anyway, the friend of the representative

434
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,140
is my friend.

435
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
Then I'm not polite.

436
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,140
Sorry.

437
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
But speaking of which,

438
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,140
are you all

439
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,140
invited to be a guest of my representative?

440
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,140
Why is there no appearance

441
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,140
when I'm back?

442
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
Maybe he wants to surprise you

443
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,140
at the wedding.

444
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,140
Maybe.

445
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,140
That's right.

446
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,140
There are so many people at the wedding.

447
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,140
I can't say anything about it.

448
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,140
My two friends,

449
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,140
have they been dating for two days?

450
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,140
Yes.

451
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,140
Sister Jin Hua.

452
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,140
Sister Jin Hua?

453
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
Sister Cao Jin Hua.

454
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,140
They were talking for a long time.

455
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,140
Then, have they met before?

456
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,140
Yes.

457
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,140
Then, you met our Yafeng.

458
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,140
My uncle told me

459
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,140
that it seemed like

460
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,140
he just left with a red envelope.

461
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,140
Sorry.

462
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,140
Yafeng

463
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,140
is my fiancée.

464
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,140
Yafeng

465
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,140
Excuse me.

466
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,140
Is Cao Jin Hua at home?

467
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Yes.

468
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Where is Cao Jin Hua?

469
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,140
Are you Cao Jin Hua?

470
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Can you not talk?

471
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,140
Wait a minute.

472
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,140
Wait for me.

473
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,140
I'll be right back.

474
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,140
I'll be right back.

475
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,140
Come in.

476
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Come in.

477
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,140
This is my house.

478
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,140
You can sit here.

479
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,140
Sit.

480
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Well...

481
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
What are you looking for?

482
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,140
It's like this.

483
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,140
Two days ago, you were at Qing Shan's house

484
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,140
chatting with two guys.

485
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,140
A man and a woman.

486
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,140
Yes.

487
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,140
I know.

488
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,140
You are not just that Henry, right?

489
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,140
Henry?

490
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,140
Yes, the two of them.

491
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,140
I'm sharing a brother with him.

492
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,140
His brother is my brother.

493
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,140
My brother is the best.

494
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
What's the matter?

495
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,140
It's a insurance.

496
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,140
Yes, insurance.

497
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,140
The insurance is like the wild storm.

498
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,140
It's like our life.

499
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,140
What's the insurance?

500
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,140
When something dangerous happens,

501
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,140
you have to take a big umbrella.

502
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,140
It can cover the storm.

503
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
I'm not here.

504
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,140
Can you give yourself insurance?

505
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,140
I...

506
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,140
I bought it.

507
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,140
I didn't buy it.

508
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,140
How can I make the client happy?

509
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,140
I really bought it.

510
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Here.

511
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,140
This is my business information.

512
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Here.

513
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Handsome.

514
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,140
You are handsome.

515
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,140
You are too impulsive.

516
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
I only talked about insurance.

517
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,140
You are talking about insurance?

518
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:27,140
I told you everything.

519
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,140
There is a number on the phone.

520
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,140
The girl left it to me.

521
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,140
She said she was saving money for Henry.

522
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
She wants to buy insurance to find Henry.

523
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
Do you want to see it yourself?

524
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,140
Sorry.

525
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,140
I might have misunderstood.

526
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
It's okay.

527
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
Where did they go?

528
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,140
I heard Cao Shuai say she brought the girl to see her bride.

529
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,140
I wanted to talk to them about the need.

530
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,140
But Jing Shan said she left early morning.

531
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,140
Yafeng, I'm going out.

532
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,140
Yafeng.

533
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,140
Who are you?

534
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
I'm here to see someone.

535
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,140
I think there is a fat guy.

536
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
He is Cao Yanhua.

537
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,140
He is Qing Shan's cousin.

538
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,140
And there is a young girl.

539
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,140
She gave you a red envelope.

540
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,140
Do you remember?

541
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
Go away.

542
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
Don't look for them.

543
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,140
Or you will be late.

544
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
You know where they are, right?

545
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,140
Yafeng, tell me.

546
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
Yafeng, you have to tell me.

547
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
Where am I?

548
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
To find out who they are.

549
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Will they kill me?

550
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
You call me?

551
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,140
They won't know.

552
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
That mountain is quite high.

553
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,140
The mountain is flat and has a good surface.

554
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:11,140
It's in the middle of the mountain.

555
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
You tell me.

556
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,140
I haven't been here.

557
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Have you seen me?

558
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,140
We'll talk in the morning.

559
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,140
The mountain is flat and has a good surface.

560
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
It's in the middle of the mountain.

561
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
You tell me.

562
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,140
I haven't been here.

563
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,140
Have you seen me?

564
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,140
They won't know.

565
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,140
They won't know.

566
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,140
They won't know.

567
