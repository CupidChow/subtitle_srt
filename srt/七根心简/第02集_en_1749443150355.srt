00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 13

2
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,240
Zhang Guanghua.

3
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,520
Who is this person?

4
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,040
I'm afraid he's dead

5
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,240
after he found out about him.

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Dead?

7
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,680
Zhang Guanghua is also a horse-drawn person.

8
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,760
He and Li Ya

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,160
lived in the same building.

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,280
After the case,

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,200
he disappeared.

12
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,760
He's also missing?

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,600
An old man.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,040
He just wanted to know

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,880
where he was.

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,880
It doesn't matter.

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,200
The photo

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,480
is gone.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,080
You're lost?

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,840
It's not my fault.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,760
That guy has a strong anti-aircraft consciousness.

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,960
And you saw it too.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,440
He's so cold and cold.

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,520
He can't follow

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,880
the ordinary people

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,680
who are just a little bit cold.

27
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,440
Hey,

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,440
did that guy

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,640
look down on you?

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,560
That's why he's so crazy.

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,080
I think

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,440
he's quite energetic.

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,080
Right?

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,600
He's a man who's so cold.

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,360
I'll go first.

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Hurry up.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,360
Hurry up.

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
Can't you retreat?

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,800
He ran away again.

40
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,280
He ran away.

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,680
What do you mean?

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,680
I know him.

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,680
He's a man of great art.

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,720
He's a famous singer.

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
Please come in, Mr. Cao.

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,120
You're welcome.

47
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,480
Can you find his home?

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,320
Of course.

49
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,040
Okay.

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
I'll see you later.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,360
Let's go.

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,440
The location is here.

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,880
What is this place?

54
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,400
We can't go around.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,640
Come on.

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,600
Is this the car?

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,520
Excuse me.

58
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
Is this the third floor?

59
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,520
The village house?

60
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
Ms. He didn't come today.

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
She left early.

62
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,000
She said there's a emergency room.

63
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,280
It's okay.

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,440
What's this place?

65
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,000
What's this place?

66
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,040
Let's go.

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,560
Take it.

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
Don't hide away from me.

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,240
What's this place?

70
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,200
Such a beautiful acting complex.

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
What's that?

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,600
It's myoyo.

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Are you sure you haven't mentioned Xiaoshan He?

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
No.

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,600
He mentioned Mo Mahu.

76
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
He mentioned Dalarantar.

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,600
What happened to him?

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
So, there's a...

79
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
...Wuxia?

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I'm sorry.

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Who's that?

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Who's that?

110
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,600
He's been in the kitchen for so long.

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
He must be tired.

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
There's a strawberry on the table.

113
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
It's hot.

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
It's not good.

115
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I...

116
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Uncle Li.

117
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Where are you going?

118
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Miss Wu Nai.

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
The business is over.

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
The business is very cheap.

121
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
I'm going to leave.

122
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
Yes.

123
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
I'll take you there at night.

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
I thought I could get some clues this time.

125
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,600
But I have to go.

126
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
You've been running around for 20 years.

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
You're always on the run.

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
You're always on the run.

134
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Thank you.

135
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
If it weren't for you,

136
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
I would have lost that photo.

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
I'm going.

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Uncle Li.

139
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,600
What time is it?

140
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
I have something to do.

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
I'll treat you to a cup of tea.

142
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Uncle Li.

143
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Can you tell me

144
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
the situation of this case two years ago?

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
That case.

146
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I had a small injury.

147
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
But this case

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
was going to be a mess.

149
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
On my birthday,

150
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I would have been on the run.

151
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
What did I do?

152
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I just wanted to take a walk in the house.

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
I was on the run.

154
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
I was on the run.

155
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
I just wanted to take a walk in the house.

156
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
I wanted to remind myself

157
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
not to give up.

158
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I've been on the run for 20 years.

159
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
I'm used to it.

160
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
That day,

161
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
I was on the run for 20 years.

162
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
It was Yaqing's birthday.

163
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I was on the run

164
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
at that time.

165
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I suddenly saw a strange person

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
coming into Yaqing's house.

167
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Why did he come in?

168
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I didn't dare to come close to him.

169
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
But I saw him in the door.

170
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I could only see

171
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
his hands

172
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
being held by the force.

173
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
He was being watched by the sword.

174
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I think

175
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I think I was enjoying

176
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
the memories

177
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I had before I became a soldier.

178
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
You know what?

179
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
I was a little bit worried.

180
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I just like the scene of

181
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
the meal today.

182
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
The feeling of being out of the house.

183
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Anyway,

184
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
in that day,

185
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
he appeared in this way.

186
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
I don't believe that

187
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
this case has anything to do with it.

188
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Then you didn't arrest him?

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I've been not a police officer.

190
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Moreover,

191
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
I can't take the evidence.

192
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I decided to keep an eye on him.

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I just kept watching him

194
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
and kept an eye on him.

195
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
I kept an eye on him.

196
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
The Little Mountain River?

197
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Are you sure you didn't mention

198
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
the Little Mountain River?

199
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
No.

200
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
I followed him to the Little Mountain River

201
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
for many days.

202
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Finally,

203
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I found him in a shop.

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I found out

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
that the whole family

206
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
was dead

207
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
when I entered the shop.

208
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
The murderer was still

209
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
tying the body with a thread.

210
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
He was so mad at me

211
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
that he couldn't let him run away.

212
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
At least,

213
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
I let him go first.

214
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
But he was hit by my heavy blow

215
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
but he was like a human.

216
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
He was so strong.

217
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I was so angry with him.

218
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I was so angry

219
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
that I was so eager

220
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,600
to find the right time

221
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
to suppress him.

222
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I didn't expect

223
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
that someone would sneak in.

224
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
When I woke up,

225
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
he was in the hospital.

226
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Who sent you to the hospital?

227
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I don't know.

228
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
The doctor

229
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
and the nurse

230
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
didn't see the light.

231
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
After I came out of the hospital,

232
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I heard

233
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
that the family had a lamb shop.

234
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
When they were cooking,

235
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
the firemen were careful

236
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
to put it in the firetruck.

237
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
They burned half a box.

238
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,600
When the fire broke out,

239
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
the family

240
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
burned to the ground.

241
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
They burned to the ground.

242
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Then,

243
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
you didn't tell the police?

244
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
You didn't tell the police?

245
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I was hurt by a head injury.

246
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I was in a bad mood.

247
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,600
I was raised for a year and a half

248
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
and I thought about

249
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
what happened that night.

250
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
I thought about the security.

251
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,600
But the case

252
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
was solved.

253
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
And,

254
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
I didn't have the courage

255
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
to make the right decision.

256
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
I didn't even remember

257
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
how the murderer looked like.

258
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
If you were

259
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
shot in the scene,

260
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
the police would take you away

261
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
or ask you for help.

262
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
But they didn't.

263
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
It means that you were

264
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
taken to the scene

265
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
and might be sent to the hospital.

266
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
But,

267
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
a serial killer,

268
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
why did the murderer

269
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
let you go?

270
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Yes.

271
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
If he was the murderer,

272
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
I should die in that fire.

273
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Is it possible that the young man

274
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
was not with the murderer?

275
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
I don't care if it was a serial killer.

276
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
He was the key.

277
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
You said that you were shot

278
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
before the shooting.

279
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Did you see his face?

280
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Draw it up.

281
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
I can also share it.

282
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
You think I didn't do it?

283
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
But I can't remember

284
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
that face.

285
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Sometimes, I have a lot of energy.

286
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I feel like I'm being smashed.

287
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Have you tried to hypnotize me?

288
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
How can you believe

289
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
that kind of thing?

290
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
You said that hypnotizing is science.

291
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
It can help you

292
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
return the subconscious to the scene

293
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
and help you to repeat the scene.

294
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
It's useful.

295
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I've done hypnotizing before.

296
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
And I'm interested in it.

297
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
I'm going to learn it.

298
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Come on, girl.

299
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
If you've learned it,

300
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
why don't you try it on me?

301
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
I believe you.

302
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
No, no, no.

303
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm not that good.

304
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
I'm not good at it.

305
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
You can find a way

306
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,600
to help you

307
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
find the most suitable person.

308
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,600
By the way, Li Shuai,

309
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
there's one more thing.

310
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Is there only one girl

311
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
in your school?

312
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Yaqing has a twin sister.

313
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
She was two years old.

314
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
She didn't find her.

315
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Hello, Aunt Hong.

316
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Bu Dai.

317
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
When can you come back?

318
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I haven't seen you for days.

319
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I miss you so much.

320
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Aunt Hong,

321
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
did you go to the temple again?

322
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
My ears are sharp.

323
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Aunt Hong,

324
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm not as good as a teacher.

325
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
I got a lot of information

326
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
from Li Shuai.

327
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Let me tell you.

328
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Li Shuai said

329
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
the murderer didn't die at all.

330
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
When he was in love with Li Shuai,

331
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
he was still in love with him.

332
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,600
He didn't die?

333
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
He really didn't die?

334
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
Yes.

335
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Isn't it normal that he didn't die?

336
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Aunt Hong, what's wrong with you?

337
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
Aunt Hong.

338
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
Aunt Hong.

339
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Aunt Hong.

340
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Where are you going?

341
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
To the practice room.

342
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
Practice room?

343
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
No, no, no.

344
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Stay a few more days.

345
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I'll treat you to dinner.

346
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Next time.

347
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
I have time.

348
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Next time?

349
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
You're still here?

350
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Go to the airport.

351
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Go to the airport.

352
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Aunt Hong.

353
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Mo Dai.

354
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Aunt Hong, you've been sleeping for a long time.

355
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Are you all right?

356
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
When did you come?

357
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I came back early.

358
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm fine.

359
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I...

360
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
The sun is too high today.

361
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I got a headache and got a car accident.

362
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
But it's all right.

363
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't worry.

364
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
It's all right.

365
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Go.

366
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Okay.

367
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I'll go downstairs and have a look.

368
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Call me if you need anything.

369
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Aunt Hong.

370
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
May I help you?

372
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
No, you're not.

373
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I'm fine.

374
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
I'm fine.

375
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Thank you.

376
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You're welcome.

377
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Please, have a drink.

378
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm fine.

379
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
You're fine.

380
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm fine.

381
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Thank you.

382
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Thank you.

383
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,600
You're welcome.

384
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm fine.

385
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Thank you.

386
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm fine.

387
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
Thank you.

388
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Thank you.

389
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
How?

390
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
How?

391
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Husband.

392
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Husband.

393
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Where is he?

394
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
You haven't paid the bill yet, have you?

395
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,600
No, no, no.

396
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
He...

397
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Let me see.

398
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Mayka?

399
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Okay.

400
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Change the word and you'll get it.

401
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
You bastard, don't look at me!

402
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
No, no, I...

403
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
I won't look at you.

404
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I'm serious.

405
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I... I...

406
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
I don't think he's that...

407
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
Husband, he ran away.

408
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Don't chase him.

409
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,600
Husband, don't look at me like that.

410
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
I can't afford it.

411
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,600
I...

412
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
I can't chase him.

413
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Just kidding.

414
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I'll try my best.

415
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Husband, you're so stubborn.

416
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Go.

417
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm so good at this.

418
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Husband, I can't hold your eight-day job.

419
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
My hand is broken.

420
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Save me, save me.

421
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Save me now.

422
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
Husband.

423
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Husband.

424
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
What are you thinking about?

425
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Husband.

426
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Husband.

427
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Let go of me.

428
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Don't always bully Yisan.

429
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
We didn't bully her.

430
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Uncle Zhang has been busy for a long time.

431
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
You should ask him to help.

432
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
I'm not.

433
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Go, go, go.

434
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Go and chase him.

435
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Come up here. I have something to tell you.

436
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
He's chasing a pig.

437
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Uncle Zhang, don't be so happy.

438
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
I'm not going to tell you.

439
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Uncle Zhang is also a pig.

440
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
He's a pig.

441
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Really.

442
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
You.

443
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Don't always go with Yisan.

444
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Look at you.

445
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
You always call him Yisan, Yisan.

446
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I even forgot his name.

447
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
I call him Yisan.

448
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
I'm always reminding him.

449
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
You helped him pay Yisan 13,000 yuan.

450
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
He has to be grateful.

451
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
He owes me a lot.

452
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I'm sorry.

454
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
He owes you a lot.

455
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
It's not that.

456
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
He has to pay Yisan 13,000 yuan

457
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
for a year in my bar.

458
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
It's quite suitable for him.

459
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
A year in a bar?

460
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Look at you.

461
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
You have to pay

462
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
all kinds of oil and water bills

463
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
for a year.

464
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
He won't

465
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
buy you a paper.

466
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Grandpa Hong.

467
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Yes.

468
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Didn't you fall asleep?

469
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Why are you up?

470
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Mr. Li's case

471
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
is in my heart.

472
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
A stone.

473
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Tell me

474
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
what you've been looking for.

475
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
How about

476
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
you let Grandpa Hong fall asleep?

477
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
How old is the murderer

478
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
in the small river?

479
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
How tall is he?

480
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
He's not tall.

481
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
He seems

482
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
to be this tall.

483
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
That's not right.

484
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
What do you mean?

485
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
It's okay.

486
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Don't eat, Hong Yi.

487
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Eat more.

488
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
The wonderful day has begun.

489
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Here.

490
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
A hand for the student.

491
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
What a nice bag.

492
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
You're so happy.

493
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
You don't understand

494
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
the joy of taking the credit.

495
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
I know how to wipe the table.

496
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
This is the credit card.

497
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Can it be a credit card?

498
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Who gave it to you?

499
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
It's a secret.

500
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Could it be a gift from the audience?

501
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
I saw it in the morning.

502
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
I didn't notice it.

503
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
He's been in bed for so long.

504
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
He must be tired.

505
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
There's a strawberry

506
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
on the table.

507
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
It's a gift.

508
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Uncle Li.

509
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
The powder is quite useful.

510
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
The portrait is drawn.

511
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Really?

512
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Is this the one

513
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
who was in the hands of

514
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
Luo Ren and Luo Ma Huo An?

515
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
He's not that old.

516
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
It's been more than 20 years.

517
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
Maybe he was the murderer's son.

518
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
No way.

519
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
How is that possible?

520
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Luo Ren is really suspicious.

521
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
When I was in the afternoon,

522
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
he followed me.

523
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Later, he bought a bus

524
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
and took the news.

525
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Now, he's following Li Xi.

526
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
He can't be a tourist.

527
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I care about the case

528
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
of the teacher's family.

529
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
He ran to deal with me

530
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
for this.

531
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
It's not a good idea.

532
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Aunt Hong.

533
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
Don't pretend.

534
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
I know everything.

535
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
What do you know?

536
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
What do you know?

537
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
You're Professor Li's daughter, right?

538
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
How do you know?

539
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Is it difficult?

540
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
I saw the photo

541
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
in Li Tan's wallet.

542
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Li Yaqing's photo

543
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
is the same as yours.

544
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Are you okay?

545
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
I was in a police station.

546
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
The teacher had a double-decker.

547
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
One of them was kidnapped at two.

548
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
You were the one who was kidnapped, right?

549
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
When I grew up,

550
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
I found out that something happened

551
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
in the house.

552
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
So I kept on investigating.

553
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Right?

554
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,600
What's so hidden?

555
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
It's really so dangerous.

556
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
You little spirit.

557
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
You can't hide anything from me.

558
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
But

559
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
I think this matter

560
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
is pretty serious.

561
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Think about it.

562
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
The murderer committed so many crimes.

563
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
He was a total liar.

564
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
I think he's a little bit

565
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
perverted.

566
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
He might

567
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,600
have found you a bastard.

568
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
He thinks he didn't

569
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
do anything clean.

570
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
He wants to finish it.

571
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
You're right.

572
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
But

573
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
he's been looking for you.

574
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
He can't keep the house.

575
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
How can he?

576
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
He's a human being.

577
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Maybe I can save him

578
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
and send him to the court.

579
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
We'll have to check the security

580
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
tomorrow night.

581
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
But we can't be too clear.

582
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
And

583
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
he's still calling

584
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
at night.

585
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
Hello.

586
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Hello.

587
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
He won't come tonight.

588
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
He won't come tonight.

589
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Go to bed early.

590
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
See you tomorrow.

591
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
You're too small.

592
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
See you tomorrow?

593
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Do you think I'm a pervert

594
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
or a pervert?

595
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
You're a pervert.

596
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
You're a pervert.

597
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
You're a pervert.

598
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
You're a pervert.

599
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I'll wait for you.

600
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Sister.

601
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
Let me ask you something.

602
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Who are you calling?

603
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm Huang Da Hai.

604
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I'm sorry, handsome.

605
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Let me ask you something.

606
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I live here in Mu Dai.

607
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Mu Dai?

608
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,600
You're looking for him?

609
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Why are you here?

610
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
I'm looking for you.

611
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
You're so mean.

612
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
You're so mean.

613
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
You're so mean.

614
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Did you steal something

615
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
and put it in your bag?

616
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
You're being beaten up.

617
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Look at you.

618
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
You're so mean.

619
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm just a pervert.

620
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
I'm just a pervert.

621
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
I'm not good

622
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
with my grandchildren.

623
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
You have to be a pervert in the hospital.

624
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
You have to be nice to your wife.

625
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
You're so nice to your wife.

626
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
You're so mean to her.

627
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
She's trying to save her life.

628
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
She's stealing people's money.

629
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
She's a pervert.

630
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm going to stop her.

631
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
Don't do anything.

632
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
You still want to beat me?

633
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
I don't believe you.

634
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
You're so good.

635
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
It's true.

636
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I can blame them.

637
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
They should be locked up.

638
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,600
They're so mean.

639
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
If they're locked up,

640
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,600
they'll arrest the police.

641
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm sorry.

642
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Mr. Hu,

643
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
this is your friend from the outside world.

644
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
His name is Cao Yanhua.

645
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,600
His name is Hong Yi.

646
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
Yi.

647
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Hello.

648
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
His name is Uncle Zhang.

649
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Yi.

650
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Hello.

651
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
No, no, no.

652
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
He's from the outside world.

653
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
He's from the outside world.

654
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
He's from the outside world.

655
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Yes.

656
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Did you set your place?

657
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
He hasn't set it yet.

658
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Did you set it?

659
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
No.

660
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
How about this?

661
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Don't waste that money.

662
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
I remember that the room

663
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
is in the high ground, right?

664
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Isn't the upper floor empty?

665
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Madam, I'll arrange it.

666
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
We'll have a drink together.

667
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
We'll meet for a few hours.

668
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Good.

669
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I didn't hear it clearly.

670
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Your name is Cao Yanhua.

671
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
I'm Cao Xiong.

672
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Is he a bad guy?

673
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Brother Fan.

674
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Yes.

675
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Brother Cao,

676
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
where are we?

677
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
We'll use the gold to make a hole.

678
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,600
What do you think?

679
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
What do you mean?

680
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Gold to gold.

681
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Right.

682
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
It's a good idea.

683
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
You two are really...

684
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Cao Yanhua, come back.

685
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Mudan.

686
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
Mr. Cao is a classmate.

687
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
You should be polite.

688
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Look at your ugly face.

689
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
The table in the window

690
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
just came in.

691
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Go and order for him.

692
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Give me some.

693
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
I'll try.

694
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Hello, sir.

695
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
What would you like to drink?

696
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Any recommendations?

697
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
If you like to drink a few drinks,

698
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
the taste of a fried chicken is good.

699
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
The spicy stew is also good.

700
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
And I feel...

701
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,600
How do you feel about the few drinks you recommended?

702
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Let's talk somewhere else.

703
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Sorry.

704
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
I'm here to drink.

705
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
I'm not here to talk to you.

706
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Don't touch my red-banded hair.

707
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,600
Boss.

708
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Red-banded hair.

709
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
It's Luo Ren.

710
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
You're a friend, right?

711
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,600
Do you remember me?

712
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,600
My name is Luo Ren.

713
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,600
We used to be neighbors.

714
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Neighborhood?

715
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Do you remember?

716
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
My family lives in the Lake of Lu Ma

717
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
and is close to No. 11.

718
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
I remember there was a rain.

719
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Your father helped you

720
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
to repair the rain.

721
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
I remember now.

722
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
The bean is so big.

723
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
I almost didn't recognize you.

724
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
How are you?

725
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Is your father okay?

726
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
My father?

727
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Yes, your father.

728
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
He's fine.

729
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
That's good.

730
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I'll treat you to a cup of tea.

731
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Okay.

732
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Aunt Hong.

733
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Don't worry.

734
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
It's okay.

735
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
We'll be there.

736
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Let's go.

737
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
It's really a neighbor.

738
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Why are you here alone?

739
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
I should be the one to get the result.

740
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Don't you have a companion?

741
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Com companion?

742
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
The small river.

743
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Half-night, the sun.

744
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
You even used up your companion.

745
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Don't you remember?

746
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
Why didn't he come?

747
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
I don't remember.

748
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,600
You seem to be looking forward to him coming.

749
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
He's not dead yet?

750
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
He's alive.

751
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
He's still alive.

752
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,600
You know who Lu Mahuan is, right?

753
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
You're not my real son.

754
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Someone's coming.

755
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Hurry up!

756
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Look, Aunt Hong.

757
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Mu Tai, stop chasing.

758
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
Look!

759
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
Aunt Hong, are you okay?

760
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Are you hurt?

761
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I'm fine.

762
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm fine.

763
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
I'm fine.

764
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
I'm fine.

765
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
I'm fine.

766
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
What's wrong?

767
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Nothing.

768
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
You're so surprised.

769
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Mu Tai, I can let you go.

770
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
But I have a few words.

771
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Please listen carefully.

772
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Diyu,

773
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
I know that the situation just now

774
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
seems like I attacked Huo Zihong.

775
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Do you feel sorry for him?

776
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Diao,

777
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
I've investigated Huo Zihong.

778
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
His family is poor.

779
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
His parents are talented.

780
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
He was born in the second grade of primary school.

781
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
His parents sold his food.

782
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
He went back to observe your red teeth.

783
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Is it similar?

784
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Thirdly,

785
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
I'll let you go now.

786
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
But you don't have to go back.

787
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
If you go back,

788
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
don't blame me for being careless.

789
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
I must make my friends happy.

790
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:52,600
YQI downs

791
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Grandpa Huang,

792
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Dad, I...

793
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Let me see.

794
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
I'm fine.

795
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
I'm really fine.

796
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,600
Don't worry.

797
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Sister, are you okay?

798
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
How's the woman?

799
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
She's fine.

800
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,600
She ran away.

801
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Come, take a rest.

802
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
I'm fine.

803
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm fine.

804
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Luo Mahu is a good person.

805
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
He's in the 12th floor of Chenqin.

806
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
My parents are the cook.

807
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
My second year in primary school is in the middle of school.

808
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
I help my parents cook.

809
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
I go back to observe the cooking.

810
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Do you want to?

811
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
How can you hit him?

812
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Is he that good?

813
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
He must be a master.

814
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
It's hard to meet a person who's a master.

815
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
He must be a master.

816
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
But I've hit him.

817
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
It's harder for you to find a way.

818
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I think it's going to be better.

819
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Everyone is looking at the product.

820
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
They're looking at the rest.

821
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,600
This wood is a person who's worth teaching.

822
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
The price is high enough.

823
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Is it expensive?

824
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
You're the one who said it.

825
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
It's expensive.

826
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
You often say that

827
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,600
you have two or three knives on your side.

828
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
The person who's not good at it.

829
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Worth teaching.

830
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I still have a question.

831
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
I heard it from you.

832
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,600
By the way, how is Ping Ting?

833
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Good.

834
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
She's still the same.

835
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
It's a loss.

836
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
She's a good girl.

837
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
If she's a good girl,

838
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I can't see her.

839
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Look, okay?

840
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Let's find a better doctor for her.

841
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
You're looking for an old man.

842
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Even if you find the real brother,

843
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
you can't help Ping Ting.

844
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Uncle Zheng,

845
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Uncle's case is too powerful.

846
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Ping Ting was also closed too suddenly.

847
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
So I always think

848
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
the case is the key.

849
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
The case is too powerful.

850
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
I'm sorry.

851
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I'm sorry.

852
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
I'm sorry.

853
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
I'm sorry.

854
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
I'm sorry.

855
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I'm sorry.

856
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
I'm sorry.

857
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
I'm sorry.

858
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
I'm sorry.

859
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm sorry.

860
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
I'm sorry.

861
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
I'm sorry.

862
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
I'm sorry.

863
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm sorry.

864
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
I'm sorry.

865
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm sorry.

866
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm sorry.

867
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm sorry.

868
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Who is waiting for you?

869
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
I'm sorry.

870
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
I'm sorry.

871
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
I'm sorry.

872
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
I'm sorry.
