1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Snake

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,000
Fastan

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,220
Super Hyrule

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,780
Wonderful

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,000
Word brake

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Dobin

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,520
The 무 can only be obtained after moving twelveかです

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,760
The smashed coatt 스타일

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:14,480
will literally justматize one of

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,600
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,480
Let's try to prove it.

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,080
In other words, it's meaningful.

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,880
It's also a way to improve the next new cut.

14
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,080
Why should we improve it?

15
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,280
Right.

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,680
It's not a good idea to improve it.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,080
Instead, we should grab the second one.

18
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
This...

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,080
The world and the object are connected.

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,880
I guess there's a possibility

21
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,680
between the new cut and the cut.

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,880
Until now, we've taken two Shanggu words.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
A knife and a water.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,880
The word new cut

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,280
seems to be a way to show them how to do it.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,480
Water can't be controlled at all.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,680
Is there anything in this world that can trap it?

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Water...

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,880
You?

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,680
Blood?

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,880
My blood?

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
I was...

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
Right.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Lu Yu.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Give it to me.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,080
My needs are also good.

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Right.

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,480
Let's try it.

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,480
The first one is the small radish.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,680
Let's start.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
It's here.

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
It's here.

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
Xiang Yu.

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,280
The second one is the small radish.

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Mine?

46
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,880
I'm sure it's fine.

47
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Mine...

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,680
Congratulations.

49
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,880
Congratulations.

50
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,480
The third one is the small fat one.

51
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
What?

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
No.

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Mr. Shen.

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,280
I'm asking for a new one tomorrow morning.

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
I might have a blood problem.

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,080
Mr. Cao, you're too stubborn.

57
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
Go.

58
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,480
Is this...

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
Is this enough?

60
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Yes.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,680
This new one...

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,680
The red one.

63
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,680
Two salt.

64
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
The small one is alive.

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
No.

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
No.

67
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,680
Why...

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Why is this group so familiar?

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,280
Three-eyes-doll.

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Right?

71
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,280
You're so scary.

72
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,680
These are three birds.

73
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680
The one with the three-eyes-doll is the big one.

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,080
The one with the two-eyes-doll is the yellow one.

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,480
The one with the three-eyes-doll is the blue one.

76
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,880
The old one has a talent.

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,280
The color is the colorless one.

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,880
The shape is the silk.

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,680
The silk is the silk.

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,880
Mr. Xi.

81
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
Isn't that too early?

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
It's the elephant.

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080
But it's not.

84
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
It's almost done.

85
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,480
I think I don't need my blood.

86
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
You're so stubborn.

87
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Try it.

88
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Put it on your mouth.

89
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
The elephant is here.

90
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,520
Look for a turban,

91
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,480
and hire an elephant.

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
Hey.

93
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:04,580
Wh...

94
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
At least take a look.

95
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,880
I wondered that

96
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,920
the three-eyes-doll

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,680
were sitting on a wooden chair

98
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,280
in front of the sea.

99
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,680
It may be different.

100
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
That crow

101
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,280
probably is the new warrior.

102
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,040
The system

103
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,960
is the daughter-in-law number

104
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,440
3C,

105
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
I'm going to eat.

106
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Why are you looking for fire?

107
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Why are you eating dog?

108
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
The first one is also a dog.

109
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Is it meaningful?

110
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,440
His clothes are like the 100 years ago.

111
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
And here,

112
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,440
this kind of building is also the style of the 100 years ago.

113
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,440
These two shadows seem to be talking about something very distant.

114
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
But we don't have anything to do with it now.

115
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Muguan, Pingting.

116
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Through the experiment, I think that you five

117
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,440
who is blood type can be together.

118
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Then we can think of a way to get to Pingting.

119
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,440
We should be able to give you the news.

120
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
Pingting.

121
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I don't know what to do.

122
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
I can't hear you.

123
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
Pingting.

125
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
You're very evil.

126
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
You can't get out of here.

127
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,440
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Pingting.

135
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
Pingting.

136
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Dad.

137
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Pingting.

138
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Pingting.

139
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Pingting.

140
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Pingting.

141
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Pingting.

142
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Let's go.

143
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Oh, right.

144
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Mu Dai, buy a new phone.

145
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Let's meet up later.

146
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
I've already thought about it.

147
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Phoenix Little Team.

148
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
How is it?

149
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Let's go.

150
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I've already married a rich man.

151
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
I'm sorry.

152
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I'm sorry.

153
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Let's go, Uncle Zhang.

154
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Okay.

155
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Let's come again next time.

156
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Okay.

157
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Uncle Zhang,

158
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
I didn't mean to.

159
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
Okay.

160
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Let's get to work.

161
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Uncle Zhang,

162
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
I'll go to the team.

163
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
You're back.

164
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Uncle Zhang,

165
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
I'm a little tired.

166
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
I'll go upstairs and take a rest.

167
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
I'll come down and help later.

168
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
I didn't expect

169
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
that you'd meet each other

170
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
when you go to He Pu.

171
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Yes.

172
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
I was wondering

173
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
if it's okay

174
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
to come back

175
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
with Mu Dai.

176
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Uncle Zhang,

177
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
before Mu Dai,

178
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
I was a little worried

179
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
about you.

180
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
I was worried about you.

181
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
I was worried about you.

182
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
I was worried about you.

183
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Did Mu Dai

184
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
suddenly forget something?

185
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
For example,

186
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
he suddenly did something

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
and then suddenly forgot it.

188
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
When we were fighting,

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
I kept shouting at you.

190
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Why didn't you react?

191
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Did you shout at me?

192
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
I shouted.

193
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
You were

194
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
like a pervert.

195
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
No.

196
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
No?

197
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Yes.

198
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
When you drink too much,

199
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
you'll be in trouble.

200
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
You'll be in trouble.

201
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
But when the wine is awake,

202
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
he forgets everything.

203
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
So you'd better not let him drink too much.

204
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Otherwise, you'll see him

205
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
go down the cliff.

206
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Uncle Zhang.

207
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Mom, wait for me.

208
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Don't leave.

209
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Mom!

210
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Mom!

211
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,440
When we were fighting, I kept shouting at you.

212
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Why didn't you respond?

213
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Did you shout at me?

214
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
I shouted.

215
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Now that I pay the money,

217
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I don't need you to remind me.

218
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,440
Last time, Ning Lao said the same thing.

219
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,440
You said that your son would bring money back.

220
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Good boy.

221
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Why are you hiding in the Valley of Waves?

222
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,440
We're the body training, you're the dirty boy.

223
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
But we don't need money in the funeral, do we?

224
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Can't you just give it to me?

225
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
I have a house.

226
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
I know you have a house.

227
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
So I've been so polite to you.

228
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,440
But your son is so generous.

229
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
It's not enough to rent a house.

230
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
Not enough?

231
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
But you didn't expect that

232
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,440
I thought that my old man

233
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
wouldn't have a few pieces of stone in his hand.

234
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Good.

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
That's what you said.

236
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
If you can get it, it'll be easier to do it.

237
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Within half a month, it will be two thousand.

238
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
But if you put it a few times before,

239
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
it won't be a limit.

240
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I really don't have a bottom.

241
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
According to the rules,

242
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
I'll take this one.

243
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I'll take it away.

244
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Let's go.

245
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Cold punch?

246
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
How does this place look like?

247
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
It looks familiar.

248
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
When Ping Ting was just born,

249
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
she was holding a small piece of ice.

250
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
You just saw it.

251
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
It's familiar.

252
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
What do you think?

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
The story about Xinjian

254
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
was all collected in the Cold punch generation.

255
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
We studied Xinjian.

256
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
It's a place that can't be opened.

257
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
So I recently

258
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
studied the local information seriously.

259
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
These are the secrets of Cold punch.

260
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
You take a closer look.

261
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
This kind of pattern,

262
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
the style, the place to play,

263
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,440
is it similar to the Phoenix Bird in Shui Yin?

264
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,440
Is it?

265
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
If you say it like that,

266
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
I'll be in good shape.

267
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I think it's time to go to the Cold punch.

268
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Wait.

269
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
Who do you think it is?

270
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Where are you going?

271
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
I'm done.

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
Don't go in.

273
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
I'll tell you the truth.

274
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
You must be careful

275
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,440
during this time.

276
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
Don't let it fall when you can be together.

277
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
What do you mean?

278
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
You all be careful.

279
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Who knows Xinjian

280
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
has a few points.

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
You can leave it.

282
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
What?

283
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
By the way,

284
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
during this time,

285
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
you must be very careful

286
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
when you are with your partner.

287
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Who is it?

288
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
It's scary.

289
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
How is it?

290
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Mudai.

291
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Are you looking at me?

292
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Come on.

293
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Are you here

294
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
not just for Mr. Lin?

295
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Is it because of your double-dead personality?

296
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
I'm just telling you.

297
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
I think you think too much.

298
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
There is no double-dead personality at all.

299
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
You are just

300
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
too scared and then you are just short-tempered.

301
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
Then I'm not that scared.

302
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
You are fine.

303
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
I'm short-tempered.

304
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Even if you are double-dead personality,

305
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,440
there is nothing to worry about.

306
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
He didn't hurt you at that time.

307
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
And he also took you to the danger.

308
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Isn't that good?

309
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Is it?

310
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I think now

311
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
it's better to be with Luo Ren.

312
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
If he knows,

313
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
I don't know what will happen.

314
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Ping Ting.

315
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Luo Ren.

316
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
I still feel that he is still a problem.

317
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
Much better.

318
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Yes, it's better.

319
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Don't eat people.

320
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Brother Luo.

321
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Where did you just say

322
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
you are going to have lunch with Zheng Bo?

323
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
I'm a little bit sad.

324
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
So many people.

325
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
Exactly.

326
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Fine.

327
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
Fine.

328
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
How are you?

329
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
You are welcome to invest.

330
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
I want to join the stock market.

331
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
I'll think about it.

332
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
You are talking about the white wolf?

333
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Look, look.

334
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
I'm the kind of person.

335
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
No money, no money.

336
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
I have a pig.

337
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
A pig?

338
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
I didn't care about it before.

339
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
There are a lot of them.

340
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
Of course.

341
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
You don't know how big the bank is.

342
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
There must be a pig.

343
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
I'll take it.

344
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
We are one person by one.

345
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
We will definitely be divided.

346
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
We all have pigs.

347
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
It's really good.

348
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
We can all be together.

349
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Brother Luo, I'm here to do it.

350
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
I'm brave.

351
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
But you said that a small person's shouting.

352
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Fu Yuan'er.

353
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
I said, that's not a big deal.

354
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
I want to be the shareholder.

355
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
He shouted.

356
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,440
President.

357
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
What's your heart?

358
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Fu Yuan'er.

359
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
What's wrong?

360
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Don't you think

361
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
the white wolf is very powerful?

362
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Powerful?

363
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
He?

364
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,440
He is more powerful than his face.

365
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
How much money can that pig change?

366
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
He will be in the stock market.

367
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Is this called power?

368
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
This is called dream.

369
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
I'm not sure.

370
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
I'm not sure.

371
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Is this called dream?

372
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,440
It's just a dream.

373
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
At least he dares to dream.

374
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I used to think

375
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
his dreams were random.

376
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
But I didn't expect him to be really persistent.

377
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Look.

378
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
He is not good at talking.

379
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
He is really good.

380
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,440
He said that he would learn martial arts.

381
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
He is really good at it.

382
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
He said that he would work at the market.

383
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Don't you think he is very good at it?

384
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
He is good at it.

385
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
I know that the past is the same as you.

386
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,440
You are holding on to it.

387
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
You are holding on to it.

388
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,440
But I think

389
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
as long as you move forward,

390
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,440
it will be different.

391
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm sorry.

392
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Okay.

393
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
If you have time,

394
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
come with me to the chicken soup.

395
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
You should think about your own business.

396
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
What business?

397
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I can't see it.

398
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
After your wife comes back,

399
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
you and the boss

400
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
will be in trouble.

401
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
Am I right?

402
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,440
Here.

403
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
Tian Tian.

404
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Song Wuniang.

405
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
You are guilty.

406
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
You just let go of the attitude.

407
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
Song Wuniang said that

408
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
it is good to have a gift.

409
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Is it that hard?

410
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Use your strength.

411
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
I'm going to see the store now.

412
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
If possible,

413
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
I'll let Zheng Bo call you later.

414
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Okay.

415
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
If you offend someone,

416
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
you should let go of the attitude.

417
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
I'll tell you the good things about the gift.

418
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,440
Okay.

419
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
Hello, sir.

420
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
What do you want to buy?

421
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,440
Is it free?

422
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
It's free.

423
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Just take a look.

424
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
These are all unique and unique.

425
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,440
I'm a shopkeeper.

426
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
It means I can get

427
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
all the beauty products from women.

428
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
I'll introduce you something good.

429
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
This is called He Huan Jin.

430
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
It's a man and a woman.

431
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
It's a pair of clothes.

432
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
It's a happy purchase.

433
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
Why is there no face?

434
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
It's scary.

435
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Because this is

436
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
the tofu that the lady

437
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
who made it for the guest

438
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
made herself.

439
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
When she made it,

440
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,440
she didn't know the man's appearance,

441
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
so she had a face mask.

442
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
After the wedding,

443
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
she will look good

444
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
when she sees the man's appearance.

445
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
You can buy this

446
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
for your girlfriend.

447
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
She can help you look good.

448
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
She can't be shy.

449
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
But

450
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
if you are single,

451
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
she will forget about it.

452
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Forget it.

453
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
The premonition is not good.

454
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
She will get married soon.

455
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
She can't even see her appearance

456
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
before the wedding.

457
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
It's sad.

458
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
Do you like this?

459
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Not at all.

460
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
Are you interested

461
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
in seeing my treasure?

462
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
The treasure.

463
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Don't lose.

464
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,440
I agree.

465
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,440
It's true that the treasure

466
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
is cheap.

467
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
This pair

468
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
is called Jinxie.

469
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Do you know

470
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
why it's called Lingdang?

471
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
To make it sound better.

472
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
No.

473
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
I don't know.

474
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
I don't know.

475
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
I don't know.

476
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
I don't know.

477
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
She hanged Lingdang

478
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
to remind her

479
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,440
to pay attention to the stage

480
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
only to make sure

481
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
that Lingdang doesn't make a sound.

482
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
That's why she is called

483
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
the real girl.

484
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
This pair

485
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
is called Bu Bu Sheng Lian.

486
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
When she walks,

487
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,440
her feet fall.

488
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,440
She will fall.

489
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
The lotus at the bottom

490
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
will be clearly held on the ground.

491
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
When she walks,

492
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
she will be covered in lotus.

493
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Two pairs are 18,000.

494
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
It's a pair.

495
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
But even if someone

496
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
wants to make this price,

497
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
I won't sell it.

498
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I will wait for the winner.

499
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
Lingdang.

500
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
Is there a pervert?

501
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
I think it's a pervert

502
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
who is a monster.

503
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Those research experts

504
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
who are famous for their skills.

505
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
Miss Lin,

506
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
you are a woman.

507
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Even if you can

508
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
make this price,

509
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
it's just a pair of

510
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
old-fashioned shoes

511
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,440
with a female figure.

512
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
It's like a treasure.

513
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I think

514
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
this kind of thing

515
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
should be kept in the coffin.

516
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Mr. Luo,

517
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
I think you are not even

518
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
respected and polite.

519
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Yes.

520
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
I feel like you are rushing me away.

521
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
No need to send it.

522
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Is this all sent?

523
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Wait a moment,

524
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
or let's have it as prez.

525
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
My pleasure.

526
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,440
No time to do this.

527
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
In case,

528
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
you have to give me a personal report.

529
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,440
Zho!

530
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,420
Such alo

531
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,440
can.

532
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,440
But

533
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
it's never to be known.

534
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,620
You think you can beat me high on breakfast?

535
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,100
Can you at least get me some glue for breakfast?

536
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,580
Werac Gabo and SWhen Heart Uniqueirsty

537
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,900
and our tragicUU.

538
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,900
Mr. graphics team,

539
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,980
Do your best

540
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,820
I will support K. Scasd's dream

541
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,120
Right. Just our dream

542
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,880
Ok

543
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,700
Anything dear,

544
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,060
Have a seat.

545
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,700
Back at puallart!

546
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,080
I hold it all up

547
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,540
We make aön and save the whole money

548
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,660
All in half a second

549
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Second, let's name it.

550
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,440
I'm a good actress.

551
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Say it.

552
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
Feng Huang is so sweet.

553
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
My god, that's so funny.

554
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
I'm not that sweet, really.

555
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I think that's a good name.

556
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
Right, Cao Xiu?

557
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Don't support me.

558
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,440
How about calling me Feng Huang?

559
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
We're Feng Huang and Xiaofen, right?

560
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Yes, I think so.

561
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
I like you.

562
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,440
I'm a teacher.

563
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
I'm a senior.

564
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
I'm a senior, too.

565
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Okay, Feng Huang House is good.

566
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Okay, that's the name.

567
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Let's wish Feng Huang House a happy new year.

568
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Happy new year.

569
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
Happy new year.

570
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,440
And, wish Mu Dai and I a successful new year.

571
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Okay.

572
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
Let's eat.

573
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Sure.

574
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
The bowl is here.

575
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
My mission is done, right?

576
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
Let's go.

577
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Okay.

578
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
This soup...

579
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Remember to add some salt.

580
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Yes, this soup is better.

581
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
I like it.

582
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Sorry.

583
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
I didn't see the fire after work.

584
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,440
He's going to open the private security.

585
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
Is he short of money recently?

586
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
No, right?

587
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
He's getting older,

588
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
how can he lose money?

589
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,440
Old man Yan is the treasure of the old man.

590
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,440
The treasure of his private security

591
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,440
is the treasure of the old man.

592
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
He's going to open the security.

593
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
He must have something to do with it.

594
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,440
He said he'd add some red sand to the chicken.

595
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
I guess he's getting old.

596
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,440
He's dying of a sudden.

597
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
He wants to give the red sand a hand.

598
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
What are you doing?

599
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
It's working.

600
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
You're making me dizzy.

601
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Moer.

602
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Where's the specific location?

603
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
I just want to tell you this.

604
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm so convinced that this old man Yan

605
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,440
told me where he was.

606
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
He told me where he was.

607
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
He said he had a few provinces.

608
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I asked him if he had any specific location

609
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,440
to tell me.

610
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
He told me the location.

611
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
Guess what he said.

612
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,440
The location is not to be said.

613
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,440
It's the rule of the treasure.

614
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,440
The red sand is still not revealed.

615
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
What's the question?

616
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,440
He said he's not taking the loan.

617
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
You can't ask him about it.

618
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm not telling you.

619
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
He used the man's name in the beginning.

620
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,440
The man's name is not a location.

621
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,440
It's just that...

622
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Old man Yan is a man.

623
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
It's not interesting.

624
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
I agree.

625
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
But the red sand told me

626
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,440
that he was sorry for Mo Dai.

627
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
My grandpa is such a temper.

628
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
He's so modest.

629
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
I can't help him.

630
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
I guess

631
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,440
he's really a rule of the treasure.

632
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
You're right.

633
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
I'm not sure.

634
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
I'll just say it.

635
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
You're right.

636
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
Mo Dai.

637
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Where's my mom?

638
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
Let me go to Hong Shan An.

639
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
I need to take a nap.

640
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
I'll be back.

641
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
I'll pick up the money.

642
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
I'll be busy with all the things you've got.

643
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
Okay.

644
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
I'll go back and have a look.

645
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
San San.

646
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm going to leave now.

647
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I'll make a couple of promises.

648
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
What do you want me to make?

649
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
A good cooperation.

650
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
A good cooperation.

651
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Pay attention to the team.

652
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Yes.

653
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
And...

654
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
I'll be back.

655
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
I'll be back.

656
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
I'll be back.

657
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
I'll be back.

658
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
I'll be back.

659
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
I'll be back.

660
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
I'll be back.

661
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
I'll be back.

662
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Yes, yes, yes.

663
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
And you need to send your phone to the delivery station.

664
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
Once an hour.

665
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
So that I can know your location anytime.

666
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
Yes.

667
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Here's your gift.

668
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Take it.

669
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Gift?

670
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,440
Last time,

671
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
your knife saved me.

672
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
I lost it.

673
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
I have money now.

674
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
I'll give you a new one.

675
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
Thank you.

676
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,440
Luo Ren.

677
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Lian Shu?

678
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
What?

679
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,600
I didn't expect to say hello to you.

680
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,000
You're not close to me, right?

681
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
This cake is really delicious.

682
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Try it.

683
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
No need.

684
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
I've tried it.

685
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,280
Hello, I'm Lian Shu.

686
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,920
I'm the boss of Lian Yan store.

687
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,080
Hello, I'm Mu Dai.

688
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,320
Yesterday, Lu Ren came to my store to pick up things.

689
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,400
We talked for a long time.

690
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,040
What?

691
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,480
His taste is quite special.

692
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,240
So I think

693
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,280
his friends

694
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,000
are all interesting.

695
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,960
Yes, his friends...

696
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,080
I'll sit with you if you have time.

697
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,080
Please have some tea.

698
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,880
We're going to the store, too.

699
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,520
We'll have a long trip back.

700
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Okay.

701
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:48,800
Okay.

702
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Almost there, right?

703
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Lu Ren.

704
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Close the door.

705
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Thank you.

706
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,400
Take care of yourself.

707
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Take care.

708
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Goodbye.

709
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:57,980
The

710
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,020
Ufire.

711
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,420
Brother Cao, what's wrong?

712
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,860
Did you just hear the thunder?

713
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,860
Thunder?

714
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,620
Did you change your mind?

715
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,020
I changed my mind again.

716
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,660
Is there still a new mind?

717
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,620
You can see the illusion again.

718
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,460
It means there's a new mind.

719
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,380
The judge said he didn't let us be late.

720
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,420
You and Hong Sha are looking for a way out.

721
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,980
The cloud is deep in the mountains.

722
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,020
The only thing he doesn't understand is that

723
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,420
we'll see the illusion again.

724
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,620
It's almost there.

725
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,020
What's the situation?

726
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,420
It's not like it was in the first place.

727
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
Don't mention it.

728
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,820
His grandpa confiscated Hong Sha's phone.

729
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,220
It's a rule.

730
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,420
I'm an outsider.

731
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,020
He can't just go straight to the scene.

732
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,420
I'm not a stranger.

733
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,020
He can't just go straight to the scene.

734
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,620
But I can't be too reckless.

735
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,820
My phone is on the phone.

736
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,420
I called him secretly.

737
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,020
Where are you now?

738
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,620
I'm on a hill.

739
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,220
He hasn't said it yet?

740
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,220
He's talking to me.

741
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,620
I can't even speak.

742
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,820
I'll go and take a look.

743
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,820
Change the automatic positioning and send the letter.

744
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,020
From now on,

745
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,220
change it to 11 o'clock.

746
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,620
From this positioning,

747
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,820
wherever you go,

748
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,420
you'll be on the hill.

749
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,220
It's not good to go into the mountains.

750
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,620
I'm not sure either.

751
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,420
If you find any signs,

752
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,620
send me a photo.

753
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,220
It's a double-checked letter.

754
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,620
I see.

755
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
Mudan,

756
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,820
keep in touch.

757
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,020
Don't be careless.

758
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,420
What's going on?

759
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,020
What's going on?

760
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
Don't move.

761
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,420
Drive carefully.

762
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,020
I've talked to the boss.

763
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,220
There's no problem with the rent.

764
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Wait a minute.

765
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,020
It's quite spacious inside.

766
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,620
I think I saw a illusion.

767
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,420
It's not convenient to talk now.

768
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
What's the illusion?

769
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,620
Is it the same as the 1130?

770
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,420
No.

771
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,220
The person who saw the head of the window was a man.

772
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,620
It's a woman.

773
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,820
The old man is a woman.

774
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,420
The woman who saw the head of the window was a woman.

775
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,220
The woman who saw the head of the window was a woman.

776
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,220
The old man is a modern man.

777
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
I'm not sure.

778
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,620
It's a modern man.

779
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,420
Can you describe the specific point?

780
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,620
What's the point of that person?

781
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,020
Is it standing or sitting?

782
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,420
The front side.

783
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,620
The person is standing.

784
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,220
He's holding the thing in his hand.

785
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,220
It's quite long.

786
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:13,420
The other arm is hanging up.

787
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,620
What's hanging up?

788
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,620
The basket.

789
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,820
You said he's holding the thing.

790
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,820
It's quite long.

791
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,820
Is it a suit?

792
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,820
Yes.

793
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,220
Do you like this?

794
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Keep your eyes on me.

795
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,820
Wait for my news.

796
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
Luo Ren.

797
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
I thought you were...

798
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
This is amazing.

799
00:35:53,620 --> 00:36:18,660
Friendly

800
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,660
The one that I'm looking for is also low-key.

801
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,660
Anyway, it's very unique.

802
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,660
It doesn't have a standard image.

803
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,660
Then what is this place?

804
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,660
I can't remember the exact location.

805
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,660
Anyway, it's a place with a lot of rain.

806
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,660
It's raining, so I want to go with the rain.

807
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Go with the rain?

808
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,660
The rain that 13000 saw.

809
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,660
It seems that this time the heart is in the mountain.

810
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,660
A place with a lot of rain.

811
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,660
How did this river end?

812
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,660
Da Ya, there's no road ahead.

813
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,660
【 seventeen abandonals 】

814
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,660
Brother Luo.

815
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,660
I'm getting dizzy.

816
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,660
There's still a plate of qing?

817
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,660
I'm sorry.

818
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,660
I'm sorry.

819
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,660
I'm sorry.

820
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,660
I'm sorry.

821
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,660
I'm sorry.

822
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,660
I'm sorry.

823
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,660
Grandpa, do you remember the road?

824
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,660
I do.

825
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,660
It's dark. When can we get there?

826
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,660
Soon.

827
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,660
Follow Grandpa.

828
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,660
There are more than enough information about the village.

829
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,660
There are no police.

830
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,140
Yes, although the

831
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,660
Buwawa is a good person.

832
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
I'm a good person.

833
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,660
I'm really brave.

834
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,660
Buwawa.

835
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,660
Buwawa.

836
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,660
You call that a corpse?

837
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,660
A corpse?

838
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Yes.

839
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,660
No.

840
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,660
Grandpa, we don't see the same police.

841
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,660
What do you see?

842
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,660
There is a hole in the middle.

843
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,660
There is a police.

844
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,660
It's a corpse.

845
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,660
A corpse.

846
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
A corpse.

847
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,660
Grandpa Yan is a old man.

848
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,660
He is going to open the police.

849
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,660
I think he has something to do.

850
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,660
Police?

851
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,660
Hello, Lu Ren.

852
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
You are in danger.

853
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Don't let the police down.

854
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
What?

855
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
You are in a bad mood.

856
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,660
Mu Dai, wait for me.

857
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,660
I'll go there.

858
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,660
What?

859
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Slow down.

860
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,660
It's not easy to get there.

861
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
Grandpa.

862
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Grandpa.

863
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
Grandpa.

864
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
What's wrong?

865
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Pack up.

866
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
Hurry up.

867
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Pack up.

868
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,660
Take it as a token.

869
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,660
Take some stars.

870
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,660
If it was a wild beast, I would have died.

871
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,660
Tian Yan.

872
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,660
Let's go.

873
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,660
Mu Dai.

874
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,660
Don't go to the police.

875
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,660
Grandpa is so naughty.

876
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,660
He doesn't think like that.

877
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,660
It's okay.

878
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,660
I am the one who can't do it.

879
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,660
Let's go.

880
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,660
What's wrong, grandpa?

881
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,660
Something.

882
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,660
Is that...

883
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Is that a ghost?

884
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,660
Don't talk nonsense.

885
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:42,660
Grandpa,

886
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,660
don't talk nonsense.

887
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,660
Don't talk nonsense.

888
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,660
Don't talk nonsense.

889
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Don't talk nonsense.

890
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,660
Uncle Zhang,

891
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,660
The traces of the past

892
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:32,660
Tell me the story of the past

893
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,660
The memories of the past

894
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,660
The black and blue streets of the past

895
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,660
The clear lines of the flowers

896
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:53,660
Tell me the story of the past

897
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,660
The gentle story

898
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,660
In the sea of ​​the brain

899
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,660
A moment of longing

900
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,660
And I'm in the dark

901
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:19,660
The memories of the past

902
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,660
The clear lines of the flowers

903
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,660
Tell me the story of the past

904
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,660
The gentle story

905
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,660
In the sea of ​​the brain

906
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,660
A moment of longing

907
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,660
And I'm in the dark
