1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,140
Bobatom

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What's this?

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This is...

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What kind of shadow is this?

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This...

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This...

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is...

8
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is...

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is...

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is...

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is...

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is...

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is...

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Come!

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Come!

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come!

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ma'am!

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What's wrong?

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Close the door.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Come down.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Come down.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Open the door!

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll open the door!

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's this?

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll kill you.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're dead?

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll kill him.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll find other tools.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll get the knife.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll cut through this toast.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's discuss one match.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's see.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
ador.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll let you今无法遇,

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and just do what I did with all my heart.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He's lost his입,

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
he must stab me if he can.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Open the door!

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Be careful!

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
No one is coming!

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I'll kill you!

43
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Open the door!

44
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Open the door!

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Shao Sen.

46
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,400
Let me open the door.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's this?

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a text.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A sign.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's a sign.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hey!

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Open the door!

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Open the door!

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Open the door!

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Open the door!

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Open the door!

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm coming!

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No!

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Come on.

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Luo Ren.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sister.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Tell me.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What's this?

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And that girl on the stairs.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Her butt.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Can you pull me in from the door?

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I can.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What's this?

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Luo Ren.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's the big deal?

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Her knife.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's heavy.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I feel like I'm in a hole.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That old woman ate us lamb.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I ate it too.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Thank you.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm fine.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm just a little injured.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The doctor should be fine.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Mudan.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You just didn't get hurt.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All right.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The thing is here.

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll take it.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Nothing else?

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Tell me.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Tell me something.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm going to the toilet.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll take the plane back.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please take a look.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We'll take a look.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No need.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's yours.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't need it.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll take it.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We'll go to the toilet.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll take it.

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll take it.

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll take it.

101
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We'll tell you.

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
if I tell you,

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
you'll object.

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ping Ting is my sister.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can't just

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
watch her mouth.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think after Xin Jie gets up,

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll get up immediately.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And my willpower is stronger than Ping Ting.

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Xin Jie

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
can't control me that easily.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why are you crying?

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I have a reason.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You're so noisy.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're so ungrateful.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
After Xin Jie gets up,

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
she's the fake one.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you and Ping Ting

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
so close to each other?

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What if Ping Ting...

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I know.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's my fault.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's my fault.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
you can't control

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the confidence you get.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you're controlled,

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
your business

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is much more than Ping Ting.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know that?

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Anyway, as a friend,

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have to tell you.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Your behavior this year,

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
your attitude

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
towards the plants

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
is very...

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's very wrong.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I know.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Today's matter

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is indeed my fault.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's my fault.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Can you

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
leave in two days?

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Although Xin Jie

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
was trapped after she was bathed,

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't think

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
she's happy.

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Later,

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
we'll call the god

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and ask her opinion.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't be angry.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The third love is still below.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Help me look after Xin Jie.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I owe her an explanation.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't be angry.

159
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't be angry.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're really Xin Jie.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You two

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
can have a rest.

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Have a rest?

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is there any business?

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Meat?

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I know.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do you have anything to say?

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't have anything to say.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have a question.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I have a friend.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He knows a guy.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They're just normal relationships.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This guy

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
talked to him

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and then

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
touched his hair.

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What do you think

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
this means?

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Maybe your friend

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
was dirty and had a hair loss.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He got a little bit dirty.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, no.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I didn't think so.

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He's innocent.

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's a fool.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He's a fool.

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He's innocent.

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He touched his hair.

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He said a friend

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
touched his hair.

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's wrong with his hair?

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I know.

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You must think I'm the one.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But it's actually my fault.

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Fine.

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Please respect each other's intelligence.

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can see

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
your face

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and expression.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're a fool.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's just a fool.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Go away.

203
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Go away.

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Go away.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll take you as my disciple.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Go away.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Master.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can understand, right?

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
a loser.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm just kidding.

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't know

213
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
what's going on in your body, right?

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You're too dark.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You didn't spare me.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You hid it from me.

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Here, here, here.

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Look.

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I can break your house.

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not bad.

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's a big deal.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's done.

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's normal to talk.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Mu Dan.

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What's wrong?

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What are you afraid of?

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Are you recording?

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

229
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Are you going to...

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm going to try to contact Shen Qian.

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's dead.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Do you think it's useful

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to keep the immortal's face?

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You're right.

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You're right.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Didn't we see

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
a light on it?

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You scared me.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's the point?

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I saw it.

241
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's not a light.

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll go ask him.

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't understand.

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What's this light?

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You can't see it in this memory.

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's different from the picture.

247
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a little different.

248
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This picture.

249
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Is there any meaning to it?

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll go get the pen.

251
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll go get the pen.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's done.

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This...

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm done.

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm done.

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What's wrong?

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This...

258
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You're going to draw a little?

259
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What do you mean?

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm busy.

261
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The light is off.

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't see it.

263
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's not bad to draw this.

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What does it mean?

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Is it a three-digit machine?

266
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
A wolf?

267
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a dog.

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What does a dog mean?

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't know.

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's obvious.

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The new sword is in our hands.

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He's in hatred.

273
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How dare he?

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We're three-digit doctors.

275
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He's a three-digit dog.

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What does it mean?

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's scolding us.

278
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Can it?

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's scolding us.

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's not a word.

281
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Four K.

282
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
High light, sensitive.

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And a bulletproof glass.

284
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Water temperature is controllable.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Stabilization is controllable.

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Blue teeth.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
My god.

288
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're going to live in a good house for Xinjian?

289
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's a street.

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Although Xinjian is in the water, she's a teacher.

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But is she really a teacher?

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
How long can she be a teacher?

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
She's a teacher.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
We can't be too careful.

295
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay, okay.

296
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll help you to control her.

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Little lady.

298
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
My god.

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Uncle Zhang asked you

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
when you were going back.

301
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He sent a message.

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's the day after tomorrow.

303
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's see which day the ticket is valid.

304
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He said the day after tomorrow.

305
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Let's see which day the ticket is valid.

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Xinjian?

307
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Sorry.

308
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
She's a good girl.

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
No money.

310
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You're leaving tomorrow?

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's almost time.

312
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're busy.

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can go back.

314
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
How about this?

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'll treat you to lunch tomorrow.

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You'll be able to solve the problem.

317
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a pity that I can't take you out for a walk.

318
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
How about this?

319
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Do you want to go to the desert at night?

320
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You can still ride a camel with a turtle.

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's great!

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I like the desert.

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
A camel.

324
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I like it too.

325
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Right?

326
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You like the desert camel.

327
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The camel is very vulnerable.

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Brother Cao, you don't like camel.

329
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Why?

330
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll ask you.

331
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
How many animals do you have on the road?

332
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Two.

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you have this one?

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Two.

335
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Seven.

336
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Two.

337
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How many people?

338
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't like camel.

339
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I hate camel.

340
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's okay.

341
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They don't want to go.

342
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's go.

343
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Do you want to go?

344
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's so good now.

345
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
After the new year's event,

346
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
people are more relaxed.

347
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's over.

348
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But for me,

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
it's better than

350
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the other animals.

351
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm not interested in the new year.

352
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So,

353
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
it should be great.

354
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
See you next time.

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I wanted to drive you back.

357
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But the doctor told me

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
that I have to go to the hospital.

359
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's okay.

360
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's more important than you.

361
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No.

362
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
We are good friends.

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If you're unhappy,

364
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
you can tell me.

365
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Since you're a good friend,

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you'll be unhappy.

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But after the new year,

368
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
it's possible to see each other again.

369
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You said that

370
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
you don't know when you can see each other.

371
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You said it's so easy.

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
No.

373
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I said that

374
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't know when I'll see you again.

375
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I said that

376
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't know when I'll see you.

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Is there a difference?

378
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Of course.

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Then,

380
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
do you want to see me?

381
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Do you want to see me?

382
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I do.

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I want to see you too.

384
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You're still talking.

385
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What if I don't?

386
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't want to see you either.

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why would I want to see you?

388
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Doctor told me

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
that Pingting

390
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
can't get a good treatment

391
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
at the small mountains.

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He needs to go to the south to get a treatment.

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
When he said that,

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I thought of his interest.

395
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You know that.

396
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I rented a house in Lixi.

397
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I was thinking whether to stay in Lixi.

398
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But he was so worried.

399
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He was afraid that he might say

400
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
that Luo Ren,

401
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
why are you here again?

402
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm not here to talk to you.

403
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Why are you here again?

404
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But it's okay now.

405
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I want to see you.

406
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Please,

407
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
can you take care of the house for me?

408
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll go to the hospital.

409
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's go together.

410
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Okay?

411
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Then,

412
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'll take care of

413
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
the house for you.

414
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why does the illusion

415
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
show up in this room?

416
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What?

417
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Please, let me stay.

418
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes.

419
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Luo Ren.

420
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He should be fine.

421
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm in trouble.

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We're back in Lixi.

423
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's good that Shen Gui said to come.

424
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll go to the car station.

425
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Really? When?

426
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Right now.

427
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Why didn't you say it earlier?

428
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'll go with you if you say it earlier.

429
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's different to see each other later.

430
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How can it be the same?

431
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's a loser.

432
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Who doesn't want to see the first one?

433
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I know why you first met him.

434
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Tell me quickly.

435
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What does he look like?

436
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I haven't seen him yet.

437
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Is it the style of the wind and the earth?

438
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The personality is perfect.

439
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You're so handsome.

440
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Lu Dai.

441
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You're not talking about Shen Gui.

442
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll go to the south to talk about it.

443
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Then,

444
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
maybe it's the same.

445
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Are you coming?

446
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Are you coming?

447
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Boss.

448
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
When you're not confident,

449
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
you can make some fried food.

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You can make some fried food.

451
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Are you Mr. Gui?

452
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
You're so mean.

453
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Come on.

454
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
You have to use your hands.

455
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
You can use chopsticks.

456
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You can use a knife.

457
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You can use a knife.

458
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You can use a knife.

459
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay.

460
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
The body is so thin.

461
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I feel like I can even ride a car.

462
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Where is the detective's house

463
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
in the wind and earth?

464
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Brother Cao.

465
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You've been with me for so long.

466
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Don't you know

467
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
what you're doing?

468
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Are you a spy?

469
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You're so thick.

470
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You can see who's the bodyguard.

471
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
If Shen Gui is like you,

472
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
how can you explore?

473
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Can you explore the cave?

474
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Let me ask you.

475
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Where is the water image you just said?

476
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Is it still there?

477
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Is it still there?

478
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's in the lake.

479
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Where?

480
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's in the lake.

481
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Where?

482
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's in the lake.

483
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Where?

484
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Uncle Gui.

485
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
There are a few shadows.

486
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I didn't see them.

487
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You didn't see them?

488
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Where is the water image you just said?

489
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Turn it around.

490
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Look.

491
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's so miserable.

492
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We can't see anything.

493
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
We can't even see anything.

494
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Is it just Uncle Gui?

495
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Or is it just us?

496
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Can't we?

497
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
He really doesn't feel anything to me, right?

498
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Hang Xiao Ren.

499
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I saw the little wolf.

500
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I saw the little monkey.

501
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I saw the little daddy.

502
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Little San San.

503
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I didn't see anything.

504
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I guess you can see it

505
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
no matter how long you don't need it.

506
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Now it seems that

507
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
two kinds of phenomena will appear after the recovery.

508
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I think it's time to go.

509
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I think it's time to go.

510
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I think it's time to go.

511
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I think it's time to go.

512
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I think it's time to go.

513
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think it's time to go.

514
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I think it's time to go.

515
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
One is the water image in the fish tank.

516
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The other is the illusion you see.

517
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I have a idea.

518
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Didn't the four of us bring it?

519
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
He's also a little angry.

520
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So he's going to give us

521
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
the mental pressure of the family.

522
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Anyway, it's fine if we don't do it.

523
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Who are we going to do it?

524
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Uncle Zheng.

525
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Hello, everyone.

526
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Come on.

527
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Slow down.

528
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Uncle Zheng.

529
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
A little bit of interest in the bar.

530
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Thank you.

531
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Welcome to Lixi.

532
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
That part is also inside.

533
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Thank you.

534
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Brother Xiaodao.

535
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Ping Ping.

536
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Ping Ping.

537
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
No.

538
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You're mistaken.

539
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Brother Xiaodao.

540
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'll show you a treasure.

541
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Come.

542
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Okay.

543
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
My lady.

544
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Everyone, sit down.

545
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Sit down.

546
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You stay and eat.

547
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I have a few more dishes.

548
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Have a taste of my cooking.

549
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You guys eat.

550
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm here to talk to Uncle Guan.

551
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I have to go back to work.

552
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Uncle Guan, I'll go first.

553
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
After eating, you can go.

554
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'll get the cake.

555
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Zheng Guo.

556
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I have something to do.

557
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'll go first.

558
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Take care.

559
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Bye.

560
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Brother Luo.

561
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Are you offended by my little master?

562
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm sorry.

563
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You're being so mean.

564
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm sorry.

565
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I didn't mean to offend you.

566
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
This...

567
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
This...

568
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
What are you doing?

569
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's not me.

570
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I don't know what's going on.

571
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Luckily, the soup isn't hot.

572
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Is it hot?

573
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
No.

574
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'll go first.

575
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You go first.

576
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You two go first.

577
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'll go first.

578
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You two go first.

579
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Is it hot?

580
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Forget it.

581
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't be afraid.

582
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'll handle it.

583
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Forget it, Brother Luo.

584
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'll handle it. It's okay.

585
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Forget it.

586
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'll take it.

588
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
It's okay.

590
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
It's okay.

591
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Come home with me.

592
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What's the matter?

593
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Do you want to talk?

594
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Luo Ren.

595
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
What are you doing?

596
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Don't you need to do anything?

597
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, right.

598
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
We have money.

599
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I brought three cups of water

600
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
from the black sand island.

601
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I brought three cups of water.

602
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I brought three cups of water from the black sand island.

603
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Black sand island

604
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
is a war zone in the country, right?

605
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The quality of the land is poor.

606
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It needs a lot of security personnel.

607
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm hired as a security center

608
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
of a hotel company.

609
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Isn't that the same as me?

610
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I told my senior brother

611
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
to contact me

612
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and also to go to the security direction.

613
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
If you have to say that

614
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
we are a same company,

615
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
it's okay.

616
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Okay.

617
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I've finished talking.

618
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll tell you.

619
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You've been adopted by your family.

620
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Do you remember

621
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
what happened?

622
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
No.

623
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Remember it.

624
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Not much.

625
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I was abandoned by my mother.

626
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I can't remember

627
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
what she looked like.

628
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I remember

629
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
she took me with her.

630
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
She wore a pair of red heels

631
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
and always bowled.

632
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I kept looking at her

633
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
and I was afraid she would fall.

634
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Later, she took me

635
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
to a welfare hospital

636
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
and gave me a peach.

637
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I left.

638
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I waited for her.

639
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
At that time,

640
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I heard the story of Kong Rong.

641
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I thought

642
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
when she came back,

643
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I would give her the peach.

644
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
She must think

645
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm good and filial.

646
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
She must be happy.

647
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
What happened next?

648
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
She was taken to a welfare hospital.

649
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I didn't eat that peach.

650
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Until she

651
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
was completely broken

652
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
and thrown into the trash can.

653
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
After that,

654
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I was allergic to peach all the time.

655
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
After that,

656
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I thought it was quite fragrant.

657
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It was the same行.

658
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It was full of family and half-timbered.

659
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It was true.

660
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I was so happy.

661
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I should have done it this time.

662
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I didn't drink too much.

663
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It doesn't matter.

664
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm happy to drink.

665
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Don't be angry.

666
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Drink it like this.

667
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It will hurt.

668
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I can't drink it.

669
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I can't drink it.

670
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm sorry.

671
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Don't be angry.

672
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Thanks for your support for me.

673
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You didn't let me do anything.

674
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You didn't let me do anything either.

675
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm not here to save you.

676
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You're too focused on your studies.

677
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Can we come slowly?

678
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
How?

679
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
For example,

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
you can go to some new water source to study.

681
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I'm a sponsor.

682
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Very good.

683
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
What do you mean by adding

684
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
salt and vinegar?

685
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Do you think it's appropriate?

686
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Then think about it.

687
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Add some wine, add some chili,

688
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
add some butter, and stir it.

689
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Okay.

690
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
How about I give you a pot of hot pot?

691
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Put it here.

692
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Where are you going?

693
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Go inside.

694
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Go inside and have a drink.

695
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Come on, go inside.

696
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Come on, go inside.

697
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Go inside and have some water.

698
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
What do I do?

699
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Okay, okay.

700
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Don't grab it.

701
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Don't worry.

702
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Ping Ting.

703
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Ping Ting.

704
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Come on, drink some water.

705
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You're so patient.

706
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
No wonder Ping Ting likes you.

707
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You're not like that little brother.

708
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
You don't know what to do every day.

709
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You're so obvious.

710
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You've already had two cups.

711
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I've had this before.

712
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Ping Ting.

713
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Little brother.

714
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
What's wrong?

715
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Little brother.

716
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Can you buy me a princess?

717
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
A lot of princesses.

718
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Okay.

719
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'll bring it to you next time.

720
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
There.

721
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Ping Ting has two princesses.

722
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
You still want to buy them?

723
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You can't always keep her company, right?

724
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Uncle Zheng.

725
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Maybe Ping Ting has a lot of princesses.

726
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
She won't play with these princesses.

727
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
She'll have a good time.

728
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Listen to me.

729
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Ping Ting.

730
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Ping Ting.

731
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You have a princess again?

732
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
That's great.

733
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Now you're angry.

734
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Angry?

735
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Uncle.

736
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Isn't Xin Jian still in that fishing boat?

737
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
We all misunderstood.

738
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
She's not Xin Jian.

739
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
She's just a part-time organization

740
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
that brought out when Xin Jian was gone.

741
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We've never seen Xin Jian

742
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
grow up.

743
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Then...

744
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Will Xin Jian go back to Ping Ting again?

745
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It's possible.

746
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
It seems that the water

747
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
can't control Xin Jian.

748
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
What should we do now?

749
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
There's no way at all.

750
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
At this time,

751
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
our heart will be in danger.

752
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Right?

753
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Find the possible breakthroughs.

754
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Xin Jian is so annoying.

755
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
She's never been good.

756
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yes.

757
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Don't forget.

758
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Except for Xiao San San,

759
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
you three have seen Li Hang Xiao Ren.

760
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
This is

761
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
the information that Xin Jian released.

762
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And this is the only information

763
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
you can get.

764
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
She must have her own meaning.

765
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Then what's the good news

766
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
about Xin Jian's message?

767
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Exactly.

768
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
She's just a bad guy.

769
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
She's not good at this.

770
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Even if she's bad,

771
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
she's still the only clue.

772
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
If we don't

773
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
get this pain,

774
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
you'll see for yourself.

775
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
No, no, no.

776
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
First,

777
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
there's a person who's a good cook.

778
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Second, it's Phoenix.

779
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Third, it's a lion.

780
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And finally,

781
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
it's a monkey.

782
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's like a cat.

783
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
A cat?

784
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It's like a cat

785
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
who's been abandoned

786
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
by his mom

787
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
in the house.

788
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
It's so good.

789
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It's a...

790
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
It's a good sign.

791
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The immortal's guide.

792
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
The immortal's guide?

793
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Your knowledge

794
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
is so fast.

795
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
When we were making the house,

796
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
we had that

797
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
flying-sweeping bridge.

798
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The most common one

799
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
was the immortal's guide.

800
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
We had this immortal's guide

801
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
with a style of architecture.

802
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's all over the country.

803
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's everywhere.

804
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
What should we do?

805
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
There's something

806
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
special about your image.

807
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The hand?

808
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Yes.

809
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's a monkey

810
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
with wings.

811
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
It was caught

812
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
by a hand

813
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
in the image of the monkey.

814
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So the immortal's guide

815
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
was the one

816
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
who didn't have the immortal's guide.

817
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It's like

818
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
missing a monkey.

819
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Where can we find it?

820
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
There's a lot of it.

821
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's like a tombstone.

822
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Let's go back first.

823
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Pingtingzhi.

824
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I'm going to do something wrong.

825
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Don't let him get away from the harm.

826
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Go.

827
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
What should we do?

828
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The water is too deep.

829
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Where can we find it?

830
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Master.

831
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Pingting is a poor girl.

832
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yes.

833
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
My brother said

834
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
he wanted to do something wrong.

835
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
He's a good man.

836
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
He's a good man.

837
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
He's a good man.

838
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
He's a good man.

839
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
He's a good man.

840
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
He's a good man.

841
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
He's a good man.

842
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
He's a good man.

843
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
He can't be trapped.

844
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
He can't be free of the harm.

845
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yes.

846
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Where are you going?

847
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
How can you follow me?

848
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Master.

849
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Master.

850
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Master.

851
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Lu Rui.

852
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Lu Rui.

853
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Don't let him get away from the harm.

854
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Pingting.

855
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Lu Rui.

856
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You're still here?

857
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm going to do something.

858
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Lu Rui.

859
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yes.

860
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Not only that.

861
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
I have other things to do.

862
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I have to pretend to be innocent.

863
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I have to pretend to be a rich man.

864
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Or I'll be more dangerous.

865
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I'll try to make him a soul mate.

866
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I'll make him a real man.

867
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Lu Rui.

868
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
He's your sister.

869
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
He's a human.

870
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
If he's like my uncle,

871
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
at the time of killing him,

872
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
he'd be a real man.

873
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
You should say that.

874
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Don't be so mean.

875
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Let him go.

876
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
From now on,

877
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
you can't come here.

878
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Only the real people know the truth.

879
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Pingting will like it.

880
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Let's go, Yunnan.

881
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Let's go.

882
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The fairy is here.

883
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I know where she is.

884
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I don't know where she is.
