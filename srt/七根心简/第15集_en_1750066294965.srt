1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
Two- pumps

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Put up with it!

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The 2nd part of the Bella afternoon

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
for our family, have a look.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Head gray!

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Come here!

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Lieutenant!

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You are going there?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I found it!

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I found it!

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Here!

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I found it!

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I found it!

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I found it!

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where did you find it?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I found it!

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I found it!

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I found it!

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Here!

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Uncle Lin...

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is the last tiger hunt.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Send it back.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll go get it.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where is Mo Dai?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He went out with you.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why did he disappear?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He...

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't remember.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Think about it.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I said I can't remember.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hurry up and call my dad.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Do you believe I call my dad?

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have so many people in my life.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I hate people who are mean to me.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My friends, brothers, and lovers.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I hate people who are mean to me.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I hate people who are mean to me.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Think about what happened.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you can't remember, I'll help you.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The first time I saw you,

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I felt something strange.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I felt...

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I felt a sense of fear.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I felt excited.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Not only you,

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but also your friends.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They want to escape.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But they want to get close.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't know why.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to get close to your family.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There's a room in the second floor.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I feel very quiet.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But I can't get in without a lock.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
When you came back,

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the situation changed.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I feel like there's a sound

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that keeps calling me.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sis.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The second floor.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's not allowed.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know why that day.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
When I came back,

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I was already at the door.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
My mind kept thinking...

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What did you think?

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Da Mu's dead body.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Where's the body?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The dead body.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Where's the body?

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The body.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Where's the body?

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then...

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I gave it a medicine.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I took it here.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,720
Come here!

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,860
Then she changes into someone spell.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You...

86
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,680
He hit me!

87
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
There's no one inside! He hit me!

88
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,360
He hit me!

89
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,640
Where's the back?

90
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
The back!

91
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
The back!

92
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,480
Don't move!

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,640
He hit me!

94
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,640
I can't get up!

95
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
He hit me!

96
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,200
It's all over.

97
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,400
The doctor will be fine.

98
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,400
We'll go home now.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll go find him.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
As long as Brother Xiao Luo is busy,

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll come and discuss with you

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the time and place record.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Be careful.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The water is coming out.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Isn't the Eighth House's water well-burned?

106
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why is it so repairable?

107
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Women who were burned are also recovering.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They even have a happy life.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The story of the water well

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is the one that is shown in the water.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's a bit strange.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The water well is still burning.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's burning.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's like a fire.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The story is so...

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Is it a story?

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's go back.

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well...

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When you were little,

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you were a good friend to Xiao Yue.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He was also a good friend.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I went to the Moon Mountain.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He drew a lot of paintings in the cave.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He drew them all with your mother.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
He brought you two to play.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's right.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
My mother was praising him.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She would take me to the mountain to play with him.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
A monk was afraid to remember.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You've never played with him since you came to the mountain.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Of course not.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I was happy to play with them.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He taught him to draw.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You taught him to draw?

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What else?

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If a monk didn't teach him to draw,

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
what would he teach him to draw?

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't be so stingy.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He's a little monk.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Can you respect him?

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's angry because he taught a monk.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then you should be angry

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
about what's going to happen next.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I was happy to play with him.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If not,

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
how would my mother let me take him alone?

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How would she listen to me?

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What did you do?

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I didn't do anything.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I just took a mushroom and put it in my mouth.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Then I put my belly on the ground

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and swam around.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're a poison.

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Then she asked him to take you to the house.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm glad that you came to my house.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I shouted and shouted.

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I asked the village people to come to see you.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You should take a good look.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He was hit by a rock.

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're enough!

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I told you

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
he was a living hell.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I originally had a happy family.

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
it was because of him.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He was perfect.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
My mother didn't want me.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
My father found a good mother for me.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You know what kind of life I've been through.

170
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It was all because of that little monk.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He was a living hell.

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Miss Lian.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You don't know their love for you at all.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You have a mother who is kind and kind.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You have a good and good politics.

176
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're kind.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm not.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You've lost them all.

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But they didn't want you.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You didn't deserve it.

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You've been a fool.

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You didn't deserve it.

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
By the way

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
the little monk in your mouth

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is more than you

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
in my opinion.

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That girl is so miserable. She's been hit by a plane.

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Why is she so miserable?

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The police are here.

195
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You look like a total loser.

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She's so miserable.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Is she a human?

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I heard that she's hit by a snowman.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Look at her.

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Look at her.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Her family knows how much she's hurt.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Look at her.

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Doctor.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Doctor.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My son is injured.

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Doctor.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
How is my family?

209
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You're family?

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There are external injuries in the back.

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But the CT check

213
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and the blood in the stomach are not clear.

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The CT check is on the right.

215
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Is that so?

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes.

217
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The CT check is on the right.

218
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Where is the patient?

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He's in the hospital.

220
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
In the hospital?

221
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He's done his surgery.

222
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He's gone to the hospital.

223
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Wait.

224
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The parts are on the bed.

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hello.

226
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Hello.

227
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Hello.

228
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is Zhang Shu here?

229
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No.

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Zhang Shu gave me a note.

231
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He said that the boss is in a hurry to go to the hospital.

232
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He asked me to watch the bar.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I just called them.

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No one answered.

235
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay.

236
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll go to the doctor and ask for information.

237
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hello.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Hello.

239
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He's upstairs.

240
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Can I stay here for a while?

241
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We can check it later.

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

243
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I see.

244
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hello.

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Are you okay?

252
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Fine.

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Would you like to talk to me?

254
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So cousin,

255
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I didn't understand you.

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,700
Hello,

258
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,000
how is the patient and the van sings to your life?

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You must take good care of the child.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So cousin,

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I was 15 years old.

262
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,800
I was adopted by Mu Dai for 10 years.

263
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,880
He was cute.

264
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,000
His personality was also very cheerful.

265
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Mu Dai!

266
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,800
Yours.

267
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,600
Thank you.

268
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,200
Let's go.

269
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,800
I was looking for you just now.

270
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
Where are we going later?

271
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,600
He has a good friend on the class.

272
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,000
His name is Shen Wen.

273
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,800
They are not in their hearts.

274
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,800
They are like one person.

275
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
But later...

276
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,000
Something happened.

277
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
After they were both in school,

278
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
they went to a department office together.

279
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,200
But one night, at 11 o'clock,

280
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,000
they still haven't come home.

281
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,800
They couldn't reach their phones.

282
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
We found the teacher later.

283
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,800
Then we found out that they were on leave.

284
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,000
I and Wenwen's mother started looking for each and every one of them.

285
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
Finally, we found a box.

286
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,600
Wenwen!

287
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,800
Wenwen!

288
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,600
Where are you going?

289
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Mu Dai's phone.

290
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,800
It's okay.

291
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,200
Wenwen!

292
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Wenwen!

293
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,600
That was a piece of abandoned land.

294
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,800
We found it.

295
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,600
We saw it.

296
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,400
Mu Dai fell down the building.

297
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,600
He was bleeding a lot.

298
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Later,

299
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
we found Wenwen in the building.

300
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,600
I asked him.

301
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,400
He died.

302
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,600
He was unconscious for several days.

303
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,600
He told us after he woke up.

304
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,800
That night,

305
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
he and Wenwen went to watch a movie.

306
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
I didn't expect to meet little Wenwen on the road.

307
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,200
So he was sick because of this?

308
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,400
Those little Wenwen were caught and were sentenced to death.

309
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
But the people of the Shen family lost their children.

310
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,400
They were in pain and were nowhere to be found.

311
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,400
So they took the blame

312
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
and went back to Mu Dai.

313
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Wenwen was the golden voice of the class.

314
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,400
He was obedient and obedient.

315
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,000
The Shen family always knew

316
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,800
that Mu Dai was always in the way of Wenwen's escape.

317
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,800
If you didn't take him out,

318
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,000
what would you do?

319
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
Plus, some people said

320
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,800
that actually Wenwen could escape.

321
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,600
It was to save Mu Dai that he went back.

322
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,200
You can't go back.

323
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,600
Go back!

324
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,400
Go back!

325
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Go back!

326
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Go back!

327
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,800
Go back!

328
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,600
Don't kill him.

329
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,200
Go back!

330
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
We didn't go to the class to blame those people.

331
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,800
We all went to Mu Dai.

332
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Go back!

333
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Go back!

334
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Don't kill him!

335
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Go back!

336
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Go back!

337
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Why?

338
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Go back!

339
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Go back!

340
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Go back!

341
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
Mu Dai was hit by Wenwen.

342
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,800
He was very vague about that.

343
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,800
The people of the Shen family

344
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,400
couldn't solve the problem.

345
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,800
It was a default.

346
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
You were the only one who could protect him.

347
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
You didn't solve the problem for him?

348
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
Solve the problem?

349
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
How can I solve the problem?

350
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
He lost his child.

351
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,000
Mu Dai was still alive.

352
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I also tried to save Mu Dai.

353
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,200
But that time...

354
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,600
Mu Dai...

355
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Mu Dai, it's okay.

356
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
It's okay.

357
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,200
Mu Dai, who did this?

358
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,400
Who did this?

359
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,800
Who did this?

360
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,400
Don't be too much!

361
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Mu Dai,

362
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I...

363
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,800
I'm not okay.

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I...

365
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm better dead.

366
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
Don't say that.

367
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
It's okay, Mu Dai.

368
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
You're in the dark.

369
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,800
You're protecting me.

370
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
Until that time,

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
I realized that

372
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
Mu Dai was in a state of mental disorder.

373
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,400
He became more and more silent.

374
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,600
He didn't communicate with anyone.

375
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,800
He was in a state of sleep all night.

376
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
Mu Dai was in a state of sleep all night.

377
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
I thought I couldn't continue like this.

378
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
I took him home

379
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
and went to the doctor's office.

380
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,400
I met Dr. He from then on.

381
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,800
He has been following this disease for eight years.

382
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Yizhi,

383
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,000
do you know Mu Dai?

384
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,800
Mu Dai's disease is very special.

385
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
He has been in a state of mental disorder all night.

386
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Mr. Luo,

387
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,200
I heard that you used to be his boyfriend.

388
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
But now,

389
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
you may get to know him

390
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,400
by hearing and seeing him.

391
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
I suggested that Ms. Huo

392
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
stay with Mu Dai for a day.

393
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
At least, you can shoot some videos

394
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,800
in a situation that he doesn't know.

395
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
In this aspect, we can monitor his situation

396
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
with our whole body.

397
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,400
Mingshao,

398
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,000
what is the matter?

399
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
Why are you looking like this?

400
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Why do you care?

401
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Why are you looking like this?

402
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
Why are you laughing like that?

403
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,800
Pardon me?

404
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Mingshao,

405
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,200
alright

406
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,000
you can leave your sickness to the people that want to harm you.

407
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Leave.

408
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,100
Miss,

409
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
What pain?

410
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
You don't understand.

411
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
You don't understand.

412
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
I really don't understand.

413
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
You're suffering.

414
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
What are you suffering?

415
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,100
Are you the one who killed?

416
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,100
But if I really feel bad,

417
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,100
I want to die.

418
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,100
I want to die.

419
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
This is my body.

420
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
My body.

421
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Okay.

422
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
What can I do?

423
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
What can I do?

424
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Then let's do this.

425
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
And then?

426
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Then he suddenly recovered.

427
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
He recovered?

428
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Recovered?

429
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
Recovered.

430
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,100
Recovered by yourself.

431
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
Just now,

432
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
the double-indulgence.

433
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
His situation

434
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,100
doesn't match the definition of double-indulgence.

435
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,100
Double-indulgence

436
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
is always perfect.

437
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,100
And it doesn't enter each other's memory.

438
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
The situation in the wooden belt

439
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,100
doesn't match any of our current situation.

440
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,100
My conclusion is

441
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
because of this change,

442
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,100
the wooden belt can't bear such a huge pain.

443
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,100
To save oneself,

444
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,100
it can separate from a different self.

445
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
This one,

446
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
we call it

447
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
the black wooden belt.

448
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
rational, calm,

449
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,100
full of enemies.

450
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
This one

451
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,100
is the wooden belt you're familiar with.

452
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
It's warm,

453
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,100
soft,

454
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
and cute.

455
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
The video ends here.

456
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
What does that man

457
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
mean?

458
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,100
A black and a white

459
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,100
are all in the middle of the main group.

460
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
I guess

461
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
the middle group

462
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,100
is standing on top of the white wooden belt.

463
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
But in the video,

464
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
the black wooden belt is more prominent.

465
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,100
That's what it is.

466
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
The result is that

467
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
the two sides are in the same position.

468
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Because the middle is social.

469
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,100
The character of the white wooden belt

470
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
is easier to be accepted by the society and the public.

471
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
And the black wooden belt chooses

472
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
to be the main group.

473
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,100
The silence.

474
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Unless the body is in a very dangerous

475
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
and painful situation,

476
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
it will be in the blood

477
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
because of self-sufficiency.

478
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,100
And the white wooden belt

479
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
seems to not know

480
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
the existence of the black wooden belt.

481
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,100
Because it's far beyond

482
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,100
the body's control.

483
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,100
And now,

484
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
he's back.

485
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,100
I don't want to hear you

486
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
make a big mess.

487
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
I only want to take the wooden belt.

488
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
This way.

489
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Brother San San.

490
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,100
10,000 years old.

491
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
San San.

492
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
What's wrong?

493
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
You're so shocked.

494
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
You've created my art.

495
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Dad, you've created it.

496
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Something happened.

497
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
I'm looking at the illusion again.

498
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Change it.

499
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
It's okay.

500
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
The process is like this.

501
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
I ate very well this weekend.

502
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
So, I want to give the flower pot

503
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
and the soil

504
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
to the body.

505
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
I'll take a piece of it.

506
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Guess what I've found.

507
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
What?

508
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
A hole.

509
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,100
I can still find a hole

510
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,100
when I keep it.

511
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
It's not a normal hole.

512
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
It's...

513
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,100
a dark red.

514
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,100
A dark red.

515
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
There seems to be

516
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
many students

517
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
who are still together.

518
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
They're quite disgusting.

519
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
They're not even out yet.

520
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
Don't be shy.

521
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,100
You said that Xin Xin

522
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,100
is starting to take the medicine again.

523
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,100
What else can she do?

524
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,100
What else can she do?

525
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
What else can they do?

526
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
We...

527
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
We...

528
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
We...

529
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,100
We...

530
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
Brother Luo is right.

531
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
He just said that he's looking for a teacher.

532
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
He doesn't know what's going on.

533
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,100
If we give him a call

534
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
after this,

535
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
we'll let him know

536
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
that we've got the information.

537
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
That's right.

538
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
That's the situation.

539
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
I see.

540
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,100
Keep the scene.

541
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
I'll go back

542
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
when I'm done.

543
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Luo Zhen.

544
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Luo Zhen.

545
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
Well,

546
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
are you okay?

547
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,100
I'm fine.

548
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
She's fine.

549
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Wipe it.

550
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
When Mu is at the office,

551
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
he likes to stay alone.

552
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
You're going to be a teacher

553
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
when you see Mu.

554
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,100
He's...

555
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
He's different.

556
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
You'll know it by yourself.

557
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Has he mentioned me?

558
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Then...

559
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
remember me.

560
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Of course.

561
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
You,

562
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
Cao Yan Hua,

563
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
and the new Red Desert,

564
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,100
he remembers it all.

565
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Don't forget,

566
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
the Black Wooden is a memory

567
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
that can be used in the White Wooden.

568
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
It's just that

569
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,100
there will be some differences

570
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,100
in the relationship.

571
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
If you're not ready,

572
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
just say it later.

573
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
I'm ready.

574
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
I'm ready.

575
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,100
I'm ready.

576
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Alma.

577
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,100
I'm ready.

578
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Do you have any other modes?

579
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,100
I'll play with you.

580
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
I like playing alone.

581
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,100
If you're together,

582
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
it'll take a little longer.

583
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Will it?

584
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Yes.

585
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
What's the difference between the two of you?

586
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
It's not over yet.

587
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Please, wait.

588
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,100
The luck is good this time.

589
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,100
It's passed.

590
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
It's not because of luck.

591
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
This time,

592
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,100
it's your turn.

593
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
I used to encounter things

594
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,100
that I'd do alone.

595
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,100
When I encounter trouble and danger,

596
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
I'm always alone.

597
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Later,

598
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
a girl told me

599
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
that

600
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
I'm too much of a person.

601
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,100
It's very...

602
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
very wrong.

603
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,100
I think she's right.

604
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
It's better for women to be alone

605
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
than to die with you.

606
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
You're a fool!

607
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
What are you doing?

608
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
After I made it,

609
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,100
I thought it was very fragrant.

610
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
It's the same brand again.

611
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
There's a lot of things in the family.

612
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,100
Really?

613
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Heart, heart, heart.

614
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
I should do it this time.

615
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
I can't change

616
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
what happened 8 years ago.

617
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
But in the future,

618
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
I'm willing to face it with you.

619
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
Why do you think

620
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
I'll need you?

621
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Because 8 years have passed.

622
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
You still can't make it.

623
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
I know

624
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,100
that no matter you're still a child,

625
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
you can't let go of the guilt of Shen Wen.

626
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
It's not me who's hurting her.

627
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Why should I feel guilty?

628
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
Why should I feel guilty?

629
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,100
Yes.

630
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Of course you don't need to feel guilty.

631
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Because you didn't do anything wrong.

632
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,100
Shen Wen's responsibility

633
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
shouldn't be taken by you.

634
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
It's not you who's watching the movie.

635
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,100
Chao Xiaolu is not your idea.

636
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
Right?

637
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,100
I think Hong Ying

638
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
knows the details of that day.

639
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,100
Hurry up, Mu Da.

640
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
We can't go to the movie theater.

641
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Wenwen.

642
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Wenwen.

643
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Why don't we

644
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,100
go back to class?

645
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
We can't.

646
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
We can't go to the big road.

647
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
Let's go to Xiaolu.

648
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Okay.

649
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Let's go.

650
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
But you're not guilty

651
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
of doing anything wrong.

652
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
Because of that

653
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Shen Wen

654
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
was

655
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
able to escape.

656
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Don't run.

657
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
You're so heavy.

658
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
You want to kill me?

659
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,100
Come on.

660
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Hurry up.

661
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Come on.

662
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100
Come on.

663
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Let go of me.

664
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Help.

665
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Come on.

666
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Maybe you're helping Wen Zhen.

667
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
This is not a wise choice.

668
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,100
I'm afraid Shen Wen will think like that.

669
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
The only thing I'm sure of

670
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
is that I love this friend.

671
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,100
Come on.

672
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
Come on.

673
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
Help me.

674
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,100
Come on.

675
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,100
Help me.

676
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,100
Help me.

677
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Hurry up.

678
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Help me.

679
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Help.

680
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Help.

681
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Help me.

682
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Go.

683
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
I lost my daughter.

684
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,100
But you should be the real bad guy to bear all this.

685
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Do you think this is the truth?

686
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
I was right.

687
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Without me, Wenwen wouldn't die.

688
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
What do you mean?

689
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Those scum in the capital made them kill the people.

690
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
It was me.

691
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
But President Huo said

692
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
you hurt your head.

693
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,100
You don't remember the time.

694
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
He can't remember.

695
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
But I'm not him.

696
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,100
So you were the one who was on the rooftop.

697
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
You're not stupid.

698
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
He's so weak.

699
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
He made himself a group.

700
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,100
He can't bear such a terrible experience.

701
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
It's me.

702
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
It's me.

703
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
It must be me.

704
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
So the Black Wooden

705
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,100
wasn't the one who was on the rooftop.

706
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
But...

707
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Brother.

708
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Beat him.

709
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
Brother.

710
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Let go of me.

711
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
You still think you know me well.

712
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,100
You said you wanted to make Xinfei happy.

713
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
But you hid your secret.

714
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
You're less than her.

715
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
She hid her secret.

716
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
You're the same.

717
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
You've found out she's wrong.

718
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
But you never asked.

719
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,100
You didn't do anything.

720
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,100
You even said you wanted to face it.

721
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Don't you think you're funny?

722
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
You two are in love.

723
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
You don't know each other's deepest heart.

724
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
You're in love with each other.

725
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,100
You're in love with each other.

726
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
You still wear it.

727
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,100
You'll understand if I wear it.

728
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
What do you mean?

729
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
It's not obvious.

730
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
I'm not your little boy.

731
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,100
He's never coming back.

732
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
Be quiet.

733
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Don't make others suffer.

734
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
Don't torture yourself.

735
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
I forgot to tell you.

736
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:16,100
I passed the exam this week.

737
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,100
The exam is shorter than today.

738
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Don't think you're too important.

739
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,100
It's obvious.

740
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,100
I don't need you.

741
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Maybe you're right.

742
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,100
I don't know you.

743
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,100
But you're the one who doesn't dare to face it.

744
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
Right?

745
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,100
If it's not because of the interrogation,

746
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
what's your heart rate?

747
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
I'll go back and do something.

748
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
If you need any help,

749
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
or if you have any questions,

750
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
just answer them to me.

751
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,100
Let me out.

752
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Hurry up.

753
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,100
It's because there are so many people who love you.

754
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
That's what you're saying.

755
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,100
Don't fight.

756
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,100
It's useless.

757
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,100
I've already solved your life.

758
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
I'm sorry.

759
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,100
I'm sorry.

760
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,100
I'm sorry.

761
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,100
I'm sorry.

762
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,100
