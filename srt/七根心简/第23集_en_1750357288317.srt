1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The End

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The End

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The End

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's so hard to hold.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Move back.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The End

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The End

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's been a while since I've been here.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's go and wait.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The auspicious time has come!

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The End

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why are you looking at that side instead of the stage?

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you for coming to the wedding of Qingshan and Ya Hong.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The wedding is officially starting now.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please stand up, everyone.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please stand in line.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are we doing this?

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Manager Ma, we're following the tradition.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the ancient calligraphy.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please bow to the sky and earth.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Our village used to be a place of fire.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is because we were raised by the mud and earth.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We've been following the tradition for a long time.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Bow to the sky and earth.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Good!

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Exchange the wedding dress!

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Good!

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Good!

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Good!

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Didn't he get dragged here?

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He's smiling so happily.

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Good!

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why do you need a firewood to make it so old?

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's convenient to use a lighter.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The tools in the tactical bag are usually firewood and large-fire stone.

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Although a lighter is easy to use,

42
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
it's a waste if it's in an extreme environment.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Look at this.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The reason why firewood is so hot is to prevent water and to prevent natural fire.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Understand?

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I got it.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You seem to like to teach me how to learn things.

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Because I have more experience than you,

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to teach you everything I know and can.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So that you can protect yourself even if I'm not here.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What happened when you said you wouldn't go to Cao's Village with us?

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:22,960
Do you remember I told you that I was a

54
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
I thought it was over.

55
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
But I got the news recently.

56
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
He has a plan to revenge me.

57
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
And his method is to kill the people around him.

58
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
So...

59
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
No wonder you're so nervous.

60
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
But the person who can make you nervous

61
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,960
shouldn't be a little character.

62
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
You're so mean.

63
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
You're so mean.

69
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
My master always said

70
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,960
that the bad things will be done by the innocent women.

71
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
But don't worry.

72
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
I'm a very good person.

73
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
I can help you protect the people around you.

74
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
So good?

75
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,960
And I can work together with my master and senior.

76
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Don't worry.

77
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,960
I'll play something nice for you.

78
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
What's wrong?

79
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
It's okay.

80
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Look.

81
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
How did you do it?

82
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Why can I only play the flute?

83
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I won't tell you.

84
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
It's a family thing.

85
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
You won't tell me anything?

86
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I've made up my mind.

87
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
I won't pass on the male to the female.

88
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
I won't pass on the male to the female.

89
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
I won't pass on the male to the female.

90
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
I won't pass on the male to the female.

91
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
Why did I offend you?

92
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,960
I've learned that I can chase girls.

93
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I don't need to learn.

94
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
I can just chase them.

95
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Okay.

96
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
It's almost done. Let's take a look.

97
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
It's not a knife.

98
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
It's a stone.

99
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
I thought it was mud.

100
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
It's easy to dig.

101
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
The mud that blocked the hole

102
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
must have come from outside.

103
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Let's go down and have a look.

104
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
It's not a knife.

105
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
It's a stone.

106
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
It's not a knife.

107
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
It's a stone.

108
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
It's not a knife.

109
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
It's not a knife.

110
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll go down first.

111
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Okay.

112
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
If you have any problems,

113
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
just tell me.

114
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I'll give you a toast.

115
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Come on.

116
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Thank you.

117
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Enjoy your meal.

118
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Cheers.

119
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Come on.

120
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Come on.

121
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Come on.

122
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Come on.

123
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Cheers.

124
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
Cheers.

125
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Cheers.

126
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Cheers.

127
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Okay.

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Thank you.

129
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Thank you.

130
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Let's go.

131
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Come on.

132
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Everyone has bought the wine.

133
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Come on.

134
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Come on.

135
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
What's wrong?

136
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Come on.

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Yafeng.

138
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I'm okay.

139
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
I drank too much.

140
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
It's okay.

141
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
Let's drink.

142
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Come on.

143
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Cheers.

144
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
It's better to drink.

145
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Come on.

146
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Come on.

147
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
He's not interested in me.

148
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Is he talking about Yafeng?

149
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Let's drink.

150
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Where's Cao Jin Hua?

151
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Wine.

152
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Wine.

153
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Come on.

154
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Everyone, hold it.

155
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Come on.

156
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Thank you.

157
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Come on.

158
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Cheers.

159
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Cheers.

160
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Cheers.

161
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Cheers.

162
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Cheers.

163
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Cheers.

164
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
It's really you.

165
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Cao Zudong.

166
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
What's wrong with you today?

167
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Jin Hua.

168
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
I can't afford to drink with you.

169
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Let me go.

170
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
I really want to get married.

171
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
You didn't do anything wrong to anyone, did you?

172
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
You're so kind.

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm sorry for you alone.

174
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I'll compensate you later.

175
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Please let me go.

176
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Don't worry about me.

177
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Cao Zudong.

178
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
I can help you.

179
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
But don't think too much.

180
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I won't forgive you.

181
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm not a human.

182
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Don't cry.

183
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
He's been buried alive for a long time.

184
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
He's not a good person.

185
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Buried alive?

186
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
I'll tell you a short story.

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
After I entered the village, the first person I met was Wan San.

188
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
The second person was you.

189
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
There is no news of Lu Ren and Mudan.

190
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Have you seen them?

191
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Where?

192
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Where?

193
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
I've seen them.

194
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
But they're in the county.

195
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
You don't know the hole is so deep.

196
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
I guess they're together.

197
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
No.

198
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
They're so good at martial arts.

199
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
They'll be fine.

200
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
You can't leave him here.

201
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
It'll be a trouble if he wakes up.

202
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
And I just tested them.

203
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
It's not that simple.

204
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
That mute is a problem.

205
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,960
You take him to the wooden house under the hill.

206
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
We'll meet there.

207
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Be careful.

208
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Be careful.

209
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
There's still a change?

210
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Brother.

211
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Brother.

212
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Oh no.

213
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
No one.

214
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
I'll go to the other side.

215
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Wait.

216
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Wait.

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I can't move him like this when he's young.

218
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
How far is the cave?

219
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
It's not far.

220
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,960
The egg is in the middle of the mountain.

221
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Let's go.

222
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Why are you carrying him?

223
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Why?

224
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
What if he wakes up?

225
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
He'll tell everyone in the village that he saw grass and soil.

226
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,960
And he was kidnapped by the mountain.

227
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
What should we do?

228
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I can't give up the gold flower if I do what my father said.

229
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
There seems to be something in front of us.

230
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Wait.

231
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
This is...

232
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Mu Tai, there's an accident.

233
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Mu Tai.

234
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
This is a tomb, right?

235
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Yes.

236
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
You're an iron man.

237
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
In ancient times,

238
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
you were killed by a pit.

239
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
I'm not an iron man.

240
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm an iron man.

241
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
I'm an iron man.

242
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
I studied ancient words.

243
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
It's written as the seven stars return.

244
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Seven stars return.

245
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Mu Tai, I'm afraid the cave is related to the seven stars.

246
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,960
The priest said that

247
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
one star represents one star.

248
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Seven stars represent seven stars.

249
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
I suspect that

250
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
they all come from the seven stars of the sky.

251
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
What does it mean that the seven stars return?

252
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Are all seven stars out?

253
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
I'm not sure.

254
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
And he said that the palace was lost.

255
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Did he not succeed in returning?

256
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
He was trapped in the pit.

257
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
He was tied to the top of the rock.

258
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
He was left without a way out.

259
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
The star king fell.

260
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
The priest died to train him.

261
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
The star king?

262
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
Is the star king

263
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
the one who was sacrificed by the seven stars?

264
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I think so.

265
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
Then he shouldn't be called the star king.

266
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,960
He's a man of great power.

267
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Then he shouldn't be called the star king.

268
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Don't forget that

269
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
the ones who were sacrificed by the seven stars

270
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
are all superpowers.

271
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
This Buddha should be the meaning of the Buddha.

272
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
It should be the one who was followed by the star king.

273
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Look.

274
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
There's a star on the Taoyongmingju.

275
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
There's an organization here.

276
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
And the people who were buried here

277
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
are all superpowers.

278
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Where did the sacrifice and the people come from?

279
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
I think

280
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,960
it should be the one who was killed by the pit.

281
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,960
He should have escaped.

282
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
He dug through the tunnel.

283
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
So he escaped.

284
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
At that time, there was no flip-flop.

285
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
It was a natural exit.

286
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Then he came back.

287
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
So there was a closed window

288
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
and an old friend.

289
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Finally, the wind blew

290
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
and the flip-flop was installed.

291
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
He should have come back.

292
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Why did he install the flip-flop?

293
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
He wanted to come back to worship.

294
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
He was afraid that someone else would break in.

295
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
So he installed the trap.

296
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Then those two bones

297
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
are the ones that were buried here?

298
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Poor thing.

299
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Do you think there's a clue?

300
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Let me see.

301
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Help me get it.

302
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
You can't move it, can you?

303
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
Be careful.

304
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Be careful.

305
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I can't move it.

306
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
It's heavy.

307
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
I need more professional tools.

308
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Did you get it?

309
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
No. Hurry.

310
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
It's almost done.

311
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
How is it?

312
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
Hurry.

313
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Let me tell you.

314
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
The 13,000 yuan is wrong.

315
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
The heart is not on the mountain.

316
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
I should have done something about the cultural relics.

317
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
That man was so good at acting.

318
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
I really thought he was a monster.

319
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
I was so surprised that I brought him here.

320
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
I can't do it.

321
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
I can't do it.

322
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
I need to rest.

323
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,960
Don't worry.

324
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
I can't do it.

325
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Aren't you tired?

326
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Fatty, you're the only one.

327
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Am I not the only one?

328
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Tell me.

329
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
If you disappear,

330
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
will your good friends

331
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
come to save you?

332
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Brother.

333
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,960
It sounds like

334
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,960
you're not as good as the last few.

335
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
I'm not that good.

336
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
I just got tired of the firecracker.

337
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
I can't hold it.

338
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I was trapped in the cave.

339
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I couldn't even fold my legs.

340
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
I was watching him

341
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
and Luo.

342
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
He was trapped.

343
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
He's still alive.

344
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Let's go.

345
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Did you see that?

346
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
We're here.

347
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Wait for me.

348
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm used to it.

349
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Where's the trap?

350
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
Don't.

351
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
It's right here.

352
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
It's alive. Don't fall.

353
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Where's the switch?

354
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
I was trapped on the rock.

355
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
They were fighting over there.

356
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
I fell down.

357
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
I remember that

358
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
the Green Hills Committee was over there.

359
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Yes.

360
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
You must be careful.

361
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
If you fall, we're all dead.

362
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Did you find it?

363
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
It's the same as the rock.

364
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
It's hard to find.

365
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Can you tie the rope?

366
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
Don't fall.

367
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
It's a secret.

368
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
It's hard to untie.

369
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Here.

370
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Give me a hand.

371
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
I'll help you.

372
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Here.

373
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
It's alive.

374
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
It's alive.

375
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Pull it again.

376
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Don't break the gold.

377
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
What if you break it again?

378
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
It's not a good kid.

379
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
It'll beat me up.

380
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
The risk is everywhere.

381
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm glad I bought insurance.

382
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,960
80% of the payment.

383
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
If I stay in the hospital,

384
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
I'll get a 120 yuan subsidy.

385
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Manager Ma.

386
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Really?

387
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
I don't know.

388
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Keep looking.

389
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
I'll hold it when I'm in a daze.

390
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Jin Hua.

391
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Why?

392
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
We're not good people.

393
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
I mean, we can't do anything good.

394
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Look at me.

395
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
I'm not a bad person.

396
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
You fainted.

397
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,960
I'm not mad at you.

398
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
I can't do it.

399
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
I'll take care of it.

400
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Jin Hua.

401
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
I'm sorry to have you in here.

402
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
I'll pay for the medicine.

403
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
I'll take care of you

404
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
if you have any sequelae.

405
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Manager Ma.

406
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
What are you looking for?

407
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
The mechanism.

408
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
I can't find it.

409
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
What about the floor?

410
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
The floor?

411
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,960
Let's go.

412
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,960
This must be it.

413
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
What's going on?

414
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Where's the bag?

415
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,960
This is a dead end.

416
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
It's okay.

417
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I believe we can get out.

418
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
You have to believe

419
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
that our friends

420
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
will come to save us.

421
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
You're a sweet tooth.

422
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
You make me happy.

423
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
Although we haven't met yet,

424
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
let's have a bite.

425
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
You eat first.

426
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,960
You haven't eaten anything.

427
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
I ate.

428
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
You didn't eat.

429
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
I'm done.

430
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Come on.

431
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
Be careful.

432
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
One, two, three.

433
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Did you press it?

434
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
I've been pressing it.

435
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
You have to press it again.

436
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
My lamp is always like this.

437
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
It's always on.

438
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Don't let go.

439
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
I'm sorry.

440
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
You press it together.

441
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
You step on it.

442
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Is it okay?

443
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Red light!

444
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Manager Ma!

445
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
No.

446
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
It's red light.

447
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
I'm sorry.

448
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
I didn't hit you.

449
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
It's a bath tub.

450
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Red light!

451
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Are you okay?

452
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
They're fine.

453
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
What did I say?

454
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
We're fine.

455
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
We're fine.

456
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
No.

457
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
There's a trap here.

458
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
There's someone down there.

459
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
There's someone down there?

460
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
I'm exhausted.

461
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
You two.

462
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
You didn't even dream of it.

463
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm a little angel.

464
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
I'm falling from the sky.

465
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
You're in a fire.

466
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
If you're okay, come up.

467
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Qing Shan and Ya Feng will come.

468
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
We can't keep an eye on them.

469
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Aren't they at the wedding?

470
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Why are they here?

471
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
I'll explain it to you later.

472
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
All right.

473
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,380
Jinhua.

474
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,000
Cover me.

475
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,540
You have to be like me.

476
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540
Be brave.

477
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,760
Cover the door.

478
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,300
Close the door shut.

479
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
Okay.

480
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,300
Grab the rope and stabilise your legs.

481
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,300
What?

482
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,300
What?

483
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,300
What?

484
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,300
Tianshan!

485
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,300
Tianshan!

486
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
Stop!

487
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,300
Stop!

488
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
It's not my fault.

489
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Stop!

490
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,300
Stop!

491
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,300
Stop!

492
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Stop!

493
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,300
Stop!

494
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,300
Stop!

495
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
Stop!

496
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Hongxiao!

497
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,300
What's going on?

498
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Are you hiding something?

499
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Tao Jinhua!

500
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
Don't let him get away!

501
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
No!

502
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Mudan!

503
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
We can't hold on anymore.

504
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Can we get back to the city?

505
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
No, I can't.

506
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,300
I can't climb fast.

507
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Let's use the rope.

508
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Give me the rope!

509
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Don't touch me.

510
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Are you done with the backpack?

511
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Yes.

512
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Give me the backpack!

513
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
Yafeng!

514
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
I'm fine.

515
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,300
You don't have to come to see me.

516
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Yafeng!

517
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
Yafeng, I know you're a good person.

518
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,300
You...

519
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
You...

520
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
You...

521
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
You...

522
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
Don't come!

523
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,300
Someone is here, Yafeng!

524
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,300
Who are you trying to save?

525
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,300
Run away!

526
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,300
A flying person?

527
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
No!

528
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
Master!

529
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
He hit me!

530
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,300
What are you doing?

531
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
Which one is stronger?

532
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,300
I'll hit him.

533
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
You hit him?

534
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
Yes.

535
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,300
I'm nervous.

536
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Be careful.

537
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,300
It's quite deep.

538
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
I'm scared!

539
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
You're not a good person!

540
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,300
What are you afraid of?

541
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,300
What are you afraid of?

542
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,300
What are you afraid of?

543
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Are you stupid?

544
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
I'll take care of you when you get home.

545
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
I'll take care of you when you get home.

546
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,300
Is that unit finished?

547
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,300
Hello?

548
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Don't tell me you've forgotten about me.

549
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:39,040
Please let me up to the

550
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
How about a new bar?

551
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Shouldn't be having coffee with so many friends.

552
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
Shut your mouth.

553
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,120
You know what?

554
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,240
Let's get this game started!

555
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,040
Okay, all right.

556
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,960
Well, you can exercise tonight.

557
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,840
Go serious.

558
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Can you

559
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,040
We are big

560
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Re draming

561
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,040
You can't do anything

562
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,160
Are you okay?

563
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,520
I'll teach you a lesson today

564
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
You can't get better.

565
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Where's Le Qingshan?

566
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,960
He ran away.

567
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Ran away?

568
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,280
It's okay.

569
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,960
Didn't you say he's the real master?

570
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,520
Le Qingshan is just a small role.

571
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
It doesn't matter.

572
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,920
Let's go to Xinjing first.

573
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,360
Where's Yi Wancan?

574
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
In your car.

575
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,480
He was buried by Qingshan.

576
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,800
He was badly injured.

577
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
We asked him to come.

578
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Sorry, everyone.

579
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
My cousin...

580
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,720
I saw him flying away.

581
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,760
Buried alive?

582
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,560
How could he be buried alive?

583
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,360
Miss Cai.

584
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,800
Thank you for your help.

585
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,680
You can go home now.

586
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,720
By the way,

587
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
don't tell the guards about this.

588
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Or you'll get infected.

589
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,080
You can go back to your room.

590
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,840
Let's go.

591
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720

592
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
We'll contact you when we buy insurance.

593
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
Really?

594
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Let's go.

Great.

596
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,720
Let's go out first.

597
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
You must contact me.

No.

603
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120

Don't kill me!

609
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
What are you doing?

610
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
I beg you.

You're wronged.

615

636
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
I don't understand what you're saying.

637
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
