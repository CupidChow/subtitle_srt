1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
Mei.

2
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,040
Mei.

3
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,800
Cry. Bye.

4
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,280
The vermillion elf wan MUSIC YOU VEGETABLE If you fail...

5
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,720
their karma thing will happen again.

6
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,440
But you don't have to cry!

7
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,680
History's...

8
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Oh

9
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:47,200
Mama mama mama

10
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,660
He's hungry. But I'm still hungry

11
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,680
Are you hungry?

12
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
You see that?

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Go.

14
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Go stand there and you won't be hungry.

15
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Go. Go now.

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,680
I'm really a thief all day.

17
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Tighten your pants.

18
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
Tighten your waist.

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
You won't be hungry.

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
You won't be hungry.

21
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
But if...

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
It seems that you are indeed Xiang Si Lan's daughter.

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,680
And your mother is really annoying.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Get lost.

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Sorry, I remembered.

26
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,680
In order to make Xiang Si Lan not look for you,

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Luo Ri spent a lot of money.

28
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
It's funny.

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Shut up.

30
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Am I caring about you?

31
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
Obviously don't want this kind of life.

32
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Why don't you admit it?

33
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,680
As long as you say it, I will change it for you immediately.

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Do you remember?

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Remember to read the book.

36
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Actually, we still have a business.

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Do you want to take a look?

38
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
I'm not feeling well, I'll rest.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Forget it.

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
This kind of thing depends on fate.

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Maybe it's not the right time.

42
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Nu Nu.

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Why did you run out?

44
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
You didn't even wear your clothes.

45
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,680
You should learn from your childhood.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Opportunities are to be gained by yourself.

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Little bear, little bear, eat chocolate.

48
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Little bear, eat chocolate.

49
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
If you don't eat, I'll chase you.

50
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,680
Little bear.

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
Is it delicious?

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Delicious.

53
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
We should go.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Where to live?

55
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Hong Yi will send you to kindergarten.

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
To kindergarten.

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Bye bye, little bear.

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Let's go to school.

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Little bear is the most beautiful girl.

60
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
So beautiful.

61
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,680
Let's go.

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Go.

63
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Go.

64
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
What's wrong?

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,680
Eat less sugar, you'll have a toothache.

66
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Look, a team of choices can make life so beautiful.

67
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,680
The next opportunity, you must hold on.

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,680
Go.

69
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Kill her.

70
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,680
I know you often recall this part.

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,680
But no matter how you recall it,

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,680
the girl at that time has fallen.

73
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Everything can only be imagined.

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Now you see clearly.

75
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
She was very afraid at that time.

76
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,680
She was so weak.

77
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,680
But for saving you, she still came back.

78
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
She's back.

79
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,680
If it weren't for you, she would have lived well.

80
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Would you really do nothing?

81
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Would you really do nothing?

82
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
She's going to die.

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,680
If you don't do anything, she will die.

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
She will die.

85
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
What's going on?

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Is this right?

87
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
Kill her.

88
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Go to the cinema tonight.

89
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
See you in the old place.

90
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Okay.

91
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Uncle Zhao is busy.

92
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
Pick a cup of hot tea.

93
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
The guests are waiting.

94
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
I'm looking for 13,000.

95
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Who is 13,000?

96
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,680
By the way, who is 13,000?

97
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Who cares?

98
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Aunt Hou, are you going out?

99
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
Go to Wujiang to do something.

100
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
I'll go in.

101
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
You're not feeling well lately.

102
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
You can't carry your shoulders.

103
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
I can't rest assured to go out alone.

104
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
You're hungry.

105
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,680
You're not feeling well?

106
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
No.

107
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Right.

108
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Who is Aunt Hou?

109
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,680
It's really important.

110
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Look.

111
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,680
There's an important person.

112
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Who is the important person?

113
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Who is it?

114
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Who is it?

115
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
It's pretty.

116
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
It's me.

117
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Who is it?

118
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
It's me.

119
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Did you see it?

120
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,680
It's pretty.

121
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
It's pretty.

122
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
It's pretty.

123
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
It's pretty.

124
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
It's pretty.

125
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
It's pretty.

126
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
It's pretty.

127
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
It's pretty.

128
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
I can't believe I got this hard.

129
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,840
and ill leave you to lie to me.

130
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,480
Don't waste any more energy.

131
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,440
Will you encounter them again?

132
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,120
Who are you?

133
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,840
I am you.

134
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
That's impossible.

135
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,760
Every day,

136
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
I come on this pinch road.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,880
All these decades,

138
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,960
I never met

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,640
Cao Peng Peng

140
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
and Zhou Xiao Dan anymore.

141
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,040
You've already chosen a normal life.

142
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,840
Our worlds are no longer interrelated.

143
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,640
We will never meet again.

144
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,840
I don't believe it.

145
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,040
Why?

146
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,640
You already have a happy life.

147
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,040
Do you want to give up?

148
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
They have already given up on you.

149
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
You should forget about them.

150
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
Boss Xia!

151
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,040
Master.

152
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,240
Meng Dan.

153
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,440
Take the map of the Demon Village.

154
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,240
Let's go.

155
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
I have to find them.

156
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
They are the most important people to me.

157
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
I can't forget them.

158
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,640
The record of people, two years ago.

159
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,640
The Tucson researchers have a spate of circles.

160
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:32,840
It's the second day of regret and regret.

161
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,640
They won't be able to go back.

162
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,000
Calamity

163
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,640
her

164
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,860
her

165
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,860
1

166
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,600
for

167
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:51,040
Question, hurry up.

168
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
But no wonder.

169
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,320
I think you're not the most important person in the whole world.

170
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
That's right.

171
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
You're familiar with him, right?

172
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,440
Do you think he's like a police officer?

173
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,320
I'll take him as my partner.

174
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,880
The police officer is as thin as the boss of the sea.

175
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,000
He's a fake, he's an illusion.

176
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,680
If you don't have the desire in your heart,

177
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
how can you have me?

178
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,400
Think of it like an illusion.

179
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,760
And the illusion is just an illusion called the Devil of Bear Formation.

180
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,560
The Devil الxyирING his 새 capitalism component

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,040
and the materialism the external paint from heavenó

182
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,160
only one somehow walking ein.

183
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,920
Only one?

184
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,700
So because I don't think they are dead?

185
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,660
They have an illusion!

186
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,660
I never recovered my energy and re-enacted the illusion.

187
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,660
But 280 years ago, I thought I could do it.

188
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,660
When I was holding them in my heart,

189
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,660
I tried my best to open the door.

190
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,660
But I still failed.

191
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,660
The illusion was a failure.

192
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,660
Failure?

193
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
That's right.

194
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,660
Just like what you're saying now,

195
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,660
they were half of the illusion.

196
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,660
That means they would return to reality.

197
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,660
Return to reality?

198
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,660
Then why did they kill themselves?

199
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,660
They didn't want you to pick up the illusion, right?

200
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,660
You were wrong from the beginning.

201
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,660
They are not dead.

202
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,660
The illusion is connected to consciousness.

203
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Consciousness is dependent on the body.

204
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,660
Once the body is destroyed, consciousness will disappear.

205
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,660
And the link is gone.

206
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,660
I understand.

207
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,660
In your world, we are all consciousness.

208
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,660
Consciousness is made up of choices.

209
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
Once the choices are wrong,

210
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,660
the original self will be destroyed.

211
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,660
The more destroyed, the easier it is to pick up the link, right?

212
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,660
What is life?

213
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,660
The so-called ritual is to make us lose ourselves in the illusion, right?

214
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,660
So what?

215
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,660
Life is just a dream.

216
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,660
Dream?

217
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Just like a fantasy.

218
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,660
I gave them whatever they wanted in life.

219
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,660
But they chose to die.

220
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
You're crazy!

221
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,660
You still want to be with me?

222
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
You're just trying to prove it.

223
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
That's because you don't understand.

224
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660
You don't understand the meaning of life.

225
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
It seems you understand.

226
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,660
But this time, you're not as lucky as Mi Hua Yi Zheng.

227
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,660
This time, the environment is as good as it used to be.

228
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,660
But I walked out.

229
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,660
Yes, you walked out.

230
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
But you can only walk here.

231
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,660
The space here is reserved.

232
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,660
Your friends have disappeared.

233
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,660
And you can only stay here forever.

234
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Forever alone.

235
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,660
Why don't you go back?

236
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,660
Back to the days of happiness.

237
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,660
That passage will always be open.

238
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,660
My companions may be confused for the time being.

239
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
But they will never be lost.

240
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
I have to get them back.

241
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,660
Just because of you?

242
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,660
Don't waste your energy.

243
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,660
You can't interfere with other people's cause and effect.

244
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,660
I'm not afraid to walk again.

245
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
I know you're close.

246
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
You don't have to do this.

247
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
Do you want to be together?

248
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
Together?

249
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Together?

250
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Do you guys want to be together?

251
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

252
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,660
Today, I'm going to die here.

253
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,660
No one will come to help.

254
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
Mother Chang!

255
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Mother Chang!

256
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Don't you have father's will?

257
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,660
I'm going to use my big knife!

258
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
Don't push me.

259
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Don't push me.

260
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
This isn't my illusion.

261
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,660
The illusion is trying to deprive me.

262
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,660
Come.

263
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,660
Do you like it?

264
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
I like it.

265
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,660
Yesterday...

266
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,660
We won!

267
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Yes!

268
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
Uncle Tao, let's have a drink.

269
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,660
Come.

270
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Who told you to kill him?

271
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
I killed Lie Bao.

272
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,660
And I saved Tasha.

273
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,660
I won't let her help.

274
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
Come, Tasha.

275
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
You're too petty.

276
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,660
Move your hands.

277
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Come.

278
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
I admit.

279
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Tasha! Tasha! Tasha!

280
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Tasha! Tasha! Tasha!

281
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,660
Tasha! Tasha! Tasha!

282
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Tasha! Tasha! Tasha!

283
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Tasha! Tasha! Tasha!

284
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Tasha! Tasha! Tasha!

285
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
I didn't think...

286
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
I'd know you for so long.

287
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,660
I've never seen you so happy.

288
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
I know.

289
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,660
Brotherhood is your biggest worry.

290
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,660
But it's not true.

291
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Luo.

292
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
I think...

293
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,660
it's time to find a godmother for Tasha.

294
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Again?

295
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
Luo Xiaodong.

296
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,660
What's wrong?

297
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,660
Nothing.

298
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,660
I heard someone call me Luo Xiaodong.

299
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
Are you crazy?

300
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
Luo Xiaodong?

301
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,660
Didn't your godmother teach you that?

302
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,660
I don't know.

303
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,660
But I feel like someone has called me that.

304
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,660
It doesn't matter.

305
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,660
I understand.

306
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,660
I understand.

307
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,660
This is not an unfeeling fantasy.

308
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,660
As long as it reminds me of reality,

309
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
the fantasy will be unstable.

310
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,660
I'll have a chance to get inside.

311
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Mom, help me!

312
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Be gentle.

313
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,660
Don't hurt her.

314
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
Luo Xiaodong.

315
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Do you remember the red sand,

316
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
the grass,

317
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
and the 13,000,

318
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
our scattered time,

319
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,660
and...

320
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,660
and the phoenix tower?

321
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,660
Godmother.

322
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
Godmother, who is it?

323
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,660
OK, bye chubby.

324
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,260
Father, warm a passed!

325
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
Dear father!

326
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,020
effective

327
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,340
interesting

328
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,700
although these

329
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,020
are not really

330
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,020
I'm so happy to see you again.

331
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,020
I'm so happy.

332
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,020
We'll always be here.

333
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,020
I'm so happy.

334
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,020
I thought you wouldn't come back.

335
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,020
I'm so happy.

336
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,020
Master!

337
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,020
Brother Luo!

338
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,020
Don't spill it! Bring me one!

339
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
You...

340
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,020
You...

341
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,020
I just saw Zhang Guanghua.

342
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
He said he could choose.

343
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,020
It's a ritual.

344
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,020
I'm so jealous.

345
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
He's just a sugarcane.

346
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,020
He's trying to seduce us.

347
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,020
Chen Lun is holding on.

348
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
I wonder how it is with Red Sand and 13000.

349
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
You all are too worried.

350
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
You have a lot of regrets.

351
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
He's easily fooled.

352
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
Not like me.

353
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
I've never experienced any setbacks in my life.

354
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,020
I'm the one who's in the EZ mode.

355
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:58,020
I'm most worried about 13000.

356
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
He's the worst.

357
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
Red Sand is fine.

358
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,020
He was the most careful in the village.

359
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,020
I don't know why he's still here.

360
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,020
Stop analyzing. Let's go find him.

361
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,020
Let's go.

362
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Zhao, there are many paintings in your area.

363
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Can you chat with us?

364
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Don't worry, Mom.

365
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,020
I'm the main character of your son.

366
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,020
They'll wait for me if I don't arrive.

367
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,020
Who would have thought that Jiang Zhao,

368
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
who came from the village, would become a painter?

369
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,020
By the way, Zhao,

370
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
the old village head called me just now.

371
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,020
He said he's celebrating his birthday this year.

372
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,020
He asked you to paint for him.

373
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,020
He asked you to paint for him.

374
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,020
Okay.

375
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,020
I'll do it.

376
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
Mr. Jiang,

377
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
the reporters are all here.

378
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,020
They're waiting for you.

379
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Okay, okay.

380
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
Let your son go in.

381
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
He'll save us from being too proud.

382
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
Right, right.

383
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,020
I'll hang up now.

384
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,020
Okay, Mom.

385
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
I'll call you in a few days.

386
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
Bye.

387
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Mr. Jiang.

388
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
Mr. Jiang.

389
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,020
Mr. Jiang.

390
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
Mr. Jiang.

391
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,020
Mr. Jiang.

392
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
When will we see him again?

393
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,020
Mr. Jiang,

394
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
we know you're single now.

395
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,020
You're the most important man in the world.

396
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,020
What do you want from your partner?

397
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,020
Mr. Jiang,

398
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,020
why did you change the theme of this exhibition,

399
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,020
the painting, to the pig?

400
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
The inspiration of this painting

401
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,020
came from my hometown.

402
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,020
He's a little boy who's been raised by a pig.

403
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
No matter where I am,

404
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,020
he'll always be the

405
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,020
only hope in my heart.

406
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Mr. Jiang,

407
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,020
you said you'd create some more

408
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
natural life works.

409
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,020
But we didn't see it before.

410
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,020
When will we see it?

411
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,020
Yi Wan Xiang!

412
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Yi Wan Xiang!

413
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Me!

414
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Mr. Jiang.

415
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Mr. Jiang.

416
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Mr. Jiang.

417
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Mr. Jiang.

418
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,020
Mr. Jiang.

419
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,020
Mr. Jiang.

420
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Mr. Jiang.

421
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
Mr. Jiang.

422
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Please come back.

423
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Please come back.

424
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,020
Please come back.

425
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Mr. Jiang.

426
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
Mr. Jiang.

427
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,020
Mr. Jiang.

428
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Mr. Jiang.

429
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
Mr. Jiang.

430
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,020
Mr. Jiang.

431
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Mr. Jiang.

432
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Mr. Jiang.

433
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
Mr. Jiang.

434
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
Art has no end.

435
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Look outside the world,

436
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,020
look inside,

437
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,020
and listen to yourself.

438
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
When is it that you still think about being a pig?

439
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,020
You're so insolent.

440
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Hong Xiang.

441
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,020
You're here.

442
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
What should we do?

443
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
He's still awake.

444
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,020
It seems that you have a lot of experience in art.

445
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,020
The highest level of understanding an artist is

446
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
that you're looking at the flowers,

447
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
while I'm looking at you.

448
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
You're so insolent.

449
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,020
I'm sure that the standard of choosing a girlfriend is also very strict.

450
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
You're just like a useless thing.

451
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,020
I care about the soul.

452
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,020
Xiang Ying!

453
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,020
Do you think

454
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
I will be the type you like?

455
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,020
No!

456
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,020
Let go!

457
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,020
I'm sorry.

458
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,020
Then we have to see the girl's soul.

459
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
What are you talking about?

460
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
Yi Wan San!

461
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,020
You're just an insolent thing.

462
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,020
You're doing art in your dream.

463
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Do you know how great my dream is?

464
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,020
I'm willing to jump out of it.

465
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
What's wrong with you?

466
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
Wake up!

467
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
Master.

468
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,020
I can't do this. What should I do?

469
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,020
You have to find a way.

470
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
I'll find a way.

471
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,020
Yi Wan San!

472
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,020
In the most deep night,

473
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,020
I will think of you.

474
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,020
With the memories of warmth,

475
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,020
I will hold you tight.

476
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,020
In this city,

477
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:13,020
the road is so lonely.

478
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:19,020
Someone will walk towards the stars.

479
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Maybe fate is too complicated.

480
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,020
But in the wind and rain,

481
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,020
the stars are the most beautiful.

482
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,020
Yi Wan San!

483
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,020
Er Fu!

484
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
Why are you here?

485
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
What's going on?

486
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,020
Hurry!

487
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
I can't see anything!

488
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,020
The prison is being blown up.

489
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
It's being blown up.

490
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,020
Yes!

491
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,020
The dead are all dead!

492
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,020
I'm lonely!

493
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
Master.

494
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,020
I'm worried even if you don't move.

495
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,020
I'm worried even if you move.

496
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,020
When will you be a head?

497
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,020
Are you okay?

498
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
Don't catch a cold.

499
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
Don't suffocate yourself.

500
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
Come on.

501
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
Let's go.

502
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
Let go.

503
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Come on.

504
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Come on.

505
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
You are my warm baby.

506
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Without you,

507
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,020
I would have been dead.

508
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,020
Thank you.

509
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
Dad.

510
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,020
You brought all your brothers and sisters here?

511
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
We are saved.

512
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,020
Otherwise, we would have been killed.

513
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,020
Last night, the snow was like a world end.

514
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,020
I didn't expect it to stop this morning.

515
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,020
Mr. Luo.

516
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,020
Mr. Luo.

517
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
Mr. Luo.

518
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Mr. Luo.

519
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
I've lived for most of my life.

520
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
I've never seen this strange thing

521
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
that the mountain group saved.

522
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
Me too.

523
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
I've never seen this before.

524
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Thank you, my baby.

525
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
If it weren't for your brothers and sisters

526
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,020
in that tent last night,

527
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,020
we would have been dead.

528
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,020
I love chicken the most.

529
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
From now on,

530
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
I'll eat chicken and cake.

531
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
I've got it.

532
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,020
I've got it.

533
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,020
I've got it.

534
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
That's great.

535
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,020
Give me a pair of wings that can fly through the universe.

536
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
That's great.

537
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
What's wrong with you?

538
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,020
It's comfortable on the bed.

539
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,020
Do you think I'm a butcher?

540
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
You're really good at destroying the atmosphere.

541
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
Stop talking nonsense.

542
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
Go down.

543
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
Go.

544
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
Go.

545
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
Be careful.

546
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,020
Be careful.

547
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
I can't jump.

548
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I'm stiff.

549
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,020
Don't fall.

550
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
It's okay.

551
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
Just let it be up there.

552
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
Don't blow it.

553
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
Don't come down.

554
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:43,020
I'm going to find a red star.

555
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Phoenix is in love.

556
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,020
There's a moment

557
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:53,020
I don't want to understand the blue star.

558
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,020
I don't want to understand the blue star.

559
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,020
Don't help us.

560
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:12,020
I don't want to understand the blue star.

561
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,020
I hope we can be together forever.

562
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
I'm going to find a red star.

563
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,020
I'm going to find a red star.

564
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
I'm going to find a red star.

565
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
I'm going to find a red star.

566
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
I'm going to find a red star.

567
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
I'm going to find a red star.

568
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,020
I'm going to find a red star.

569
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,020
I'm going to find a red star.

570
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,020
I'm going to find a red star.

571
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,020
I'm going to find a red star.

572
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,020
I'm going to find a red star.

573
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,020
I'm going to find a red star.

574
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
I'm going to find a red star.

575
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,020
I'm going to find a red star.

576
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
I'm going to find a red star.

577
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
I'm going to find a red star.

578
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
I'm going to find a red star.

579
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
I'm going to find a red star.

580
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,020
I'm going to find a red star.

581
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
I'm going to find a red star.

582
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Go! Go!

583
00:33:48,020 --> 00:34:17,020
What's wrong with Fenghuanglou?

584
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
We've been waiting for you.

585
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
This kind of thing is annoying.

586
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,020
Brother Cao.

587
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,020
Didn't you find that Cao Haohang

588
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,020
has been acting strange these two days?

589
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,020
Why do you keep looking at me?

590
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,020
Fenghuang.

591
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
Dad.

592
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
What's bothering you?

593
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,020
Tell me.

594
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,020
What?

595
00:34:52,020 --> 00:35:01,340
I meant to say I was being a bit of a

596
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
victim.

597
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Victim?

598
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,340
Yes.

599
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,340
Yes, I was being a victim.

600
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,340
You scared me.

601
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
But that's not right.

602
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
I didn't do anything wrong.

603
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,340
I didn't do anything wrong.

604
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,340
I didn't eat chicken and meat.

605
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Don't talk about that stupid thing.

606
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,340
I didn't do anything wrong.

607
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
I didn't eat chicken and meat.

608
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
I didn't eat chicken and meat.

609
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,660
Don't talk about that stupid thing.

610
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,660
She said it.

611
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,660
You must have promised her something.

612
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
But you didn't keep your promise.

613
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,660
Promise?

614
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,660
I promised Fenghuang that I would sign her name.

615
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
You're right.

616
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
Fenghuang.

617
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,660
I'm leaving.

618
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,660
Fenghuang, let's go buy a brand.

619
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Let's go buy a brand.

620
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
That's my problem.

621
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,660
If you want to sign it, I'll sign it.

622
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,660
A good chicken costs $13,000.

623
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
How do you cut it?

624
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Cao Yanhua's chicken.

625
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,660
Mine?

626
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,660
Look at Fenghuang's small neck.

627
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
It's bent by your two ribs.

628
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
This is called exercise.

629
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,980
It's really cruel.

630
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,980
No, Uncle Guo.

631
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
You gave me something new.

632
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
And you have to take it back.

633
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
It's too stingy.

634
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
What do you know?

635
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,980
It's broken for a while.

636
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,980
I'll show you the difference between the mountain village and the town.

637
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Now, it's time tolemme it out.

638
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Is this the...

639
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,620
Yeah.

640
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,480
I've always told you,

641
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,900
Feng will take a lot of people who only love Fenghuang.

642
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,900
The number of people who are stuck with her could be very big, right?

643
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,900
The definition of food is halibut.

644
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,740
I've asked experts toSouth Hawaiians got bread,

645
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,020
I'm very old.

646
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,020
It reminds me of

647
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,200
the day I was afraid of the Wujang

648
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,780
and now I'm a man who saved the world.

649
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,620
Heroes never ask about the future.

650
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,820
It's hard to predict the future.

651
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,460
No, Uncle Guan.

652
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,600
Isn't there only three phoenix

653
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,660
and wolfhounds?

654
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,660
Yes.

655
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,660
What about you five?

656
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,660
How do you divide the three?

657
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,660
You don't have to fight.

658
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,660
I've got someone

659
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,660
who's back to the house

660
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,660
and made a new one.

661
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,580
What about the phoenix and wolfhound?

662
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
Is there any news about the Unwelcome Tree?

663
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,580
The Unwelcome Tree is just a tree.

664
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,580
It's not easy to collect.

665
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,580
And it's not easy to preserve.

666
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,580
Besides,

667
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,580
you're all sealed.

668
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
This phoenix and wolfhound

669
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,580
is enough.

670
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
You're a big fan of Yun Tian.

671
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
You're going to make five tables.

672
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
And it's so thin.

673
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,580
Did you make six?

674
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
You suspect me.

675
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,580
You suspect me.

676
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,580
Call him out.

677
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
You suspect me.

678
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,580
You're a moral man.

679
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,580
Don't run.

680
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,580
You suspect me.

681
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,580
Call him out.

682
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
Don't forget.

683
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,580
Give it to me.

684
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Cheers.

685
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,580
Cheers.

686
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,580
Cheers.

687
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,580
It's so heavy.

688
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Have a drink.

689
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,580
Drink some water.

690
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,580
First, I have a question.

691
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,580
Today's fried pork is very good.

692
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
It's from the outside.

693
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,580
Come on.

694
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,580
Come on.

695
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,580
Eat.

696
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Eat.

697
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,580
Come on.

698
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,580
I have a question.

699
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,580
Have you ever thought about

700
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,580
the connection between your body

701
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,580
and the heart?

702
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,580
It should be the interaction

703
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,580
between you and the heart.

704
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,580
On the contrary,

705
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,580
your blood can control the heart.

706
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,580
Why?

707
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Have you ever thought about that?

708
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
No.

709
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
So you still have to rely on me.

710
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
I've been thinking about it

711
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,580
for a long time.

712
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
I think our consciousness

713
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,580
is probably

714
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,580
the fourth dimension

715
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,580
that humans don't understand.

716
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,580
In this space,

717
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,580
as a human being,

718
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,580
as a carbon-based creature,

719
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,580
it has become an energy object

720
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
at this moment.

721
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,580
As a gene,

722
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
as a higher-end substance,

723
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,580
when it meets humans,

724
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,580
it changes.

725
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,580
The main difference is that

726
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,580
it can store information

727
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,580
and make it pass on.

728
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,580
How can I know that?

729
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,580
It's on the human body.

730
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,580
Me too.

731
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,580
It's called

732
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,580
instinct.

733
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
Enough.

734
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,580
You're right.

735
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,580
If you can't figure out

736
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
the truth,

737
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,580
this is...

738
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,580
You're right.

739
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,580
Connection

740
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
exists in the deepest part

741
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,580
of our consciousness.

742
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580
Connection

743
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
is now in your body

744
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
and the phoenix's heart.

745
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,580
We've got it, right?

746
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,580
And the phoenix's heart too.

747
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,580
Let's consider

748
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
the environment

749
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
and celebrate.

750
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,580
I think it's good.

751
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Where should we start?

752
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
Where should we start?

753
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,580
How about the wood house?

754
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,580
That's great.

755
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
I've never been to the wood house.

756
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
Then let's go there.

757
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,580
I have someone.

758
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,580
If you haven't been there,

759
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
why don't you go and have fun?

760
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,580
As long as you can

761
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,580
help me wake Uncle Zhang up,

762
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,580
I can do it too.

763
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,580
I won't take you.

764
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,580
I'll help you.

765
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580
You can't do that.

766
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,580
A thousand worlds

767
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
are only for one man.

768
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,580
Uncle Zhang,

769
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,580
let's take a photo together.

770
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,580
The last time,

771
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
we were so lucky.

772
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,580
Let's have fun.

773
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,580
Come on.

774
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,580
Let's go.

775
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Let's go.

776
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,580
I'm so excited.

777
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,580
Put it on.

778
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,580
Who should I hug?

779
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,580
Put it on.

780
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,580
You're still suspicious of me.

781
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,580
The last time we were so lucky

782
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,580
If you're still suspicious of me

783
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,580
I'll be more willing to be with you

784
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,580
OK?

785
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,580
Let's take a photo.

786
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
Let's take a photo.

787
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
I think we need something.

788
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,580
Let's go to the grass.

789
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,580
Where should we go?

790
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,580
Yeah.

791
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Where's the baby?

792
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,580
She was here just now.

793
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,580
The baby didn't bring anything.

794
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,580
The pot face.

795
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,580
Stop talking nonsense.

796
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,580
What if she falls into the pot?

797
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,580
Let's go.

798
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
Is she in the movie?

799
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
Come on.

800
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
Let's go.

801
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Let's go.

802
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,580
What are you afraid of?

803
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,580
I'm going to be gentle

804
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
In my mind

805
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,580
A little bit of sadness

806
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,580
And I'm in the dark

807
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,580
The ugly face of people

808
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:16,580
Two sides

809
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,580
One side is the main

810
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,580
One side is waiting for you

811
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
This game

812
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,580
Is never over

813
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:33,580
It has traces of the past

814
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,580
You are my match

815
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
I'm your match

816
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,580
I'm you

817
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
I'm you

818
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,580
I'm you

819
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,580
I'm you

820
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,580
I'm you

821
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
I'm you

822
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,580
I'm you

823
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
I'm you

824
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
I'm you

825
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,580
I'm you

826
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,580
I'm you

827
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
I'm you

828
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,580
I'm you

829
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
I'm you

830
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,580
I'm you

831
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,580
Look back

832
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:24,580
On the previous start

833
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,580
A strange chaos

834
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
Has been involve

835
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:38,180
It is

836
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:43,040
It will be

837
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm in the dark

838
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,040
The sky crosses the line of the dawn

839
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,040
Tells me the end

840
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,040
The future is about to be gentle

841
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,040
The face of my memory haunts me

842
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,040
And I'm in the darkness
