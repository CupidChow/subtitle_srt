Professor, this is Doctor out chief imperative.

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,840
However, ever since B kg Earth contour became an occultia,

3

this is something unknown.

7
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,320
Someone said the credit', tremendously famous to see fair mines,

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,480
He泊銃在尋找逃脫的機會

9
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,900
這個故事就從22年前

10
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,020
珞瑪湖的一個冬 rumors

11
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:20,980
麼者演講

12
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,600
When is your mom going to let us meet?

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,840
She has an important g tässäcQ 03,

Not again!

17
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
I'm going to get some water.

18
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Here you go.

19
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,040
I'm going to get some water.

20
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Hello?

21
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Is Miss Huo Zihong here?

22
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Yes.

23
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Did you find out anything about the Luo Mahuan?

24
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,040
I'm going to get some water.

25
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
I'm going to get some water.

26
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Aunt Hong, you finally called me.

27
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Did you find out anything about that?

28
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Wait a minute.

29
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

30
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
You've arrived at the brand.

31
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Of course, someone is calling.

32
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
The other person called Wan Feng Huo

33
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
to do a few years of call-up.

34
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Don't talk too much when you arrive there.

35
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Just listen to me.

36
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Don't worry.

37
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
I know the rules.

38
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
Yes.

39
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
We've been learning dance for 8 years.

40
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
I'll send you the location later.

41
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Take care of yourself.

42
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Okay, Aunt Hong.

43
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Bye.

44
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,960
2 Mārata

45
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,860
Ms Ye.

46
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,820
Why did you strike me up?

47
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Suck me up?

48
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I'll let you go.

49
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Where's my stuff?

50
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,040
I'll keep it for you.

51
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I'll put it back.

52
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Put it back.

53
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
I'll put it back.

54
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Put it back.

55
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Go away.

56
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Right.

57
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
You're sitting in the wrong place.

58
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
You have to go that way.

59
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Left that way.

60
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
North-East.

61
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
I have to sit back.

62
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
You're so annoying.

63
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
You're so annoying.

64
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
I have to sit back.

65
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,040
I have to go.

66
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Welcome.

67
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
The customer is here.

68
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
This way, please.

69
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
The power supply is on today.

70
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
The communication, power supply, and related areas

71
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
will be affected.

72
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Why do we have to be like this?

73
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Compared to this hairpin,

74
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
there are two people.

75
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
One person

76
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,040
who asked me to make a phoenix hairpin.

77
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,040
Some people still say

78
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
I want to play phoenix hairpin

79
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
in the Hong Bao room.

80
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
But I don't have a hairpin.

81
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
Until one day,

82
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,040
someone took it to me.

83
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Look,

84
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
the buyer has it.

85
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
The buyer has it.

86
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
It will be on the table.

87
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
And I'm

88
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,040
the one who's in charge of this.

89
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
If you have something to say,

90
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
the boss is here.

91
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
He has no time to talk to you.

92
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
Mr. Li, you're so annoying.

93
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
My information this time

94
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
is very big.

95
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
I'm sure you'll know

96
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
that I'm not a good person.

97
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Mr. Ma.

98
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
This is Miss Huo.

99
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
She's my mother-in-law.

100
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
My mother-in-law.

101
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Miss Mu.

102
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
She's a good teacher.

103
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Please sit.

104
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Let me introduce you.

105
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Mr. Li Tan.

106
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Mr. Ma.

107
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,040
I have a little rule here.

108
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
To protect the privacy of the suspect,

109
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
you can't take pictures,

110
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
record pictures and record photos in this space.

111
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
And the signal of this house

112
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
will be blocked later.

113
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,040
I'll take care of your phone.

114
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Brother, he has a cell phone.

115
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
It's blocked.

116
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Ask him to sit.

117
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,660
When it changes,

118
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,040
only officials can help.

119
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,080
And so he's a criminal.

120
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,040
Maybe it is impossible for someone

121
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,540
to kill a criminal for privacy in highacious cases.

122
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,040
We could only recommend a TB operation.

123
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
But Mr. Hou is a criminal.

124
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
How much time can he have save

125
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
to ask such a person to be charged?

126
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
OK.

127
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
If Anything has happened in this household life,

128
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm sure you're cheering up.

129
00:10:39,040 --> 00:11:06,480
number is also a message to her,

130
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,480
You all decide whether to pay me back or not.

131
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,080
You can question his honesty.

132
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,280
If there's any doubt,

133
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,680
I'll sell the old rules and vote for the votes.

134
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,080
Less is more.

135
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,880
If more than half of the people think

136
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,680
that information is valuable and useful,

137
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,680
then you all pay me back.

138
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,280
Then...

139
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,080
Let's start.

140
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,880
These few people who were killed by the murderers

141
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,680
are called Liu Shu Hai.

142
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,880
They died five years ago.

143
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,280
Five years ago?

144
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,280
They died five years ago?

145
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,480
Yes, six years ago.

146
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,880
At that time,

147
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,280
I was in a hotel in the Western Jiao Kui Yun Station.

148
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,880
The staff member

149
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,280
was the kind of little hotel that was very low-key.

150
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,480
They were often not changed.

151
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
The guests who lived there were three or nine-tailed hotels.

152
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,280
They used everything.

153
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,680
That day, I was in the middle of a night shift.

154
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,280
Hello?

155
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,480
Please come in.

156
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,880
We're having a drink at 203.

157
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
Okay.

158
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,480
Mr. Liu?

159
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,280
Mr. Liu?

160
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,880
After entering the house,

161
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,680
I can't forget this life.

162
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,080
What's wrong?

163
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,280
Mr. Liu,

164
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,680
the hot water is here.

165
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,080
I put it here for you.

166
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,880
Mr. Liu, I'll seal it.

167
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,480
Are you okay?

168
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,280
Are you okay?

169
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
Mom!

170
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Mr. Liu?

171
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,280
Mr. Liu?

172
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Mr. Liu?

173
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
Mr. Liu?

174
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Open the door!

175
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Open the door!

176
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

177
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

178
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

179
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

180
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Twenty-three.

181
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Why would he talk like that?

182
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,280
Who did he kill? How did he kill him?

183
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Why did he kill that person?

184
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,280
And his appearance is like a report.

185
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
He's very scary.

186
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
How many cases did he say?

187
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Two.

188
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
My husband is the first case.

189
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Where's the second case?

190
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Boss,

191
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,280
the price of one-to-one is reasonable.

192
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,280
But he killed the person.

193
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,280
And the one used is the fish line.

194
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
What happened next?

195
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
The person, the body, are all here.

196
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
He's dead.

197
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,280
But on his back,

198
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,280
he was cut off by a big piece of skin.

199
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
I understand.

200
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
He's been shot.

201
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
No, no, no.

202
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
This is already reported.

203
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
Someone has been shot?

204
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
The skin was cut off.

206
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Did anyone come in after you ran out?

207
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
No one came in.

208
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
And that thief was a dead person.

209
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
I was standing there.

210
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
I didn't see anyone come in.

211
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Then why did you say that?

212
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
The skin was cut off by someone.

213
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Because the wound was very smooth.

214
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
It must have been human.

215
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
And it was cut off by force.

216
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
By force?

217
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
My dear.

218
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Sister,

219
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
listen to what you said.

220
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
If you say that the person is dead,

221
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
we can trust you.

222
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
The key is a piece of skin.

223
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Who wants a piece of skin?

224
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
It's just a piece of human skin.

225
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
If you find a piece of human skin,

226
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
you'll know it.

227
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
You...

228
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
We reported the scene.

229
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,280
And the people in the corridor know about it.

230
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Amazing.

231
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
The scene was very impressive.

232
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,280
I could see that you put a lot of effort into it.

233
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Boss Ba,

234
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
you have to be honest in your business.

235
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
You can't find out the truth.

236
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
You're not ashamed.

237
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,280
You're making a fool of yourself.

238
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
You'll be embarrassed.

239
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Boss Ba,

240
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
what do you mean?

241
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm not making a fool of myself.

242
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm telling the truth.

243
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I didn't say that this is a fake.

244
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Maybe that Xiaoli was dead at that time.

245
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Maybe that dead person was cut off by someone.

246
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,280
But it has nothing to do with the case of Luo Mahu in his 22nd year.

247
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,280
You're not Luo Mahu's son-in-law.

248
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
He is the killer.

249
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
You're kidding me.

250
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
I didn't...

251
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
You're kidding me.

252
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I didn't buy my credit card.

253
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Boss Ba,

254
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
my credit card is real.

255
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
You can't buy it.

256
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Boss Ba,

257
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,280
I spent money to find out Luo Mahu's killer.

258
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm not interested in other cases.

259
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
We're all buyers.

260
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
I want the news.

261
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
As long as it's real,

262
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
I won't give you any money.

263
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
What do you mean?

264
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,280
Hello, sir.

265
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Hello.

266
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,280
What do you think about this news, Luo?

267
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Father.

268
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Okay.

269
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
This is the whole story.

270
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
The one who came today,

271
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
the one I bought and the one I bought,

272
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
were all liars.

273
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,280
That person was so stupid.

274
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
He couldn't see anything.

275
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,280
But there's a person called Li Tan.

276
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
He said that the news was fake.

277
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Hongyi, what do you think?

278
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
As far as I know,

279
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I also think that the word was wrong.

280
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
It's not.

281
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
It's just that I've been living here for a long time.

282
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
That's a story.

283
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
But Hongyi,

284
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,280
how did you know it was fake?

285
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,280
Didn't I tell you that

286
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,280
Professor Li is my mentor?

287
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
I always put his family's business in my heart.

288
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,280
Not only through the fire of Wan Feng.

289
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Then, we'll still be rich.

290
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Let's take care of it.

291
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Mr. Mai has been in the police station for so many years.

292
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
He's been looking for a job.

293
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Okay.

294
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
Hongyi, you're so kind.

295
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Besides,

296
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,280
I don't want him to know that I've taken someone else's place.

297
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
You just said that Mr. Li seems to know a lot about that time.

298
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
You should go and contact him more.

299
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,280
See what he knows.

300
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Okay, I understand.

301
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Then, I'll hang up now, Hongyi.

302
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
There's still a suspect who killed him.

303
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
You're so mean.

304
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Go to hell!

305
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,280
He obviously fell from such a high place.

306
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,280
How could he not have died?

307
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
Mr. Li,

308
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Second,

310
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Amiasm,

312
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
the present comes from Sis.

313
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,280
The rational one of those yet so close to those long estates,

314
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,280
I already've sent them to your residence.

315
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
Look,

316
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:45,620
another of your family members in Yan

317
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,780
werekien grenades killed by Yathong.

318
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:55,280
Really,

319
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
We have booked a room.

320
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,280
We will send you the information later.

321
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Remember to come here...

322
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Boss Wan, I'm going to leave now.

323
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Come back later.

324
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Miss Mu, please.

325
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Hello, Boss Luo.

326
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm going back to the city.

327
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Why?

328
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
As I said, sit down.

329
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
I'll take your left hand and go.

330
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It's weird. Please go up.

331
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Boss Luo, I'm already at the city.

332
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
What do you say?

333
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Keep going down.

334
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Keep going down?

335
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Boss Luo, I'm going to leave now.

336
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
I'm going to leave now.

337
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
What do you mean?

338
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
Keep going down.

339
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Keep going down?

340
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Don't follow me.

341
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
I... I'm being followed!

342
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
Run!

343
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Okay.

344
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
Where is the case?

345
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
The building.

346
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
The building is on the fifth floor.

347
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
The building.

348
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Are you crazy?

349
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,280
Stand up!

350
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
How's the band?

351
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
It's been a long time.

352
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,280
I know Boss Wan has rules.

353
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
But the rules are stable.

354
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
No need to bother.

355
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I'll handle it.

356
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
I won't use it anymore.

357
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
Also, I'm not interested in your business.

358
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm not interested.

359
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,280
Please don't come to me again.

360
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Understand?

361
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,880
I understand.

362
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
Mr.

363
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Here's 200.

364
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
200.

365
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Okay.

366
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Don't worry, Xiaoxiao.

367
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
They're all fooling you.

368
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
I won't fool you.

369
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
I'll definitely save them.

370
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
Save them.

371
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
Give me the money!

372
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
Give me the money!

373
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Stop!

374
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Come back!

375
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Give me the money!

376
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,280
What's wrong?

377
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
Don't be so stubborn.

378
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
Don't be so careless.

379
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Let's not fight.

380
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Give me the money.

381
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,280
It's been two times.

382
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
We've been fighting.

383
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:43,280
It's nothing to do with you today.

384
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,280
You should be the one to take care of it.

385
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
You should go back.

386
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
What's wrong?

387
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
Give you the money.

388
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Take care of it.

389
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,280
You're so careless.

390
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
Give me the money!

391
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Where's it?

392
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Here.

393
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Let's see if we have enough money.

394
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
It doesn't matter.

395
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
The most important thing is this photo.

396
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
It's gone after I lost it.

397
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280
Miss, thank you.

398
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
Get up.

399
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
I'm sorry.

400
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Forget it.

401
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
They're partners.

402
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Don't mess with them.

403
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
Don't cause trouble.

404
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
This guy has experience.

405
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
You have to listen to him.

406
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,280
My brother is really a hooker.

407
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
You can't eat it.

408
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Let's go.

409
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
Really?

410
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Yes.

411
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Yes.

412
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Miss, thank you for today.

413
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
But a girl

414
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,280
is still in a hurry to get along with these local流氓.

415
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
She's afraid of losing money.

416
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Who's afraid of whom?

417
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Uncle Bi, I want to ask

418
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
why you're so obsessed with this case?

419
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
What about you?

420
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
You're still young.

421
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
You haven't been born yet.

422
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Why are you investigating?

423
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Me?

424
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
I'm here for my mother.

425
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
She's a student of Professor Li.

426
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
She's been in such a miserable situation.

427
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
She can't be released.

428
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
No wonder.

429
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Because of her.

430
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
Who is she?

431
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Her name is Li Yaqing.

432
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Why does she look like Hong Yi?

433
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Her name is Li Yaqing.

434
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Professor Li's daughter Li Yaqing.

435
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
I'm sorry.

436
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
I'm sorry.

437
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
I'm sorry.

438
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
I'm sorry.

439
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
I'm sorry.

440
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
I'm sorry.

441
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
If something bad happens that day,

442
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,280
we'll get married that year.

443
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
For more than 20 years,

444
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
for this case,

445
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I lost my job,

446
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
I went to the capital,

447
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
and I've been investigating for half a lifetime.

448
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm not sure if I can make it.

449
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
Are you sure?

450
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
You said

451
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
you're sure your friend is dead?

452
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
What do you mean?

453
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
I mean,

454
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
did you find out about this?

455
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,280
What do you want to say?

456
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
I think

457
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
what if...

458
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
what if I saw it wrong?

459
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Are you blind?

460
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
No.

461
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
You think I can't even recognize my lover?

462
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
I was a cop at that time.

463
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I can't make it.

464
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
When Xun Wan came to the capital,

465
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
I was the first one to arrive at the scene.

466
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Do you know what I saw?

467
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
The scene is cruel.

468
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
I'm so worried.

469
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,280
I can only think

470
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,280
how to get rid of Yaqing.

471
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
How to get rid of her.

472
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
How to get her to die in prison.

473
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
Tell me.

474
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
Tell me.

475
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
I'm tired.

476
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
You can drink it slowly.

477
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
By the way,

478
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
you're a professor of philosophy.

479
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
You're a good student.

480
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
Tell him

481
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
not to believe in me.

482
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,280
Why?

483
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Why?

484
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
Two years ago, the murderer committed a crime.

485
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,280
The same is the case of Yu Xian.

486
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,280
The same is the case of the murderer.

487
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
I've seen him before.

488
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Unfortunately,

489
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
I didn't see his face clearly.

490
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
So, the five years ago,

491
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,280
Liu Shuhai was definitely not the murderer.

492
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
The murderer.

493
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
You're back.

494
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Sister, look at me.

495
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
I'm so bad.

496
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
I can't even get out of the house.

497
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,280
You're so old.

498
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Did I ask you to call me sister?

499
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
You're so young and pretty.

500
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
You don't even call me old.

501
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
You're a bad guy.

502
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
You're not even a police officer.

503
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
No.

504
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
How can you be a bad guy?

505
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
You think so?

506
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
I've done two cases in total.

507
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I've even put them all in your hands.

508
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Can I be a bad guy?

509
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
I'm the kid who's been doing the blood pressure.

510
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
You pulled me back and I came back.

511
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
I was so scared.

512
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
My master said

513
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
people will choose their own path in the future.

514
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Whether they're one or not,

515
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
I'll give you another chance.

516
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
I'm not going to do it again.

517
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Don't worry.

518
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
I won't dare to do it again.

519
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Thank you.

520
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
I'm sorry for your kindness.

521
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
I'm sorry.

522
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
What's up?

523
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Are you going to follow me?

524
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
No, no, no.

525
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,280
I'm here to see if you can be a good guy.

526
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,280
I'm a good guy.

527
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,280
I don't know if you have the honor to meet me.

528
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,280
No.

529
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
Sister.

530
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Sister.

531
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,280
I've always liked to be a good guy.

532
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
This is my idol, Li Ganglong.

533
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
I've seen all of his videos.

534
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,280
But in real life,

535
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
I've met a good guy.

536
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
You're the first one to know.

537
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
You've got the skill, right?

538
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
It's not a big deal.

539
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
I'm Tao Yanhua.

540
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Kong Tao Yanhua.

541
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
I'm from Taojiang.

542
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
I came here because of you.

543
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
Look,

544
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
you know my name and address.

545
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
It's a cultural and martial power.

546
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Of course,

547
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
it's too vague to compare with you.

548
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,280
But I can also write a martial art.

549
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,280
I can help you in any place.

550
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
For example,

551
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
I can tell you clearly.

552
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
From the tea table to here,

553
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,280
which color wolf is staring at you?

554
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Follow me.

555
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
Come on.

556
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
Come on.

557
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Come on.

558
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Come on.

559
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Come on.

560
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Come on.

561
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Be careful.

562
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
Be more natural.

563
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Look at my back.

564
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Watermelon.

565
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Just wear a zongzi.

566
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
You can't get it wrong.

567
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
I was stuck there.

568
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
I was a little bit dizzy.

569
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,280
I thought if you took my picture,

570
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
you'd hide.

571
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
I didn't want to take your picture.

572
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
It's obvious.

573
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
You can take a picture first,

574
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
then follow.

575
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
You can't take the picture.

576
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
If you want to revenge,

577
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
you can lie to me.

578
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
Sister,

579
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
you're hurting me.

580
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
I'm not going to take your picture.

581
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
I'm going to take your picture.

582
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,280
I'm going to take your picture.

583
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
I'm going to take your picture.

584
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
This is going to hurt me.

585
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
I'm a grasshopper.

586
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Even if I want to revenge,

587
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
I can't use such a useless means.

588
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
Trust me.

589
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
That guy is a ghost.

590
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
The grass is fresh today.

591
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Yes, we just made it today.

592
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
How about a drink for you?

593
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
How do I put it in?

594
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
Okay.

595
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Take care.

596
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Hey.

597
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Hey.

598
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
Why are you following me?

599
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
Me?

600
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,280
I'm following you.

601
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
I'm following you.

602
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
I'm following you.

603
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
You might have misunderstood.

604
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
My friend lives here.

605
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
I came to visit him.

606
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
He's not very polite.

607
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
So I came to buy some fruits.

608
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Maybe I'll meet him

609
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
and take you back.

610
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Really?

611
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Miss Guo.

612
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
If you just want to know me,

613
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
I'm Luo Ren.

614
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
This is my number.

615
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
You can call me anytime.

616
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,280
I'll just let him go.

617
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
It seems that the sound of the flowing sea

618
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
is quite interesting.

619
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
It was a common man.

620
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
He said that

621
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
the sound of the flowing sea

622
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,280
is a human being's nature.

623
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,280
Then he went to the big river,

624
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
traveled around the country,

625
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,280
and encountered a traffic accident.

626
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,280
He got into a car accident.

627
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,280
He was only 48 hours away from home.

628
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,280
He was only a miracle.

629
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
He left home after he was discharged from the hospital.

630
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
He died in a few laps after half a year.

631
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
It seems that the disaster is not over.

632
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,280
There may be consequences.

633
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
It says that

634
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
the flowing sea

635
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
has never been to the Romance Lake.

636
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
What did his family say?

637
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
His family really missed a piece of skin.

638
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Then the sister didn't have a car.

639
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
It's a waste of time.

640
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm sorry.

641
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
I'm sorry.

642
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Boss, I'm leaving.

643
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
Miss Mu.

644
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
This is a disaster.

645
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
In my case,

646
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
I'm going to give her another case.

647
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
Please give her the case.

648
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Zhang Guanghua?

649
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Who is this person?

650
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
I'm not sure.

651
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Hongyi, look.

652
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Uncle Wan said that

653
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
these things were found

654
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,280
by the Romance Lake in the village.

655
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,280
That long-sleeved red envelope

656
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,280
should have been a surprise

657
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
to him.

658
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
By the way,

659
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,280
Uncle Li said that

660
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
the killer was found two years ago.

661
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
I see.

662
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Mu Dai,

663
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
find Li Tan for me.

664
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
I'll find out the case

665
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
two years ago.

666
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,280
I'll hang up now.

667
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Okay.

668
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Could it be that the Heavens are not open?

669
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,280
How could you survive?

670
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,280
What?

672
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
I'm sorry.

673
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I'm sorry.

674
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
I'm sorry.

675
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
I'm sorry.

676
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
I'm sorry.

677
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
I'm sorry.

678
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
I'm sorry.
