00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
needle

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,540
a

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,020
ori

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:28,300
N

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:58,300
I'm not sure if I can get the first one to get the second one to get the second one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get the third one to get

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:28,300
the third one to get the third one to get the third one in order to get the third one in order to train a charge machine learn to deal with the shock and fire with the fire as you push the trigger

7
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,300
What's going on?

8
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Help!

9
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
Zhaqin!

10
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Hurry up! They're about to get on the plane!

11
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,300
I'm driving a car, Fugou!

12
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,300
It's not a plane!

13
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
Be a little more steady.

14
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,300
After the smoke, when I'm in my heart, you leave

15
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,300
I don't have a single answer, I can't help it

16
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,300
The fair things won't be written down

17
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,300
Even if I have to go through the battlefield

18
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,300
I'll go through the world

19
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,300
That unknown place

20
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
What's going on? Where's Dad?

21
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,300
Who's there?

22
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,300
Can't see anything

23
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
Get on the plane!

24
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
Someone!

25
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,300
Run!

26
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
Drive!

27
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Drive!

28
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
Help!

29
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
That's weird.

30
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,300
That's totally different from Dad.

31
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,300
He's so strong, he's even good at it.

32
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,300
He's also very strange.

33
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
He's so fierce.

34
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
It seems that this old man is not easy.

35
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,300
I thought you wouldn't make it.

36
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,300
You should analyze if Xinjian is with him.

37
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,300
From your description,

38
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,300
the old man's victory has changed a lot.

39
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,300
This is similar to the state after Xinjian was captured.

40
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,300
So the possibility of Xinjian in the old man's body is very high.

41
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,300
You can go check it out.

42
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,300
I got it.

43
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm going to do something first.

44
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Okay.

45
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Hey, my boy.

46
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
You found something?

47
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Yes.

48
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
I'm sitting here,

49
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
and it's as high as you are standing.

50
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Master, my brother.

51
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,300
Why are you dressed like this?

52
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Wow, that's a nice dress.

53
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
It's like finding a blanket for the old man.

54
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
He's so annoying.

55
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
What's wrong with you?

56
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm hungry.

57
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
I'm so stubborn.

58
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,300
My old man can't come with me.

59
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Is this okay?

60
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Yes.

61
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,300
But Brother Cao, you know how to eat.

62
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
You look like a baby.

63
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,300
You're lying.

64
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,300
My old man has been torturing me for a day.

65
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
I don't eat a few street foods.

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
Is it good?

67
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Yes.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
You try it.

69
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Why is it so cute?

70
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
You two, be careful.

71
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
Luo Ren,

72
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
that new girl is really your old man.

73
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
What is that new girl?

74
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,300
You're too naive.

75
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
You should go back to your old man.

76
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Right?

77
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,300
What have you experienced?

78
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
How about this?

79
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,300
Explain to her what we've experienced these days.

80
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Explain to her what new girl is.

81
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Your old man,

82
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,300
take that string and go to the private tutor.

83
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Okay.

84
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
No.

85
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
You two, go to the private tutor.

86
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Go to the private tutor.

87
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
You're so naive.

88
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
What are you going to do?

89
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Aren't you going to take your old man?

90
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Luo Ren,

91
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,300
this is his old man.

92
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300
He's not a criminal.

93
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,300
He's going to die.

94
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
Anyway, I'll tell you first.

95
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,300
I'm not going to participate.

96
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
I'm going back to the bar.

97
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
But I haven't decided yet.

98
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,300
Anyway, it's the safest place.

99
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Tomorrow,

100
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
I'll go to the waterfront to see

101
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
if I can find Uncle Hong Sha.

102
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,300
I'll be back.

103
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,300
Be careful.

104
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,300
That guy is here again.

105
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
One thousand three.

106
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
One thousand three.

107
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
Go ahead.

108
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
I didn't know it was like that yesterday.

109
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
He can do it.

110
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
Okay.

111
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Your shrimp.

112
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,300
My god.

113
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
It's like this.

114
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Can you eat it?

115
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
Thank you.

116
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,300
It's delicious.

117
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Your skill is good.

118
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
It's good.

119
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
But you didn't try it.

120
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
I'll take it with black sand.

121
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Is it better?

122
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
Do you know how we used to rely on seafood?

123
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
The method we created

124
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
was called black sand salt cooking.

125
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Those seafood

126
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
were put on a big stone.

127
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
My colleagues and I

128
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
had a long drink together.

129
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
At that time,

130
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,300
it was really helpless.

131
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Your colleagues?

132
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
I have two good friends.

133
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,300
One is called You Yu Si.

134
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
He always likes to sing sour songs.

135
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Another friend is called Qing Mu.

136
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
You can't hear the voice of You Yu Si.

137
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Louder.

138
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
He has a lot of soul in his hometown.

139
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,300
So he would go to the sea every night.

140
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
He wants to have a soul.

141
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,300
That picture is actually quite warm.

142
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
Where are they now?

143
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Do you have any contact?

144
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,300
After we got back,

145
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,300
we had no contact.

146
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Louder.

147
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Tomorrow, we'll go to the lake.

148
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Are you nervous?

149
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
I'm nervous.

150
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Although we have cars and equipment,

151
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
I'm thinking about that old man.

152
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
I'm so nervous.

153
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Let's play a game.

154
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Let's relax.

155
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
The rules of the game are

156
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
the opposite.

157
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
It's a person's question.

158
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
It's a person's question.

159
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
I'll ask you a question.

160
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
You can only ask one person, okay?

161
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
I'll ask you if you have any mind.

162
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
Ask directly.

163
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
I'm not stronger than you.

164
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
I'm tired.

165
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Let's start.

166
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,300
It's a game.

167
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,300
Okay.

168
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
Ask me a question.

169
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Do you like me?

170
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Yes.

171
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Hongda.

172
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
I...

173
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,300
Okay, I'm asleep.

174
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
You can continue.

175
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
Hongda.

176
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,300
If...

177
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
If...

178
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,300
the person you like...

179
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
has a lot of...

180
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,300
a lot of trouble,

181
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
do you like him?

182
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Do you like him?

183
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,300
What do you want to say?

184
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,300
I have a lot of trouble.

185
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,300
The problem of the patient.

186
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
You mean...

187
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
to avoid the problem of the patient,

188
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,300
I have to stay away from you?

189
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
If I don't make a fuss with you,

190
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
I'll wait.

191
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
I'll wait for you to solve the problems of the patient.

192
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
I'll be with you, right?

193
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
You're dreaming.

194
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
I've never loved anyone.

195
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
But I know...

196
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
the best time for the two of us...

197
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
is when you like me and I like you.

198
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Those things...

199
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,300
when I have money,

200
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,300
when I solve the problems,

201
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
when I wait,

202
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
when I wait,

203
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,300
when I wait,

204
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,300
when I wait,

205
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
when I wait,

206
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,300
when I wait,

207
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
I won't wait.

208
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,300
If the two of us meet,

209
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
and can't hold each other's hands,

210
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
maybe we'll walk together,

211
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
and meet each other's hands.

212
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
I'll only wait for that...

213
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
that...

214
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
each other has a deep love,

215
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
and I'm willing to protect it.

216
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
But we're not...

217
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,300
that close to each other.

218
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,300
After I let you go,

219
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,300
I was doing so many things that...

220
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
resulted in you 20 years ago.

221
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
I know.

222
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
It's a reallymer human being.

223
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
Don't move!

224
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
You dare to scare the old man!

225
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
The water is getting dirty!

226
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Are you crazy?

227
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Why are people crazy?

228
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
Or are you crazy?

229
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Come here.

230
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
Come with me.

231
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
Look carefully.

232
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
They are all there.

233
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,300
So many people are fighting over there.

234
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
They are fighting over there.

235
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
If you can't see them,

236
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
you can beat your dog!

237
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Look over there.

238
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
There is a man.

239
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Can you see him?

240
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
He is Jiang Jiao's father.

241
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
He fell into the water.

242
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
He saw you and he is waiting for you to save him.

243
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
He is waiting for you to save him.

244
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,300
You saved him.

245
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
What are you hesitating about?

246
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Did you get eaten by the conscience?

247
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
You don't know that, do you?

248
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
Shi Jinie.

249
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
God is also blaming me.

250
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
My conscience is also blaming me.

251
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,300
I know I am sorry for your father.

252
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,300
Jiang Jiao's father.

253
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,300
I am sorry for you.

254
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
This is all my fault.

255
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,300
My retribution.

256
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,300
Jiang Jiao's child is not happy at all.

257
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,300
It's my retribution.

258
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Jiang Jian.

259
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
I am so worried about you.

260
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
I am so worried about you.

261
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,300
My conscience is angry with you.

262
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,300
People can't stop fighting.

263
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Now we can't get out of this village.

264
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,300
It's all my retribution.

265
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
You are also famous.

266
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
You miss me and your uncle.

267
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
You miss the new sister.

268
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
I asked.

269
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Why?

270
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,300
To play football.

271
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
And?

272
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I am always thinking about the birds.

273
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
He is so blind.

274
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,300
He should go to the hospital to see me.

275
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
I am so angry.

276
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
It's okay.

277
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I am a big-hearted person.

278
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,300
I know everything.

279
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
I will arrange everything for you.

280
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
I am so angry.

281
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
I want a handsome one.

282
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Okay.

283
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
I will think about it.

284
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
I will be better than him.

285
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
I will choose the best one.

286
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
My mom.

287
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Can you come here?

288
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Of course.

289
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
Okay.

290
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
I will find you.

291
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
The best one.

292
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
You said it.

293
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,300
You are so good.

294
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,300
It's safe.

295
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
We will use the water to get to the grass.

296
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
We will check the water.

297
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
We will see if we can find any clues.

298
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
You are so stupid.

299
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
482

300
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
This case is all right.

301
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
He is the most reliable guy inlabred by two entities.

302
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
He will När you know him well.

303
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
What?

304
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
Why is there no fish?

305
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
It seems like it's dead.

306
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,300
I remember I had a lot of fish in the lake when I was a kid.

307
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Even if I had a fish on the lake, it wouldn't be a problem.

308
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Luo Ren, you should check the tank.

309
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
See if there's any fish nearby.

310
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,300
Could it be that the lake broke the water's balance?

311
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,300
I feel like the lake is connected to it.

312
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Indeed.

313
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
It's so big that people can't even imagine.

314
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
It's not too late.

315
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
It's like a small fish.

316
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
It seems like the fish is connected to the tank.

317
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
It's hard to get out of it.

318
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,300
Ma Ying!

319
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Are you okay?

320
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
I'm fine.

321
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,300
Who's that?

322
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
I'm scared to death.

323
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
Is that a bone?

324
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
It's not a human bone.

325
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,300
I'll let the tanker shoot the water and have a look.

326
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Oh my god.

327
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,300
The water is so deep.

328
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Is your village the starting point?

329
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,300
Our village has been a water god for a week.

330
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
The water is so deep that it can't even get out of the tank.

331
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
When it's in the cage, it can get out of the tank.

332
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,300
And the water is so deep that it can't get out of the tank.

333
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,300
And the water is so deep that it can't get out of the tank.

334
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
It's like a big tank.

335
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,300
I'm going to kill you.

336
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
Luo Ren.

337
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Can you turn the camera around for me?

338
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
You're late.

339
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
What should I do?

340
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
My parents left early.

341
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,300
They said it was their only son.

342
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
I think I'm going to fall asleep.

343
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
I'm going to fall asleep.

344
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
I don't think it's that simple.

345
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,300
We've been in the river for a long time.

346
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,300
We can't take it anymore.

347
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,300
I'm afraid that other people will drag us down.

348
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
No matter what,

349
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,300
let's get your uncle's corpse first.

350
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
There's no problem with the left side.

351
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
Can we take this machine?

352
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,300
The maximum weight is 120 kg.

353
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
I think it's fine.

354
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Be careful, uncle.

355
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,300
No.

356
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
No.

357
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
No.

358
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,300
No.

359
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
The tank is under the tank.

360
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
It's hard to get it.

361
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Luo Ren.

362
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Have you set up the video?

363
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,300
Yes, I have.

364
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Don't worry.

365
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
I'll bring the body.

366
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
It's my dad.

367
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
Tell him,

368
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,300
you've got everything I've burned for you.

369
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,300
It seems that

370
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,300
you have to deal with the boss first.

371
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
It's dangerous to deal with the boss.

372
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
You can't join.

373
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
I'll take one.

374
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
I must join.

375
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
You all know

376
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,300
that I came here for Ping Ting.

377
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,300
I'm not going to let you go.

378
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,300
I'm going to take the body.

379
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
I came here for Ping Ting.

380
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
If I'm on the move now,

381
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
I'll run away.

382
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
So I want to keep going.

383
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
It's dangerous,

384
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
but Lao Hua said

385
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
it's dangerous to go out.

386
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
Maybe there will be a new discovery

387
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
in the future.

388
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
I've asked the doctor.

389
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,300
His father's corpse is under the water.

390
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
My mother is also there.

391
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
He's with us.

392
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
I'll join too.

393
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,300
My dad took all of my body.

394
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,300
He almost killed me.

395
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,300
You saved me.

396
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Besides,

397
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
what's the matter with the body?

398
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I have to help you.

399
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,300
Why are you looking at me?

400
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,300
I'm a fireman.

401
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
My brother-in-law is my sister.

402
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
I'm a disciple.

403
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
Friends,

404
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,300
of course I have to go.

405
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,300
Okay.

406
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Then do it.

407
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Since you want to do it,

408
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
you have to have a plan.

409
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
I'll take Lao Bang out of the lake.

410
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
He'll be out of the lake.

411
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
I'll make a trip to the lake.

412
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
I'll go to the train station to make a plan.

413
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Get in the car!

414
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
He's too strong.

415
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
He'll start the plan.

416
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
We'll drive together.

417
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,300
Anyway,

418
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,300
we'll take him out of the lake.

419
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
As soon as the speed is high, he'll be in trouble.

420
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,300
We'll take him out of the lake.

421
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
He'll be out of the lake.

422
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,300
We'll take the help of the fish.

423
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
The body might be in the help of the fish.

424
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
As long as the body is out of Lao Bang,

425
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,300
he'll be fine.

426
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
This is our plan.

427
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,300
No.

428
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Then how are we going to

429
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,300
get him out of the lake?

430
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
I'll do it.

431
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,300
I'll tell him to come out.

432
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,300
I'll go out when he comes out.

433
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,300
I'll tell him to come out.

434
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,300
I'll tell him to come out.

435
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
I'll tell him to come out.

436
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
I'll tell him to come out.

437
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,300
I'll tell him to come out.

438
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,300
I'll tell him to come out.

439
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,300
I'll tell him to come out.

440
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,300
I'll tell him to come out.

441
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,300
I'll tell him to come out.

442
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,300
I'll tell him to come out.

443
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
I'll tell him to come out.

444
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,300
I'll tell him to come out.

445
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,300
I'll tell him to come out.

446
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,300
I'll tell him to come out.

447
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
I'll tell him to come out.

448
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,300
It's been so long.

449
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,300
You haven't come out yet?

450
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Did you see?

451
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
I can't see.

452
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
I'll look.

453
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
Look this way.

454
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,300
I'm looking.

455
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,300
Is it annoying?

456
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Go on.

457
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,300
You're the only one who's got the most.

458
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,300
Okay.

459
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,300
I can see it.

460
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,300
It's here.

461
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,300
It's here.

462
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Keep it up.

463
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,300
It's here.

464
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
It's flying.

465
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
It's here.

466
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,300
It's here.

467
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
It's here.

468
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
There's a boss.

469
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Must get up soon.

470
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
They could get there.

471
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,300
They'll capture me by flying.

472
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,860
Now let's have a look.

473
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,900
What the hell is happening!

474
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:15,820
Okay,."

475
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,500
So, that's just why

476
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,520
you look like guys.

477
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,940
Part One.

478
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,100
It takes some human

479
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,180
to be backs Mikado,

480
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,880
all will survive

481
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
stop

482
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,900
Anhoo!

483
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,840
Shut up, you gluttoner!

484
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,880
Take my bag!

485
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
Go!

486
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Go!

487
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,180
Hurry!

488
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,180
Hurry!

489
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
Hurry!

490
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
Hurry!

491
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,180
That was close!

492
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
He's too close!

493
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,180
I took him to the hard ground.

494
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
I saw how he was doing.

495
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,180
There's a door.

496
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,180
The old man who was out of the water was in the beach.

497
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,180
Hurry!

498
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,180
The victory is in sight!

499
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,180
Hurry!

500
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
Are you okay?

501
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Where are you going?

502
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,180
Let's go!

503
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,180
The car can't move.

504
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
It's stuck.

505
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
We're going to push him down.

506
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
You pushed him down?

507
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
What should we do?

508
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,180
What should we do?

509
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
Come this way!

510
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
I'll kill him!

511
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Pull the car down!

512
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
Get in the car!

513
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Get in the car!

514
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,180
This way!

515
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Hurry!

516
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,180
You have a golden point, too.

517
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,180
Brother Cao, get him!

518
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,180
Take this.

519
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Brother Cao!

520
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,180
One, two, three, four!

521
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,180
Hurry!

522
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,180
Water.

523
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,180
Water.

524
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Water.

525
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,180
Water.

526
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,180
Water.

527
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
Water.

528
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,180
Water.

529
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
Water?

530
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,180
Where's my water?

531
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
I have water here.

532
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,180
Water.

533
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,180
Water.

534
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,180
You're going to regret it.

535
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,180
Go get some water.

536
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,180
Hurry!

537
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,180
Put it here.

538
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
Water.

539
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Water.

540
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
I've checked.

541
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,180
The van is not related to the fire.

542
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,180
It's the reason for the earthquake.

543
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,180
And I've inquired about the old man.

544
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,180
After he left Wuzhu Village,

545
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,180
he had a mental breakdown.

546
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,180
He talked to Water God later.

547
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,180
He said he was pregnant.

548
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,180
He then insisted on going back to the village

549
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
and turned back.

550
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,180
He couldn't report it.

551
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,180
He was in a bad mood.

552
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
But he'll be fine in two days.

553
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,180
He'll be fine in two days.

554
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,180
What's the point of this?

555
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
What's the point?

556
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,180
You guys stay with him.

557
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,180
I'll go home and have a look.

558
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
I'll go.

559
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Come.

560
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,180
I'm sorry.

561
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,180
I've been asking you something.

562
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,180
I've been shouting at you when we were fighting.

563
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,180
Why didn't you respond?

564
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
Did you shout at me?

565
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
I shouted.

566
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,180
You were like a pervert.

567
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
No.

568
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,180
No?

569
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,180
When you were being held by your wife.

570
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,180
Mu Na.

571
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
When did he go to your place?

572
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Come.

573
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Master.

574
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
What?

575
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,180
Brother San San and Hong Sha are so cruel.

576
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,180
Shall we go to comfort them?

577
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,180
Don't go.

578
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,180
Let them do it.

579
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,180
Dad.

580
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,180
Mom.

581
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,180
You guys haven't been home for days.

582
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,180
I'll take you back to see.

583
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
I'll go.

584
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
I'll go.

585
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,180
I'll go.

586
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,180
I'll go.

587
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,180
I'll go.

588
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,180
I'll go.

589
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,180
I'll go.

590
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,180
I'll go.

591
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,180
I'll go with your son.

592
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
I'll go.

593
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
Okay.

594
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,180
I got it, Uncle.

595
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Uncle told me

596
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,180
he had a test.

597
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,180
He wanted us to go back.

598
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
I'm sorry.

599
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,180
He wanted us to go back.

600
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,180
We can't go back alone.

601
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
It's okay.

602
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
I'll go back with you.

603
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,180
I'll go back to Hua City.

604
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Where is my brother?

605
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,180
He's here.

606
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,180
Come with me.

607
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Jiang Zhao.

608
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
Jiang Zhao.

609
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
Jiang Zhao.

610
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,180
I know I'm sorry.

611
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,180
I'm sorry for your family.

612
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:15,180
I've been missing you.

613
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
I don't know if you can live

614
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,180
in the outside world.

615
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,180
I'm sorry.

616
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,180
I'm sorry for the loss of my village.

617
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,180
I beg you.

618
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Please forgive me.

619
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,180
Forgive me?

620
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,180
Can you be at ease if I forgive you?

621
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,180
You can forgive me, too.

622
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,180
The person who died was my father.

623
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,180
He was in the water for over 20 years.

624
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,180
You should beg him to forgive you, not me.

625
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,180
He lost everything.

626
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,180
I have no right to forgive you for him.

627
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,180
No.

628
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,180
I'm not qualified.

629
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
I'm not qualified.

630
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,180
I'm guilty.

631
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,180
I'm guilty.

632
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,180
I'm guilty.

633
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:14,180
I'm guilty.

634
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,180
I'm guilty.

635
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,180
I heard that

636
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,180
because of the construction of the land,

637
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,180
a small lake appeared.

638
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,180
It was not created before,

639
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,180
but because of the damage caused by the ecological damage.

640
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,180
Now the problem is solved.

641
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,180
As long as the water comes back,

642
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,180
the fish and shrimp will be tied up.

643
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,180
The fish and shrimp will be tied up.

644
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,180
I heard that

645
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,180
the land was built

646
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,180
and the fish and shrimp will be tied up.

647
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,180
By then,

648
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,180
I will come back.

649
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,180
But I have no family in the village.

650
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,180
I'm not qualified.

651
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,180
I'm guilty.
