00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
BL防

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,040
Watch out for 3 dan

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,040
The first time I saw a black hole, I thought it was a black hole.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,040
I thought it was a black hole, but it was a black hole.

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Episode 19

14
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm begging you. Please let me go.

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Please.

16
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,040
No.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,040
Sister Xing is not with him.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,040
No, no, no.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,040
When I fought with him, he was fast.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
He was strong.

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,040
I had to give him the right to attack.

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,040
But when Lu Ren came up, he was immediately convinced by us.

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Qing Shan also escaped at that time.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,040
You mean he was confused and changed his mind.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,040
He deliberately let Qing Shan escape.

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
It's possible.

27
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,040
We have already proved that Sister Xing can change her mind.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,040
What Sister Xing? I don't understand.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Do you want money?

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm begging you. Please let me go.

31
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Please let me go. Please.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,040
Please let me go. Please let me go.

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I feel that he doesn't look like Zhuang.

34
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,040
When Xiang Si Lan was separated by Xin Jian in the South,

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
didn't he forget everything?

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
You should tell Sister Xing.

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Enough. Stop pretending.

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
Xin Jian might have changed his mind.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,040
But if you really don't know anything,

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
you won't say anything after Xin Jian has changed.

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,040
You're helping Qing Shan to delay the expedition, right?

42
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,040
When Qing Shan is safe, you start pretending to be innocent and kind.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
You're trying to confuse the people.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
That's right.

45
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,040
From now on, you don't want to know anything.

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
I don't want to know anything.

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
You...

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,040
What should we do now?

49
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Where should we find Qing Shan?

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
I think I ran out of Qing Shan.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
We've been together for too long.

52
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
We can't make it.

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Brother Xia...

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
What?

55
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Where is he?

56
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
He said he'd wait for me in the car.

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Did he get caught by the Green Mountain?

58
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
No.

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
I should have taken him down.

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,040
I didn't have much patience.

61
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
He's not good at fighting.

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Why are you playing with him?

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I'm also going to fight.

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
What's wrong?

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
The message is sent.

66
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Are you still here?

67
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm going to fight with Jinzhan.

68
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
THE W production

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
sweating

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
How long can I keep Sporting every day?

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,840
Nan raised crochet

72
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,040
in your arms

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,040
I thought I only heard the wind

74
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,040
I only heard the wind

75
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,040
I thought I only heard the wind

76
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
I don't care if I'm gone

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Look at me, Ya Feng

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
The other guys, follow me

79
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,040
The things I'm doing are not for my hands

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Even if I have to stand up

81
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,040
I'm afraid that it won't be easy

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,040
I don't know if I can leave

83
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
I'm afraid that I can't live

84
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,040
I don't care if I'm gone

85
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,040
I don't care if I'm gone

86
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,040
I don't care if I'm gone

87
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,040
I don't care if I'm gone

88
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
Ya Feng

89
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Ya Feng, help me

90
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
Help me

91
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
What are you talking about?

92
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
How dare you curse my brother?

93
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
You're a child of the King of Qing Mountain

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
How dare you call me that?

95
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
I'll get you some food

96
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Okay, okay, I'm almost done

97
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Wait for me to recover

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Let's clean it up together

99
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Don't move, okay?

100
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm done cleaning it up, come in

101
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
What are you doing?

102
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
That's mine, my Xin Jian

103
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Mine

104
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
Wait, someone will clean it up

105
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Do you think this is over?

106
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
You're all in the dream

107
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Qi Qi, Qi Qi, Qi Qi

108
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Xin Jian is mine

109
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
You're all in the house

110
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Shut up

111
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
What does Qi Qi mean?

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I don't know, I keep reading

113
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,040
It's weird, everyone is normal in Xin Jian

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Why is she more than friends?

115
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Don't worry about her, you can see who is friends

116
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Why can't you get out?

117
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
What's wrong?

118
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
What's wrong?

119
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
What's wrong?

120
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,040
What's wrong?

121
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
What's wrong?

122
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Are we in the water?

123
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
The water is so high

124
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Have some water

125
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Did you see it?

126
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Yes

127
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Dog, it must be a good dog

128
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Last time, we saw the girl on the water in the south

129
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
The dog was walking around with her dad

130
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,040
This time, it's the scene of the dog's adopted dog

131
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
It's a real crime

132
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,040
It looks like the dog should be very sensitive to the owner

133
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
But who took the dog on the day of the accident?

134
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Did the dog find it by himself?

135
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Today is the family's fire

136
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
But the girl is so good to the dog

137
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
She is not only the owner, but also the watchman

138
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,040
I'm sure it must be a new dog

139
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Maybe it's a story of bullying the water

140
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,040
It should be the old days of the hundred years ago

141
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
What should we tell?

142
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Not yet

143
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
It's not a good idea to make a decision

144
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
How is it?

145
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Did you ask what the number of the seven senses is?

146
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
I didn't ask

147
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Ya Feng is really different from other survivors

148
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
I think she knows a lot

149
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,040
But she doesn't say

150
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
If Dr. He is here, it's good

151
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
She can be hypnotized

152
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Maybe she can ask for clues

153
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
I'll try

154
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
You?

155
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
I've learned hypnotizing

156
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
And I've tested positive

157
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,040
It's just that the technology is not good

158
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
The success rate of the experiment is only 50%

159
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
It's easy to fail

160
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,040
I think it's too hard to let this book hypnotize her

161
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
But...

162
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,040
It should be fine if she doesn't hypnotize

163
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,040
Forget it, don't make too much hope

164
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
You must make a hope

165
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,040
You are the first hypnotist in the second trial

166
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Then...

167
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Try it

168
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,040
We've already taken out the new key

169
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,040
How about we put Ya Feng and Qing Shan down?

170
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Yes, it's not reasonable to keep an eye on them

171
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
They are not afraid to be caught

172
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
They are actually victims

173
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Ya Feng is really good at talking

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
She is actually a little girl

175
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
Just scare her

176
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Are you sleepy?

177
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Yes, but there are too many things happening today

178
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
I can't sleep

179
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
How about we count the sheep?

180
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,040
We should count the stairs

181
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,040
One street, two streets

182
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Three streets, four streets

183
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Five streets, six streets

184
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Seven streets

185
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Seven streets

186
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
You are here

187
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Have a talk

188
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Xin Jie, how did you get here?

189
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
I don't know

190
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
She suddenly came

191
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,040
She came and she felt so good

192
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,040
She felt like she was full of strength

193
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Do you know why Xin Jie chose you?

194
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
I know

195
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Xin Jie likes me

196
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Because I am bad

197
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Actually she doesn't understand

198
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I am more suitable for Xin Jie than her

199
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Who is she?

200
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Your companion

201
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Com companion?

202
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,040
You mean Qing Shan?

203
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,040
If it wasn't for that stupid thing, I wouldn't have been caught

204
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
How did you know that trans-faceted scene?

205
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
I knew it

206
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,040
I have been here for a long time

207
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
It was them

208
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,040
They brought the government people to bury me

209
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Just in that hole

210
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
What is the magic of the miracle?

211
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Yes

212
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Don't let them hear it

213
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Except the dream and phoenix curse

214
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,040
They can't hold us back

215
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
No matter what they do

216
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
They can't get rid of the magic of the miracle

217
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,040
The miracle is 49

218
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
Yes, 49 days

219
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Those stupid people

220
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,040
They thought they could use blood to poison Xin Jie

221
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,040
What's the use of that?

222
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,040
They can only hold us for 49 days

223
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,040
No, I remember they had been trapped for 49 days

224
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
They had been trapped for 49 days

225
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
That's because they had been trapped for 2nd and 3rd

226
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,040
As long as they have been trapped for 49 days

227
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,040
The magic of the miracle will start over again

228
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,040
So it's useless

229
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
As long as they can't find Xin Jie

230
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
They will be wasted

231
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
Xin Jie is still mine

232
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Mine?

233
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
They will be wasted

234
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
They will be wasted

235
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,040
What have you done?

236
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Don't think you can get anything

237
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
You will be wasted

238
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm telling you

239
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
You are not a person

240
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
You are a person

241
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
You have a piece of skin on your back

242
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
You are also a victim

243
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
What have we done wrong?

244
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,040
We are just a poor little father

245
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
You perverts

246
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Perverts

247
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
This is really useless

248
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,040
We have been perverts for 16 times

249
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
They want to sue us

250
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,040
They want to make Xin Jie's missing

251
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
And the whole village can be punished

252
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
They have a piece of skin on their back

253
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
We want to sue them

254
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
To make a proof

255
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Let go of her

256
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
She has been locked up

257
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
She is really a criminal

258
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Fortunately Xin Jie has been arrested

259
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,040
They can't hurt anything

260
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Ya Feng

261
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Ya Feng

262
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Where are you going?

263
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Can we talk about it when we come back?

264
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Village

265
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Does it have anything to do with your village?

266
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
We...

267
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
We have been together for a long time

268
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
We have been together for half a year

269
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
You are a useless person

270
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,040
If it wasn't for you

271
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
I would have done it

272
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I want to be your husband

273
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Dream

274
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
Ya Feng

275
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Ya Feng

276
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
I have even considered my cousin

277
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
I beg you

278
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Go back with me

279
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Can't you understand?

280
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Don't follow me

281
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
I will go

282
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Scarnia

283
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,040
Go

284
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Go

285
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Go

286
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Go

287
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,600
Stop

288
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,040
Stop

289
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Stop

290
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
We can't tell

291
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Stop

292
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,640
You are so 160

293
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,080
You are a good student.

294
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,840
You are a good student.

295
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,600
You are a good teacher.

296
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
That's what you call a person.

297
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,960
You are at the entrance of the house.

298
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,040
You don't even look at me.

299
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,200
That's what you call a person.

300
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,320
Do you understand?

301
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,600
I am just giving my old man a headache.

302
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,960
What are you doing?

303
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,400
Brother Hao, go back and have a look.

304
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,120
I don't have a place to go back to when I want to.

305
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,880
Fatty,

306
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,040
in our five people,

307
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,320
you are the one who is good at looking at me.

308
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,240
Go back now.

309
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,720
I haven't been home for so long.

310
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,800
I need to go back to the store.

311
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,320
Here, take this.

312
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,040
Take it.

313
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,040
I...

314
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,840
I...

315
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,960
I don't need such a lot.

316
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,840
Keep this e-mail.

317
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
Not for you, either.

318
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,400
No.

319
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
Don't東 unenjoy any more, Chunk.

320
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,840
You deserve more than me.

321
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:27,880
No!

322
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:29,600
There...

323
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,800
I will toss up the old stingfish sellers line.

324
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
Slow down.

325
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,840
Actually, I've been thinking about this all the time.

326
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
It's good that we can go to the back mountain to see it now.

327
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,840
I think we have a clue.

328
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,840
What?

329
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,840
We don't understand these toys now.

330
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
We can get married if we want to.

331
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
If we don't, we won't.

332
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,840
I asked him what he was thinking.

333
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,840
He was like a mute.

334
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
This green mountain, this cow's temper.

335
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
It's really similar to our big mountain.

336
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,840
I don't know if this big mountain is still here.

337
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
Where?

338
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
It's outside.

339
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
He just didn't come back.

340
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,840
If he comes back, I'll beat him to death.

341
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
Mom.

342
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
Mom.

343
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
Mom.

344
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Mom.

345
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
Mom.

346
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Mom.

347
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Mom.

348
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,840
In the big city, my husband was a man at first.

349
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,840
I brought him here to see you.

350
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,840
What kind of man are you?

351
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
Even if you want to come back,

352
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,840
in my heart,

353
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,840
you are my own son.

354
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Do you know that?

355
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Son.

356
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Son.

357
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Son.

358
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Son.

359
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Son, please.

360
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Please come back.

361
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Please come back.

362
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Let's cook for the kids.

363
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,840
Son, please get up.

364
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I forgive you.

365
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Please get up, son.

366
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
Please get up.

367
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
I forgive you.

368
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Son.

369
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Son.

370
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Son, what's wrong?

371
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Son.

372
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
Son.

373
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,840
You two said that the one who was lying here is the alien.

374
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,840
There are many people who are born in the new age.

375
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,840
They are not open yet.

376
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
So they are called aliens.

377
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
They are chased and tortured.

378
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,840
So these mask-bearers are not human?

379
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
No.

380
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
No.

381
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
No.

382
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
No.

383
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
No.

384
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
No.

385
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
No.

386
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,840
So these mask-bearers are the one who is chasing after them?

387
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,840
But who are the five people in this cabinet?

388
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,840
The master said that the evil thief

389
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,840
wants them to die in the world.

390
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,840
When Yafeng was hypnotized,

391
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,840
he said that the people who brought him to the government

392
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
wanted him to die in this hole.

393
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,840
I guess

394
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,840
it's the five people who let the Star Army die.

395
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Five people who are in the same team with the Star Army.

396
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,840
We are five people.

397
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
We are in the same team with the Star Army.

398
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,840
I'm thinking that there are some mushrooms here.

399
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
No.

400
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
Are you in a mess?

401
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
You are so stupid.

402
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
Yes.

403
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,840
I'm stupid.

404
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
No.

405
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
This is a Star Army.

406
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,840
The people who escaped here are the people who saved the three treasures.

407
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,840
They set up a trap.

408
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Maybe they are the reason why the Cui family is here.

409
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Yes.

410
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
I remember.

411
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Cao Jinghua told me that

412
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,840
they used to be the victims of the Cui family.

413
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,840
And on the ranking,

414
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,840
there is a ancient word,

415
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
the word of the rabbit.

416
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Rabbit?

417
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Here.

418
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Your favorite eggs.

419
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Yes.

420
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Okay.

421
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
These are all your favorite eggs.

422
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Here.

423
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Mom, I'm sleeping.

424
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
I'm sleeping.

425
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,840
There is one more thing.

426
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,840
You should apologize to Jinghua and Dani.

427
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
I ran into his father yesterday.

428
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,840
His father was angry.

429
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
He said that he was going to die.

430
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
He said that he was going to die.

431
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
His father was angry.

432
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,840
He said that he was going to let your son take care of him.

433
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,840
He is still single until now.

434
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Here, eat.

435
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Hurry.

436
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Eat.

437
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,840
Eat.

438
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
Jinghua,

439
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
my father said that

440
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
he thinks that I have delayed your personal life.

441
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,840
I apologize to you.

442
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,840
It's okay.

443
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
I'm telling you.

444
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm still thanking you.

445
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,840
I ran out of the house to work.

446
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Then I found that the outside world was so big.

447
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
There were so many ways to live.

448
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,840
Although I'm tired and tired of work,

449
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
I feel very rushed.

450
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
I'm very stupid every day.

451
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
Yes.

452
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,840
As for personal problems,

453
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
I'm

454
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
quite good alone.

455
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
I just want to work well

456
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
and make money.

457
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Then give my family a better life.

458
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,840
I want to improve myself from the inside to the outside.

459
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
To be honest,

460
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
many people in the family are chasing me.

461
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
But they have rejected me.

462
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Because I don't know how to talk to them.

463
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
How can I talk to them?

464
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
Right?

465
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Yes.

466
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Even if you don't know how to talk to them,

467
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
they are...

468
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,840
Tudor.

469
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
I'm still

470
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
worried about you.

471
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
I think

472
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
your current working environment

473
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
is too dangerous.

474
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Men?

475
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
So,

476
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
I think

477
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
you should buy insurance.

478
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
I...

479
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
I'll buy insurance.

480
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
I have a lot of insurance.

481
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,840
I understand.

482
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
Manager, you misunderstood.

483
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,840
I'm a friend of mine.

484
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,840
I'm a foodie.

485
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
I'm very safe.

486
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
I'm very safe.

487
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Your friends?

488
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
I just went up the mountain.

489
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Up the mountain?

490
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Why didn't you go with them?

491
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,840
The same is the way out of the window.

492
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
The road is getting wider and wider.

493
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,840
People are getting thinner.

494
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
I've been walking all the way here.

495
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
I even have a watch.

496
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Luckily, I met some friends.

497
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
I'll see them.

498
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
The village of Cao is a treasure.

499
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,840
All villagers are from Cao.

500
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,840
They are from the army.

501
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,840
So,

502
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Cao is the descendant of the Star Lord?

503
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
The Star Lord is the one who was killed by the Star Lord?

504
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Then there won't be any problem in the village.

505
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
When the season comes,

506
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
the village has forgotten the treasure.

507
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
I just want to make it a traditional custom.

508
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,840
By the way,

509
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
Li Kecai told me about this.

510
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I'm the descendant of the Star Lord.

511
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
I'm the descendant of the army.

512
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Why didn't you tell me?

513
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
Who is it?

514
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,840
It's me.

515
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Didn't you say that you want me to say sorry?

516
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
What do you mean?

517
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,840
I can deal with them,

518
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
but I can't let them die.

519
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
What if they want me to die?

520
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Don't worry.

521
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
They want the Star Lord.

522
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
They don't want your life.

523
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
The Star Lord?

524
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,840
Didn't you want my life?

525
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,840
In order to achieve the true goal,

526
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,840
I think it's worth it

527
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,840
to sacrifice everything now.

528
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
But people are almost dead.

529
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
You've played too much.

530
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
You said you were playing like this.

531
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
How can you let others play like this?

532
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,840
You think I'm stupid?

533
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
You didn't even tell me that there was a wild tiger.

534
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,840
They have five people.

535
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
They are all so fierce.

536
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
I'm a man with a lot of guts.

537
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
It's a waste to sacrifice.

538
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,840
Everything is as you wish.

539
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,840
I'm done for.

540
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
You still blame me?

541
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,840
No, no, no.

542
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
I didn't blame you.

543
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
I really didn't.

544
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,840
Okay, okay.

545
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,840
Luckily, nothing happened.

546
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
Right?

547
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Think about it.

548
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
If anything really happened,

549
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
would I forgive you?

550
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
No.

551
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
I don't have the heart anymore.

552
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,840
But you still have it.

553
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Give it to me.

554
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
Give it to me.

555
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Sister likes me more.

556
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,840
She will be happier with me.

557
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Give it to me.

558
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Give it to me.

559
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,840
No way.

560
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
No.

561
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
Give me the heart.

562
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Give it to me.

563
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
Give it to me.

564
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
So, you want to go home?

565
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
Yes.

566
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Send us to the town.

567
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
I'll go there.

568
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
My parents want me to accompany them.

569
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,840
Hello,

570
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,840
all the family members.

571
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Brother Cao,

572
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
what's wrong?

573
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,840
This time, we are going to the grassland village.

574
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
We are not going to go to the front garden with your grassland flower.

575
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
What are you talking about?

576
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
I can't talk to you.

577
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Then are you not going to

578
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,840
turn your love into a wild tiger?

579
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
We don't have love.

580
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I'm afraid I'll be lonely and old.

581
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
To prevent this horrible thing from happening,

582
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
I'm going to raise a pet.

583
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
What pet?

584
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
I didn't think about it.

585
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
But what kind of pet do you meet

586
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
in what place?

587
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
It should be a kind of Yuan-Fat.

588
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
It's a Yuan-Fat.

589
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Fine.

590
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
I'll take care of it.

591
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
You go first.

592
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Go on.

593
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,840
I'm not married.

594
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
They don't care at all.

595
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
They don't care at all.

596
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
They are in my birth.

597
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
They don't like me.

598
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
My phone is broken.

599
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
I'll go to the front to repair it.

600
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
You can go out and have a look.

601
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
I bought some food.

602
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Eat on the way.

603
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Okay.

604
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
I'll go.

605
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
I'll go.

606
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
I'll go.

607
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
I'll go.

608
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
I'll go.

609
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
I'll go.

610
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Let's go, Erhao.

611
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Give me some.

612
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,840
Okay.

613
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Fatty,

614
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
the private meeting is over.

615
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
I'll go with Erhao.

616
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
Let's go.

617
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Fatty,

618
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
you are so rude.

619
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
What about you?

620
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Go out and have a walk.

621
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Let's go.

622
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
I'm going to have a look.

623
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Erhao, what do you want to eat?

624
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
I'll take you to eat.

625
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Let me see.

626
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
There's a good noodle shop.

627
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
Oh, a good restaurant.

628
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
What do you want to eat?

629
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I'll buy it for you.

630
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Let's go.

631
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Let's go.

632
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Erhao,

633
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Ji,

634
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
are you going to give me back the money?

635
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Are you lonely?

636
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
I'll go and fix my phone.

637
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
Come back soon.

638
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
Wait for me.

639
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
What a coincidence.

640
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
I just called you.

641
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
What does the seven stars mean?

642
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
What's the big danger?

643
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
The heart will grow.

644
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
What does it mean?

645
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
How do you grow?

646
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
I don't know.

647
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
It was said by Yin Erma last night.

648
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
He thought I was going to ask him right away.

649
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
He said I was going to curse him.

650
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
He just heard that the seven stars

651
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
will grow.

652
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
But how?

653
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
How big?

654
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
He really doesn't know.

655
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
What's the big danger?

656
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,840
The heart will grow.

657
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
What's the big danger?

658
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
I don't know.

659
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Just a little.

660
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Relax.

661
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Relax.

662
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Your reward is

663
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,840
in the book I wrote.

664
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
I

665
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
will

666
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
write it on the book.

667
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Mr. Dada

668
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
came out of the canyon.

669
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
We had a good time in our village.

670
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,840
We asked for a drink.

671
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
We asked for meat.

672
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
We ate a little.

673
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
We told the story.

674
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
One.

675
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
Because of the passion,

676
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
one

677
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
has become a source of energy.

678
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,840
Why do you

679
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
have to go to the temple

680
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
every day

681
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
to see the moon?

682
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,840
Love.

683
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
Love is the star.

684
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
One.

685
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
You see the most

686
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
two stars.

687
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
One.

688
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Six.

689
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
When?

690
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
One.

691
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
A few years ago,

692
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
one day,

693
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I saw a monkey.

694
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
Did you see

695
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
the seven stars?

696
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
No.

697
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
No.

698
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
No.

699
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
You saw the seven stars,

700
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
you were in trouble.

701
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Why did you see them?

702
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
They will grow.

703
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,840
Grow?

704
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
I'm sorry.

705
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm really sleepy.

706
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
The dialogue yesterday

707
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,840
caused my deep death.

708
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
You see,

709
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
if this heart

710
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
doesn't grow,

711
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,840
it will never grow.

712
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
I'm sorry.

713
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
I'm sorry.

714
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
I'm sorry.

715
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
I'm sorry.
