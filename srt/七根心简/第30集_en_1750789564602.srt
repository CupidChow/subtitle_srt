1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
oh

3
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,740
Oh

4
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,460
Okay

5
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,540
This is water hands가지

6
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:50,580
Safe to carry

7
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,520
Motor walls

8
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,860
You can kiss it when in danger

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll play you a nice tune.

10
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,320
How did you do it? Why can only I play the flute?

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,920
I won't tell you.

12
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
I just want to read it.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Old man.

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Dragon.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's over.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're dead and you want to hold the dagger.

18
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You want to kill me before I die.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've prepared a surprise for you.

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I prepared a surprise for your little girl.

21
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For a dangerous bomb?

22
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Dragon, you're going to die.

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've prepared a beautiful and beautiful lotus feast for you.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Are you looking forward to it?

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come on.

26
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What's up?

27
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go.

28
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Dragon.

29
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Jing Mo. Jing Mo. Wake up.

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Jing Mo.

31
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Jing Mo. Jing Mo.

32
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Jing Mo, you're going to fight.

33
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's wrong? You're going to fight.

34
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Fight?

35
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm going to fight.

36
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Jing Mo. Jing Mo.

37
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Dragon.

38
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll help you.

39
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let me go.

45
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Go.

46
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go.

47
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Hong Sha, you're safe.

48
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Go.

49
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Go.

50
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Go.

51
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let go of my master.

52
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll kill you.

53
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Go.

54
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Come back.

55
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sorry. I didn't hit you.

56
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I didn't hit you.

57
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Did you find anything on your bag?

58
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What? What?

59
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I was alone just now. I was about to fall. I stole everything.

60
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hurry up and call the hospital to get three cars.

61
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Someone is dying. Hurry up.

62
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Did you hear that? There's a gunfight inside.

63
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There's no gunfight.

64
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's here.

65
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A firecracker.

66
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Can you blow it?

67
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Jing Mo, you're wrong.

68
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Jing Mo.

69
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hurry up.

70
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Jing Mo.

71
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What the hell is going on?

72
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Where is Su Su?

73
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Is she dead?

74
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Su Su.

75
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Hurry up.

76
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't run.

77
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hurry up.

78
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let go.

79
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We're back home safely.

80
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Not good.

81
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The doctor said that maybe...

82
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Uncle Shi will handle the funeral in Black Sand.

83
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He'll be back soon.

84
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Where's Little Bean?

85
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Where's Little Bean?

86
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He's not coming back.

87
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Go to sleep.

88
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Be careful.

89
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Be careful.

90
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Human.

91
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Sometimes, humans are not human.

92
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Uncle, how's the firecracker?

93
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Not good.

94
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I asked them to send me pictures and videos.

95
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I've seen dozens of them.

96
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
None of them are real.

97
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But the video is right.

98
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Little Bean, are you awake?

99
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No.

100
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why are they all lying down?

101
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I have to think about it.

102
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're here to see your boyfriend?

103
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I heard that he can't wake up even if he eats.

104
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Wait. Where should I put this ball?

105
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You can't put it here.

106
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It should be lower.

107
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's a heart.

108
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
A little higher.

109
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
A little higher on the left.

110
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Look.

111
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mu Dai, you're here.

112
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Come here.

113
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll show you something.

114
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Luo Ren, wake up.

115
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Mu Dai misses you.

116
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We miss you too.

117
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Take it easy.

118
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Go to 2019 Racquetball.

119
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We'll come again next year.

120
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Take us to a estuary and give us a lift.

121
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Me too.

122
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Thanks.

123
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
With the memories of warmth, I'm slowly hugging you

124
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
In this spring, the road is hard to cross

125
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Mudai, if Luo Ren can never wake up, do you want to wait for him?

126
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Wait. Of course I have to wait.

127
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm waiting for someone who is worth waiting for.

128
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm full of hope every day. I hope he wakes up.

129
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Luo Ren, do you know that the night storm has been in the way.

130
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No normal person can act.

131
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
After sending the group of people, they will be sentenced to jail.

132
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Tasha has returned to Xi Ao.

133
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Senior Brother Dai contacted his current guardian and found him a best care center.

134
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He did a mental test, but it's not ideal.

135
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He can't return to life in a short time.

136
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Kneel.

137
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Kneel.

138
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Kneel.

139
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Don't forget to buy Chinese cabbage, seaweed, potatoes.

140
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And some good yellow wine. Don't bring me anything else.

141
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I know, I know.

142
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It seems that our red sand is reliable.

143
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Of course.

144
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I won't do it for nothing. Your salary has to be transferred to me.

145
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I have to pay the bill.

146
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't worry.

147
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Luo Xiaodao.

148
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Luo Xiaodao.

149
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I've been sleeping for a month. When do I have to sleep?

150
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
If I get used to it, I'll come to see you only once every ten days and half a month.

151
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What should I do?

152
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The deadline is coming. You can't sleep anymore.

153
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We are waiting for you to take us to catch the seventh star.

154
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That table.

155
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll take it.

156
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Qingmu.

157
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What's wrong with my Luo?

158
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I can't hear you. What's wrong with my Luo?

159
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Luo.

160
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Don't worry. I woke up once.

161
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I asked if you were safe. I said everyone was safe.

162
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The doctor said it was a good symptom.

163
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't worry.

164
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Now Luo is fine. I also bought a ticket.

165
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm going home tomorrow.

166
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're going home?

167
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hello, Jize.

168
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Are you okay?

169
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I hope you and Luo are happy.

170
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll leave her to you.

171
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Every memory is quietly facing the flowers.

172
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Looking at each other's tears.

173
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Together through the wind and sand.

174
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Using the river to answer to oneself.

175
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I thought.

176
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This endless fate.

177
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Like a quiet cliff.

178
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Walking through the pain and the thorns.

179
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The dream is in my hands.

180
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's much better.

181
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Looking at the future.

182
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I believe I believe I believe.

183
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The end of love.

184
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
How long do I sleep?

185
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
More than a month.

186
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Are you hungry?

187
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Do you want to eat?

188
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What?

189
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
At that time.

190
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I was hurt by you.

191
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It was a life-and-death battle.

192
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not a small injury.

193
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's okay.

194
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Don't worry.

195
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll be there.

196
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Does it hurt?

197
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
This time.

200
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I did it wrong.

201
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You don't have to say sorry.

202
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I did a lot of good things.

203
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
All this way, you've been supporting us.

204
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Take care of us.

205
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This time, it's my turn.

206
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I can't take care of you.

207
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Don't be sad.

208
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Now it's okay.

209
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Everyone is over.

210
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Everyone is safe.

211
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Isn't it a good thing?

212
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Right?

213
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Why are you listening to me?

214
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Or we can talk later.

215
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's okay.

216
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Mudan.

217
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
We were in the cage.

218
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We were all in the mud.

219
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
How did you wake up?

220
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I called Mudan out.

221
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I was locked in a place.

222
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I can see the signal.

223
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I calculated the signal for three seconds.

224
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's very easy to help hypnotize.

225
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Ye Bao wants to brainwash us.

227
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He made us another tower.

228
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
He used it to deal with me.

229
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We can't let him succeed.

230
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Of course not.

231
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Fortunately, he doesn't know that there is a mistake in this world.

232
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You're too tired.

233
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Come on.

234
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's not easy to hide it.

235
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Pretend to be brainwashed.

236
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
So,

237
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
you and I sleep together.

238
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The other person accepts brainwashing.

239
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I just don't understand.

240
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What is the key to this hypnosis?

241
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What is the key to this hypnosis?

242
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
The young master of Luo Ren.

243
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He said

244
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
this is the sound of the jade.

245
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
When he heard the young master,

246
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
he woke up.

247
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And a brainwashed person can't stay.

248
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He must be stopped by himself.

249
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
To eliminate the regret.

250
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Why?

251
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You know everything.

252
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm you.

253
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's hard to brainwash.

254
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Come back.

255
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Don't cry.

256
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't cry.

257
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The world is so big.

258
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
My existence is to protect me.

259
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Listen.

260
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I will be like a master.

261
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I will fight to the last battle.

262
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's a pity.

263
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's a pity.

264
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I can't see you on the stage.

265
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Don't be afraid.

266
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You are invincible.

267
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You will come back alive.

268
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Luo Xiao Du.

269
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I...

270
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I feel like...

271
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Sometimes I feel lonely when I wake up in the middle of the night.

272
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I feel like

273
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
a part of my body

274
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
is torn apart.

275
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Master.

276
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
People say

277
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
growth is saving me.

278
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I keep on falling in love.

279
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I keep on being in love.

280
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But I don't think so.

281
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think growth is

282
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
saving me and keep on hugging me.

283
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
They are like a family.

284
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Mo Dai.

285
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He is you.

286
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You are him.

287
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
He never disappears.

288
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He only chooses

289
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
not to appear again.

290
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Look.

291
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Look.

292
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Look how energetic we are.

293
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Mo Dai will be more energetic.

294
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You are awake.

295
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I am afraid you will...

296
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Great.

297
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Your eyes are bigger than mine.

298
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
What are you doing?

299
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It's okay.

300
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Don't be scared.

301
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's okay.

302
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You are so funny.

303
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
You...

304
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
You should eat more delicious food.

305
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You should try to recover your energy.

306
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Congratulations.

307
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Mo Dai.

308
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Thank you, Uncle Guan.

309
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
We are hanging up.

310
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Brother Ma.

311
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Wake up.

312
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What I made

313
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
is not as delicious as yours.

314
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Here.

315
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Let me massage you.

316
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You are so brave.

317
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Great.

318
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Thank you.

319
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's a good song.

320
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Right?

321
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yes.

322
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It's a good song.

323
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Great.

324
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Next, we will perform

325
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
a more powerful dog poem.

326
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
We will let the dog

327
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
draw a happy letter from these words.

328
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Isn't it that dog?

329
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Okay.

330
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Look.

331
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's a happy letter.

332
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Great.

333
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Next,

334
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
we will let the dog

335
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
draw a happy letter from these words.

336
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Another one.

337
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Look.

338
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Happy.

339
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Happy.

340
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Happy.

341
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Happy.

342
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Great.

343
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Great.

344
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Right.

345
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The dog has a sharp nose.

346
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Who knows what it smells like

347
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
on the paper?

348
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Right.

349
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Look.

350
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
There are people like you

351
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
in every age.

352
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
This is a detective.

353
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You are so good.

354
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Brother.

355
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
What do you think?

356
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Let me write.

357
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
If the dog can read,

358
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I will buy a silver dumpling.

359
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
No.

360
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Who knows if you and the leader

361
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
are in a good relationship?

362
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Right.

363
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Guys, I will give you a tip.

364
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I think

365
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
we should write

366
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
the poem of the old man Wei

367
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
in the Nongzheng private school.

368
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That's fair.

369
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Right.

370
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The daughter of the old man Wei

371
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
is here.

372
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Miss Wei.

373
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
She can also read.

374
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
She can write the same.

375
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Right.

376
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Right.

377
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
This one.

378
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Is it the one in the private school?

379
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's a dog again.

380
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It can read.

381
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Although this

382
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
good dog's intelligence

383
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
can reach the level of a child,

384
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
it can't read

385
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
the words.

386
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You are not sure.

387
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Maybe it's on the paper

388
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
that it smells like something.

389
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So far, we have got information.

390
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The story is about to be completed.

391
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Let's read it.

392
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
First,

393
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
in a place called Nongzheng,

394
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
there is a private school

395
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
that was opened by the old man Wei.

396
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
There is a girl

397
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
who can read and write.

398
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
There is a performance in the town.

399
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
One of the parts is called the Poem Box.

400
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The audience is wondering

401
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
if it's real.

402
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
They invited Miss Wei

403
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
to write the poem.

404
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Poem Box.

405
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It appeared in the private school.

406
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Miss Wei must have been eating it.

407
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
From this speculation,

408
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
it's possible that

409
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
after the performance,

410
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Miss Wei adopted this dog.

411
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
After that, Miss Wei married.

412
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I guess the dog has lost its owner

413
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and went to find it.

414
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The dog is easy to raise.

415
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Then the husband took it.

416
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
In the water camp,

417
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
it's a couple's daily life.

418
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The dog lost its owner in the dark.

419
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Maybe it's because

420
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
it loves the owner too much

421
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and has hatred for the owner.

422
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
After that,

423
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
there was an endless fire.

424
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Miss Wei and her husband

425
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
died in the fire.

426
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Oh, no.

427
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It can't be the dog that set the fire.

428
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
The dog set the fire?

429
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
That's a bit exaggerated.

430
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But the Chu family was affected.

431
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
This dog is really unmovable.

432
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
If the dog has a heart,

433
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
it's normal that it can set the fire.

434
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I don't think so.

435
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Do you remember the first water camp?

436
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
This is the mountain range.

437
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I didn't see it before.

438
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Isn't this the Fengzi Ridge?

439
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Now we know

440
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
that about 280 years ago,

441
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Mei Hua and Yi Zhao went to the Fengzi Ridge

442
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
to give hearts.

443
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
The age of the lion and dog

444
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
appeared 100 years ago.

445
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
This picture

446
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
is like the owner's

447
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
wandering around after the disaster.

448
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I don't know why,

449
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
but when we were in the Fengzi Ridge,

450
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
we opened the phoenix's cage

451
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
and released the heart.

452
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Do you remember

453
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
when we went to the Fengzi Ridge,

454
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Ding said

455
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
there was a dog

456
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
that lived for a long time.

457
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
My dad said

458
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
he saw it when he was a kid.

459
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Do you know how old he is?

460
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
That dog was so scared.

461
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But don't be afraid.

462
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Twenty years ago,

463
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
a customer of mine

464
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
killed him.

465
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Is this the dog

466
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
in the water camp?

467
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
This is a lot of information.

468
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I searched here

469
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
and didn't find a place

470
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
called Longzheng.

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
This is normal.

472
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
My master wanted to

473
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
burn knives in Lai City before he died.

474
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But when we checked,

475
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Lai City is not called this name.

476
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Many cities

477
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
are no longer used to saving lives.

478
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
This is easy to do.

479
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Give it to Wen Fenghuo.

480
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I understand.

481
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
The water camp is going to tell us

482
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
how Xinjian escaped this round.

483
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
After they entered the city,

484
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
they wanted to continue their previous plans.

485
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I won't let them succeed.

486
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
The color of Xinjian is getting lighter.

487
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The seven-leaf clover tree is about to fall.

488
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The seventh root,

489
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
according to the position,

490
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
is in the canyon.

491
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But where exactly is it?

492
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
This day

493
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
is finally coming.

494
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,840
The

495
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
news came from Wen Fenghuo.

496
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This is the location

497
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
of the previous Longzheng.

498
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Tongxian.

499
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The Fengzi Ridge is next to it.

500
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It seems that the Fengzi Ridge is the key.

501
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But the area is so big.

502
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
How can we find it?

503
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Let's take a look.

504
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Come back and get ready.

505
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Let's go as soon as possible.

506
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
How many days are you going this time?

507
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
If it goes smoothly,

508
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
seven or eight days.

509
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
That's okay.

510
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't bring too many things.

511
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Yes.

512
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I don't know

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
what you are doing.

514
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
This time,

515
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
don't be like last time.

516
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Aunt Hong can't stand you.

517
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I know.

518
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Don't worry.

519
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
When I come back this time,

520
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll be in the bar

521
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
and accompany you.

522
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I won't go anywhere.

523
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Really?

524
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Of course it's true.

525
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Good things are fun.

526
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But

527
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
young people like you

528
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
should go out more

529
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
to see the world.

530
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Bye.

531
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Take care of your body outside.

532
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Be careful and safe.

533
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I know.

534
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Okay.

535
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I've finished packing.

536
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I have to get up early tomorrow.

537
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Rest early.

538
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Okay.

539
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm leaving.

540
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Master.

541
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Master.

542
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
We saw a illusion again.

543
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I remember

544
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I wanted to open the window

545
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
and breathe.

546
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Then I opened the window

547
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
and my eyes were

548
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
full of green.

549
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It was like the original forest.

550
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Trees.

551
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Yes, trees.

552
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Many trees.

553
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yes.

554
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
In the middle is an empty space.

555
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
There is a strange tree on the empty space.

556
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It's like the kind of tree

557
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
we saw in the park.

558
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
The stem is a microphone.

559
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
The stem is a microphone.

560
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
The stem is a microphone.

561
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The stem is a microphone.

562
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The stem is a microphone.

563
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
The stem is a microphone.

564
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
But it's crooked.

565
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yes, crooked.

566
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
There is a tree.

567
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Why is Xun picking people?

568
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I've been in the team

569
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
for a long time.

570
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm also a member of the team.

571
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Why didn't he let me see it?

572
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
This is not up to others.

573
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You don't come to the team when you start.

574
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
It's normal to lack development.

575
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Who lacks development?

576
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Who?

577
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Who?

578
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Go and get some water for everyone.

579
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Come on.

580
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
About the phoenix forest,

581
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I remember

582
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
there is a record

583
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
in the ancient books of the Guansi Pailou.

584
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The Great Deity and the Flower of Meihua

585
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
are all heading to the phoenix forest.

586
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
They must be built in the place of the beginning.

587
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Maybe what we see

588
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
is this place.

589
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
The place of the beginning?

590
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Then this time

591
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
we really have to welcome

592
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
the end of the war.

593
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
According to this fantasy,

594
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
the seven new arrows

595
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
are in the phoenix forest.

596
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
The seven arrows

597
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
never shine on the Guansi Pailou.

598
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Have they never been activated

599
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
or left?

600
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It's normal.

601
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There must be a house

602
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
in the seven arrows.

603
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They are willing to be lost.

604
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Or they can't move.

605
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Maybe the setting of the first game

606
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
determines that the seven arrows

607
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
can't leave the place of the beginning.

608
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
San San, you are very smart.

609
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
There is no such possibility.

610
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I think it's possible.

611
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Because Xiao Qiqi

612
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
doesn't have the time to go to the phoenix forest.

613
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Xiao Qiqi

614
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
hasn't grown up yet.

615
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Then we locked him up.

616
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Uncle Guan,

617
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
let's not call Ni Cheng

618
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
the new arrow, okay?

619
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I don't think it's too optimistic.

620
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Maybe this Xiao Qiqi

621
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
is hiding something.

622
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It doesn't matter.

623
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
We should be confident

624
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
in ourselves.

625
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I recently

626
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
received the news of this lock.

627
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
It's getting more and more.

628
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
My intuition is that

629
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
it's possible to find the lock.

630
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The doctor said

631
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
the mother's condition

632
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
is developing in a good direction.

633
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Everything is good and unstoppable.

634
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Yes, that's the spirit.

635
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
We should think in a good way.

636
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I believe

637
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
we can definitely succeed this time.

638
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
But there is a question.

639
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
You say.

640
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
If the old tree is in the phoenix forest,

641
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the square of the phoenix forest is hundreds of miles away,

642
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
how can we find it?

643
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
It's easy.

644
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
That tree looks so strange.

645
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And it must be over a thousand years old.

646
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
The old people living nearby

647
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
must have seen it.

648
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I just met this person.

649
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You mean the old tree?

650
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The mountain is high and dense.

651
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Only that part is not deep.

652
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Only it is alive.

653
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You said that

654
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
reminds me of it.

655
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm tired.

656
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Mr. Yang.

657
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Why is it harder to walk

658
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
than last time?

659
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And we are getting cold.

660
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's getting cold.

661
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
It's getting deep.

662
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The mountain is high.

663
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The climate in the mountain is strange.

664
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's snowing in June.

665
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It's smoking in June.

666
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
There are strange things.

667
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
How are you?

668
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Someone said that

669
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
it's a place where

670
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
stars fall and fall.

671
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What is the star?

672
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's a place where you can see the stars.

673
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's a place where people are afraid of danger

674
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
when they enter the mountain.

675
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So they made up this story

676
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
to deceive people.

677
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Be careful.

678
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
If there is a star,

679
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
our life

680
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
will be so good.

681
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Follow me.

682
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You have to climb up.

683
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Take a break.

684
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Take a break.

685
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I have a little advice.

686
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Just make my business

687
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
a success.

688
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Last time, I took a picture with you.

689
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I take pictures with every team.

690
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'll show you.

691
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Let me show you.

692
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Look.

693
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I took this when I was young.

694
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I took it with my toes.

695
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I've been doing this for decades.

696
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You are so familiar with this.

697
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Uncle Ding.

698
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Does this person have an impression?

699
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Yes.

700
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
He is the one

701
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
who beat the dog to death.

702
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
My guest.

703
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
What's his name?

704
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Zhang...

705
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Zhang Guanghua.

706
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Zhang Guanghua.

707
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Just this name.

708
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You are familiar with it.

709
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You are familiar with this person.

710
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
He has to thank me.

711
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
How to say it?

712
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
He has to thank me.

713
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
He has to thank me.

714
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
How to say it?

715
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Back then,

716
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
he had a low oil level.

717
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
He couldn't see the dog.

718
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
So he beat the dog to death.

719
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
He wanted to cook it.

720
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
He added oil to himself.

721
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
But he stopped me.

722
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Because the dog

723
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
was too strange.

724
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
How strange?

725
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
How strange?

726
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
On his body,

727
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
he has no fur.

728
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
He is not the kind that naturally falls off.

729
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It's like using glue

730
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
to stick it on.

731
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Then tear it off.

732
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Tear it off.

733
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
How many strips does he have?

734
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Three.

735
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Four.

736
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
He has a lot of glue.

737
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:47,760
No

738
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Look.

739
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We are here.

740
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Just this tree.

741
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Uncle Yun, thank you.

742
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Thank you.

743
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Don't stay inside

744
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
for too long.

745
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The weather changes fast in the mountains.

746
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's cold.

747
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You must be careful.

748
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Be careful.

749
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Be careful.

750
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Be careful.

751
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Be careful.

752
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It seems that dog is the dog.

753
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's left in the mountains.

754
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Today, by chance,

755
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
we opened the seal of the heart.

756
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's alive.

757
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
According to the past experience,

758
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
it's very likely that the heart

759
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
chose Zhang Guanghua on its own.

760
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Otherwise, he is an ordinary person.

761
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
He can't deal with the heart of the dog.

762
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's hard to say

763
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
how many Zhang Guanghuas are there.

764
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
If Zhang Guanghua has two hearts,

765
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
after the dog falls off,

766
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
if he gives one to Liu Shuhai,

767
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
he still has one left.

768
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Then he may still be alive.

769
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
If he still has the heart,

770
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
there are only seven left.

771
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Let's go.

772
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It's time to verify.

773
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Let's go.

774
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The sky is clear in the flowers

775
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Tell me the end

776
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,140
The gentle

777
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,000
appearance is about to happen

778
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
In my mind,

779
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
gently

780
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
the mask of sadness

781
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And I'm in the dark

782
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And I'm in the dark

783
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The ugly face of the person

784
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
is divided into two sides

785
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
One side is the main character

786
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
One side is waiting for you

787
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
This game

788
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
never ends

789
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,760
It's the trace of this

790
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,000
walk

791
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
You are my

792
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
tacit understanding

793
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I didn't hear

794
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I became you

795
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Feel every breath of yours

796
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Then it's time to verify

797
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The sky is clear in the flowers

798
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Tell me the end

799
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
The gentle

800
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
appearance is about to happen

801
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
In my mind,

802
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
gently

803
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
the mask of sadness

804
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And I'm in the dark

805
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
The ugly face of the person

806
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
is divided into two sides

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
One side is the main character

808

One side is waiting for you

809
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
This game

810
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
never ends

811
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's the trace of this

812
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
walk

813
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
You are my

814
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
tacit understanding

815
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I didn't hear

816
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I became you

817
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Feel every breath of yours

818
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Tell me the end

819
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
The sky is clear in the flowers

820
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Tell me the end

821
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
The gentle

822
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
appearance is about to happen

823

In my mind,

824
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
gently

825
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
the mask of sadness

826
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
And I'm in the dark

827
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The ugly face of the person
