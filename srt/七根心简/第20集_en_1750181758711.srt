1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Lried face

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You

3
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Chigga

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Chigga

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Chigga

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Chigga

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There are three more

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Just count them

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Chigga

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Chigga

11
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Chigga

12
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Chigga

13
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ten

14
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Chigga

15
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Chigga

16
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Chigga

17
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Chigga

18
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Chigga

19
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,200
It's okay, take it.

20
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,960
Thank you, Uncle Shi.

21
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,200
You can go now. Goodbye, Uncle Shi.

22
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Qian?

23
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,040
61000

24
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
Vai!

25
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,120
Wait up.

26
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,280
What are you doing, Brother?

27
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
Keep this on for the military!

28
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,600
You like it?

29
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
Something feels mixture,

30
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,120
right?

31
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,360
My husband knocked on my door.

32
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,180
I approached the door and kicked the lock.

33
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,760
Is that your husband, or?

34
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,380
The owner of the client told me

35
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,380
that the lock is notencyd.

36
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,560
Since when has he searched the house

37
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,440
andpayed tableware fees?

38
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,220
Have you had a Gucci Love Versailles order?

39
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,520
No.

40
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,020
I did something,

41
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,220
I think marriage is a big deal to you.

42
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,820
After all, it's only once in your life.

43
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,420
I'm your cousin, so I have to come back.

44
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,020
I won't see my parents.

45
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,420
You're the only one who knows I'm going back to my village.

46
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,820
What?

47
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,220
Your marriage has been over for so many years.

48
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,220
Your uncle and aunt have forgotten about it.

49
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,420
They're probably arranging a wedding in the square now.

50
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,620
How about this? Let's go there together.

51
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,420
No, no, no. You stay there.

52
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,820
I have two things to do when I come back.

53
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,820
First, I want to see you and give you a red envelope.

54
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,620
This young man is not that handsome when he was young.

55
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,420
Second, I want to see my cousin.

56
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,420
I'll go back after I'm done.

57
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,820
Okay. Let's go inside and rest for a while.

58
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,420
We'll get some food later. I'll lock the door first.

59
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
You're back early. You should have told me.

60
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,220
You must have been in the rain all the way.

61
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,420
Let's go. It's raining heavily.

62
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,020
Brother, it's raining heavily. Be careful.

63
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,620
You're so red when you see girls.

64
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,420
You're getting married and you're getting married.

65
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,820
I heard that girl is your maid.

66
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,820
What's her name?

67
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,020
Her name is Ya Feng.

68
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,820
She's very pretty.

69
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,220
She's pretty.

70
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,620
She's pretty.

71
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,220
I don't know what's going on, but she likes me.

72
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,820
You're getting a good deal.

73
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Why is the front yard locked?

74
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,220
It used to be locked.

75
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,020
It used to be locked because there was no valuable item in the house.

76
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,620
How can it be compared to before?

77
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,020
Yes.

78
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,220
Okay. Let's go in.

79
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,220
Okay.

80
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,620
After we finish our work, I'll take you to Ya Feng.

81
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,020
Ya Feng is afraid of the rain.

82
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Can you see it?

83
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,820
There are rules.

84
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,420
Before the bride and groom come, no one is allowed to enter.

85
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,020
I know.

86
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,220
Those are the rules of the older generation.

87
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,620
We just have to be quiet.

88
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Besides, are you an outsider?

89
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,420
That's my cousin.

90
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,020
Don't worry.

91
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,220
Okay.

92
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,020
Here's the thing. You eat first.

93
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,820
There are guests outside. I'll go back to work.

94
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,620
Go ahead.

95
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,020
I'll bring the door for you.

96
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,620
Besides, if this is a letter that your parents forced to write,

97
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,020
it should have a secret code on it.

98
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,220
Look. There's nothing wrong with this letter.

99
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,620
Then I'm relieved.

100
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,220
What's wrong?

101
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,820
There's a mark on the handwriting.

102
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,820
That's it.

103
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,620
Ya Feng!

104
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,620
Ya Feng.

105
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,620
Ya Feng.

106
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,420
Ya Feng.

107
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,020
Ya...

108
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,420
Ya Feng.

109
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,020
Ya Feng.

110
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,820
I...

111
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,420
I'm Cao Qing Shan's cousin.

112
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,620
You were kidnapped?

113
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,020
Uncle, please help me get out.

114
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,820
Okay.

115
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,620
Why did you keep it from her?

116
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,020
I didn't want to either.

117
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,620
Cao Peng Peng only wrote one line.

118
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,220
If someone is playing around, it's no use telling everyone.

119
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,820
If it's true,

120
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,220
this is something that someone else did,

121
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,620
she thinks she's not on her own, so...

122
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,420
So she didn't tell anyone.

123
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,620
How long has she been a mistress?

124
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,420
For four years.

125
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,620
She's been a mistress for four years.

126
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,620
She's been a mistress for four years.

127
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,620
It's been 48 hours.

128
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,420
Her base station is broken.

129
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,620
The signal is bad.

130
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,020
Plus, she's busy with her wedding.

131
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,620
So...

132
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
She's not in touch.

133
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,420
This is a big and small matter.

134
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,020
What if Cao Peng Peng doesn't handle it properly

135
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,420
and gets caught by the criminals?

136
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,620
How about this?

137
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,820
I'll ask the fire department to inquire about Cao's village.

138
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,220
If there's anything,

139
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,420
we'll go over there.

140
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,020
Okay.

141
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,220
Okay.

142
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,420
Who drew this?

143
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,620
What's wrong?

144
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,420
Are you okay?

145
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,020
I don't know.

146
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,820
Maybe it's a guest who's drunk.

147
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,820
Maybe he knows about our bar,

148
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,420
the one that's broken up, the one that's lost his wife, the one that's unemployed.

149
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,420
He's drunk and he's doing a couple of things.

150
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,020
Right, look at the numbers.

151
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,620
They're not even written properly.

152
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,220
7, 8, 6, 7...

153
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,620
Are you okay?

154
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,020
I'll change it later.

155
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,620
I'm fine.

156
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,620
Okay, you guys go back and pack your bags.

157
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,620
I'm going to Cao's Village tonight.

158
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,420
I have to pay the bill.

159
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,620
Okay.

160
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,420
Take a picture.

161
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,220
You guys draw well.

162
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,820
I'll change it tomorrow and then we'll talk.

163
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,220
Okay.

164
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,820
Luo.

165
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,620
Qingmu.

166
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,020
You drew this?

167
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,420
You have such a complicated way of sending numbers.

168
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,620
It's not like your personality.

169
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,020
I went to look for you.

170
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,820
You're not here.

171
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,220
I have something important to do.

172
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,420
Tomorrow night, I have to see you.

173
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,820
I have something to do tomorrow night.

174
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,620
Come or not, you can do it yourself.

175
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,020
Okay.

176
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,820
I have to go check if there's a bar in Cao's Village.

177
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,820
I can't say if there's a bar, but I can confirm two things.

178
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,020
There's a big banquet in Cao's Village.

179
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,020
Many people go to drink.

180
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,420
Second, the bride is called Ya Feng. She's a county girl.

181
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,820
She was a waitress in Meishi City.

182
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,020
A lot of her friends will be there.

183
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,020
So clean.

184
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,220
Little lady.

185
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,420
Do you think that Cao is really married?

186
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,620
We can go to her wedding.

187
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Are we going to get married or get married?

188
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Okay.

189
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,220
Ready to go.

190
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,820
30 kilometers in the whole city.

191
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,220
It takes about 35 minutes.

192
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,820
Turn right after 40 meters.

193
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,620
Cao's Village is so dark.

194
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,820
No, I'll take you to the airport.

195
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,020
We're going by plane?

196
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,820
I have something to do.

197
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,620
I can't go with you.

198
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,020
So I bought you a plane ticket.

199
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,620
Okay.

200
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,220
Okay.

201
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:11,220
Then, let's meet after you're done.

202
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,820
Okay.

203
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,620
The taxi is here. I'll go around.

204
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,020
No need. We can just get off here.

205
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Let's go, 13,000.

206
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,220
I'll get you a ride.

207
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,620
He didn't say anything to you?

208
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,220
Then why didn't you ask?

209
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,820
Why would I ask if he doesn't want to?

210
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,420
What do you mean he doesn't want to?

211
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,620
He's your boyfriend. You two are dating.

212
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,820
Lu Dai.

213
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,620
After we get there, we have to contact each other at least once a day.

214
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,220
I know the air-raid station is not good.

215
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,620
But it seems okay outside the village.

216
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,420
I'll have to trouble you to run for a while.

217
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,620
I practiced kung fu before.

218
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,020
I had to run 10 to 20 kilometers before going to bed every day.

219
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,020
That's nothing.

220
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,420
Let's just call it a day. I'll call you every day.

221
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,020
The time is 10 p.m.

222
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,820
Let's go.

223
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
I'll walk you out.

224
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,020
No need. You seem busy.

225
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,620
Get back to work.

226
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,820
You know what?

227
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,420
You did a great job. You were just trying to be nice to him.

228
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,220
You let him know that he changed his plan.

229
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,020
You were just angry. You were just angry.

230
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,020
You were just playing around.

231
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,820
Take it.

232
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,620
What's wrong?

233
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,620
I forgot to tell you something.

234
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,220
I know that it's important that you don't go to Cao Yan Hua with me.

235
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,620
It's okay if you don't want to tell me now. I respect your choice.

236
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,820
But I want to say that if you're trying to protect me,

237
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,620
or you're afraid that I'll get into trouble and you're trying to hide it,

238
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,820
I don't think it's necessary.

239
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,620
If we want to walk together for a long time,

240
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,820
we have to go through a lot of ups and downs.

241
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,820
I can't let you protect me every time there's a storm.

242
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,620
You won't make me feel safer.

243
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,220
Instead, you'll make me never be able to face the storm.

244
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,420
I hope that you have faith in your partner.

245
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,820
He can fly with you.

246
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,620
He can fly with you.

247
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,620
Maybe his wings will be more powerful and he can fly in front of you to protect you.

248
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,620
Okay.

249
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,820
I wish us all the best.

250
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Okay, okay.

251
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,420
Okay.

252
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,220
I'm leaving.

253
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,220
Follow your little boss.

254
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,820
How do you use my voice?

255
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,220
To be honest, it's not that bad.

256
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,220
When you're in the car,

257
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,020
you pick up your own bottle of poison and put it in your hand.

258
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,020
And then you use those medicine bottles to fight.

259
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,820
Swish, swish, swish.

260
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
The sky is dark and the sun is shining.

261
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,620
Then swish.

262
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,620
You can get rid of all the bad thoughts.

263
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,420
No.

264
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,020
No.

265
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,620
What's wrong?

266
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,620
What do you have in your hand?

267
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,020
You have a brush.

268
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,420
Okay.

269
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,020
It's a brush.

270
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,620
I told you.

271
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,820
The best thing you have in your hand is

272
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,020
the brush.

273
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,220
The brush.

274
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,220
What is the brush?

275
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,420
It's the kind of wood that doesn't get old,

276
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,220
doesn't get old,

277
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,420
doesn't get old.

278
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,020
This kind of wood...

279
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,620
Where did you get it?

280
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,220
Where did you get it?

281
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,220
The wood that doesn't get old.

282
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,620
There's a mountain called Phoenix.

283
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,820
What's Phoenix?

284
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,820
It's called... what's Phoenix?

285
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,220
What's Phoenix?

286
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,420
Phoenix...

287
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,820
What?

288
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,220
What's the gift?

289
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,220
I can't remember.

290
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,220
What's Phoenix?

291
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,420
Da De.

292
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,620
He received a new sword.

293
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,420
What is it?

294
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,420
The engraving.

295
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,220
One is enough.

296
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,020
To pay them.

297
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,820
You mean, those ancient words are Da De's?

298
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,820
After he received the new sword, he engraved them one by one?

299
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,420
That... that...

300
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,020
That Phoenix is a great god.

301
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,420
Phoenix is the best.

302
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,220
He came from heaven.

303
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,820
That's right.

304
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:41,020
That's why Phoenix is engraved.

305
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,420
The new sword engraved can't be missed.

306
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,820
It's all old.

307
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,220
Phoenix is engraved.

308
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,020
What's Phoenix? I can't remember.

309
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,020
Brother Lin.

310
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,420
Brother Lin.

311
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,020
What's Phoenix?

312
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,020
Thank you.

313
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Thank you.

314
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,620
Thank you.

315
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,220
Sorry.

316
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,020
You're from Yanxi?

317
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,620
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go back.

318
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:32,420
Where's the

319
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,220
New Mountain?

320
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,620
Long time no see.

321
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,620
You've grown taller.

322
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,420
You are...

323
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,420
You forgot?

324
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,420
Cousin, Cousin Cao Yanhua.

325
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,620
We're friends of Cao Yanhua.

326
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,420
We came from Yanxi.

327
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,820
I see.

328
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,620
If Cousin brought some friends from the city,

329
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,220
I...

330
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,020
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:53,820
I'm angry.

332
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,220
I know.

333
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,820
I'll have two.

334
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,420
It's a little worse than the city.

335
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,420
But don't mind it.

336
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,020
Come on.

337
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,220
Sit down.

338
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,620
Have some hot tea and rest.

339
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,220
I'll talk to my uncle later.

340
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,420
Tell him to get you a room.

341
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,420
Thank you.

342
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,420
I'm going.

343
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,220
I feel like Cao Xia Village

344
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,220
is not like that place with no roads.

345
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,820
It's hard to say.

346
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,220
After all, we've been led by someone.

347
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,820
Did you find anything along the way?

348
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,220
Nothing.

349
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,220
Slow down.

350
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,620
It's going to rain.

351
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,420
What are you looking at?

352
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,820
Thank you.

353
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,820
Yes, put it there.

354
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,820
It's done.

355
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,620
Look at the road.

356
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,620
It's a little bit slippery.

357
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Cousin.

358
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,220
Don't touch that.

359
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,020
Cousin Cao's father.

360
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,820
You can leave it there.

361
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,020
Cao's parents died early in the Qing Mountain.

362
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,820
Cao's father is his uncle.

363
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,220
He's half of his father.

364
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,220
If...

365
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,420
If the wind was driven by the wind,

366
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,220
Cao would not have left.

367
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,620
If Cao was caught because of the wind,

368
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,420
then the tiger poison is not a child.

369
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,620
He's afraid he'll be locked up.

370
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,620
He won't be in trouble.

371
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,420
That's what I mean.

372
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,020
But I'm afraid Cao

373
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,620
didn't go back to the village.

374
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,020
The Qing Mountain is so old.

375
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,420
Even he told me he didn't come back.

376
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,220
I believe him.

377
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,420
But Cao

378
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,420
made a phone call at the grocery store.

379
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,220
So I think he might have

380
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,420
made some mistakes on his way back.

381
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,820
You mean the young man?

382
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,020
I remember.

383
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,620
He and the fat flower of Cao's family

384
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,020
were found by the money.

385
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,020
Fat flower?

386
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
Fat flower?

387
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,820
Yes, it's Cao Jin Hua.

388
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,020
He's now called Cao Jian Ni.

389
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,420
You think Cao Jin Hua is suspicious?

390
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,420
No way.

391
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,620
They've been together for seven or eight years.

392
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,020
You don't know much about humanity.

393
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,620
Cao Jin Hua was pushed out by Cao Pang Pang.

394
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
He was so angry that he was in a bad mood.

395
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,820
He was a little angry.

396
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,620
The day came and the night came.

397
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,420
On the way back home,

398
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,620
Cao Jin Hua met me.

399
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,420
They were so close.

400
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,820
He just...

401
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,820
He...

402
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
But it's not a big deal.

403
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,220
It's possible that the next money

404
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,220
is on Cao Jin Hua.

405
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,820
Don't you believe me.

406
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,020
There are three money out there.

407
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,620
I can't let go of the guard.

408
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,820
I'd rather be a traitor.

409
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,820
I won't let go of any of your money.

410
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,020
I heard the guests from the city of Yan

411
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,620
are my fellow villagers.

412
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,020
You two.

413
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,220
You're so handsome.

414
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,020
You're from a big city.

415
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,420
Come on, sit down.

416
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,620
Sit down.

417
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,020
I'm a member of the Cao family.

418
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
I've been working in the city of Yan for five or six years.

419
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,820
I heard the guests from the city of Yan are so close.

420
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,220
I came to meet them.

421
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,020
Right, I'm Cao Jian Ni.

422
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,220
Just call me Jenny.

423
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,620
I live in the city of Yan's He Ding Qu.

424
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,620
What about you? Which district do you live in?

425
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,820
We?

426
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,220
We live in...

427
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,820
The city of Luo Ri Qu.

428
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,020
Luo Ri Qu?

429
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,620
The city of Zhong Xin City?

430
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,020
You look like a rich man.

431
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,820
By the way,

432
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,220
how did you know about Qingshan?

433
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,220
He hasn't been out of this village.

434
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,220
Just a tourist.

435
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,020
Right, he doesn't like tourists.

436
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
Tourists are good.

437
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,820
What does that mean?

438
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,220
It means rich and free.

439
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,020
For example, we're working in the countryside.

440
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,620
We're too busy to travel.

441
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,820
You live in a place close to the subway.

442
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,420
But you must have a car.

443
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
A car is good.

444
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,820
Just a taxi on the way.

445
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,220
Luckily, there's a rental car.

446
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,820
Right.

447
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,820
But...

448
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,220
Anyway,

449
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,820
whether it's a trip or a car,

450
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,220
it's risky.

451
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,020
Some people

452
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,020
leave home in the morning

453
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,420
and never come back.

454
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,420
Some people can leave

455
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,420
in the street.

456
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,220
Don't you think so?

457
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,620
What do you mean?

458
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,420
I mean

459
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,820
people have their own risks.

460
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,020
God has his own ways.

461
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,820
Smart people should be prepared.

462
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,020
This is my business card.

463
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,820
Listen,

464
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,220
this risk is like a storm in nature.

465
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,820
It's taking our lives.

466
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,420
Insurance? What is insurance?

467
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,220
It's when danger comes.

468
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,020
You can lift the umbrella.

469
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,620
It can block the wind and rain.

470
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,620
It can block the rain.

471
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,020
It's...

472
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,620
No money?

473
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,020
No money?

474
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,820
Then insurance is more important.

475
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,420
Think about it.

476
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,620
The war and the disaster.

477
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,420
Rich people can afford it.

478
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,620
What about the poor?

479
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,420
The only thing they can rely on

480
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,620
is insurance.

481
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,420
I'm still young.

482
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,020
Maybe I'll talk to you later.

483
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,820
Where are you going?

484
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,420
I...

485
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,620
I dropped the peanuts.

486
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Peanuts?

487
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
We have peanuts.

488
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,420
Don't be so polite.

489
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,020
You don't have to eat them.

490
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,620
Come on, pretty lady.

491
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,620
You too.

492
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,020
Listen, pretty lady.

493
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,820
You're young.

494
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,820
It's better to buy them.

495
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
It's cheaper.

496
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,420
The same age as 20 and 40.

497
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,620
The latter is twice as expensive.

498
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,620
You should buy them as soon as possible.

499
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,020
Eat.

500
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,620
It's good.

501
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,820
Chenyin.

502
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,820
You're right.

503
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,620
I need insurance.

504
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,820
Do you have a pen?

505
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,420
Do you have a pen?

506
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
Yes.

507
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,420
Yes.

508
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,620
Here.

509
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,220
Look.

510
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
I've prepared everything.

511
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:46,820
Thank you.

512
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,620
Come on.

513
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,820
My family is strict.

514
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,020
So my salary is kept by my brother.

515
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,420
I'll leave you his phone number.

516
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,020
If you need anything,

517
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,420
just tell him.

518
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,620
You buy insurance.

519
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,620
Your brother pays you.

520
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,820
Yes.

521
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,420
What's your brother's name?

522
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,020
My brother's name is Luo...

523
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,020
I'll write it down.

524
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,620
My brother's name is Henry.

525
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,420
Henry?

526
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,020
Yes.

527
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
My brother's name is Henry.

528
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,420
What about you, handsome guy?

529
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,020
Me?

530
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,420
I'm the same as him.

531
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,220
I share the same brother.

532
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,820
He's my brother.

533
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,620
My brother pays me.

534
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,420
Your insurance is also his brother's.

535
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,020
Yes.

536
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,020
You two are the same.

537
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,020
Yes.

538
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,420
That's great.

539
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,820
So it's three steps.

540
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,220
Three steps.

541
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,220
Okay.

542
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,820
I'll take you to the room.

543
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
Okay.

544
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,620
Qingshan.

545
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,420
I forgot something.

546
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,420
Coming.

547
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,220
Wait a minute.

548
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,220
Okay.

549
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,220
Do you still think Cao Qinghua is suspicious?

550
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,620
Don't you think he has a heart?

551
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,420
Unless the fifth heart is particularly ambiguous.

552
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,820
Okay, now all the clues are broken.

553
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,620
I think Qingshan is fine.

554
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,420
I think Cao Jinni is fine.

555
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,420
I think Cao Yaonan is fine.

556
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,020
Where do you think Cao Fangfang is?

557
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
I think we have to meet Ye Feng.

558
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
He is the key person.

559
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,420
Yes.

560
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,420
Qingshan.

561
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,820
When can we see the bride?

562
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,620
Yes.

563
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,620
I want to see.

564
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,820
I think it will take three days.

565
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,620
We will have a party in three days.

566
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,420
Three days?

567
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,620
Well, there is a rule in our village.

568
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,620
The bride can't see her groom or outsiders before marriage.

569
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,820
I know you city people think it's not necessary.

570
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,220
I also think it's not necessary.

571
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,220
But the old people are particular.

572
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
That's a pity.

573
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,220
We can't see the bride.

574
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Yes.

575
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,820
What a pity.

576
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,020
Why?

577
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,420
Because we are too busy.

578
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,420
We have time to see the family situation for your cousin.

579
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
We will go back tomorrow.

580
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,420
It's a pity that we can't see the bride.

581
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,420
Yes, it's a pity.

582
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,620
I'll take you back to your room.

583
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,020
I'll discuss the rest with the old lady.

584
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
Okay, thank you.

585
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,020
Come in.

586
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,020
Qingshan told me yesterday that you came here

587
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,020
to congratulate the bride in person.

588
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:54,020
I think it depends on the situation.

589
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,020
But the groom is a man.

590
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,020
He is not a good man.

591
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,020
It's not convenient.

592
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,020
It's okay, I can represent him.

593
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,820
Is the bride alone in the backyard?

594
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,820
No one is with her?

595
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,820
Yafeng is a poor child.

596
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,620
She has no family.

597
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,420
She said she would have two friends in a few days.

598
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,220
Come, sit.

599
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:26,020
How did she know Qingshan?

600
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,820
Qingshan was free at home a while ago.

601
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,820
She came to the county office and worked for three months.

602
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,820
When she was eating, she met Yafeng.

603
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,820
They got along well.

604
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,020
They said they were getting married soon.

605
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,220
We were happy too.

606
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Qingshan is not a small girl.

607
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,420
It's good to see her.

608
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,820
But Qingshan is married.

609
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,220
Our daughter...

610
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Yafeng, I brought a friend from Qingshan to see you.

611
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,820
Come.

612
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,420
Yafeng.

613
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,820
Yafeng. Yafeng.

614
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Why is she so scared of life?

615
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:23,220
Yafeng, this is a friend from Qingshan.

616
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
She wasn't like this before.

617
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,820
Maybe she's nervous about being a bride.

618
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,620
Here, our little gift.

619
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,420
I wish you and Qingshan a happy marriage.

620
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,420
Take it.

621
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,220
Take it.

622
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,420
Yafeng, take it.

623
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,020
Yafeng.

624
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,020
I saw it. You sent it too.

625
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,020
I won't bother her then.

626
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,820
Okay.

627
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,620
I'll go.

628
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,420
We arrived in the city in ten minutes. Why are you riding a camel?

629
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,020
I'm going to free the camel.

630
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,620
Free it.

631
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,220
Raister

632
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,220
Go.

633
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:32,580
He just found Edition

634
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,780
Look at this.

635
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,180
Is this a rock?

636
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,380
Yes, it is.

637
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,980
But it's not an ordinary rock.

638
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,380
My grandpa said

639
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
it fell from above.

640
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,780
A meteorite?

641
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,380
Oh my god!

642
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,580
Such a huge meteorite!

643
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,380
Such a huge rock!

644
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,580
It's so huge!

645
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,380
It's so huge!

646
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,380
No, only the rock in the middle.

647
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,980
The rock next to it is just a piece of rock

648
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,380
that's been stuck together for too long.

649
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,780
I found a problem.

650
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,380
You said that Mr. Bo Yangzi

651
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,380
left a piece of rock behind.

652
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,980
It wasn't him who left the rock.

653
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
He found it.

654
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,580
And you said

655
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,180
there are seven reflectors in here.

656
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,980
Why do I see only five?

657
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,780
Look carefully.

658
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,380
It's like looking at the sky.

659
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,180
You only care about the brightest stars.

660
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,380
Those dark ones on the edge

661
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,380
will be ignored.

662
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,180
There's one here.

663
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,980
There's one here too.

664
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,780
Seven.

665
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,780
It's really seven.

666
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,780
This shape...

667
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,580
What's this pattern?

668
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,980
It looks like a wife.

669
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,980
That's right.

670
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,980
It's a wife.

671
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,980
It's a wife.

672
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,780
This is...

673
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,580
the Seven Star of Heaven.

674
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,980
What's the Seven Star of Heaven?

675
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,180
Brother Yun, look.

676
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,180
Don't look. You can't see it now.

677
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,980
When the sky is full of stars,

678
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,580
the ancients would name

679
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,980
a combination of stars.

680
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,380
In foreign countries, this is called a constellation.

681
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,780
In our country, it's called a star.

682
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,180
The Seven Star of Heaven is one of the 36 stars.

683
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,580
That's how it looks.

684
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,980
It's like the wife of the ancients.

685
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,580
There are seven stars.

686
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,780
Seven stars of heaven.

687
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,380
Seven stars of heaven.

688
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,380
One star corresponds to one star.

689
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,380
We've conquered four stars.

690
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,780
There are three stars.

691
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,580
Why are there five stars?

692
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,180
The Seven Star of Heaven

693
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,180
People's sorrow

694
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
is divided into two parts.

695
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,180
One side is the first,

696
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,180
the other side is waiting for you.

697
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,180
This game

698
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,180
is the end of the story.

699
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,180
It carries the traces of the past.

700
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,180
You are the one who is the match.

701
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,180
You are the one who is the match.

702
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,180
I will be you.

703
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:31,180
I will feel every breath of you.

704
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,180
Then I will continue to cherish the sky.

705
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,180
The flower is bright and bright.

706
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,180
Tell me the end.

707
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,180
The gentle breath

708
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,180
is in my mind.

709
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,180
The flower is bright and bright.

710
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,180
Tell me the end.

711
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,180
The flower is bright and bright.

712
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,180
Tell me the end.

713
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,180
The flower is bright and bright.

714
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,180
The gentle breath

715
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,180
is in my mind.

716
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:18,180
The flower is bright and bright.

717
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,180
The gentle breath

718
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,180
is in my mind.

719
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,180
The flower is bright and bright.

720
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,180
Tell me the end.

721
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,180
The gentle breath

722
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,180
is in my mind.

723
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,180
The flower is bright and bright.

724
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:58,180
And I am in the dark.

725
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,180
Thank you for watching!
