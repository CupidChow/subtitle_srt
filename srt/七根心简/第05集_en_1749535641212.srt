But, myЯ

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:10,280
God if we've made it through the challenges and challenges, then we'll make it all past!

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,280
Emzyms are the proof.

Coal- oatmeal container

Sw bowel

8
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:31,400
Mrs.

9
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
I don't care what you are.

10
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Just be safe.

11
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,280
I'll take you out of here.

12
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Yin Ting.

13
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
I'm hungry.

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Here.

15
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Play with the duck.

16
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
It's okay.

17
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,280
You mean,

18
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
who will move?

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
There's a flower on it.

20
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
It's hard to say.

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,280
I didn't see it clearly even though it was a flash.

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,280
It's like a chicken's body.

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
It's like a relationship between a chicken's body and the host.

24
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
By the way,

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
was Ping Ting still in the wedding song?

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Did she have any contact with the host?

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
I...

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
I'll send you a video.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Uncle Kun,

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
you still use smart phones.

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,280
I can't use smart phones.

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,280
I have no connection with this era.

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
I'm afraid you'll bother me.

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,280
This tune is Ping Ting's song.

36
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Who are you?

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
He's Luo Ren.

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
I mentioned him before.

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Hello, Mr. Shen.

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,280
I'm Ping Ting's guardian.

41
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I'm also a friend of Mu Dai.

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,280
A friend of Xiao Kou Dai is my friend.

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,280
I compared Ping Ting's singing style to his.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,280
He's not a normal song.

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,280
He's a song that's like a rising up in the cold.

46
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,280
What about Ping Ting and Uncle Kun?

47
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Why did you choose this song?

48
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
I'm not sure.

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
I need to check it out.

50
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Xiao Kou Dai, Xiao Luo Bo.

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
You guys keep on researching.

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
If you have any new progress,

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
call me.

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
If you don't have any new progress,

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
don't call me.

56
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Okay.

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Xiao...

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
Xiao Kou Dai.

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,280
This is Mr. Shen's personal habit.

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
He doesn't have any bias.

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,280
He's the one who's giving you a nickname.

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
He's the one who's taking you as a friend.

63
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
He's the one who's sure about you.

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,280
And Xiao Luo Bo is such a rich person.

65
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
He's got a lot of land.

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,280
He's a person who's changing.

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Sorry.

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,280
I'll get you some water.

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Thank you.

70
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Alright.

71
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
Hmm.

72
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
No, you don't have to gourmet friends.

73
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,440
Life is so beautiful. Why are you sighing here?

74
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:46,400
You don't understand the

75
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:54,800
c

76
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,200
c

77
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
I have to accompany him.

78
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,640
Why? Have you been there?

79
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,320
Of course I have.

80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,360
And what's the name of that man?

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,600
He's a real man.

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,560
He's a fake man.

83
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,080
He even said he's a fake man.

84
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,800
He's a fake man.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,960
Can you believe that?

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,200
You...

87
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,040
You're right.

88
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,440
I mean, it's a misunderstanding.

89
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,040
Because...

90
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Let me tell you.

91
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,320
Xiao Le Wen's wife

92
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,400
is stubborn.

93
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,560
She can't call back in her phone.

94
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,600
What should we do?

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,520
We can only send someone

96
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,920
who has a plan to catch her.

97
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,280
Uncle Zhang.

98
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,800
This old lady

99
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
entrusted her to you.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
If she had any problem,

101
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,360
Uncle Zhang, you're so hard-working.

102
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,960
It's the one who can rely on her.

103
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,360
Who is she?

104
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,400
¡...

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,760
Stop making noise.

106
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
It's uncomfortable.

107
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,680
I thought I saw this.

108
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,920
You, in order to avoid being worked up,

109
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,480
won't just like your father-in-law

110
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
reading a book and having fun.

111
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,960
Let me tell you.

112
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,560
He always wants to find a quarrel.

113
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
He doesn't want to move.

114
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,520
What? You want to trouble him?

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,520
To be honest,

116
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,000
are you ganging up debates again?

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,720
No.

118
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,760
Why not?

119
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
I'll take a photo and a card.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,720
By the way,

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,720
you can go with me.

122
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,760
Why should I?

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,920
Uncle Zhang promised to pack the food for you.

124
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,040
I don't have the money.

125
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,600
I can pack the food.

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,280
You can eat and stay.

127
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,720
You can take the money yourself.

128
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,840
Don't be so mean.

129
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,760
You just don't have time to play.

130
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,760
You can take me as your companion.

131
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,440
You are so mean.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I really thought for you.

133
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Think about it.

134
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,800
You are going to be a teacher.

135
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,200
The mountain is not like you.

136
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
You are like a mountain.

137
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,120
You are far away from the mountain.

138
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,560
You are being chased by people.

139
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,440
You don't want to go to the small mountains.

140
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
You are so sincere.

141
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,120
The teacher who is innocent will be touched by you.

142
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,800
Say it.

143
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,160
I'll say it again.

144
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,040
If that tofu really has a three-way cut,

145
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,280
you will be a child.

146
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,720
You will be in a fire.

147
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,680
What should I do?

148
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,280
I have to cry.

149
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,080
I beg you.

150
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,280
Cao Yuanhua, you are my childhood friend.

151
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,560
It's okay.

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,360
Yuan San.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,120
Although you are very good at speaking,

154
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,960
you have to say it.

155
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
You are so talented.

156
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,880
Let's go.

157
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
We have a deal.

158
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,000
Lingqiao is going to be late.

159
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,960
I want to go back to you.

160
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,920
Yes, you can leave if you want.

161
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,880
I will be back to you for the main hall.

162
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:48,440
See you.

163
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,000
Bye.

164
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,440
Bye.

165
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,680
Do not be afraid.

166
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,120
Then we can go downstairs.

167
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,040
Take care, signing.

168
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,720
Miss Zong.

169
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
I thought I ran too fast.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,360
I Mom bricks andFations are wet.

171
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,360
I'll go get some food.

172
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
I'll be there in a while.

173
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Are you okay?

174
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Here?

175
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Don't worry.

176
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
You're well rested.

177
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
You'll be back soon.

178
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
Okay.

179
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
You're the best.

180
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
You drink less water.

181
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Don't drink too much.

182
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
The more you drink, the more you'll be dry.

183
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
It's useless to drink too.

184
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Really?

185
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Did you bring a lip balm?

186
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
I was walking around.

187
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I was walking around.

188
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
I was walking around.

189
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Okay.

190
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
You can use mine first.

191
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
I'll buy it for you later.

192
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Thank you.

193
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Wait a minute.

194
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
I don't mind.

195
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Okay.

196
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Thank you.

197
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
I'll go get some food.

198
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Captain.

199
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Come on.

200
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Have a seat.

201
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Please sit.

202
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Thank you.

203
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Thank you.

204
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Thank you.

205
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Thank you for what you did these two days.

206
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
You don't know that it's been a long time.

207
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
It's just a mess.

208
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Where's Luo Ren?

209
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
He's watching Ping Ting eat.

210
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
He's in a good mood.

211
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Of course.

212
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
You don't know that

213
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
when Luo Ren just got home,

214
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Fan Ning didn't like to talk.

215
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Ping Ting is like a little aunt.

216
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
She's always there.

217
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
She's always there.

218
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
Come on.

219
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Have some soup.

220
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Thank you, Uncle Zheng.

221
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
Later,

222
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Luo Ren left.

223
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
He didn't stay here.

224
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
But

225
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
their relationship didn't change.

226
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
One day,

227
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
I was with his uncle.

228
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
I wanted to make up for them.

229
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,360
I didn't expect

230
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
this to happen.

231
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Make up for them?

232
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Aren't they siblings?

233
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
They have no blood relationship.

234
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
They're siblings.

235
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
They just keep talking.

236
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Keep talking.

237
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Eat.

238
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
What's wrong with you?

239
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
You came to help,

240
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
you know?

241
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Ren Luo is so stubborn.

242
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
How nice it is to be with you.

243
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
What's wrong with you?

244
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Look at you.

245
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Have you heard what I said?

246
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
Don't think too much.

247
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm not drunk.

248
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
Don't look for me.

249
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
The building is really nice.

250
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Wait.

251
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
Wait.

252
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Wait.

253
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
I think it's over there.

254
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
There's a movie.

255
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Look, the building.

256
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Right?

257
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Yes.

258
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
We'll go ahead.

259
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Let's go.

260
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Right here.

261
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
It's only here.

262
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
I'll give Uncle Zhang a card.

263
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
There's no sign.

264
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
I can't go in.

265
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
That way.

266
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
What are you looking at?

267
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Hurry up.

268
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
Are we a private house?

269
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
I'm not lying.

270
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
I just want to see.

271
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Tell me.

272
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
What's wrong?

273
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Nothing.

274
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Are you blind?

275
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I saw a window with a wooden roof.

276
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
A window?

277
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
A window.

278
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Right.

279
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
There's a woman in the window.

280
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
Is that woman a wooden belt?

281
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
No.

282
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
It must be a woman.

283
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Could it be a woman who plays in a movie?

284
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
A young woman.

285
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Hurry up.

286
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
Let's call the police.

287
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
No.

288
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
We haven't seen it clearly.

289
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,360
If it's a miscarriage,

290
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
the woman is still inside.

291
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Do you want to be her disciple?

292
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Do you want to be alive?

293
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Yes.

294
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
Then continue to observe.

295
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Try to find some information.

296
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
I saw a horse.

297
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
It's a nonsense.

298
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
Mu Dai.

299
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
Coming.

300
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
What's wrong?

301
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
What are you looking at?

302
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,360
If I'm not mistaken,

303
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,360
the two brothers are in your shop.

304
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
I still have a machine to control.

305
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
I'll go.

306
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Don't be polite.

307
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Sit down.

308
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
It's okay.

309
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Drink some water.

310
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Say it.

311
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
What are you doing here?

312
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Boss Xia, it's like this.

313
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
We've been watching you for days.

314
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
We even miss you.

315
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Yan Xia, please respect each other.

316
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
What can't be said directly?

317
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
You say it.

318
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Uncle Cheng is worried about you.

319
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
What is he worried about?

320
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
The place is so far away.

321
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
He's not familiar with life.

322
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,360
And he's a guy who doesn't know the bottom line.

323
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
He's a guy who doesn't know the bottom line.

324
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Uncle Zhang doesn't know you.

325
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
He knows you're a guy.

326
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
He's a girl.

327
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
You two go out together.

328
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
He's not worried about you.

329
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Yes.

330
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
I'll explain to Uncle Zhang.

331
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
You two go back and forth.

332
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Don't do this.

333
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Don't, Xiaolabunniang.

334
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
We've been running here for a long time.

335
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
The water is so dirty.

336
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm just...

337
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Come on.

338
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Come out.

339
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Give me a hand.

340
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I bought too much.

341
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Luo Ruo.

342
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I bought too much.

343
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
I bought too much.

344
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Luo Ruo.

345
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Uncle Zheng.

346
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Uncle Zheng.

347
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Uncle Zheng.

348
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Who are you?

349
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
They're...

350
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
They're friends from the wooden belt.

351
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
They came to Xiaoshan River to live for a few days.

352
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
That's good.

353
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
The lamb leg is not bad today.

354
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
I can't help but buy more.

355
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
I can't finish the meal.

356
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
You two are here.

357
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
It's so good.

358
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
It's so hot.

359
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Eat it all.

360
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Come on.

361
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
I'll test it for you.

362
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
Uncle Zheng.

363
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
Uncle Zheng.

364
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
I'll get the lamb leg.

365
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Give me that.

366
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Thank you.

367
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
Thank you.

368
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
I'll buy some food with you.

369
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Where?

370
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
In the kitchen.

371
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
Come on.

372
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
This way.

373
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
This way.

374
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
This way.

375
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
Okay.

376
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
Here.

377
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Uncle Zheng.

378
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
Have some barbecue.

379
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Thank you.

380
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
You two are here.

381
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
It's so hot.

382
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Try it.

383
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
It's not hot.

384
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
It's not hot.

385
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Sit down.

386
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
Sit down.

387
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
It's so hot.

388
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
How is it?

389
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
It's good.

390
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
It's good.

391
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Uncle Zheng.

392
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
Here you are.

393
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
Give me some of it.

394
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Okay.

395
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Uncle Zheng.

396
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
What?

397
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Have some more barbecue.

398
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
Uncle Zheng.

399
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Give me some more of the food.

400
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Don't let him touch anything else.

401
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
It's almost done.

402
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Is it good?

403
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
It's more delicious.

404
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
I'm so full.

405
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Where is the 13?

406
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I'm getting some water.

407
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
It's so good.

408
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I'm not so hungry.

409
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
I'm so full.

410
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
I'm full.

411
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
I'm full.

412
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
I'm so full.

413
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
I'm full.

414
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
I'm full.

415
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
What's wrong with Uncle Zheng?

416
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
I'm so hungry.

417
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
I'm so hungry.

418
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
I'm so hungry.

419
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
I'm so hungry.

420
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
I'm so hungry.

421
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
You want to go upstairs?

422
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
I'll help you.

423
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Uncle Zheng.

424
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Thank you.

425
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Actually, it's all my fault.

426
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
I was careless.

427
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
I was so careless.

428
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
It's okay.

429
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Just call me.

430
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Okay.

431
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Just call me.

432
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
I don't want to see you.

433
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
You're so mean.

434
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
You're so mean.

435
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
You're so mean.

436
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
We're sick.

437
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
We're sick.

438
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
You need some help.

439
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,360
We're eating.

440
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
Yiding.

441
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
You'll have the barbecue today.

442
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
Give it to me.

443
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Help me.

444
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
If it's too soft,

445
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
eat more.

446
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Help me.

447
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
What are you thinking about?

448
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
You haven't slept yet?

449
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
I was watching you upstairs.

450
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
I'm so hungry.

451
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
I feel so uncomfortable.

452
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
No.

453
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
I was thinking about Pining's schedule.

454
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
I was thinking about Pining's schedule.

455
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
You're so mean.

456
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
I'm so tired.

457
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
I'm so tired.

458
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
I'm so tired.

459
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
I was thinking about Pining's schedule.

460
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
I just sent a message to the public.

461
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
I asked about the progress of the situation.

462
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
He didn't reply me.

463
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
It's so strange.

464
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
I guess

465
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
he's also very confused.

466
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
No way.

467
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
The master is here.

468
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
I trust him anyway.

469
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Thank you.

470
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Thank you.

471
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm sorry.

472
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Come here.

473
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
Come here.

474
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Do you remember me?

475
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Did you tell me that you were saving my life?

476
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Okay.

477
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
I'll talk to you.

478
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
I'll talk to you later.

479
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
I'm sorry.

480
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,360
I'm sorry.

481
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm sorry.

482
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
I'm sorry.

483
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Okay.

484
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
I'll talk to you later.

485
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
I'll tell you two things.

486
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
First,

487
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,360
are you Luo Ren's sister?

488
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,360
Second,

489
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
are you Luo Ping Ting's sister?

490
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,360
Yes.

491
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Save me.

492
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Let me out.

493
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,360
I still have to call the police.

494
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Tell me about your situation.

495
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
I'll tell the police.

496
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Or I'll save you.

497
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
You can't run away from here.

498
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,360
They'll catch you.

499
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Right?

500
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm not Luo Ren's sister.

501
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
What?

502
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
Okay.

503
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Tell me now.

504
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
I'll get you some water.

505
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
I'm sorry.

507
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,360
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I'm sorry.

509
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Ping Ting.

510
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
Ping Ting.

511
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Ping Ting.

512
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Ping Ting.

513
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Ping Ting.

514
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Xiaohuotai.

515
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
You sent this picture.

516
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
It's too important.

517
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
I thought about it.

518
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
The picture on the human skin.

519
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Maybe it's not a bullet.

520
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
It's a kind of

521
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
ancient word.

522
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,360
An ancient knife.

523
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Knife?

524
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,360
Every human on the planet

525
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
has a knife.

526
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Is it a murder method?

527
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Let's see.

528
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
There's a problem.

529
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,360
Every time a bullet appears,

530
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
Ping Ting will be released.

531
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
No wonder Ping Ting

532
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
wants to escape.

533
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Luo Ren.

534
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
Don't let me go to kill people.

535
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
Lock me up.

536
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Like my uncle,

537
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
I'll kill people.

538
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Let's

539
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
keep watch on him.

540
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Don't let him get out.

541
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,360
He's been like this for a lifetime.

542
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
I think it's useless to use his hand.

543
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Why?

544
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Did you find it?

545
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
Ping Ting.

546
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
He escaped.

547
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
He jumped off the building.

548
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
He jumped so high.

549
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
He jumped down.

550
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,360
If he fell, he would die.

551
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
Why did he jump so hard?

552
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Think about it.

553
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Is there

554
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
a little possibility?

555
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
He...

556
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,360
What's the possibility?

557
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
I'm just

558
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
guessing.

559
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
Can you see that?

560
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
The dragon's skin.

561
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
There's

562
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
no one

563
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
special in these three people.

564
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
That is,

565
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
before a dead person

566
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,360
would run to another person.

567
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
If

568
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
Ping Ting is kept by you,

569
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,360
he would think

570
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
he's useless.

571
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
So,

572
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
he decided to give up.

573
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,360
Then,

574
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
he would hide his secret.

575
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
What?

576
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
There's a possibility.

577
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
If someone dies,

578
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
he'll be able to leave.

579
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,360
What if he dies?

580
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
If he dies,

581
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
he'll be able to stop breathing.

582
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
You can show me if he dies.

583
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
This is not the way to do it.

584
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
After the new management,

585
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
he'll find a new owner.

586
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
He'll hurt the innocent.

587
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,360
We can't

588
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
save Ping Ting

589
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
and hurt others.

590
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Xiao Guodan,

591
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
you're right.

592
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
I'll keep on researching.

593
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,360
If you have any news,

594
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
I'll call you right away.

595
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
I'll be back.

596
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Wait.

597
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
I'll be back.

598
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Ping Ting.

599
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
You scared me.

600
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,360
You...

601
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
Don't be angry.

602
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
It's a good thing that you're here.

603
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
We've already

604
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,360
touched some of your head.

605
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Mu De,

606
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
you...

607
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
got hurt?

608
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
You said this...

609
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
What's wrong with Ping Ting?

610
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
She'll be fine.

611
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,360
Thank you.

612
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
By the way,

613
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,360
I'll keep an eye on

614
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,360
the two rooms

615
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
near the hotel.

616
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,360
Later,

617
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
you can talk to them

618
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
in the grassland.

619
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Once the three of us are in trouble,

620
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
you can go to the hotel.

621
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
I'll be back.

622
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,360
I'll be back.

623
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
Once the three of us are in trouble,

624
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,360
you can go to the hotel.

625
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,360
I don't need to be in trouble.

626
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
Where are you going?

627
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
I'll be back

628
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
to repair the windows and fire.

629
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,360
It's noisy.

630
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
And you're not sleeping either, right?

631
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,360
And,

632
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
don't blame the three of us.

633
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
I'll let them go out

634
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
to stay safe.

635
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Ping Ting really hit me.

636
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
I'm so shocked.

637
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
She hit me?

638
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
I'm so shocked.

639
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
You're just a fool.

640
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
You're even

641
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,360
a ten-year-old society.

642
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Pay attention.

643
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,360
You're going to lose your social status.

644
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
You're going to lose your social status.

645
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
The old man came here

646
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
to eat, sleep,

647
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
and even made a fuss.

648
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
You're really a good boy.

649
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
You're too young.

650
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
We're just

651
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
a bunch of people.

652
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
As the first law-abiding citizen,

653
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
we should see

654
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
the young lady being imprisoned.

655
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
We should

656
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
get out of the prison.

657
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
You mean

658
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
we should give you a few days, right?

659
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,360
What are you laughing at?

660
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Where are you going?

661
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
I'm not kidding.

662
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,360
You're a man, too.

663
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
If Ping Ting

664
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,360
has been locked up by you,

665
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Xin Jin will think

666
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
she's useless.

667
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
So

668
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
she's going to give up.

669
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
Then

670
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
she'll commit suicide?

671
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
What about Jia Si?

672
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Jia Si

673
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,360
is going to stop breathing.

674
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,360
You should show me Jia Si.

675
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
After Xin Jin leaves the country,

676
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
she'll find a new owner.

677
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
She'll hurt the innocent.

678
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
We can't

679
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,360
save Ping Ting and hurt others.

680
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Dr. Wei,

681
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
you should come here tomorrow.

682
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
If there's no problem,

683
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,360
I need you to bring

684
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
her emergency equipment.

685
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Where are we going?

686
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Ping Ting is sleeping.

687
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,360
We'll take you out for a walk.

688
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
We'll see if we can solve the problem.

689
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
When things are all over,

690
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,360
we'll see if we can get out of here.

691
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
Just stay with me.

692
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,360
It's so quiet at night.

693
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Yes.

694
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
I really like driving.

695
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,360
When the traffic is bad,

696
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,360
I can calm down

697
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
and think about the problem.

698
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
It's scary.

699
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
No.

700
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Is the car wrong?

701
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
Is it a little too fast?

702
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,360
If this is

703
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
your last ride,

704
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
what will you do?

705
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
What do you mean?

706
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Don't you think

707
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
Xin Jin's off?

708
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
Come on, get in the car.

709
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,360
I'm so scared.

710
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,360
How is it?

711
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,360
This is the classic project of the local.

712
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,360
It's a life-and-death experience.

713
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
I was a little unprepared just now.

714
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
One more time.

715
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
Just one more time.

716
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,360
I'm sorry if you're feeling down.

717
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,360
How is it?

718
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,360
How does it feel to be with him?

719
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Of course, it's alive.

720
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
I'm not sure.

721
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
I'm not sure.

722
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
I'm not sure.

723
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Of course, it's alive.

724
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
I have to cherish my life.

725
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,360
I have to live well.

726
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,360
I'm 140 years old.

727
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
You can do it.

728
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
I'm so proud of myself.

729
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,360
I've never seen so many stars.

730
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
It seems that

731
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,360
I can catch a star with my hand.

732
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Stars are far away from us.

733
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I've seen the light reach the earth.

734
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
I have to pull it out for many years.

735
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Actually, what we see now

736
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,360
is what it was sent out many years ago.

737
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
For example, that moment.

738
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,360
It might be dead now.

739
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
According to your diary,

740
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,360
the stars on the sky seem to be the same as the sea.

741
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
All the stars are the fire.

742
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Did you come here often to watch the stars?

743
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
I've been here with Ping Ting.

744
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
I've never been with Ping Ting.

745
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,360
I went to her house because of my dad.

746
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
She had two wives.

747
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Two wives?

748
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
My mom got married to a bad husband.

749
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
She suffered with him.

750
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
She was born with him.

751
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,360
She finally got rich.

752
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,360
She had a good husband.

753
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
She finally got rich.

754
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
She thought

755
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,360
she should pursue what she really wanted.

756
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,360
For example, love.

757
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,360
I think that's an excuse.

758
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Later,

759
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,360
she finally got married.

760
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
She didn't get married.

761
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
But she got married at a wedding.

762
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
She was more crazy than my mom.

763
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,360
She was married to a bad husband.

764
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,360
Until that woman got a boy,

765
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
things were different.

766
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,360
Two things happened that year.

767
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,360
One was that I almost got hit by a car.

768
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,360
The other was poisoned.

769
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,360
She went to the hospital for a bath.

770
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Did that woman do it?

771
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
She was a good girl.

772
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
The TV series said that

773
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
she was trying to get money

774
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,360
and she was fighting.

775
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
I think so too.

776
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Where are you going?

777
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,360
So, I sent me to the uncle's house.

778
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,360
Ping Ting was 45 years old at that time.

779
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
He had two hairpins on his head.

780
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
He had a big wooden knife in his arms.

781
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
He told me that

782
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,360
Brother Xiao Dao

783
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,360
said that

784
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
someone was bullying you.

785
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
Don't be afraid.

786
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,360
If he was bullying you again,

787
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
I'll cut him for you.

788
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,360
Luo Erming is my uncle.

789
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,360
But I think

790
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,360
he is more like my father.

791
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
After the uncle left,

792
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Ping Ting was my most important relative.

793
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
Family?

794
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
I told my uncle

795
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,360
not to kill himself.

796
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,360
I didn't do it.

797
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I told Ping Ting that

798
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
my uncle was my best friend.

799
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
I told him not to be afraid.

800
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
I was afraid that

801
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Ping Ting would be mad at me.

802
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,360
I told him that

803
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,360
I would let him go.

804
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,360
I did everything that I could.

805
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
So this time,

806
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
I don't want Ping Ting to be hurt again.

807
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Mu Dai,

808
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,360
thank you for yesterday.

809
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,360
I'm glad to meet you.

810
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
I don't know who it is.

811
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
When I first met him,

812
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,360
I put my knife on his neck.

813
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
I was not happy at all.

814
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Do you still remember?

815
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
I remember.

816
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
Here you are.

817
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
For me?

818
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
In the future,

819
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,360
you can take out the knife

820
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
and put it on your neck.

821
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Remember that.

822
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
I always think of my bad.

823
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,360
What's good about

824
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,360
asking Luo Ren?

825
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
I'm here to see Uncle Zheng.

826
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Mu Dai,

827
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,360
yesterday,

828
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Luo Ren was with you.

829
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Is there anything strange?

830
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Or did you say

831
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
something strange?

832
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
What do you mean?

833
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
You're leaving already?

834
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Listen,

835
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
this tofu

836
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,360
is not for you.

837
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,360
We need to

838
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,360
change the shop.

839
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
Do you want to be a teacher?

840
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
This is a way to get rid of the bad.

841
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Follow me.

842
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
Xiaolai,

843
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
I know they have a secret.

844
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Let me do it.

845
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
Come on.

846
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
Open the door, Your Majesty.

847
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
Let me do it.

848
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Your Majesty,

849
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
I'm here to see you.

850
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
I'm here to see you.

851
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
Let me do it.

852
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
Your Majesty,

853
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Your Majesty.

854
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
Hurry up.

855
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
The password is already changed.

856
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
You can't open it.

857
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,360
Your Majesty.

858
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Your Majesty, open the door.

859
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
Your Majesty.

860
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Open the door.

861
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
What should we do?

862
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,360
What should we do?

863
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
Don't move.

864
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Don't move.

865
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
You're dead.

866
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Your Majesty.

867
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
The two gold coins are not outside.

868
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,360
The stone is on the street.

869
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
I'll give you a hand.

870
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,360
I'll show you the black one.

871
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,360
The man in the door

872
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,360
and the man in the room.

873
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Look at the mirror.

874
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
How is it?

875
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
Your Majesty.

876
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
What's wrong?

877
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

878
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Your Majesty, don't touch me.

879
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
What are you doing?

880
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Your Majesty.

881
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
Your Majesty.

882
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Your Majesty.

883
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,360
Stop it.

884
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
Uncle Zhang,

885
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
is the doctor ready?

886
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
He's right next door.

887
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,360
He's right next door.

888
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
Doctor.

889
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
Come.

890
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,360
I'm sorry.

891
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,360
I'm sorry.

892
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,360
I'm sorry.

893
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
I'm sorry.

894
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,360
I'm sorry.
