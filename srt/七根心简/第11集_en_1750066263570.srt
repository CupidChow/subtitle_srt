1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
and I'm all for it.

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The End

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 1

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Zha Ma, you are like a train with a fire.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You are so handsome.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is there a village in front of you?

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But didn't you say there is no one in the village?

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's been moving to the town a few years ago.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But the old people in the mountain are still used to old places.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
My mom is the one who lives in the mountain.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
She lives in the water of nature.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I will come here every two weeks to give you some food.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So I can stay with my mom for a few days.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We are lucky.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We just met you in the village.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And you are in a car.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But what are you doing here?

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You have relatives here, right?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
By the way, we just met an old man.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He is so scary.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He said he is an wild man.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That is the village next door.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We met an old man in the mountain.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He was scared.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You have an old man here?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What kind of old man?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I am a legend.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
After the accident,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the government sent the work group to investigate.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There is no old man in the investigation.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If there is an old man,

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
we will be in trouble.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But you have to be careful.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You can only go by car.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You will be here soon.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't go.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You don't have a signal.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I have something urgent.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I want to contact my friend.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go out.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can call the place where you can drive.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You can leave the car tomorrow morning.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will give you the horse.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can contact me.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The horse just came.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I am tired.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I want to rest.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You want to rest.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will come to the city.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will come to the city.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will come to the city.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I will come to the city.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will come to the city.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You want to rest.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You want to rest.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will pay the rent.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How much do you pay?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
100 yuan.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I will pay 200 yuan.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I will contact you.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I will go.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I will give you the horse.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I will come to the city.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I will come to the city.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will come to the city.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I will give you the horse.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can call the police.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Is it still closed?

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The woman's phone is not working.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I think

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
they are the signal security in the mountains.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will call the police.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Put it away.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Luo Zhen, let's go faster.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I saw a shadow in the car today.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It looks like the sky.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Did you see the illusion again?

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I saw it again.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Then don't mind him.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Anyway, Ping Ting is fine now.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Who wants to take advantage of the illusion?

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sister-in-law.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You want to go to Yuliang Mountain?

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Did I ask you?

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This season is rainy.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's hard to walk.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And you are an old man.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You are carrying these two girls.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Besides, there is a rumor.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There is a snow mountain.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What?

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Didn't you say there is no snow mountain?

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But everyone has never seen it.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The legend of the snow mountain has always existed.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The villagers near us are all from the mountain.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Very few people come to the mountain.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So I guess

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
even if there is no snow mountain,

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
there will be a snow mountain.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't worry.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The shop has been there.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No snow mountain, no snow mountain.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's all rumors.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We are not afraid of rumors.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hongsha.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Come back to your room.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No, no, no.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm getting old.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I can't sleep at night.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm going back.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Get out.

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mom, let me drink.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I love you.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I love you.

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What I mean is

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
if it's not enough,

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll go home.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Enough.

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I love you.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What do you think?

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm very good.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
She has become very smart.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
She lives in the hospital.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
In the hospital?

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
In ancient times,

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the men and women in the mountain

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
would find the Tao Gu to see if they were alive.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
My mother's ancestors

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
were born in the house.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They were very powerful.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So you people

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
may not believe

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
our traditional customs.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So,

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
do you think it's appropriate

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
for the two of you

142
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
to see it or

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll do it alone?

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's okay if it's alone.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But do you have

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
some things

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
she gave you?

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You can see it if you have.

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I love you.

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Xuan Hong.

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I love you so much.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I love you so much.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:59,100
Have you seen the

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,040
video?

155
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:12,280
I haven't seen it,Sis.

156
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
You must be careful.

157
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Otherwise, you will get lost.

158
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Okay.

159
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Also, there is a waste site on the way.

160
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
You can stay there.

161
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,280
We can't catch the hunters.

162
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
I know.

163
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
You know, my mom said that this site

164
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
was cleared 20 years ago.

165
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Can you hear me?

166
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
I can hear you.

167
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Mom, this is what my mom prepared for you.

168
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
It's raining and it's raining.

169
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
My mom is more independent.

170
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Don't be afraid.

171
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Thank you.

172
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Here, grandpa.

173
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
I'll leave soon.

174
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
I'll be there soon.

175
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
I'll contact my friends.

176
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Keep it with me.

177
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Thank you.

178
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Don't put it on your heart.

179
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,280
My mom is right.

180
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,280
My mom just said that she didn't see through it.

181
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,280
She said that there was another you.

182
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
But the one that stayed at the end

183
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,280
is different from the one you are now.

184
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
What's so accurate?

185
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Don't be too close.

186
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Let's go.

187
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Be safe.

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Goodbye, mom.

189
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
I came here to pick you up.

190
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I don't know where your mother is.

191
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm so glad to see you.

192
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
I'll be back.

193
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Bye.

194
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Bye.

195
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Bye.

196
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
I don't know where my mom is.

197
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm so glad to see you.

198
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
See you.

199
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
See you.

200
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
See you.

201
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
I don't know where my mom is.

202
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
See you.

203
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
See you.

204
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Bye.

205
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Bye.

206
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Bye.

207
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
See you.

208
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
We're here.

209
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
There's a village ahead.

210
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
Come on.

211
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
What's wrong?

212
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Nothing. Let's go.

213
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
What's that?

214
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
It's called the Blue Sky.

215
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,280
It's used to pray to the heavens.

216
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
It's the custom of the past.

217
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
Almost every family has it.

218
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Why does the Blue Sky sound so familiar?

219
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Sister Xin.

220
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
The Blue Sky

221
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
The Blue Sky

222
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
The mountains, villages,

223
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,280
the rain, the sky, the rain,

224
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
the whole team.

225
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
We don't know that we're so unlucky.

226
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
We need to make up for it.

227
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Let's eat first.

228
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Let's eat?

229
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
No matter what we make up for it,

230
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
we'll have to fill our stomachs first.

231
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
That way, we can handle it.

232
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
You're right.

233
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,280
Grandpa, let's eat first.

234
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
I thought it was 50,000 yuan.

235
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
I'm afraid.

236
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
It's a lot of sweat.

237
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,280
I don't know if I can get the water.

238
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,280
I just called you.

239
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
You said you'd come.

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
I was so nervous.

241
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
I thought you'd come to make up for it.

242
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
So, they're doing fine.

243
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
What did you guys encounter

244
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
besides that old man?

245
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
You.

246
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
I've told you many times.

247
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Don't worry. It's okay.

248
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Let's eat.

249
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
But we still have a day left.

250
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
You guys should leave early tomorrow.

251
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
They're all women.

252
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
You're full of strength.

253
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
You'll be in a hurry.

254
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,280
But don't let them get away.

255
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
It's dangerous.

256
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
They'll get lost.

257
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Mom, do you want to drink?

258
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
By the way,

259
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
you don't know him, do you?

260
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,280
When our uncle Zuo Nan found out,

261
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
he said his clothes were torn.

262
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
He even shouted,

263
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
do you know him?

264
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Do you know him?

265
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
He was crazy.

266
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Nonsense.

267
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,280
He's got a lot of people.

268
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
But he's very kind.

269
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Look,

270
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
you'll believe it.

271
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,280
People are more and more attractive.

272
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
What are you laughing at?

273
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Your eyes are like a thread.

274
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Tell me.

275
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Tell me clearly.

276
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
You might not be able to tell.

277
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
You'll have to fall into this mountain.

278
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Uncle Zuo Nan,

279
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
think about it.

280
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Your kung fu is so good.

281
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
I can't help but to take a look.

282
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
He's a man of the art.

283
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
What should I do?

284
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Yes.

285
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,280
I'm telling you.

286
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
I'm a man of the art.

287
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
He doesn't like it.

288
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
He just loves you.

289
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
You're laughing too.

290
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
I'm so angry.

291
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
I'll do it.

292
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
What's this?

293
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
A gold-plated cloth.

294
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
You've got it.

295
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Why don't you take it and take a look?

296
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Maybe you'll find something.

297
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
You're so bold now.

298
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Where should I go?

299
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
Just over there.

300
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
I'm afraid I'll get angry.

301
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Me too.

302
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,280
I've got the old man's strength.

303
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
You can pick it up.

304
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
It's easy to do.

305
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Mudan.

306
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Yes.

307
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm your boss.

308
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
You're my employee.

309
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
You've seen the boss.

310
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
He's sitting here.

311
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Mudan.

312
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Excuse me.

313
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Just a word.

314
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,280
Let's go and go.

315
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
Please.

316
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Quiet.

317
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
Please.

318
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Please.

319
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I'm your boss.

320
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
How come?

321
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I wish you well.

322
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
This maid Fukuma...

323
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm not.

324
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,280
You're just making up these little kids.

325
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Mu Dai,

326
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I'll go to your place alone first.

327
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,280
I have some business with Hong Shan.

328
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Hong San, come.

329
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Wait for me.

330
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
Look, look at what?

331
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,280
I don't know if my teacher is so generous.

332
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
But my friend,

333
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
if you let him,

334
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
how will I get along with him?

335
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,280
What do you know?

336
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,280
This newspaper

337
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
is also the last time

338
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
grandpa has ever made a dish.

339
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Uncle died.

340
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Grandpa

341
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
doesn't know how long he can live.

342
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Grandpa,

343
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
don't say that.

344
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
I'm so worried.

345
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
I'm so worried.

346
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,280
I'm just making this dish.

347
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
It's not for you.

348
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I've said it all.

349
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I'm a good cook.

350
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
I'm a good cook.

351
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
I want to make this dish

352
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
more delicious.

353
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
This newspaper

354
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
was made

355
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
by grandpa.

356
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
It's easy to understand.

357
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
It's just to save the life.

358
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
The report

359
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,280
is not enough for me.

360
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
We're looking for the best

361
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
and the least.

362
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
We've found the police.

363
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
When we hide it,

364
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
we're afraid that others will find it.

365
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,280
It will be a lonely punishment.

366
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
We use human blood

367
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
to suppress the treasure.

368
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
This way,

369
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,280
we can find the truth.

370
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
The End

371
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
It's sunny.

372
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
It's so sunny.

373
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Let's go.

374
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
Muzi,

375
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
what are you looking for?

376
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Let's go.

377
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Hurry up.

378
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
Let's go.

379
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
That's the Blue Sky Pond.

380
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
When is it?

381
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,280
You're still playing with that little boy?

382
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Let's go.

383
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Let's go.

384
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Let's go.

385
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
Let's go.

386
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Why isn't the Blue Sky Pond here?

387
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
What's wrong?

388
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
Is it weird?

389
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,280
We took it back yesterday.

390
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
No one touched it.

391
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
We were the only ones in the room.

392
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
Why didn't it disappear?

393
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
It was...

394
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
What's wrong, Grandpa?

395
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
The Blue Sky Pond

396
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Why didn't it disappear?

397
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
It was here.

398
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Here?

399
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I don't think

400
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
the atmosphere here

401
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
is good for us.

402
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
I don't think so.

403
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
It's a bit too much.

404
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,280
Let's go.

405
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Let's go.

406
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Let's go.

407
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Let's go.

408
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Let's go.

409
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Let's go.

410
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Let's go.

411
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Let's go.

412
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
Let's go.

413
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Let's go.

414
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
Let's go.

415
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
The atmosphere here

416
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
is different from other places.

417
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
What atmosphere?

418
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
What can you see in Grandpa's eyes?

419
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
I don't know

420
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
what I can see.

421
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
But my uncle told me

422
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
that the range of the radio waves

423
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,280
is very wide.

424
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
People can see

425
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,280
the range of 400 to 700.

426
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
The range they can't see

427
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
is not nothing.

428
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,280
It's just that we can't see it.

429
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
It's just that we can't see it.

430
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
It's just that we can't see it.

431
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
It's just that we can't see it.

432
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
It's just that we can't see it.

433
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
It's just that we can't see it.

434
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
It's just that we can't see it.

435
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
It's just that we can't see it.

436
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
It's just that we can't see it.

437
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
It's just that we can't see it.

438
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
It's just that we can't see it.

439
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,280
It's just that we can't see it.

440
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
It's just that we can't see it.

441
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
It's just that we can't see it.

442
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
It's just that we can't see it.

443
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
It's just that we can't see it.

444
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
It's just that we can't see it.

445
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
It's just that we can't see it.

446
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
It's just that we can't see it.

447
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:16,280
It's just that the rock inside the pit.

448
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:24,280
I don't need to rush.

449
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Don't move.

450
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,280
This matter is for our Yan family.

451
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It's not convenient for outsiders to participate.

452
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
You have a good job.

453
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Go upstairs and let go.

454
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
In the past, when we were in the treasure,

455
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,280
there would be people who wanted to get married.

456
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Let's go to the house.

457
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,280
Wusha.

458
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,280
Wusha.

459
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Come here.

460
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Wusha.

461
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
Wusha.

462
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
Come here.

463
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Come here.

464
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Someone's blood is coming out of the treasure.

465
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
Hurry up. Take it.

466
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
Take it.

467
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Take it.

468
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Take it.

469
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
Hurry up.

470
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Be gentle.

471
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,280
The tree is small and it has a water.

472
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
The yellow tree.

473
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,280
What's so good about it?

474
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Wusha.

475
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Grandpa, I won't dig anymore.

476
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
I really don't dare to dig anymore.

477
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
Dig? Keep digging?

478
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
I don't want to.

479
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
If I can dig, I'll have you dig.

480
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
Dig!

481
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,280
I won't dig anymore.

482
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
I really won't dig anymore.

483
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
Wusha.

484
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,280
What?

485
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Are you tired?

486
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
How about this?

487
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Let me help you.

488
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
No, don't dig.

489
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
Why?

490
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Don't dig.

491
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Why?

492
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
There's a dead person down there.

493
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Wusha.

494
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
This...

495
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Why is there a dead person down there?

496
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,280
What's going on?

497
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,280
You've been protecting us all along.

498
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
You're our own people.

499
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
I'm telling you, don't worry.

500
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,280
What you said was my own greed.

501
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,280
We set up a team of search teams.

502
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Among the doctors,

503
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
I can only see the treasure.

504
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
We turned a few mountains.

505
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
I was here.

506
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,280
I was found out by this.

507
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,280
This is so nice.

508
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
The treasure is as round as a red.

509
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
And...

510
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
there's a corpse inside.

511
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
According to the legend,

512
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,280
the corpse's blood can suppress the treasure,

513
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
but it can't.

514
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,280
It can't be seen as a treasure.

515
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
There's a hole.

516
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Maybe it's been too long.

517
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
The corpse became a corpse.

518
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
The blood was gone.

519
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
It couldn't suppress the treasure.

520
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,280
I was so worried at that time.

521
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,280
I told them that the body was broken.

522
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
They didn't have any idea.

523
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Anyway, it's a treasure.

524
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,280
It's worth it.

525
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
If we had left at that time,

526
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
we wouldn't have been able to handle it.

527
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
It's okay.

528
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
But I'm afraid that if

529
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,280
other masters pass by here,

530
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
they will definitely see it.

531
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,280
But I have to hide this.

532
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
I have to find a way.

533
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
It's just that

534
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,280
someone in the tomb is not convinced.

535
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
He's been killed by a few soldiers.

536
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,280
I'll bury him in here.

537
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Because the dead body's blood

538
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
can cover the treasure.

539
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,280
It's all the evil that the old man left behind.

540
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,280
Evil.

541
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Only the stupid people would believe it.

542
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,280
Shut up.

543
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
I'm not.

544
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
I did it for who?

545
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,280
It's all for your little things.

546
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,280
You little things are not angry at all.

547
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,280
I'm still in love with you.

548
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Maybe...

549
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
Maybe it's because I'm getting older.

550
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,280
I regret the past.

551
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,280
So this time,

552
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,280
besides giving me some hard time,

553
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,280
I also want to give this good friend

554
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
a chance to

555
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,280
make a good friend.

556
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,280
I'm not sure if I can make it.

557
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,280
I also want to give this good friend

558
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,280
a chance to make him feel safe.

559
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
After I get the treasure,

560
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,280
I'll give it to his family to share with you.

561
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
You're right.

562
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,280
But I'm also afraid of things like dead bodies.

563
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,280
You decide for yourself.

564
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
My master often says

565
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
that if you meet someone in a place,

566
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
you should do something.

567
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
It's all a kind of fate.

568
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Since we're in a relationship,

569
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
we should make it a good friend.

570
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,280
It's a good thing.

571
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Zhuo An.

572
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Someone's here.

573
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Someone's nearby.

574
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
How many people?

575
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
I see.

576
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
He's hiding behind the tree.

577
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
I can't see him.

578
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
How many people?

579
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
I didn't see anyone.

580
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,280
He ran away.

581
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
You can't catch him.

582
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
The treasure must be here to take care of him.

583
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
Don't be so loud.

584
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
If you're so loud,

585
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
you'll get something to eat.

586
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,280
It's a good thing to have a good time.

587
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
It's a good thing.

588
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,280
It's a good thing to have a good time.

589
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Come and see.

590
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
I found it.

591
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
The mark we saw before is very different.

592
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,280
The mark we need to check is the height of the habit.

593
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
The height of the wooden belt

594
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
can't be measured at such a high position.

595
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
And you're so strict.

596
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,280
You and I can do this.

597
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
The mountain is not right.

598
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Other than the wooden belt,

599
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
there should be others.

600
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Let's go.

601
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Let's make the mark.

602
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Be careful.

603
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
I'll give it to you.

604
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
I'll leave the back seat to you.

605
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
The treasure is here.

606
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
Mu Da.

607
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,280
The hole is down there.

608
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Bring the rope.

609
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Come on.

610
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Put the red belt inside.

611
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Two.

612
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Be careful.

613
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
I'll count to three.

614
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
You two, together.

615
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
One.

616
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
Three.

617
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,280
Three.

618
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Four.

619
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
It's the ancient sword.

620
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
The sword is not strong enough.

621
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Brother Shen.

622
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
I want to see you.

623
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,280
No, you...

624
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
What's that?

625
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,280
What's that?

626
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
What?

627
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
Mu Da.

628
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
You see?

629
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
That long hair.

630
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
It must be two meters.

631
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
That's the eye-catching Mu Da.

632
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,280
It should be.

633
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
The body is so big.

634
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
It will be stolen.

635
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
It can't be done by a night.

636
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
Are we safe here?

637
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
Hurry up.

638
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Wait a minute.

639
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Don't be chased by him.

640
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,280
No.

641
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
I'll go with you.

642
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Wait a minute.

643
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
Don't be chased by him.

644
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
It's impossible not to be in the body.

645
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
How could it be missing?

646
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
When did it happen?

647
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
It's still in the body.

648
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Grandpa.

649
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
We met an eye-catching person.

650
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,280
Grandpa.

651
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Could it be that

652
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,280
someone found the body

653
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
and then took care of it?

654
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
It's impossible.

655
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
That body

656
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
was so well hidden.

657
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,280
I couldn't find it.

658
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Besides,

659
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
even if someone took the body away,

660
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,280
why did they

661
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
restore the body?

662
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Who knows?

663
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
Your friend died of illness.

664
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Maybe

665
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
he didn't die.

666
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
He fell out of the body.

667
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
It's impossible.

668
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
A man with a knife

669
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
is a total thief.

670
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
How could he

671
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,280
get out of the body?

672
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Grandpa.

673
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Didn't you say

674
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
he died of illness?

675
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Where are you going?

676
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
To the convenience store.

677
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
I'll go with you.

678
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
You're not safe.

679
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
No need.

680
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
You're with me.

681
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
How could I be in the convenience store?

682
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I'm not in the convenience store.

683
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
I'm not in the convenience store.

684
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
I'm not in the convenience store.

685
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
Don't worry.

686
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
You two stay here.

687
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Mu Da.

688
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
My grandpa is a murderer.

689
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
Right?

690
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
He's a murderer.

691
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Maybe it's not what we thought.

692
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
I'm not a murderer.

693
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
He killed someone.

694
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
He killed

695
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
someone else.

696
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
It's raining outside.

697
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Hongshan.

698
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Your grandpa is outside.

699
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
Let's go and have a look.

700
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
What's so good about him?

701
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
He's fine.

702
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
He's not afraid of anyone else.

703
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,280
Is this light not bad?

704
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Grandpa.

705
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Grandpa.

706
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
What's wrong?

707
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
What was that sound?

708
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,280
Grandpa, come in.

709
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,280
Grandpa.

710
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Go.

711
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
Hongshan.

712
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Hongshan.

713
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
Grandpa.

714
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
Grandpa.

715
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,280
Are you all right?

716
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Go.

717
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Go.

718
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Go.

719
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Go.

720
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
Go.

721
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
Go.

722
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,280
Go.

723
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
Go.

724
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
Go.

725
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Go.

726
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Go.

727
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Go.

728
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Go.

729
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Go.

730
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
Go.

731
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
Go.

732
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Are you all right?

733
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Are you all right?

734
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
This is a real thing.

735
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,280
I added an egg to my little sister's meat.

736
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
It's nutritious and has a lot of bones.

737
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
You should eat this egg from the mackerel.

738
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,280
You should eat it and get down.

739
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,280
Go.

740
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Maybe there's a bacteria in your body.

741
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,280
I'll take it for you later.

742
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
Here.

743
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
You brought the stuff.

744
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
What else?

745
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,280
You didn't even get to see the wild animals in the mountains.

746
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
You must have thought about getting hurt.

747
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,280
You must have been in danger.

748
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
I've seen your luggage.

749
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
No medicine.

750
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
No weapons.

751
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,280
There's a lot to eat.

752
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
What are you doing here?

753
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
Are you all married?

754
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Let's talk about it.

755
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I'll go and see if the noodles are ready.

756
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
Meng Sha.

757
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Yes.

758
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
I'll call you back later.

759
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Come.

760
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Come.

761
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
I'm so tired.

762
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
I've never seen a wild animal like this.

763
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Did he want to kill me?

764
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
No.

765
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
Did he want to kill me?

766
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
I'll give you an egg.

767
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Don't be angry with me.

768
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
It's not his fault.

769
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,280
Does it hurt?

770
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,280
Let me see.

771
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,280
What's wrong?

772
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,280
Look down.

773
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,280
The wild animal dragged my hair and pulled me down.

774
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Did it drag my hair?

775
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Let me see.

776
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
It's quite dirty.

777
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
What's wrong?

778
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,280
I'm afraid you'll get better if you drag your hair down.

779
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,280
You have to put on a big piece of hair.

780
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Put on?

781
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
I'll put it on.

782
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
It's okay.

783
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Smart head doesn't grow hair.

784
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
If you put on it, it means you're smarter.

785
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,280
You can cover your hair with a hair dryer.

786
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
You can't wear a hat.

787
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
You can't wear a hat.

788
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I'm afraid you'll get worse if you come down.

789
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
You can't wear a hat.

790
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,280
You can't wear a hat.

791
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
You can't wear a hat.

792
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
You can't wear a hat.

793
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
You can't wear a hat.

794
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,280
When did you cry?

795
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
I was so happy when I saw you.

796
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
I didn't cry.

797
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I didn't cry.

798
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,280
Why did you try to drag your hair down?

799
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
