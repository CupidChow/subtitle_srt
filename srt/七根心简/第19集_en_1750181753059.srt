00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,820
Die Back

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Episode 15

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When me and Wan San were chasing the Tao He Di,

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we found this house nearby.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It should be where he lives.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They're waiting outside.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They said we can call them anytime.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What do you want?

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What do you want?

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What do you want?

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Come in.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The heart was just removed.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's weak.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Just wait a few days.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Do you remember you had a daughter?

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You threw her out.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You were at the door of the house. Do you remember?

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you remember?

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You don't remember?

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You don't remember such a big thing?

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What?

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I remember it well.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I wanted to tell you

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
that Tao He Di was living a miserable life in the house.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
In peace.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do you remember?

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I remember.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You were a good daughter.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I remember.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I remember.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You were a good daughter.

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I remember.

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You were a good daughter.

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I remember.

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I remember.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I remember.

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So?

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So he's my responsibility?

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
When he left me, why didn't he say I was his responsibility?

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Mu Dai, I didn't mean that.

46
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Mu Dai.

47
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mu Dai.

48
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mu Dai was so worried that he offended you.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If you asked him if he had a daughter,

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
would you feel better?

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't expect that.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm so ridiculous, right?

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've never been concerned about anyone I want to find.

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's the use of finding someone?

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Mu Dai, don't worry. Maybe Xin Jian just left.

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's possible that she can't remember.

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been keeping something from you.

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
After I came to Nantian,

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Huo Cong kept calling me to ask about you.

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And Zhang Shu, they've been concerned about you.

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mu Dai.

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Some people may not have blood ties with you,

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
but she's been trying to be a mother for 20 years.

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I care about you.

66
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Losing a relationship is important,

67
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
but you can't keep staring at it.

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You have to believe that God loves you.

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The flowers will bloom with stars.

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Mu Dai, I know it's a pity to lose a relationship,

73
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
but you can't keep staring at it.

74
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Some people may not have blood ties with you,

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but she's been trying to be a mother for 20 years.

76
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hello, Hong Shang.

78
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hello? Hong Shang, speak.

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hong Yi.

80
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Mu Dai.

81
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's me.

82
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mu Dai, where are you?

83
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How are you? Are you okay?

84
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Are you hurt? Why did you call me?

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Speak, Mu Dai.

86
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hong Yi, are you okay?

87
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm fine.

88
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't worry about me.

89
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm fine.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The business is getting better.

91
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I just miss you.

92
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How are you?

93
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How are you doing?

94
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How's the food there?

95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Is the money enough?

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If it's not enough, tell me.

97
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm fine, too.

98
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't miss me too much.

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm relieved to hear that.

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Get up.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay.

102
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm fine.

103
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The girl who asked me if I was coming,

104
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
she's not here today?

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Is she your girlfriend?

106
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes.

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Last time she asked me

108
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
if I left my daughter in the orphanage.

109
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
She said my daughter had died long ago.

110
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Actually,

111
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
my daughter is her.

112
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

113
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's her.

114
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's talk about you first.

115
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you know what's on your mind these years?

116
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Of course, good things.

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Good things?

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She's good to me.

119
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
She helped me do a lot of things

120
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
that I couldn't do before.

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're talking nonsense.

122
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Is that a lie?

123
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What do you mean by a lie?

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Everyone lies.

125
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What?

126
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You spit in the soup.

127
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You spit in the soup.

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They all lie.

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Why don't you say they hurt people?

130
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I only came to give her.

131
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I can't force her.

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You treated us before

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
because Xinjie didn't work on us?

134
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Not entirely.

135
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That man asked me to do that.

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That man?

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's...

138
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I remember he came to tell me.

139
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What did he say?

140
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He said

141
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
you can't play this game alone.

142
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There are others waiting for you.

143
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What?

144
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Game?

145
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
There are others?

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're kidding, right?

147
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Listen.

148
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Maybe Xiang Si Lan

149
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
is lying to us.

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No.

151
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I remember he said

152
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
if he leaves,

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
the game will be more fun.

154
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's getting weird.

155
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Be careful.

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There's one more thing.

157
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll take you.

158
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Xiang Si Lan

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
guessed you were his daughter.

160
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He wants to play alone.

161
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Xiang Si Lan

162
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I heard that the woman who adopted you

163
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
is a rich woman

164
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and a boss.

165
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Look at my living condition.

166
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm not feeling well.

167
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't know

168
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
if I can live better

169
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
in the last days.

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You abandoned me.

171
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You abandoned me

172
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and let me marry you?

173
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Look at your boyfriend

174
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and your rich mother.

175
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If I hadn't abandoned you,

176
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
would you have had this chance?

177
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you for your kind heart.

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The abandoned children

179
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
are not good to their parents.

180
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I won't give you a penny.

181
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You have to give me money.

182
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why?

183
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Because you're not my biological daughter.

184
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What?

185
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll be honest

186
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
with you.

187
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I picked you up.

188
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do you remember that bridge?

189
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
One day, on the way home,

190
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I heard a child crying under the bridge.

191
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I went down and saw you lying there.

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You had a towel on you.

193
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
If I hadn't picked you up

194
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and picked you up that night,

195
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
you would have been frozen to death.

196
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're so kind.

197
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I wouldn't sell books.

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I was a single woman

199
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and I couldn't afford to buy anything.

200
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I thought I had a child

201
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and I would have to show my sympathy.

202
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You were still young.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You could feed the poor

204
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
and the poor.

205
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Really?

206
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What about when I grew up?

207
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was able to work and I was obedient.

208
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Wasn't that more reasonable for you?

209
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why didn't you want me?

210
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
When you grew up,

211
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
you ate a lot.

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You were like a dead animal.

213
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You couldn't eat anything.

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Anyway, I picked you up,

215
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
raised you,

216
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and sent you away.

217
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I sent you to a family with such good conditions.

218
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I wanted to make up for it.

219
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Do you think you should give me some money?

220
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It sounds like you can't say no.

221
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Mudan, go back to the car.

222
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Leave this to me.

223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I have something to talk to her.

224
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll be right back.

225
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Don't bother her after you get the money.

226
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll be right back.

227
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'll be right back.

228
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's go.

229
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't think you need to come back.

230
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't you need money?

231
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I've talked to her.

232
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You gave her money?

233
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Don't worry. I've settled everything.

234
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm not afraid of being satisfied.

235
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I won't suffer any loss.

236
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
She told me

237
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I wasn't her biological child.

238
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
She said I was picked up from the bridge.

239
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What do you think?

240
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you disappointed?

241
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You don't know how to be surprised

242
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
by any news?

243
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How can I not be surprised?

244
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Come learn from me.

245
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I can't.

246
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't know why.

247
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I heard her say that.

248
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I feel a little happy.

249
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It feels so easy.

250
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's easy.

251
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You want to leave your love

252
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
to someone who deserves it.

253
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Right?

254
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll give this back to you.

255
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is from my mother.

256
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
She's blessed with it.

257
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's up to you to decide whether to keep it or not.

258
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
My heart beats so softly.

259
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The wind blows like a hurricane.

260
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The stars are falling.

261
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You listen to the sound of the flute.

262
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's like a memory.

263
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The rain falls.

264
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The flowers bloom.

265
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I see the future.

266
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I believe I believe I believe I believe.

267
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I want to love you slowly.

268
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

269
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Do you know that

270
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Ma Chao is awake?

271
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He admitted that he pushed Zhang Tong.

272
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I heard from Luo Ren.

273
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Luo Ren?

274
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You two have made up?

275
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's hard to say.

276
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We'll talk about it later.

277
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
This is for you.

278
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The end is near.

279
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's a must.

280
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Come and play with me.

281
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm leaving.

282
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Sister Mu Mu.

283
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I think you're a little different

284
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
from when you came.

285
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Really?

286
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What's the difference?

287
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I can't tell you.

288
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But I like it anyway.

289
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Erhu, did you see my charger today?

290
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
No.

291
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I put my own things on my own.

292
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Where's the hat?

293
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Are you done packing?

294
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Almost.

295
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Aunt Hong said she would give Mu Dai a ride tomorrow.

296
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Then we...

297
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
If she gives Mu Dai a surprise,

298
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
don't say it out loud.

299
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
There are regrets and pain.

300
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But you are always loved.

301
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And always loved.

302
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're pretty good like this.

303
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Maybe

304
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
you don't need me anymore.

305
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Fine.

306
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't want to get along with

307
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
your friends anymore.

308
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
They're not like me anymore.

309
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Get out of here!

311
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You bitch!

312
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Go!

313
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Get out of here!

314
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Get out!

315
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Get out!

316
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Give me back my mom!

317
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Give me back my mom!

318
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Don't hit my mom!

319
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Don't hit my mom!

320
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What are you looking at?

321
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Give me back my mom!

322
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Give me back my mom!

323
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
My love, I love you.

324
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Really.

325
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Come on.

326
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Give me a kiss.

327
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No!

328
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'll give you one.

329
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let go of me!

330
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I don't want it!

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You're so ungrateful.

332
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You don't respect me at all.

333
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
No, she's still young.

334
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Okay?

335
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Let go of me.

336
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
After this,

337
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
can you go to a place with me?

338
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
What place?

339
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
A place

340
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
that doesn't have a bad uncle.

341
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Okay.

342
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You know what this money

343
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
is for?

344
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Don't ever

345
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
harass me again.

346
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Is this

347
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
good for us?

348
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Alright.

349
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Get tight.

350
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,400
Thank you.

351
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Shit.

352
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Isn't Luo

353
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
too worried

354
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
to use this as the secret room?

355
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
He has his own reason.

356
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
We should understand that too.

357
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Now, our Lu Yi Xin is...

359
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Right?

360
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's normal to upgrade the security,

361
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
so that Jin Xiao Tuo can be safe.

362
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That makes sense.

363
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I thought it would be the wooden belt.

364
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I didn't expect it to be you.

365
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So you insist that the white and black wooden belts are actually the same person, right?

366
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Indeed.

367
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
They have two sides.

368
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Maybe you're right.

369
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The wooden belt hasn't changed.

370
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's just that it's a unique way of getting along with this world.

371
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Actually, Black Wooden Belt is very cute.

372
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's always so arrogant and aggressive.

373
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's the child who lives in the old house in the south,

374
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
can't get mother's love,

375
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and is hungry.

376
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's very angry and it's always on guard against everyone.

377
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Does it hurt?

378
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It hurts both fists.

379
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It's a small mushroom, right?

380
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Uncle Kun is calling.

381
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Hello.

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Uncle Kun, where are you?

383
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm in the canyon.

384
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm going to a very important place now.

385
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I heard that Da De left a caretaker here.

386
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I have a feeling that this caretaker is an important clue.

387
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Dear friends,

388
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
in this exciting...

389
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
exciting moment,

390
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I must share it with you.

391
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh, right.

392
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
The thing you told me last time

393
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
made me have a new, bold idea.

394
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Are you talking about Xiang Si Lan?

395
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes.

396
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Look,

397
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
she can make Xiang Si Lan do things.

398
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
This means that this person

399
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
is the same type as Xin Qian.

400
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This has triggered me to think deeply.

401
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Do you think that

402
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Xin Qian has also raised this low?

403
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
After I thought about it,

404
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I think that person's low position

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
seems to be a little higher.

406
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And she's smart.

407
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
How could she possibly stop her?

408
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm talking about your...

409
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
She's so brilliant.

410
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
She's the beauty of the world.

411
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
She's so beautiful.

412
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, be careful.

413
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm going to investigate.

414
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Help!

415
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
He's drunk.

416
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
How could this be?

417
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
That high-grade alcohol

418
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
can't be drunk with just a sip.

419
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
He doesn't have to be that happy

420
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
even if he comes back from the flower city.

421
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Luo Xiao Dao.

422
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Luo Xiao Dao.

423
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Luo Xiao Dao.

424
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
What's wrong?

425
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You're so angry that you're so drunk.

426
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I'm so drunk.

427
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My mother said that you were drunk.

428
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I'm making you some tea.

429
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's okay.

430
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Luo Xiao Dao.

431
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Long time no see.

432
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It's not that.

433
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You've only been to the flower city for a few days.

434
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I just feel that

435
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
it's been a long time since we last met.

436
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Is Pinning safe?

437
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
What did the doctor say?

438
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He said

439
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
he was a little disappointed

440
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
that he didn't see you.

441
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm not sick.

442
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Why would I see him?

443
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
That's right.

444
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm not sick.

445
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
What's there to see?

446
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I didn't know he was here before.

447
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But this time, it's strange

448
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
that I can feel that he's been here.

449
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And he's very close

450
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and close to me.

451
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I want to hold him

452
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
just like we do now.

453
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I just hope to hug you slowly.

454
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Lower your body.

455
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
This bamboo branch

456
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
was made by me.

457
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I baked it, soaked it, and raised it.

458
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I made it for you.

459
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Do you like it?

460
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
When I was cutting the bamboo,

461
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
you must have missed it.

462
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
A little higher.

463
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm going to teach you

464
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
how to fly on the wall today.

465
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Get up and look.

466
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Good!

467
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That's great.

468
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Are you ready?

469
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's your turn.

470
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
No, this...

471
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
This is not something that can be done in one go.

472
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Why is this not something that can be done in one go?

473
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You have to believe in yourself.

474
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Let's go.

475
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I believe in myself.

476
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I can't fall down.

477
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I believe in myself.

478
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I can't fall down.

479
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
How about I help you?

480
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
No, don't.

481
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Don't.

482
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Two.

483
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I...

484
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
A little higher.

485
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Go on.

486
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Drink it.

487
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Right.

488
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
No.

489
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
What is this?

490
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I can't go home

491
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
and just pay 600 yuan

492
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
to have a happy new marriage.

493
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
What's going on?

494
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm just worried about Xin.

495
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm afraid of being single.

496
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I can't go back.

497
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Then,

498
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
someone wants to buy a big yard in the Yan family.

499
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Hong Sha went back to buy the goods alone.

500
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Why isn't she afraid?

501
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm just not getting married well.

502
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I can't go back.

503
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Uncle Zhang didn't ask me to pay, did he?

504
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'll let you pay.

505
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'll let you pay.

506
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I can't send all my 600 yuan back.

507
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Uncle Zhang,

508
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I didn't mean to say that.

509
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You went back to attend a wedding,

510
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
not to take you to the ground.

511
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Do you have to be so entangled?

512
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Tell me honestly,

513
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
is there any bloody plot?

514
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
What?

515
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Your cousin's fiancee is your lover?

516
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Don't talk nonsense.

517
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm just worried that this is a conspiracy.

518
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's not a plan of our family.

519
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You're lying to me.

520
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Conspiracy?

521
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Lying to you?

522
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Brother Cao,

523
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
no wonder you never told me

524
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
that your family

525
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
asked you to attend the wedding

526
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
and wrote a letter.

527
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So you ran away from home?

528
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Brother Cao,

529
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I really didn't know

530
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
that you were a story teller.

531
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Shoot me.

532
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Let's make it clear first.

533
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
There's nothing that can kill people.

534
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Don't worry.

535
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You can't do that with two of us.

536
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You ran away.

537
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You ran away from marriage.

538
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Ran away from marriage?

539
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Well,

540
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
the girl who made the engagement

541
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
with Cao Pang Pang

542
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
is called Cao Jin Hua.

543
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Since Cao Pang Pang was born,

544
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
this person is taller than her and stronger than her.

545
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
In the several childhood fights,

546
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
both of them accused Cao Pang Pang

547
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
of being beaten to death on the ground.

548
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
But Cao's father

549
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
looked at Cao Jin Hua very kindly

550
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
and thought that he was a strong man

551
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
who could get down on the ground.

552
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So when it was time to get married,

553
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
they arranged a wedding for each other.

554
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It was a cold and windy day.

555
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Cao Pang Pang climbed to his own roof

556
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and accused his parents of getting married.

557
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
After a while,

558
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
everyone came

559
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and told them to break the engagement

560
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
in one way or another

561
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
to tell the family

562
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
that the engagement was not in a hurry.

563
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Get out!

564
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Fellow citizens,

565
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
today,

566
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
in the White House,

567
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I want to announce

568
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
that

569
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Cao Jin Hua and I

570
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
have broken the engagement!

571
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
That's right!

572
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Hurry up!

573
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
No one is innocent!

574
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
No one is innocent!

575
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Boss Cao, what's going on?

576
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
This kind of marriage is not worth living!

577
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Bro, don't be angry.

578
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'll let him come down right away.

579
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Who is your bro?

580
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Don't be angry!

581
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Cao Pang Pang!

582
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Well done!

583
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
You're like my disciple.

584
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
With my heart-wrenching persuasion,

585
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Brother Cao finally opened up his heart

586
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and decided to return to his homeland.

587
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
How should Brother Cao deal with

588
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
the son who came back from the wedding?

589
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
In the face of Cao Jin Hua, who hasn't seen him for many years,

590
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
should Brother Cao continue to be in the same place?

591
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Listen!

592
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Next time,

593
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
we'll split up.

594
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Mr. Ma goes to see Guan Qing Tai every day.

595
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
If you need anything, ask him.

596
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Mr. Yu!

597
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Mr. Yu!

598
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Mr. Yu!

599
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Mr. Yu!

600
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Mr. Yu!

601
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Who are you looking for?

602
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Mr. Yu,

603
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
let me introduce myself.

604
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
My name is Shen Mu Kun.

605
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You can also call me Shen Mu Kun.

606
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm the son of Shen Mu Kun.

607
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm Shen Mu Kun.

608
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm Shen Mu Kun.

609
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I'm Shen Mu Kun.

610
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm Shen Mu Kun.

611
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
You can also call me Shen Kun.

612
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yin Village is a battle

613
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
that can't be avoided

614
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
by studying the culture of the Xia Valley.

615
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Back then,

616
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Mr. Da De went to the Western Regions.

617
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
How could I say that?

618
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Mr. Da De's son, Bo Yang,

619
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
went to the Western Regions to study.

620
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
He passed by Yin Village

621
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and left a stone.

622
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Let's go.

623
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
It's disgusting.

624
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yes.

625
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
That stone is a crystal stone.

626
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Ordinary people think it's just a stone.

627
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
They don't know the mystery behind it.

628
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's so painful.

629
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It seems

630
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
you know the stone.

631
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I know a little.

632
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Mr. Lin,

633
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
is Guan Xin Tai

634
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
related to Xin Jian?

635
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Thank you.

636
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Mr. Shen

637
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
knows seven Xin Jian.

638
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Seven!

639
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
In my mind,

640
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
there is a light flash of a flashback.

641
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And I am in front of the darkness.

642
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The people are looking at two sides.

643
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
One side is the first,

644
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
the other side is waiting for you.

645
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
This game

646
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
is never over.

647
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
It has the traces of the past.

648
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You are my match,

649
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
my beauty.

650
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I become you.

651
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I feel your every breath.

652
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Then I continue to cherish the sky.

653
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I cross the line of Li Ming.

654
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Tell me the ending.

655
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The soon-to-be gentle breath.

656
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
In my mind,

657
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
the flash of a flash of a flash.

658
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And I am in front of the darkness.

659
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
The flow of Li Ming.

660
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Tell me the ending.

661
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
The soon-to-be gentle breath.

662
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
In my mind,

663
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
the flash of a flash of a flash.

664
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And I am in front of the darkness.

665
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
The flow of Li Ming.

666
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Tell me the ending.

667
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The soon-to-be gentle breath.

668
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
In my mind,

669
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
the flash of a flash of a flash.

670
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And I am in front of the darkness.

671
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
The flow of Li Ming.

672
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Tell me the ending.

673
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,000
The soon-to-be gentle breath.

674
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
In my mind,

675
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
the flash of a flash of a flash.

676
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And I am in front of the darkness.
