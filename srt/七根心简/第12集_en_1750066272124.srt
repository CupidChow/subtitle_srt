1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,060
Finally, the time for the White Sdeal 20 SEC C możerias ne se bien,

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:27,920
while Chelsea is there for you.

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,520
Episode 4

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,680
Well, I-

5
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Why are you so arrogant, brother?

6
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,100
What about the notebook then?

7
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,800
I'veông my new colleagues back in the ė0

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,800
I'm just curious.

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Let him do it for you.

10
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Hong Sha, come out.

11
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Don't do that.

12
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
What's going on?

13
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
My grandpa killed someone.

14
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,800
You're pretty.

15
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
And you're wearing a necklace.

16
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
What's it called?

17
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
A tiger's den.

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
It's a housekeeper's house.

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Ask your professional.

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Sister Sha.

21
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Master.

22
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Did you say anything?

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
I told you what I should have said.

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
My grandpa was scared today.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Tell him yourself.

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
We need to make it clear

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
about the murder.

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Murderer.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
What are you doing?

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Why did you ask me?

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
I was sent here by the actor.

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Brother Luo.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Why did you call the actor?

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
The actor attacked you in the police station.

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
He chased you here.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Didn't you realize

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
the target of the actor was you?

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
With the actor's strength,

39
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
he could kill Mu Dai in one second.

40
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Mu Dai didn't die because we arrived in time.

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
He didn't kill him.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Fang Lv.

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Why did an actor

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
chase you here?

45
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
What did you do here?

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
That woman...

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
It has nothing to do with the actor.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Are you sure?

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Master.

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
You need to make it clear

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
about what you said.

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Then we can deal with it.

53
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
The body is the place of the actor.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
The whole world is trapped here.

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
You don't need to think about it.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
You need to think about it for your granddaughter.

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Grandpa.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Tell me.

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Grandpa.

60
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Tell me.

61
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
More than 20 years ago,

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
the moon was about to set.

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I didn't want to let anyone know

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
about the scene I was in.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
I was in the hospital.

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I was in the hospital.

67
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
But there was no blood.

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
The blood was found

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
by the body sooner or later.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
It was just that time.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Grandpa.

72
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Didn't you say it was a dead man?

73
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
Grandpa, what are you talking about?

74
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Who told him to be so cunning?

75
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Don't come alone in the mountain.

76
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll say it again.

77
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
That man is a human.

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
He is a human.

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
He is not that actor.

80
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Of course he is not that actor.

81
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I've fought with that actor.

82
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
He was bloodthirsty and ambitious.

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
He was a man of the word.

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
More than 20 years ago,

85
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
he was still a child.

86
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
So,

87
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
isn't it?

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
That woman is now his mother.

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
And the candy in the basket

90
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
and the little doll

91
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
were indeed prepared for the child.

92
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
But the scenery is so narrow.

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
It's so far from the village.

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Who would raise the child there?

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
You suddenly don't say anything.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Even if he has a brain disease,

97
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
he must raise the child there.

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
It's dangerous to go to the mountain at night.

99
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I don't know how to bring a few more people.

100
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Grandpa.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
You know it's a killing.

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Don't be so stubborn.

103
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
I heard that

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
his family had a strange disease.

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
They thought it was bad.

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
They threw the child into the mountain

107
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
and let him die.

108
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
But there were some

109
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
who were not willing to go to the mountain

110
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
and ate it.

111
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
If that's the case,

112
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm afraid we can't get out so easily.

113
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
I'm afraid we can't get out so easily.

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Grandpa.

115
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
It's me.

116
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
It's raining so hard.

117
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Can't sleep?

118
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
There are too many things going on these days.

119
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Go to bed.

120
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
I'll help you to keep up the night.

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
It's okay.

122
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
But you...

123
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
You've been running around and tired.

124
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I can't sleep either.

125
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I can't sleep either.

126
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
I was afraid it was the same thing yesterday.

127
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
I almost died.

128
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
What did you say?

129
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
You don't know.

130
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Death is very close.

131
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Just like last night.

132
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
If you come late, I'll die.

133
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Or maybe

134
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
eight years ago,

135
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
I'll die.

136
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
It's nothing.

137
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
It's all the past.

138
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
It's a small accident.

139
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Ruorin.

140
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
If I become

141
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
another person,

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
can you recognize me?

143
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Another person?

144
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
How?

145
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
It's just...

146
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
We look the same.

147
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
But the character,

148
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
the behavior,

149
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
are completely different.

150
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Mudan.

151
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Have you heard of a saying?

152
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
People's body cells

153
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
are constantly being replaced.

154
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
If you want to change the whole body cells,

155
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
you need to remember.

156
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
So after seven years,

157
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
we are all new people.

158
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
We will change.

159
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
What?

160
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I came back from the Black Desert.

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Pingting told me,

162
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Brother Xiao Dao.

163
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
You seem to have changed.

164
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
But I think

165
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
the person who really cares about you,

166
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
no matter how you change,

167
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
he will recognize you.

168
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Because what he sees is not only the result,

169
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
but also the

170
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
reason why you changed.

171
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
So you will recognize me?

172
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Yes.

173
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
But you said

174
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
you will say it.

175
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
It's a lie.

176
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
You will say it.

177
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
You have water on your hand.

178
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Luo Ren.

179
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
You are so right-handed.

180
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
As I said,

181
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
you will be right-handed.

182
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
What do you mean?

183
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
You are trying to buy a house?

184
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
You are so cool.

185
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
No matter what,

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
you are my grandpa.

187
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
I am not.

188
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
The most important thing is

189
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
to get out of here as soon as possible.

190
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Throw him behind.

191
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Okay.

192
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
What are you talking about?

193
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Guess what I am talking about.

194
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,800
I am talking about the people who are right-handed.

195
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Right.

196
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Luo Ren.

197
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Do you think

198
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
the three new sisters

199
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
will be right-handed?

200
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
It's possible.

201
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Shanshan, Xia Yu,

202
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Village Manager Qin,

203
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
every one of them is right-handed.

204
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
And this woman

205
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
is not only good at martial arts,

206
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
but also good at making fake labels.

207
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Lady Qing Tian is so innocent.

208
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
She is too smart.

209
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
You are talking about the gang

210
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
that is so good.

211
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
There are more than one of them this time.

212
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
You are so considerate.

213
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Master,

214
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
is this new sister

215
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
a bad animal?

216
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
She has been married to a old man.

217
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
She is a wild animal.

218
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
She can't find a normal person.

219
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
You think she is good at dealing with animals.

220
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Sometimes, people are more scary than animals.

221
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
You are not leaving?

222
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Go, go, go.

223
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Don't fight.

224
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Don't fight.

225
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Run.

226
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Don't move.

227
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Run, run.

228
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Run, run.

229
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Run, run.

230
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Run, run.

231
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Go.

232
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Run, run.

233
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Luo Ru,

234
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
my grandfather was caught by someone.

235
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Go.

236
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Mu Dai.

237
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
13,000.

238
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Fatty.

239
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Grandpa.

240
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Luo Ru.

241
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Luo Shan.

242
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Mu Dai.

243
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Mu Dai.

244
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Mu Dai, are you okay?

245
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Are you hurt?

246
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm fine.

247
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
You are fine.

248
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
It's okay.

249
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Where are Fatty Cao and 13,000?

250
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm fine.

251
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
I'm fine.

252
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Wake up.

253
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Wake up.

254
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Where are you?

255
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Where are you?

256
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
The eyes.

257
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
I see.

258
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I see.

259
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Where are the eyes?

260
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
They are not here.

261
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
They are not here?

262
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Luo Ru.

263
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Go, go, go.

264
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Why are you still here?

265
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I'm here.

266
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm here.

267
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm here.

268
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Luo Ru.

269
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Luo Ru.

270
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Be careful.

271
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
They are on the other way.

272
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Don't think about it.

273
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
We can't get off the bus.

274
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
But they can get on.

275
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
We are in a high position.

276
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
We can get on.

277
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
We can get on.

278
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Okay, okay.

279
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Yes.

280
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
No, no, no.

281
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I'll teach the wild people how to do it.

282
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
What should we do?

283
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
What should we do?

284
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Let's do it.

285
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
13,000.

286
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Be steady.

287
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
The more you do it, the more calm you get.

288
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Think of a way to drive your mind.

289
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
You can do it.

290
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
You can do it.

291
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Yes, we can do it.

292
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
We can do it.

293
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
First step.

294
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Think about what we are good at.

295
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm good at painting.

296
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I'm good at drinking.

297
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I can be a magic.

298
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm here.

299
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Where are you?

300
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
I'm going to the toilet.

301
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
The toilet?

302
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
What are you doing?

303
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
You are so annoying.

304
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Why are you so annoying?

305
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
What are you talking about?

306
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Let the others catch you.

307
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Let the others catch you.

308
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
You are a bad guy.

309
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
You are a bad guy.

310
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
You are a bad guy.

311
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
You are a bad guy.

312
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Don't say that.

313
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
You are so arrogant.

314
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
You.

315
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Get off.

316
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Get off.

317
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
What are you doing?

318
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
You are so annoying.

319
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
You are here.

320
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Are you a wild man?

321
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Let's go.

322
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Let's go.

323
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Are you hurt?

324
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Are you hurt?

325
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Are you hurt?

326
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Are you hurt?

327
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Are you hurt?

328
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Are you hurt?

329
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Are you hurt?

330
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Are you hurt?

331
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Are you hurt?

332
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Are you hurt?

333
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Are you hurt?

334
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Are you hurt?

335
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Are you hurt?

336
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Get off.

337
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Get off.

338
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
You are so annoying.

339
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,800
Where are you going?

340
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
I'm going to the toilet.

341
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Get off.

342
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Don't hurt me.

343
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Don't hurt me.

344
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm not hurt.

345
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I'm not hurt.

346
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
We have been looking for so long.

347
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
I haven't found them.

348
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Will they...

349
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Will they...

350
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
It's okay.

351
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
If they don't find out,

352
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
they will be fine.

353
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
They will be fine.

354
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Yes.

355
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
We need to have some information on them.

356
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Yifan and Caoer are helping.

357
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,800
They are not so good at kung fu.

358
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
But they are so smart.

359
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
And they are strong in football.

360
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Your grandpa is also a great man.

361
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
He has experienced a lot of things.

362
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I think my grandpa is gone.

363
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
I saw Yanran.

364
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
I took him away.

365
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Yanran's goal is my grandpa.

366
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
I think...

367
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
the probability of his life...

368
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
is very small.

369
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I think he is not so good at kung fu.

370
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,800
There will be someone who will trust you.

371
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Have something to eat.

372
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
This house...

373
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
is a conservative area in the west.

374
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
The east was the forest that was covered with the wind yesterday.

375
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
But the moon is very big.

376
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Which direction should we go?

377
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Every time the hunter attacks us,

378
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
he wants to take your grandpa.

379
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
He didn't take the kill.

380
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
It seems like he wants to take someone to some place.

381
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
But the hunter is really that woman's child.

382
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Think about it.

383
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
He will take the murderer at the first time.

384
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
What will he take the murderer to?

385
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
Let's go.

386
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
We thought the hunter would not know but he was......

387
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,800
It has been forgotten.

388
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
What will happen?

389
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
If you miss the end?

390
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
If it means I missed it,

391
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,080
A cicada will come to attack me too

392
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
If you miss it,

393
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
I will come to kill you too.

394
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
This is why we should not listen to body language.

395
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,800
Isn't it obvious?

396
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,840
and he stored it in the kitchen.

397
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,720
Lu Roi.

398
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,120
Who is she?

399
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
He Shen...

400
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
He Shen...

401
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
He Shen...

402
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
What should we do?

403
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Let me go down and have a look.

404
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,880
Okay, no more thumb balls.

405
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,880
Throwing online persuade me of dreaming

406
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,880
not bad at all

407
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
No?

408
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,860
You hurt me, I Agent

409
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,920
How did you fall?

410
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,900
The rope interrupted the challenge

411
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,920
I have not yet tried as much as I could

412
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,520
Okay

413
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,920
Im not God, will cause you dangers

414
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,920
I have to go up now.

415
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,200
Change your �

416
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,740
Mu Dai, please kill際 мне, 끓吗, 저 Dasher Shah.

417
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,100
I need to follow her, we might find 13000 후

418
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

419
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

420
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

421
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

422
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

423
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

424
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

425
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

426
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

427

I'm not sure if I can get through this.

I'm not sure if I can get through this.

I'm not sure if I can get through this.

I'm not sure if I can get through this.

I'm not sure if I can get through this.

434

I'm not sure if I can get through this.

435
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

436
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

437
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

438
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

439
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

I'm not sure if I can get through this.

458
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

459
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

460
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,920
Ugh...

461
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Ah....

462
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
Shit!

463
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,740
What?

464
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,480
Red S Notch

465
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,580
Red S

466
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Just awake Red S

467
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
Don't cry. Don't cry.

468
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

469
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Don't cry.

470
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Mother.

471
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
I saw a ghost.

472
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
No ghost.

473
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
No.

474
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,440
Ghost.

475
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,440
I saw it.

476
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
You were scared by the woman.

477
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,440
Not a woman.

478
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
It's a woman.

479
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
She's not that white.

480
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
She's a fool.

481
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,440
She doesn't have any choice.

482
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,440
She's not that white.

483
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
She doesn't have any choice.

484
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
Her hair is white.

485
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Her hair is blue.

486
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Her neck looks like

487
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,440
she's covered with a transparent glue.

488
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,440
And

489
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
she's like a melted tiger.

490
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
On her neck.

491
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
transparent.

492
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
She can see it in her neck.

493
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
It looks like she's been cut off.

494
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
She's covered with a transparent glue.

495
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,440
She's like a melted tiger.

496
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
Don't cry.

497
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Don't cry.

498
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
No.

499
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,440
No.

500
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,440
No.

501
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,440
No.

502
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
No.

503
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Your Majesty.

504
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Are you okay?

505
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,440
I'll tell you later.

506
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Your Majesty.

507
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,440
Well.

508
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
I put my grandpa down with the muntai.

509
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,440
But

510
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
I really don't understand.

511
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Can you please

512
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
take him up

513
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,440
for me?

514
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Is that okay?

515
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Your Majesty.

516
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,440
I want to tell you something.

517
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
We can't

518
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
take you down

519
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
in this situation.

520
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
So can you

521
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,440
put your body here first?

522
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
The weather is hot.

523
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
You should be able to put your body here for a few days.

524
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
After you finish your work,

525
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,440
I'll ask someone to bring you back.

526
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
Okay?

527
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Okay.

528
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,440
I'll be back.

529
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
Be careful.

530
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
So that ghost woman

531
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
is the woman

532
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
that Grandfather Hongzha

533
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,440
killed, right?

534
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
You know her?

535
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
I suspect

536
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,440
that it's Xinjian

537
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,440
who made that woman alive.

538
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Do you feel it?

539
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
Until now,

540
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
all the people who were killed by Xinjian

541
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
were born with a physical disability.

542
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
Whether it's physical skills

543
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
or life skills,

544
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
there are many strengths.

545
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,440
There are birds,

546
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,440
pines, and tigers.

547
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
It seems like

548
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
it's true.

549
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
But what's the matter

550
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
with the tiger's tail?

551
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Hongzha,

552
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,440
is the tiger's tail a gemstone?

553
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,440
What's its feature?

554
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
The tiger's tail

555
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,440
is a gemstone.

556
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
The feature is

557
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
that it's fragile

558
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
and weak.

559
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,440
It's afraid of high temperature

560
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,440
and it's hot.

561
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
Is it possible

562
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
that the tiger's tail

563
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
was originally on the woman's body?

564
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
When Xinjian

565
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
used her mouth

566
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,440
to release some kind of energy,

567
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,440
it melted the tiger's tail.

568
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
It's possible.

569
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,440
I think

570
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
the tiger's tail

571
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
is like

572
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
a melting

573
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
and re-increasing mushroom.

574
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Then this part...

575
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
It's thin.

576
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,440
It's fragile.

577
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
It's not broken.

578
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
Look here.

579
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
There are some red threads.

580
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,440
It's like

581
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
a windmill.

582
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
It's mixed with

583
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
some blood.

584
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Will there be

585
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
some new ones?

586
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Think about it.

587
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
After Xinjian's use,

588
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
the tiger's tail

589
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
melted.

590
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
Xinjian's tiger's tail

591
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
and blood are mixed together.

592
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Then it's a piece of white

593
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
and some blood are mixed together.

594
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
There must be some new ones.

595
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Hongzha, sleep.

596
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Come.

597
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
When the tiger's tail

598
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
was on the woman's neck,

599
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,440
I saw the word.

600
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Why didn't I see the word?

601
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
Hold it.

602
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
This is the old word I've been looking for.

603
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
This is the old word.

604
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
This is the human word.

605
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
This is a rope.

606
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
This rope is on the human body.

607
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
It's like a tide.

608
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,440
It's very dangerous.

609
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
This is the fishing line.

610
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
That's right.

611
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
So my grandpa

612
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
will be killed.

613
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
It's not just because

614
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
that woman is revenge.

615
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,440
And because

616
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
this is Xinjian's

617
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
word.

618
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,440
It seems that the god said it right.

619
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Every word is

620
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
the way Xinjian

621
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,440
killed.

622
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,440
I'm a demon.

623
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
I'm a beauty.

624
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
I'm a demon.

625
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,440
I feel every breath of yours.

626
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
Then the time goes by.

627
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,440
The flower is clear.

628
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Tell me the answer.

629
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,440
The gentle breath of your hand.

630
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,440
In the sea of ​​the brain,

631
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,440
the longing of your ears is light.

632
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
The black silk of your ear.

633
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,440
The clear flower is clear.

634
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,440
Tell me the answer.

635
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,440
The gentle breath of your hand.

636
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,440
In the sea of ​​the brain,

637
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,440
the longing of your ears is light.

638
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,440
The black silk of your ear.

639
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,440
The clear flower is clear.

640
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Tell me the answer.

641
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,440
The gentle breath of your hand.

642
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,440
In the sea of ​​the brain,

643
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,440
the longing of your ears is light.

644
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,440
The black silk of your ear.

645
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,440
The black silk of your ear.
