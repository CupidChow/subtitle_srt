And...

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,700
I wanna get out.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,700
Where are you?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,000
Penelope and Evo are still inside behind Deft Henry hamlet.

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
That place is in H smashedaha.

10
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,620
I live in the village.

11
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,340
That's my hometown.

12
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,620
The village designer plays water trading

13
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,400
with water едies in the君の汳 Follow

14
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,900
There was a pair of the water deer with the blood on it.

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,900
Actually, when I first drew the water deer in the small river,

16
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,900
I saw the illusion on the water deer.

17
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,900
I realized that was the water deer after I finished drawing it.

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,900
I was too shocked, so I didn't say anything.

19
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,900
I didn't expect that you would also see the same thing as me

20
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,900
after you all went on the way.

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,900
Water deer is a water deer.

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,900
illusion is illusion.

23
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,900
How can you be sure that the water deer you are in

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,900
is what we are looking for?

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
Because the last line is mine.

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,900
The guards who caught the line are mine.

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
Because I don't want to talk about that place.

29
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,900
There is a place in the Wuzhou Village.

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,900
I will search it.

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
The village is too small.

32
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,900
I can't find it on the map.

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
I can take you there.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
But I have a condition.

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,900
You tell me.

36
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,900
Take care of my safety.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Okay.

38
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,900
I will go to the village.

39
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
I will go to the village.

40
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
I will go to the village.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,900
I will go to the village.

42
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,900
I will go to the village.

43
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
I will go to the village.

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,900
I will go to the village.

45
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
I will go to the village.

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,900
I will go to the village.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,900
I will go to the village.

48
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
I will go to the village.

49
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,900
I will go to the village.

50
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
I will go to the village.

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,900
I will go to the village.

52
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,900
I will go to the village.

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,900
What's wrong with you?

54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
I didn't come to the hospital.

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
I am the one who caused you to suffer.

56
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,900
What?

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,900
What's wrong with you?

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,900
Brother Luo took the hospital.

59
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,900
I have to go to the hospital.

60
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
I am too cold.

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,900
I like to be warm.

62
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,900
My little sister is with me.

63
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
She is so cold.

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,900
What's wrong with you?

65
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
Life doesn't make sense.

66
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,900
Life doesn't make sense.

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
What do you want?

68
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,900
I have something.

69
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Sit down.

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
But we are in the north.

71
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
You can sit here.

72
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,900
Is the target here?

73
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,900
You are not here.

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
I told you that my brother is here.

75
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Who?

76
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
You...

77
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,900
You...

78
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,900
My master told me to clean up.

79
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
I have to do it.

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,900
My hands and legs are broken.

81
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,900
You are holding it?

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,900
Where is the red one?

83
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
What did he tell you?

84
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,900
Nothing.

85
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Brother Luo.

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,900
Go.

87
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Oh my god.

88
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,900
When did you come?

89
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
You are in the group.

90
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
What?

91
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Don't you like to wash your face?

92
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Didn't you say that I have to find a job for you?

93
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
You are looking for a job?

94
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Yes.

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,900
Let's go.

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Where are you going to?

97
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
Hua City.

98
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
I have to clean up.

99
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
It's only 30 km away.

100
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Let's go.

101
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Tell uncle Zhang that I am leaving with my brother.

102
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,900
What?

103
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,900
Thank you for taking care of Mu Dai.

104
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
Life is meaningful.

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
You can say it.

106
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Where did you get this money from?

107
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
Hurry up.

108
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
Come on.

109
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,900
I will tell him.

110
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,900
This is the miracle of medical school.

111
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,900
What a long trip.

112
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,900
There is no house in the mansion.

113
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
It's a special thing.

114
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,900
Senior.

115
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
Can I do the insurance?

116
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,900
Yes.

117
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Then,

118
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
what do you need to pay attention to?

119
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,900
You don't need to pay attention to anything.

120
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
You can do whatever you want.

121
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Don't pretend.

122
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
They are picking on you.

123
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
You are picking on them.

124
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
Anyway, you are not cool.

125
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,900
You are a good person.

126
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
You should respect yourself.

127
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
Go and have a look.

128
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,900
We are here.

129
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
Wait for me.

130
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Junior.

131
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
Linglong.

132
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
Don't forget to say hello.

133
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Hello.

134
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
Mu Dai, did you see the table in front of you?

135
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
Yes.

136
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
Yes.

137
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,900
There is a word on the table.

138
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Read it.

139
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
Zhu Yu,

140
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
the treasure.

141
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,900
The beast is not covered by the painting.

142
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
The treasure.

143
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
The beautiful one.

144
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Junior.

145
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
How many times have I told you?

146
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
Be gentle.

147
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
You are picking on me.

148
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Hello.

149
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
Hello.

150
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
Someone recommended me to you.

151
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,900
Someone recommended me to you.

152
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
I have never been to a faraway place.

153
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
I want to find a girl for her.

154
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
I want to find a girl for her.

155
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
I want to find a girl for her.

156
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
At least four or five days.

157
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,900
I will have a full bag of food and clothes.

158
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
I will have 20,000 yuan.

159
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
I will have 10,000 yuan.

160
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
Senior.

161
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
Where are you going to school?

162
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
You can still go home.

163
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
Where is this place?

164
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
What is it?

165
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
What is it?

166
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Tell her.

167
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Tell her.

168
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
Our house is a treasure.

169
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
Do you hear me?

170
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Do you hear me?

171
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,900
This treasure is called the jewelry.

172
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
These are all priceless treasures.

173
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
We can't pick priceless treasures.

174
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Why are you so patient?

175
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
You can use the equipment

176
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
to open and store your jewelry.

177
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
We don't pick such a wasteful thing.

178
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Do you remember the saying on the stone table?

179
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
What?

180
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Don't be fooled by the stones.

181
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
The jewel is made of jade.

182
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Don't be fooled by the stones.

183
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
We pick such a thing.

184
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Don't be fooled by the stones.

185
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Then you can't be fooled by the stones.

186
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
You should have left.

187
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,900
The outside world is the outside world.

188
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
Do you think

189
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,900
jewelry is your own treasure?

190
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
They either have a stone or a piece of land.

191
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
They either have a stone or a piece of land.

192
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,900
Of course ordinary people cannot see it.

193
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,900
Then we should use a pair of eyes

194
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
to distinguish the treasure they have.

195
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Do you understand?

196
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,900
We treasure people who don't dig land.

197
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
We only pick the water and the scenery.

198
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
The water is the treasure of the pearl.

199
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,900
The scenery is the treasure of the god.

200
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
The ancient books are bold.

201
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
The stone is in the scenery.

202
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
The top is empty.

203
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,900
The pearl is in the stone.

204
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
Don't talk about those gray people who don't understand.

205
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
I'm telling you.

206
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
We treasure people who

207
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
are practicing the eyes.

208
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
They rely on the eyes to make the treasure

209
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
a certain defense.

210
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
But this method is too wasteful.

211
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
So the practice people

212
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
are all blind in the future.

213
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
I have a son.

214
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
He is the 25th of Hongsha.

215
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
He can't read his own books.

216
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
He likes to use his own method.

217
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
A few days ago, he went to the place

218
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
where he was in the palace.

219
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
He said he would go to the treasure.

220
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
I have been in contact with him for the past two days.

221
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
I can't contact him.

222
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,900
The phone is connected.

223
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
No one can answer.

224
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,900
The location of the check is in that generation.

225
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
I am anxious.

226
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
But I am anxious.

227
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
I am anxious.

228
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
But the behavior is not so good.

229
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
So I will ask you

230
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
to take Hongsha to see.

231
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
The place is

232
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,900
a little bit higher.

233
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,900
It is convenient to ask

234
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
where the location is.

235
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Hepu

236
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
Wuzhu Village

237
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,900
What a coincidence.

238
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,900
The front tunnel is behind the gate.

239
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
Please turn around.

240
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
The front tunnel is behind the gate.

241
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
Please turn around.

242
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Yuwen San

243
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,900
The road ahead seems to be not clear.

244
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
This kind of yellow-skinned face

245
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
is often used in the kitchen.

246
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,900
Believe me.

247
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
This tunnel is 20 meters out of 15.

248
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
I remember it very clearly.

249
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
The tunnel is accurate.

250
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
That's impossible.

251
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
It is Wuzhu Village

252
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
after all.

253
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
It has to be divided from other places.

254
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,900
I don't know why I have to go down the road.

255
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,900
I am in the luggage.

256
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
I am your baby.

257
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Not your assistant.

258
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
Oh, right.

259
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
After you arrive at Hepu,

260
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,900
what do you do?

261
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Where do you live after you finish your work?

262
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
Have you checked everything?

263
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Grandpa said

264
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,900
to take the full bag of food and clothes.

265
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Remember to arrange it.

266
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,900
I will take it.

267
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,900
I will take it.

268
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,900
I will take the full bag of food and clothes.

269
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
I told you to go over there.

270
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
I am going to the restaurant.

271
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Boss, have you heard that there is a Wuzhu Village nearby?

272
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,900
I know.

273
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,900
You are going there?

274
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
I used to go from the old tunnel to the tunnel.

275
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
Now the tunnel is closed.

276
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
It has to be far away.

277
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
You can take the train.

278
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
There is also a road to the tunnel.

279
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Do you know why?

280
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
The tunnel is closed.

281
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,900
There is no one there.

282
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
It is empty.

283
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
I heard that

284
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
Wuzhu Village is a talent village.

285
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,900
It is a generation of talent.

286
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Why is it empty?

287
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
It is empty.

288
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
There is no more talent.

289
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Let's move out.

290
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
There is no more talent?

291
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
I heard that there are real pigs in the lake.

292
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
There should be no more talent.

293
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Brother, you don't know this, right?

294
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,900
It is said that on the weekend night,

295
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,900
the legendary old pig's sun moon really appeared.

296
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
It is said that all the pigs are real pigs.

297
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,900
I don't know which bastard

298
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
burned all the gas in the lake.

299
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Who?

300
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
What a lack of a thing.

301
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Who said it is not?

302
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
I heard that

303
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
the generation of the old pig

304
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
is no longer a pig.

305
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
I heard that the old man said that

306
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
it is a good thing.

307
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
I think that this thing is very rational.

308
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,900
If you burn it with fire,

309
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
it will definitely hate this place.

310
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,900
So no more people come, right?

311
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,900
But now there is nothing.

312
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
And I heard that the village's generation

313
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,900
is still a pig.

314
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Really?

315
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Don't say that.

316
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Come, come, come.

317
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Come, come.

318
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,900
It is that town

319
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
that you want to leave?

320
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,920
This thing is supposed to have got

321
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,420
rid of an old pig.

322
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:07,900
The crane can live itself for long.

323
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
The old wagon is still alive.

324
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,900
It want to go to the river.

325
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,920
Now, we take off.

326
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,900
It us 추 the washed-up car.

327
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,900
It will make all the pakkis

328
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
ashame gas.

329
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,900
It went ashame.

330
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Cruise from this Crosswalk

331
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Did you hear me?

332
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
Hello?

333
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,900
Sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

334
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
Please call again later.

335
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
Come on.

336
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Wake up. Wake up.

337
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Wake up. Wake up.

338
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
What's wrong?

339
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,900
Wake up. Wake up.

340
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,900
What's wrong?

341
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
Something happened.

342
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
Why can't you reach me?

343
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Your uncle has lost his face.

344
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
He called you now.

345
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,900
I said the phone was out of power.

346
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
The owner will call you.

347
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
He didn't answer.

348
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
But he didn't talk.

349
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Something happened.

350
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
The phone was out of power.

351
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
My dream is so scary.

352
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
It's like real.

353
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,900
People have said that dreams are all opposite.

354
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Don't think about it.

355
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Go to sleep.

356
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
It's so scary.

357
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
The ticket is not good.

358
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
It's so scary.

359
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
The train is coming.

360
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
The train is coming.

361
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,900
The train is coming.

362
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,900
How could this happen?

363
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Where is he?

364
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,900
Is this place coming to pick us up?

365
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Don't worry. I've arranged everything.

366
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
He is a professional.

367
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
He is a treasure.

368
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
He doesn't pay attention to life.

369
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Here!

370
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
I don't understand.

371
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
What's wrong?

372
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
I don't understand.

373
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
What's wrong?

374
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
I don't understand.

375
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
What's wrong?

376
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Hello.

377
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Which one is Miss Yan?

378
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
You want to take the ride?

379
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Yes.

380
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Yes.

381
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Get in.

382
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Come on.

383
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,900
Sit tight.

384
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,900
We're leaving soon.

385
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,900
I have this.

386
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Yes.

387
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
How could this happen?

388
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
I'm coming.

389
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,900
I'm coming.

390
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,900
This is your house.

391
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
I'm coming.

392
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
Why didn't you send the proposal?

393
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Why did you send someone to protect us?

394
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
The group leader is far away.

395
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
He is afraid that he will steal the pig.

396
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
If they steal it, we will be less.

397
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,900
The pig is beautiful and has few natural characteristics.

398
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Jiang Zhao will have less skin and less skin.

399
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Am I right?

400
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
I'm leaving.

401
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Take care.

402
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
I'm wearing a protective suit.

403
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Don't worry.

404
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
I'm leaving.

405
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
Mingyuan.

406
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,900
If you have any problem,

407
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
tell me.

408
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
You know,

409
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,900
I live in the village

410
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
because of the pig.

411
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,900
The water and the farm are so thin.

412
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
Some of them have more.

413
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Some of them have more.

414
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Everyone wants to share the other.

415
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,900
This is a conflict between the two villages.

416
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,900
We agreed that

417
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,900
the two villages will be the same.

418
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
We agreed that

419
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,900
the two villages will be the same.

420
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
But the villages are different.

421
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
We just want to steal the pig.

422
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
We want to make things better.

423
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
This is our land.

424
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
We can't go back to our land.

425
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
Go. Go. Go.

426
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Go back.

427
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
Go.

428
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
Go.

429
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,900
My dad

430
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,900
died in this mess.

431
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
The dead pig died.

432
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
But the pig is

433
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
very good.

434
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Yes.

435
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
Who knows?

436
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
Maybe

437
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,900
the water is getting dirty.

438
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
There's always an accident.

439
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
I don't know.

440
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,900
I don't know how to find the body.

441
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
From now on,

442
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,900
my mom will become a mess.

443
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,900
I can't tell the reality.

444
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
Mom, what are you doing?

445
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
I'm looking for your dad.

446
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Mom, the wind is too strong.

447
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,900
Don't go. Mom.

448
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Did you hear that?

449
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Where's your dad?

450
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
He's in the house.

451
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
He can't catch the pig.

452
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
I have to go.

453
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
Mom, don't go.

454
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,900
The wind is too strong.

455
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Mom.

456
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Mom.

457
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
Go away.

458
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Mom.

459
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Mom.

460
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
Mom.

461
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,900
Mom.

462
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,900
Mom.

463
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Mom.

464
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,900
Mom.

465
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Mom.

466
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
Don't go.

467
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
Let me go.

468
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Don't go.

469
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
Don't go.

470
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Are you stupid?

471
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,900
Don't kill me.

472
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Chief.

473
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Chief, please save my mom.

474
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,900
Such a big wind.

475
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,900
How can I save her?

476
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
No one can scare her.

477
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Who scares her,

478
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
who gives her up?

479
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,900
You're a mad woman.

480
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900
Mom.

481
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Crazy woman.

482
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
Let me go.

483
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Let me go.

484
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
Open the door.

485
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,900
I remember that night,

486
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,900
the wind was strong on the street.

487
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
No one was there to save her.

488
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
When I was looking for her the next day,

489
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
I couldn't find anything.

490
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Do you think I'm unlucky?

491
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Anyway, I think so.

492
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
I remember that time,

493
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,900
I secretly went to the police station

494
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,900
to ask who was the culprit.

495
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
What did I do wrong?

496
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
What did we do wrong?

497
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Did our family offend her?

498
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
But there was no response.

499
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Close the door.

500
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
I asked you to come here

501
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,900
to discuss about Jiang Zhao.

502
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Poor girl.

503
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
She needs a lot of money

504
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
in school and her family.

505
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,900
I think this money

506
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
is not enough for her.

507
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
I think we should

508
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,900
discuss about it.

509
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Fine.

510
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
I'll do as you say.

511
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
Fine. I'll do it.

512
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Liu.

513
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,900
You should express your gratitude.

514
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Chief.

515
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
It's unfair.

516
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
You're not guilty.

517
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
I'll pay for it.

518
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Nonsense.

519
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
I didn't hurt her.

520
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
I didn't push her down.

521
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
I didn't push her down.

522
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Why didn't you save her

523
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,900
when you were next to her?

524
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
It was so chaotic.

525
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,900
I couldn't save her.

526
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Besides,

527
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:06,900
Jiang Zhao didn't die.

528
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,900
At least,

529
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
we helped her

530
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
to hold the lake.

531
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
Yes.

532
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
We killed her.

533
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
Li Kui and her family

534
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
came to take the land.

535
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,900
The boss also sympathized with us.

536
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
He just painted the water.

537
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
So,

538
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,900
Jiang Zhao's father

539
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,900
is the accomplice of our village.

540
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
We should take care of Jiang Zhao

541
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,900
and take her as our hostage.

542
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
Don't just

543
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
hang around.

544
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Do you hear me?

545
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Chief.

546
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,900
Chief.

547
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
Chief.

548
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
Chief.

549
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,900
Chief.

550
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
Chief.

551
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Chief.

552
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,900
Chief.

553
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Chief.

554
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,900
Chief.

555
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,900
Chief.

556
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Chief.

557
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
What a mess.

558
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
What a mess.

559
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,900
What does

560
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,900
the old gang mean?

561
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,900
The old gang.

562
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,900
It's just a legend.

563
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,900
If

564
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
in the middle of the autumn,

565
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,900
a group of dogs

566
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,900
climb up the lake

567
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
and open the shell.

568
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
They will be more lively.

569
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,900
In the coming year,

570
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,900
the harvest of the pearl

571
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,900
will be very good.

572
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
If the harvest is more luxurious,

573
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
the pearl will be bigger and rounder.

574
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,900
But do you think

575
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,900
they deserve it?

576
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,940
They are so kind and

577
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,900
so desperate.

578
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Do you think

579
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
they deserve it?

580
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Do they deserve good harvest?

581
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Then?

582
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,900
Then?

583
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Then I asked for the oil.

584
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
I burned the village.

585
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
I went to the top of the village.

586
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
I destroyed the city.

587
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Then I knew it.

588
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
I never mentioned this to anyone.

589
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
Ask me.

590
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Liu Kansan.

591
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:40,900
The past

592
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,900
can't be changed.

593
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,900
The important thing is

594
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,900
to say it right now.

595
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,900
Yes.

596
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,900
You are right.

597
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
We came here

598
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
to save Pingting.

599
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,900
Tell me.

600
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Where are we going next?

601
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
The pond.

602
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,900
There is a

603
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
pond of the pond.

604
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
I think there is a clue.

605
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,900
Here it is.

606
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,900
There is a big grass here.

607
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,900
Otherwise, it won't be so clean.

608
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Yes, I also found it.

609
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,900
Is there anyone

610
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
who comes back to clean the pond?

611
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,900
Liu Kansan.

612
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,900
What?

613
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,900
Do you have any words?

614
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,900
No.

615
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
We have

616
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
the water god.

617
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
But we don't have

618
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
the folk saying.

619
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,900
Let's go.

620
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
Here we are.

621
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Here we are.

622
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
I can't go

623
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
this way.

624
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Thank you.

625
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,900
Let's go.

626
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,900
You two

627
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,900
keep moving this way.

628
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
The five villages

629
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,900
are on the opposite side of the mountain.

630
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,900
You two climb the mountain

631
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
and see an old pond.

632
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,900
That's it.

633
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
We just go this way.

634
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
We can't go this way.

635
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,900
See?

636
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
The first pond

637
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,900
is the pond.

638
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
The second pond

639
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
is the pond.

640
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,900
The pond is the pond.

641
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,900
See?

642
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
It's not far from the pond.

643
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
It's a pond.

644
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
You two go down there.

645
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,900
I'll call you when I get back.

646
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,900
Why are you walking that way?

647
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Isn't the lake center there?

648
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,900
There's a pond.

649
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,900
I'll go in there.

650
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Where are you going?

651
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,900
Just go straight.

652
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
You have to go around.

653
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Are you tired?

654
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
Actually, I think

655
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,900
this is a

656
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
open pond.

657
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
The lake center

658
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,900
is a lake.

659
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,900
It's a lake.

660
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,900
We can't go there.

661
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
But the more we go,

662
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,900
the more we get there.

663
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,900
It's okay to run and drive.

664
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,900
We've been going straight

665
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,900
between two o'clock.

666
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,900
We should try to

667
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
run in the middle.

668
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,900
That's the best way to save energy.

669
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,900
The lake center.

670
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,900
The lake center.

671
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
The lake center.

672
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,900
Rui San.

673
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,900
What's that sound?

674
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,900
No need to look.

675
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,900
It's a silk boat.

676
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
We're used to it.

677
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
We'll tie a silk boat

678
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,900
on the boat.

679
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
We'll go to the lake

680
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
and get a good harvest.

681
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Go and see.

682
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Are you sure

683
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,900
we have to walk there?

684
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,900
You've chosen the path.

685
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,900
It's great.

686
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Look.

687
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
What's wrong?

688
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,900
You can't even

689
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
eat this bitter melon.

690
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
Look at yourself.

691
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Is it close to the front?

692
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,900
Look at yourself.

693
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
You're the one.

694
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
I'm talking to you.

695
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,900
Are you polite?

696
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
Do you think

697
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,900
there's something on the ground?

698
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,900
No.

699
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,900
Why are you so suspicious?

700
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
133.

701
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:06,900
133.

702
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,900
The production team is right.

703
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Did you see

704
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,900
the man I just saw?

705
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,900
He's the one who fell down.

706
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,900
Why didn't he live

707
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,900
in the village?

708
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,900
He was

709
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,900
in the boat.

710
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,900
Hello, Mu Dai.

711
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,900
What's wrong?

712
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,900
Hello, Lu Ren.

713
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Are you in the Wuzhu Village?

714
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,900
I'm here.

715
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,900
Lu Ren,

716
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
I'm in the Wuzhu Village too.

717
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,900
You're in the Wuzhu Village too?

718
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
Mu Dai.

719
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,900
I'm going in.

720
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,900
Mu Dai.

721
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,900
Mu Dai.

722
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
What's wrong?

723
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
Hello.

724
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Mu Dai.

725
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,900
I'm trapped.

726
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Mu Dai, I'm trapped.

727
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Mu Dai, help me.

728
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
Help me.

729
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
Hello.

730
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
I told you to have something.

731
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,900
Come help me.

732
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,900
Hello.

733
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,900
What's wrong, Lu Ren?

734
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,900
Hu Di.

735
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,900
Mu Dai, help me.

736
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
Mu Dai.

737
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,900
Mu Dai.

738
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,900
Mu Dai, help me.

739
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,900
Mu Dai.

740
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,900
Mu Dai.

741
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,900
Mu Dai.

742
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,900
Are you okay?

743
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Mu Dai.

744
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,900
Mu Dai.

745
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
Mu Dai.

746
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Mu Dai.

747
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
Mu Dai.

748
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
Mu Dai.

749
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
Mu Dai.
