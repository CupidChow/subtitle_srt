Episode 1

2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Wudai, I feel like I have a few things to share.

3
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
These past few days, I plan to transfer the Zahu Hall to the previous position.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can't help but ask. I don't believe I can't help this person.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going to transfer the Zahu Hall to the next position.

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll take the portrait to the small mall.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't choose a place.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There are a lot of cameras out there.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can protect myself.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't worry.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I didn't touch the bridge.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You didn't touch the road.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I didn't touch your stuff.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I didn't eat the strawberries.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I didn't throw them away.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mo Bai,

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
actually, I'm always good at this.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you know why?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't want to eat it.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You have good kung fu.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But you only have to be gentle and careful.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You even put your sword on my neck.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You even praised my kung fu.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You must have missed my moves.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Seriously,

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I can tell that

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you have a very professional martial arts skills.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you teach me this,

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm not your opponent.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can tell that you are a martial arts master.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What are you doing?

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It doesn't matter.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't want to know.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you here to talk about the case of Luo Mahou?

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have a request.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What is it?

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Two people will keep an eye on Luo Mahou.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Jin You and the murderer.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Three people will search for the source of the information.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I, Hong Yi and Li Tan are Jin You.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What about you?

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What about you?

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You know Hong Yi very well.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You know Li Tan very well.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You can talk to me.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But you have to get out of our whole plate.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You hide it yourself.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's not good.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm very busy.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you don't say, I'll leave.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll leave.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Your parents and your sister?

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
My uncle.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My uncle is Luo Wenmiao.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He is a historical scholar.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
After his death,

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
he went to the prison for his professional studies.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He took his daughter to the prison.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He moved to the school.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
About two years ago,

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
my uncle passed away.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The prison was closed.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I asked my parents to come back.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's been a long time.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
My uncle suddenly came back.

78
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Uncle.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Dad.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you okay?

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm fine.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He went there.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He said it was a mess.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
My uncle often went to the foreign land to do the study.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I didn't care.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But that night,

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
something strange happened.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Uncle.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you still not sleeping?

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's late.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Uncle.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I...

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't let me kill people.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let me go.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What do you mean?

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I've been chasing after Wenmiao.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But she did it.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I've never said that.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's like

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
she made a bad joke with me.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Maybe it's because she's too serious.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I've always been prepared.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So I lock the door every night.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Uncle, I'm coming in.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll follow you when uncle comes out.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Uncle.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are you doing?

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've been here for a few days.

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I've been quiet.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've been locked up.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But I didn't expect it.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I thought he'd wake up.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
My dad...

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
My dad is gone.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Didn't you lock the door?

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I locked it.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Do you believe it?

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
My uncle is over 50 years old.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He can't jump and can't lift his hand.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He can't even lift his bike.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He can even cross the wall of the four-meter height.

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And I think that person is very good at playing.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He should be very good at it.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But I didn't expect that

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
he's so strong.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He's so strong.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I immediately chased him out.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I threw a small box.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I left a box of firewood.

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Someone is shooting inside.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You went to see it?

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The image of the house is very miserable.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Is Uncle Li Tan here?

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I thought he was a murderer.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When I went in,

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I saw him pinching my uncle's neck.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You know that sometimes you just see a picture

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and it's not a real picture.

140
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But you'll be in the conclusion.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I know.

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
At that time,

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I gave Li Tan to Da Yun.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Uncle ran away at this time.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I saw his eyes.

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That kind of

147
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
lost eyes.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I immediately realized that I was wrong.

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
My uncle is a murderer.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
When I went after him,

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I saw his speed and power.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That wasn't my uncle at all.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But he

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
was really my uncle.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What happened next?

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Luo Xiao Dou.

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What happened to Mo Bai?

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What happened?

159
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Uncle,

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
are you a murderer?

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm a king.

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't let me go.

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm a king.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm not coming.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hurry.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I tied Uncle up and went to find Li Tan.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He is the only murderer in the scene.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have to find out

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
what happened.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What happened?

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Who killed him?

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I caught him.

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I finally caught him.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I finally caught him.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What did you say?

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I finally caught him.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Tell me.

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I killed him.

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I was watching Li Tan go to the hospital.

180
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So I locked Uncle up in the study room.

181
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I asked Ping Ting

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to come back and discuss with me.

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Li Tan is back.

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll explain to him when he comes back.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I thought

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I tied him up in the study room.

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I was so worried.

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There wouldn't be any problem in the short time.

189
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I must have rushed back at the highest speed.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I didn't expect that.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Uncle is dead.

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ping Ting.

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Ping Ting is crazy.

194
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't know what happened.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Maybe

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
he heard I wanted to call the police

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
and let me go.

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But the medical condition

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
is very serious.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm afraid

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
that I'll be killed

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
if I'm not careful.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why would Ping Ting be crazy?

204
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Even if I'm killed by Mu Du

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and I'm not scared of being killed,

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
until I see the evidence,

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can understand

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
what happened at the time.

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I realized

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Ping Ting might have been through

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
a terrible thing.

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's so strange.

213
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I started to search

214
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
from this case

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and Li Tan.

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I found out about the Lu Mahuan.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But the real brother

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
of Lu Mahuan

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
was definitely not my uncle.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He was still studying abroad.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Later,

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I found out about Huo Zihong's mission.

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Then I found out

224
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
what I could find

225
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
with the evidence.

226
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If this was a big plan,

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the whole company

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
would be on Huo Zihong.

229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Mu Du.

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I need your help.

231
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I...

232
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I, Hong Yi...

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I, Hong Yi,

234
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
can't be a murderer.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Maybe he's not a murderer.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But he must know

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
who the murderer is.

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What evidence do you have?

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Do you remember last night

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
when we talked behind us?

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He came up and asked

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
if he hadn't come with us.

243
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He was my uncle.

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
My uncle was already dead.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He was dead.

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How could he come together?

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He's still alive?

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He's alive.

249
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He's still alive.

250
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I realized

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
we were talking in the same place.

252
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We were talking about the same thing,

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
but we were talking about

254
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
not the same person.

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He said he wasn't my uncle,

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
but the real murderer.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
His words made me think

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
he was talking to the murderer.

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So I killed him.

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you know who the real murderer is?

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're not Huo Zihong.

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You saw

263
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
what he said.

264
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What did you think?

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Zhang Guanghua.

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Who's Zhang Guanghua?

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Zhang Guanghua is the second

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
person I've ever met

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
in Wanfeng Fire.

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He's a street cat.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
he lived in the same building with Li Aqin.

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Later,

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
the case of the horse mackerel

275
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
didn't take long.

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He disappeared.

277
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then his body

278
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
was found

279
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
in the pond and pond of Datong.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It seems that he was in a coma.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Datong?

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Datong?

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Why is the underground so familiar?

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think I've seen it somewhere.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's where Liu Shuai fell off the water.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes.

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's in Datong.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Where did you put

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Zhang Guanghua's information?

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know.

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I haven't seen the tomb in the afternoon.

293
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay, you can look for it.

294
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What's that noise again?

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Aunt Hong, you're here.

296
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I've been

297
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
having so many things.

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I want to pray

299
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
to bless our hotel

300
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
to be safe and sound.

301
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Aunt Hong, you're here.

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You can come.

303
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Okay.

304
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'll go.

305
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hello.

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I didn't find it.

307
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
where Hongyi put

309
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Zhang Guanghua's information.

310
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's okay.

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
There should be a foundation

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
for Wanfeng Fire.

313
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What are you going to do next?

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I've known

315
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
all the details of the three-story house.

316
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I have to get rid of

317
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
their relationship as soon as possible.

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Tell me directly.

319
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There should be a secret.

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wait, wait, wait.

321
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Three-story house?

322
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Isn't it two-story house?

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, right.

324
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You don't know

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
the special thing about Dalun.

326
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How about you go to my house

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and help me fix it?

328
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll make more details for you.

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Go to your house?

330
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, it's too late.

331
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Okay.

332
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll hang up now.

333
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'll call you later.

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay.

335
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Xiaozhi.

336
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You live here?

337
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Then I...

338
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Come in.

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Is this your house?

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's a house with a lot of people.

341
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Come on.

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Where are you going?

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
My room.

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The information is in my room.

345
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh.

346
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Where is the information?

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Can you see the bar here?

348
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You can see my room?

349
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I said there was always

350
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
a feeling of being stolen these days.

351
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The most common thing is that you don't know the purpose.

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm...

353
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
called a detective or a observer.

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Come and look at the information.

355
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Liu Shuhai mentioned two cases before.

356
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
One is the horse-drawn fox.

357
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The other is the one

358
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
that didn't tell me.

359
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So you secretly bought the information

360
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
from the village head?

361
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This case happened five years ago.

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Dalentor,

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the Eastern District,

364
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
the police were also the first to kill people.

365
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I was the first to find the suspect.

366
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But no one knew about this case.

367
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
No one knew?

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The victim was trapped.

369
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There was a wolf.

370
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This matter

371
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
was on the roof.

372
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Take it back.

373
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
These cases

374
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
are there any rules

375
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
from the first case?

376
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
They are very far away.

377
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I can't see any connection.

378
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What about the time?

379
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The second and third cases

380
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
were solved for three years.

381
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But the first and second cases

382
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
were solved for 17 years.

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
The first case was solved for 17 years.

384
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Then,

385
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
the murderer of the media.

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I think

387
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
the first case was not done by Liu Shuhai.

388
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
First,

389
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
the case was solved for too long.

390
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Second,

391
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
when the case happened,

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Liu Shuhai just admitted it.

393
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Why did he suddenly

394
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
kill his own family

395
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
with his own unrelenting Li Yaqing?

396
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's right.

397
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I didn't have a chance to admit it.

398
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Until

399
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
you mentioned Zhang Guanghua to me.

400
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What a coincidence.

401
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Zhang Guanghua was also living in the Lu Mahu.

402
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What's more,

403
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Zhang Guanghua's relics

404
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
were in the big city.

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Liu Shuhai

406
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
was also on the big city.

407
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
They both

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
had a studio.

409
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Liu Shuhai

410
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
was also

411
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
killed by my uncle.

412
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Did you remember

413
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I told you that

414
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I helped my uncle

415
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
to find him

416
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
when he was missing?

417
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I asked Ping Ting

418
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
if there was anything

419
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
strange

420
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
before my uncle left the house.

421
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Ping Ting told me

422
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
that my uncle used to go to the police

423
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
for business.

424
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He came back to the factory

425
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
to collect the money.

426
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
He was a big man.

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
He came back to the factory.

428
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He was in a bad mood

429
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
after he left.

430
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Five years ago,

431
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm so sorry.

432
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
My uncle bought the wrong ticket.

433
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I was the one who was wrong.

434
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The one you found was wrong.

435
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Okay.

436
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Now, the little donkey in the village.

437
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Okay.

438
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Okay.

439
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's all.

440
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The right-hand man

441
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
kept walking in the direction of the house.

442
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
He was in the second house.

443
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The village head said

444
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Liu Shuhai was living in the 203.

445
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What a coincidence.

446
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's right.

447
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
When we were single,

448
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
we were in love.

449
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
My uncle was also there.

450
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The police is already there.

451
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The police.

452
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Do you remember

453
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
when Liu Shuhai died,

454
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
he lost his skin?

455
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Professor Cang Chun said

456
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
that his skin was very expensive.

457
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
My uncle was also there.

458
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Liu Shuhai was in the big hole.

459
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He fell into the water.

460
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
He was not normal.

461
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Your uncle started to be weird

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
when he came back from the police.

463
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I think there's a problem.

464
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It seems like

465
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
a murder game.

466
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
One person died.

467
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The other person continued to be in charge.

468
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
He was in charge.

469
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Then the next one.

470
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The next one.

471
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Maybe someone in the dream

472
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
tried to control everything.

473
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He cut off the skin of the participant

474
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
as a memory of the contestant.

475
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Did you remember anything?

476
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What did you remember?

477
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The game ended.

478
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What do you mean?

479
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
When Liu Shuhai died,

480
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
my uncle took the next one

481
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
with him.

482
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
When my uncle died,

483
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
there was another person with him.

484
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Pingting?

485
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Excuse me.

486
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Please.

487
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Excuse me.

488
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Please.

489
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Excuse me.

490
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Please.

491
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Please.

492
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Please.

493
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Please.

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Please.

495
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Sister, you're back.

496
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
What are you doing?

497
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Nothing.

498
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
What?

499
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You're so bold.

500
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You're so selfish.

501
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No.

502
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Look at Tang Zeng.

503
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He's so stubborn.

504
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He doesn't need to be killed.

505
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
He doesn't even need to be picked.

506
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
He has a good disciple.

507
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Even if he wants to

508
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
be a good disciple,

509
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
you can't be so selfish.

510
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You just want to learn from him, right?

511
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Can I?

512
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
No.

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I have a master.

514
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He has to recognize you

515
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
for what I said.

516
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Sister,

517
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
what should we do?

518
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
We should meet again.

519
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I'll take a little bit of time.

520
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm a good disciple.

521
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You're a little bit too much.

522
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But my master

523
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
has been the most responsible person.

524
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
My senior brother,

525
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
do you know that?

526
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Senior brother?

527
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
He was confused

528
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and did something wrong.

529
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
He stole something

530
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
or something.

531
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
My master told me

532
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
to clean it up.

533
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He's so clever.

534
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
He's not well yet.

535
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
He's not well.

536
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
His arm and legs are broken.

537
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's like you're

538
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
practicing slowly.

539
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You're so thoughtful.

540
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Work hard.

541
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You're so angry.

542
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Brother Cao,

543
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
a smart person

544
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
should be able to see the situation.

545
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That martial arts

546
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
is like a threat.

547
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Even if you're a master

548
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and a bullet comes through,

549
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
you have to...

550
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Who's the one who's trained

551
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
to kill people?

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's the paper on the bed.

553
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Is it a poem?

554
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Fourth,

555
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I want to be a superstar.

556
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Brother Han,

557
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
you're still a superstar.

558
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You're the first one to make a mistake.

559
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Don't you have money?

560
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You're the one who's been a superstar.

561
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You...

562
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You're a loser.

563
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
You're a loser.

564
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
What are you doing?

565
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I want to be a superstar

566
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and have a dream.

567
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You still have a dream?

568
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Fine.

569
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I have a dream, too.

570
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Why do you ask me

571
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
what my dream is?

572
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
My dream is

573
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
to have a man

574
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
who is good at acting

575
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and who is gentle.

576
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
He's a man of nature.

577
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What do you mean?

578
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm a man of nature.

579
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm not a man of nature.

580
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Eat soft rice.

581
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Brother Cao,

582
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
why do you

583
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
have such a sharp tongue?

584
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's just that

585
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
you have a lot of money.

586
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So this is a dream.

587
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Just think about it.

588
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Fine.

589
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's talk about it, Brother Cao.

590
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You have a place to sleep,

591
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
you have a meal,

592
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
and you can live with it.

593
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
No, San San.

594
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Why are you so bad?

595
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You're young and young.

596
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
You lose your color in your eyes.

597
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I can't be like you.

598
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I have nothing to do with you.

599
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Tomorrow,

600
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll go out and work.

601
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
How about Kang Dabao?

602
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
He can't be ashamed of his food.

603
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I have to show him

604
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
my true colors.

605
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
By the way,

606
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
if one day,

607
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm going to be the fourth.

608
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Don't report me.

609
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
SOUP

610
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,060
DON'T

611
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,500
DON'T

612
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,000
I can't.

613
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
updated information

614
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I think we should start from the red mark.

615
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
I haven't slept yet.

616
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,820
S-Order me.

617
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,660
I'm sorry.

618
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,880
I didn't know that ...

619
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,200
nobody would persuade me in every way.

620
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,160
I herd up all youraking

621
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,580
as well.

622
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,700
You called me a boss.

623
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,160
Will he mess up?

624
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Luo Miao's death is a relief.

625
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,360
When Liu Shuai died,

626
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,160
Chen Chunjiao was in jail.

627
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
So much time.

628
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,960
He could do everything he could to escape.

629
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,160
He didn't leave any traces.

630
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
It's so scary.

631
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,160
It's like someone made it.

632
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
What's wrong?

633
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,960
It's because of that Li Yitang.

634
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,160
He's so mad.

635
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,560
How did he get into you?

636
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,360
You know, Li Yaqing.

637
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,560
He's a girl named Li Yitang.

638
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,160
He's been working for half a life.

639
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,560
He lost his job.

640
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,760
He's been working for a small business.

641
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,560
He told me he'd take that small business

642
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,360
and keep looking for the murderer.

643
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,760
Did he go crazy?

644
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,360
He told me he'd give you an explanation

645
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,760
before he left.

646
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,960
Isn't that funny?

647
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,760
He's just a joke.

648
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,560
He's just a joke.

649
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,360
You're too much.

650
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,960
How did Hongyi teach you?

651
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
To be rational.

652
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
That's someone's misfortune.

653
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,760
How could you talk to him like that?

654
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,960
I'm sorry, Hongyi.

655
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,560
I shouldn't say that.

656
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,560
But I have a question.

657
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Hongyi, do you remember that Luo Ren?

658
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
His uncle and sister.

659
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,360
They were both victims.

660
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360
You mean Luo Ren is also a victim?

661
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,160
And the murderer who killed his uncle

662
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,360
and the murderer 20 years ago.

663
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,560
So finding the murderer in the car is very important.

664
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,760
Hongyi, I can see that you know some things.

665
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,960
Can you tell me what happened

666
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,360
without hurting yourself?

667
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,160
Mu Dai, you're overthinking.

668
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,760
Hongyi really doesn't know anything.

669
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
If I knew,

670
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,560
I wouldn't have asked that bastard to go and fight.

671
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Okay, stop asking.

672
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
I'm...

673
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:13,760
What's the matter?

674
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,760
I was supposed to throw them out of the bathroom.

675
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,360
Stop pretending you saw them.

676
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
Can you give me the contact information?

677
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:12,360
Hello? I heard that Li Tan is here to practice.

678
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,360
I'm on the spot right now.

679
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,360
Why didn't you tell him the phone number?

680
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
Li Tan is in a bad mood.

681
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
It's better to talk face to face.

682
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,360
You know he's in a bad mood too.

683
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,360
I'm afraid that if you two haven't talked, you'll be beaten to death.

684
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Am I that bad?

685
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,360
Anyway, you two have to talk face to face to avoid misunderstanding.

686
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,360
If I didn't agree to come to the temple with him, I would have gone with you.

687
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,360
Don't worry. We just need to talk.

688
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,360
I'm also the host.

689
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,360
I'm hanging up. I'll practice later.

690
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Guเรา

691
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
Is that !!!

692
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,360
I forgot to inform you.

693
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
Mu Dai auch

694
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Aunt Hou, You've finished talking.

695
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
No need.

696
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
Uncle Lin.

697
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,360
Mu Dai

698
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
How come you are wearing trousers?

699
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,400
Where is the bullet?

700
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I found the murderer.

701
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,040
I'm dead.

702
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,160
This is the one.

703
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,000
But I found the knife.

704
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,080
I'm...

705
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,880
I'm in the ice.

706
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,680
Luo Ren.

707
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,400
It's not Uncle Li.

708
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,320
You're wrong.

709
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,080
Do you know where they are?

710
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,920
Luo Renjia.

711
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:53,800
Let's go.

712
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,040
Let's go.

713
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Don't come near me.

714
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,840
No.

715
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,320
No.

716
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,000
Get out.

717
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,240
Get out.

718
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,640
Uncle Li.

719
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,680
Don't you...

720
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,120
It has nothing to do with Luo Ren.

721
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,120
It has nothing to do with him.

722
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,080
I saw the murderer in person.

723
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,520
He's the murderer.

724
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
He lied to me.

725
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,240
He said his uncle controlled me.

726
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,680
Am I a child?

727
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
I'm a stone.

728
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,360
Uncle Li.

729
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,760
There's no answer.

730
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,240
Put down the lighter.

731
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,760
The murderer is guilty.

732
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,160
I'm alive.

733
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,040
22 years.

734
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,640
22 years.

735
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,200
I finally...

736
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,080
I finally can explain to Ya Qing.

737
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,760
Uncle Li.

738
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,520
Uncle Li.

739
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,200
Li Tan.

740
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,000
Li Tan.

741
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,640
Uncle.

742
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,360
Uncle.

743
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,040
I...

744
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,320
Li Tan.

745
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,720
Ya Qing.

746
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,120
Ya...

747
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,960
Ya Qing.

748
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,280
It's me.

749
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,720
No.

750
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,720
You're not.

751
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,440
You're Ya Qing's twin sister.

752
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,520
You all want to see me.

753
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,000
No.

754
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,520
I know.

755
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,040
I'm Ya Qing.

756
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
I'm Ya Qing.

757
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,120
I'm...

758
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,880
I'm not Ya Qing.

759
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,680
I'm...

760
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,040
You're not Ya Qing.

761
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,080
I'm not Ya Qing.

762
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,880
I'm just...

763
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,480
You forgot.

764
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,800
I'm not Ya Qing.

765
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,600
When we first met,

766
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,440
you had a tomato soup

767
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,160
in your room.

768
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,440
The tomato soup was perfect.

769
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,400
I said it shouldn't be like this.

770
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,600
The tomato soup should be scattered.

771
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,320
But you said

772
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,920
the tomato soup should be like this.

773
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,760
Did you forget?

774
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,120
You said you can't drink.

775
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,000
Right?

776
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,680
Do you remember?

777
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,040
I'm really Li Ya Qing.

778
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
You can't drink water today.

779
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,080
Here.

780
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,880
Okay.

781
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,560
Here, feel free to eat.

782
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,520
No.

783
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,000
Don't hold onto anything.

784
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,960
Don'tumueta...

785
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,600
You can't sleep inside.

786
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,480
I keep sleeping with you.

787
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,080
Don't go through this.

788
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,400
I'm just a nobleman.

789
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
You don't know how fizzy it is.

790
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Great fool.

791
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,200
You got caught.

792
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,360
We are liars.

793
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,200
What can this mean?

794
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,460
or be mine.

795
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,480
Oh, yeah.

796
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
I have something to tell you.

797
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Li Kai is really...

798
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,200
He said it all.

799
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
I'm so powerful.

800
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
I'm so powerful.

801
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Who are you?

802
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
I'm not that strong.

803
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I just want you to smell it.

804
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Just be that strong.

805
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,200
How can you two come back to lie to me?

806
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
It's not interesting enough.

807
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
I want to see you.

808
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Don't leave me.

809
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Let's go.

810
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Why do they want to see me?

811
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Artists are the best.

812
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
We are the best.

813
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Why do you come back to me?

814
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,200
I'm not telling you.

815
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Everything is true.

816
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
The effect is good.

817
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
It's too urgent, so I'm going to leave.

818
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
I couldn't sleep the last few days.

819
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,200
And I was thinking about this case.

820
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
I suddenly came up with an idea.

821
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
Tell me.

822
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Tell me.

823
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Could the tumor behind you be super-natural?

824
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Is this weird?

825
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Sorry.

826
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
After the water in the sea fell into the river,

827
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
the mood changed.

828
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
It was controlled.

829
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
Then it died in the small hotel.

830
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
And it controlled your uncle.

831
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
So you think

832
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
the current situation is over.

833
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Is this power controlled?

834
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
Yes.

835
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
So we should

836
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
find a big house to help.

837
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
What are you talking about?

838
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Can't you say it?

839
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
Come on.

840
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
You're going to drink my water now?

841
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
This time you're really poisoned.

842
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Actually, there are many things I should have told you.

843
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
But I didn't have a good chance.

844
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Litan.

845
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,200
You know that I was in a relationship with Zhang Guanghua.

846
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Because my dad didn't have a face.

847
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
So...

848
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
I just want to say

849
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
sorry.

850
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
It's my fault.

851
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
I'm sorry.

852
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Dad.

853
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Uncle.

854
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
What are you talking about?

855
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Uncle.

856
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
What's wrong?

857
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,200
What's wrong with you?

858
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,200
I'm not your father's father.

859
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
I'm not your father's father.

860
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Then what do you think?

861
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I think

862
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
you should go back to the hotel.

863
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Why?

864
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
I'm not your father's dad.

865
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
You don't want to go back to the hotel?

866
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
I don't want to go back to the hotel.

867
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,200
I don't want to go back to the hotel.

868
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
What's wrong?

869
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
Where are you going?

870
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
Uncle Li.

871
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
What's wrong?

872
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Aunt Hong.

873
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Uncle Li.

874
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:51,600
My orthogonal assessing grid

875
00:43:51,640 --> 00:44:03,760
Thisclub is supremely aligned

876
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
I'm sorry.

877
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
I'm sorry.

878
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
I'm sorry.

879
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,760
I'm sorry.

880
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
I'm sorry.

881
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
I'm sorry.

882
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
I'm sorry.

883
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
I'm sorry.

884
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
I'm sorry.

885
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
I'm sorry.

886
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
I'm sorry.

887
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
I'm sorry.

888
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,760
I'm sorry.

889
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,760
I'm sorry.

890
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,760
I'm sorry.

891
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
I'm sorry.

892
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,760
I'm sorry.

893
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,760
I'm sorry.

894
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,760
I'm sorry.

895
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,760
I'm sorry.

896
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
I'm sorry.

897
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
I'm sorry.

898
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,760
I'm sorry.

899
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
I'm sorry.

900
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
I'm sorry.

901
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
I'm sorry.

902
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,760
I'm sorry.

903
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,760
I'm sorry.

904
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
I'm sorry.

905
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
I'm sorry.

906
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,760
Sorry.

907
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,760
I'm sorry.

908
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,760
Excuse me.

909
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,760
No.

910
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,760
Sorry.

911
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,760
I'm sorry.

912
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
It's great.

913
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,760
Okay.

914
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,760
And I'm in the dark
