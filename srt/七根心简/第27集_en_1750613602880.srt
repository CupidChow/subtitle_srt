00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Uncle!

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Are you calling the ghost?

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I...

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Did you find anything?

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I didn't find anything.

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It looks like he jumped into the wall.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What did I say?

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He'll be back in half an hour.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Uncle.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's late.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Go to wash up and sleep.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Uncle.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's up?

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you think my buddy is a hunter?

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's a bit talented.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let me put it this way.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I've never seen anyone better than him.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I've never seen Brother Luo so anxious like today.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you think like that,

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
a opponent who can make him lose control

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
is definitely not a coward.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's pay attention to him.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you know about the black box?

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've played black box before.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've made some friends in the martial arts world.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have some stories.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll share them with you if I have a chance.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What about the hunting newspaper?

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hunting newspaper?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It sounds like a name.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It sounds like a late-term training.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't want to help you.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But the conditions are not allowed.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Tomorrow is the first day.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The fog will disappear.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll take you to the mountain.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
One more thing.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You can't enter my master's room.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Otherwise, I'll beat you.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Have a rest.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What the hell are you doing?

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Don't you want to be ashamed?

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't run away if you have the guts.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, no.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Uncle Zhang said

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
if Feng Feng calls again tonight,

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
he'll kill him.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's ridiculous.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Who is he?

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Uncle, Feng Feng.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're a cat.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're a cat.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're a cat.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're a cat.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're a cat.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're a cat.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're a cat.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're a cat.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're a cat.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You play cat and dog and learn how to make a nonusual chicken?

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't run away if you have the guts.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who?

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Look at this.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Rice?

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why there's a smell of wine?

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's called drunk rice,

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
specially mixed with bird feathers.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This stuff...

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
is not from any species.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why are there so many people taking about it?

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Feng Feng, is it okay, Feng Feng?

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Poor thing!

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Uncle Zhang.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,400
Uncle Zhang, don't scare us anymore.

78
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
Look at him. He's a good chicken.

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,080
He's not a chicken.

80
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,640
Right?

81
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,320
Good chicken.

82
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,720
When you see Cao Pangpang,

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
I'll praise you.

84
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,040
What a poor thing.

85
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,120
Brother Luo.

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,000
Uncle Luo.

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
What's wrong?

88
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,000
You lost me?

89
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,840
I don't understand.

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:58,240
My

91
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,920
relax.

92
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,800
Don't be so terrible.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:29,880
Master!

94
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,320
Wang!

95
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,200
Where are you going?

96
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Master!

97
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Brother Mo!

98
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Master!

99
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Master...

100
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Mudai...

101
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Where is Mudai?

102
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Mudai!

103
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Master!

104
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Mudai!

105
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Master!

106
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Mudai!

107
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Master!

108
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Mudai!

109
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
Master!

110
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Long time no see.

111
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Where is Mudai?

112
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
Sir, you don't want to catch him with your old friend?

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Just worry about your little sweetheart?

114
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Where is your Mudai?

115
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,200
She's fine.

116
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Just crying and cursing.

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
But don't worry. I have a good temper.

118
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I won't kill her with a single blow.

119
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,200
That would be no fun, right?

120
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,200
You killed Master, right?

121
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Oh!

122
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
That old lady looking for death?

123
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Well, she's so old and she doesn't have much time left anyway.

124
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
What do you want?

125
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
What do I want?

126
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Have you ever heard the saying,

127
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
a beautiful woman dies twice?

128
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
One is when her beauty fades,

129
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,200
and the other is when her life comes to an end.

130
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
No.

131
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
You took one of my eyes.

132
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
You've already killed me once.

133
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Where is she?

134
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I have no idea.

135
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Maybe I'll find out when we meet.

136
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Where is she?

137
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Your place is nice.

138
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Just across the street from your little angel's bar.

139
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
You do make a lot of boring weird friends.

140
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Why do you have a chicken?

141
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
You'd better get home now.

142
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
Because I don't like your chick.

143
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
She has sparkling eyes.

144
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Not like mine.

145
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
With a poor black hole.

146
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Let me answer the phone!

147
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Come on.

148
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,200
You are the last person in the world who gets to tell me what to do.

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
The person on the phone...

150
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
is called Lian Baobao.

151
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Is it Lian Baobao?

152
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Let's go.

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
To the west.

154
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
You two go first.

155
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I'll take care of the master and the rest.

156
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
I'll go find you.

157
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Lian Baobao

158
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Lian Baobao

159
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Luo

160
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
Luo Yuan, Lian Baobao is in the car.

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
The master he killed is also in the car.

162
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
Hello, 98.

163
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Something happened to the electrician.

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Don't worry.

165
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,200
The chicken almost got stolen last night.

166
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
What chicken?

167
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Is it my chicken?

168
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Who are they?

169
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Why are they with the chicken?

170
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
They are Lian Baobao's men.

171
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
They like to play psychological warfare.

172
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Luo Yuan, be careful.

173
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Hello?

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm here to investigate someone.

175
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Money is not a problem.

176
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
This person is not in China.

177
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I know your network.

178
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
You can find out where someone is.

179
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
The first point is the Black Mountain Island.

180
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
No one knows his name.

181
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
But if it's Lian Baobao, he will be destroyed before half a year.

182
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I want all his information.

183
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I want all three of them.

184
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
The more, the better.

185
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Add the chicken.

186
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
You mean Mu Da...

187
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Don't say it.

188
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Uncle Zhang and Hongyi can hear you.

189
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Luo Yuan.

190
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
So we will be in danger here.

191
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Yes.

192
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
So I told Hongyi to arrange a way in.

193
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
He was my partner in Black Mountain.

194
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
He is good at playing the game.

195
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
He can protect you.

196
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
And don't let Uncle Zhang and Hongyi go out.

197
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
I will be here.

198
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
There is a new sister.

199
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
What about Mu Da?

200
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I have to find a way.

201
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
Senior.

202
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I am on my way.

203
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I am on the road to the town.

204
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
He just told me that the master's case came out.

205
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Something is wrong.

206
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
What?

207
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
The master was not killed.

208
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
He was killed by someone.

209
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
The master was not killed.

210
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
He died naturally.

211
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
The body was broken.

212
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
He can't be the murderer.

213
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
What about the wound?

214
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I was too confused.

215
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I didn't check the amount of blood.

216
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Yes.

217
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
The amount of blood is not big.

218
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Didn't the master kill the hunter?

219
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
He didn't kill the hunter.

220
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
He must have killed the hunter.

221
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
We can't tell now.

222
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
We will talk when we get there.

223
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
With your permission.

224
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
OK.

225
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Let's go.

226
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
OK.

227
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Let's go.

228
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Let's go.

229
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
OK.

230
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Let's go.

231
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Let's go.

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Go.

233
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Go.

234
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Go.

235
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Go.

236
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Go.

237
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,540
Magic apples came to me Radix

238
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,320
have a unique friend

239
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,460
Though few people can do that

240
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,220
Is it possible

241
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,280
Where is your teacher?

242
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Teacher?

243
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
In...

244
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
A Wuzhai

245
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
There's someone out there

246
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm afraid we can't leave.

247
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,600
We can only fight.

248
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,040
Listen to me.

249
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,760
Don't hang up.

250
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,960
The person who sent the letter is a cruel man.

251
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
He's armed.

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,360
I can't do this.

253
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
I can't fight him.

254
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,640
Mudan.

255
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,320
Mudan!

256
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,600
Mudan.

257
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,800
Things have been very good. I will be thankful to you.

258
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,300
It was really foggy last night, and the mountain road was hard to navigate.

259
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,900
I couldn't find your little injury anywhere.

260
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,400
But you've been very cooperative and cleared the place.

261
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,800
Erie went out in a day. Impressive.

262
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
If you dare to touch her,

263
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,300
I will definitely kill you.

264
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,900
No.

265
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,500
I can't wait to see you.

266
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,200
Where's my master?

268
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,400
He's awake.

269
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,400
Master said that the mountains and rivers here

270
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,800
were created by a master a long time ago.

271
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
It formed a natural maze.

272
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,900
Follow the silver and silver bats and you won't go wrong.

273
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,400
Go in tonight and come out tomorrow night.

274
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Master, I and my master

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,500
will only be in the first door in this life.

276
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,900
Only the one who brings the key can open the second door.

277
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,600
If you don't get to wait in this life,

278
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,800
remember to take a good student

279
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,600
and open this door.

280
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,000
I will be waiting for you.

281
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Tell him.

282
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
Boss, you're buying oil?

283
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,800
Fresh red sesame oil.

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,800
Here you go.

285
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,600
Fresh red sesame oil.

286
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,400
Dad, some rice.

287
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,000
Wait a minute.

288
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,200
Come, come, come.

289
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,400
Take a look.

290
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
Take it.

291
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Take care.

292
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Come on.

293
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Fresh red sesame oil.

294
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
Okay, you want this?

295
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,600
Yes, yes, yes.

296
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,800
Come and have a look. These are all new.

297
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I know what you want to say.

298
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
Why don't you go home and eat?

299
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,400
Mom!

300
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm ready to go.

301
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,000
Okay.

302
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,800
Mom!

303
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
Mom!

304
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,400
Mom!

305
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
Mom!

306
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,200
Mom!

307
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,200
It's okay.

308
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,600
Hold me. I'll help you get out of the ambulance.

309
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
I'll help you.

310
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,200
Mom.

311
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,000
Who can help me get out of the ambulance?

312
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
Who can help me get out of the ambulance?

313
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,800
I'm begging you. Help me get out of the ambulance.

314
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,000
Thank you, thank you.

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,800
I said there's no ambulance.

316
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Director, hold on. The ambulance will be here soon.

317
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,400
Eunuch.

318
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,200
Mimi can die with me.

319
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,600
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

320
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,200
The war is over.

321
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,600
The key is still here.

322
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,000
The key is in the house.

323
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The house.

324
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,800
Eunuch Yi. Eunuch Yi.

325
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Eunuch Yi.

326
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
Eunuch Yi.

327
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,200
Why isn't the ambulance here yet?

328
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,600
It's okay. It's okay.

329
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,200
It's okay. It's okay.

330
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
It's okay. It's okay.

331
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Uncle! Uncle!

332
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Uncle, hold on!

333
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
Uncle!

334
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
He's still alive.

335
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
But we'll see if he can survive.

336
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Send him to the emergency room.

337
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
You can only sign in the emergency room.

338
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,600
Mr. Shen, I'll sign here.

339
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,800
Please help me pack my clothes.

340
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,200
Eunuch Yi's name was...

341
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,600
Eunuch Yin?

342
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,800
My father's name was indeed Eunuch Yin.

343
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,600
He didn't like it, so he had to change it.

344
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,000
What's the difference? It's just a number.

345
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Thank you. Thank you.

346
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,600
It's okay. It's okay.

347
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,800
He'll get better.

348
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,560
xa

349
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,800
Eunuch Yang

350
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:30,260
It's reporters age and f火.

351
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:38,680
Some more stern security equipment who are waiting for talk.

352
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,880
Grab all of your school teal.

353
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,180
Do not waste the ear.

354
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:52,940
All ofjesther's

355
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,620
They get super pissed off right,

356
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,740
but they still thing that cannot be solved.

357
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,940
But they're kinda famous.

358
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,080
But they're cre feasting themselves on their own.

359
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:13,100
Also, they kinda watch

360
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,300
sichers around and legiblera and stuff.

361
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:31,480
muffled phone ringing

362
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,300
I took a few photos and sent them to you.

363
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,300
We will continue to investigate the rest.

364
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,320
what

365
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,320
1

366
00:24:47,300 --> 00:25:04,540
Did you sleep well?

367
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,300
How did my master die?

368
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:29,300
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

369
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:34,300
It was longer until I killed him.

370
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
Come out.

371
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Come out.

372
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Come out.

373
00:26:47,300 --> 00:27:16,300
I heard you have some kind of mental problem.

374
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,300
You always cry when you're upset like a welfare girl.

375
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,300
Then your own home has to babysit you.

376
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Wait, are you going to cry now?

377
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Are you going to cry now?

378
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:52,300
What are you looking at?

379
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Look at your face clearly.

380
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
You're alive, but you don't let go.

381
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,300
You're dead, but you don't let go.

382
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:08,300
What a sharp tongue.

383
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Your master was a real fighter.

384
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Quite admirable, actually.

385
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,300
I've never seen anyone like her.

386
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Most people can't handle to take my hits that much.

387
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:32,300
What are you going to do now?

388
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Lord has been annoyingly screwing up my business and my money too.

389
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
I would love to work with him.

390
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,300
He makes money doing security work, so helping me out is just another job.

391
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,300
At the end of the day, he completely let me down.

392
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,300
He made me become what I look like right now.

393
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:10,300
So you're going to kill him?

394
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,300
Just kill him?

395
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
You're so naive.

396
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,300
It will only take a stab or a bullet, then he will be free.

397
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
But what about me?

398
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
Living like this for the future?

399
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Who the hell do I turn to if I want to win?

400
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Do you know why I'm called Lebo?

401
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,300
My dream is to have a cheater as my pet.

402
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,300
Oh, and every cheater trainer said the same.

403
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,300
That they can be tamed as a pet, but...

404
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,300
I don't believe it.

405
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,300
And then...

406
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Here, have a look.

407
00:29:54,300 --> 00:30:04,300
These are...

408
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,300
This is exactly how she repaid me.

409
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:14,300
But it's fine. I've put out her claws, teeth, cut her tongue, and had the vet operate on it to reshape the bones in her mouth.

410
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,300
You asked me what I want to do with Loren.

411
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,300
I don't want him dead at all.

412
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:30,300
I just want to pull out his claws and teeth and make him my most favorite pet dog.

413
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,300
He won't.

414
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,300
Really?

415
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,300
Now you don't know me well enough.

416
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,300
The only reason he's still breathing is because I let him.

417
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:52,300
He has no idea what a curse I'm holding in my hand.

418
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:38,300
I'm sorry.

419
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,300
I'm sorry.

420
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,300
I'm sorry.

421
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,300
I'm sorry.

422
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,300
I'm sorry.

423
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,300
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,300
I'm sorry.

425
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,300
I'm sorry.

426
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,300
I'm sorry.

427
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,300
I'm sorry.

428
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,300
Master, have some tea.

429
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,900
Хот

430
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,860
� out

431
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:30,860
this

432
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,900
He should be here soon.

433
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
We'll wait here.

434
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I think I'm the best fit for the job.

435
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,100
One case for one person.

436
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,300
Everyone, cooperate.

437
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Okay.

438
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,500
Liu Xiaoxiao is in touch.

439
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,700
How is it?

440
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,900
Not my ideal.

441
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,100
I have a favor to ask.

442
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,700
There might be something going on with the Lubao.

443
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,900
I want you to help me.

444
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
I'm listening.

445
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Why?

446
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,100
The Muda is in their hands.

447
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,100
I'm worried that I can't calm them down.

448
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
Luo.

449
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,700
You're not as ambitious as the Lubao.

450
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,300
From him, you have nine partners.

451
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,100
You lost so many times to your girlfriend.

452
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,100
But you won't admit it.

453
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,100
You're scared.

454
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,700
Okay.

455
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,100
I can promise you.

456
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:48,900
But I have something to tell you.

457
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,100
I went to Black Shark Fuchong this time

458
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,100
for my partner.

459
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,300
In my plan,

460
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,700
as long as the Lubao can die,

461
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,900
your girlfriend can die.

462
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,900
What did you say?

463
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
What?

464
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Is there a problem?

465
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,900
She's your girlfriend.

466
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,100
It has nothing to do with me.

467
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,300
You have to save her.

468
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,900
I'm not going to let you go.

469
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,100
I'm not going to let you go.

470
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,100
I'm not going to let you go.

471
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Save her.

472
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Okay.

473
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
I'll do it myself.

474
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,100
Okay.

475
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,900
As you said.

476
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,900
Interesting.

477
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,300
I've been ordered by others

478
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,300
since I was a kid.

479
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,100
Those who gave me orders

480
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,300
are all dead.

481
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Fang Fang.

482
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,700
I heard you were almost taken away.

483
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,700
I'm sorry I didn't get your permission

484
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,100
to put you in there.

485
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,900
You don't hate me, do you?

486
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,900
Sometimes I hate myself.

487
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,100
When I encounter many things,

488
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,300
I can't help at all.

489
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,900
I called Mu Dai last night.

490
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,100
He didn't answer my call.

491
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,300
I wonder how his master is doing.

492
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,300
I think he's helping his master.

493
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,100
The lady boss is his disciple.

494
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,300
Yes.

495
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,300
Let's keep him there for a few more days.

496
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,100
And help him to be filial.

497
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,700
Cao, you're not hungry?

498
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,900
Let's eat.

499
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,700
XIACHENGAN

500
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
There is no hint.

501
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,620
I cared about an潜《Dwokun》

502
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,100
internal demand thing.

503
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:16,740
Then he was arrested by One-Aak

504
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:20,060
in the T Minute WhereasChongyue Town...

505
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,340
Five people?

506
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,100
Yes.

507
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,300
There are five people in the cave of Cao's Village.

508
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,100
There are two holy temples.

509
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,540
I have a strong feeling that

510
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,460
the five people in the Rose Gate are the five people.

511
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,540
The group of hunters is really bad.

512
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,540
Maybe they are also after the star king.

513
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,420
Hey, if you go deeper,

514
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,340
you'll find the star king.

515
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,580
You're a gold digger.

516
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,700
Come back quickly.

517
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,300
Don't mess with me.

518
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,140
Maybe someone is like us.

519
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,380
From one place to another,

520
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,140
we can track down the star king.

521
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,540
Did they succeed?

522
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,420
But if they succeed,

523
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,940
we don't need to be the star king.

524
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,500
That's not necessarily true.

525
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,820
Maybe they succeeded.

526
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,100
Later, for some reason,

527
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,420
the star king fell again.

528
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,740
Even if they didn't succeed,

529
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,980
they must have gone further than us.

530
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,860
At least,

531
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,540
they have reached the sixth star king.

532
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,460
Hello?

533
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,180
Luo, don't hang up.

534
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,580
Act normal.

535
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,980
Walk out of the bar calmly

536
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,620
and don't let anyone notice anything.

537
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,900
Don't even try to wink or signal.

538
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,620
I'm watching you right now.

539
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,660
If you do anything stupid,

540
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,140
I'll give a step to a little and join you in return.

541
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,180
I'll go get the package.

542
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
Okay.

543
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,580
Don't wait for me to eat.

544
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,580
Say something.

545
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,700
Luo, it's time to meet.

546
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,980
I prepared a gift for you.

547
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,540
Where's the wooden bag?

548
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,940
I mean, all I want is to see you.

549
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,340
That's not too much to ask, isn't it?

550
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
Long time no see, Luo.

551
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,580
I asked your girl if there was

552
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,780
a memorable spot for you two around here.

553
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,980
And here we are.

554
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,340
Wooden bag.

555
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:30,940
Look around.

556
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,420
Wooden bag.

557
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,100
I just gave you the hint.

558
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,420
Must be easy for you, huh?

559
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,740
Hurry up.

560
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,100
The package.

561
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,900
Where is it?

562
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,880
Musical

563
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,140
ateur

564
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,300
in
