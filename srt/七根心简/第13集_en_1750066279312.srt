1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the first one.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the second one.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the third one.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Their power goes through her uh...

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
To be continued...

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We feel as the clumsy Minsk,

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:05,040
Film

10
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,520
Come on, come on, come on, this way.

11
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560
The motto...

12
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
...is Laoï¿½, LeiAndada

13
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,160
They are describing a ancient legend of our Lengquan Town.

14
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,160
It is said that in ancient times, the evil blood soldiers were in the sea.

15
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,160
Once the evil blood is obtained, it is over.

16
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,160
It is like a wind. It is everywhere to harm people.

17
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Fortunately, it has been unlawful since ancient times.

18
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,160
We are the great virtue of the world, Bo Yang Zi.

19
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,160
He heard that Bo Ran was angry with his own books.

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,160
He fought with the evil blood soldiers.

21
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Sorry.

22
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,160
In ancient times, the evil blood soldiers were made by Mu Jian, right?

23
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Yes, it is Mu Jian.

24
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Bo Yang Zi and the evil blood soldiers were moved to the warehouse.

25
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,160
In the storm and thunder, there were phoenix, yellow, and round birds.

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Three birds came to the human world.

27
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
They really have a spirit of sacrifice.

28
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:36,160
They made themselves a ring, and locked the spirits in it.

29
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,160
They made these evil blood soldiers to be forever sealed.

30
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
You are right.

31
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Let's go.

33
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Let's go.

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Let's go.

35
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Don't go.

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Come back, friends.

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Look at this.

38
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
Phoenix Bird.

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
It is our art.

40
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
It is called flying fish.

41
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,160
Flying fish is a good thing to do.

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
It is a big tiger.

43
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
Come on.

44
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
Take it back.

45
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,160
This is a good thing to do.

46
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,160
Love is good.

47
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Go home.

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Give your old man a warm-up.

49
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Go home and bless me.

50
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Forget it.

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Take it back.

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
I want to go home.

53
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,160
He has been out for so long, but he is not back.

54
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,160
Why are you afraid of him coming back?

55
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,160
I think the evil head is guilty.

56
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,160
He is guilty of his old man Yan.

57
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
It has nothing to do with us.

58
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
And he is good to us.

59
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
He didn't hurt us.

60
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
He is also good to us.

61
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,160
I think it is good.

62
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Good?

63
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Forget it.

64
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
It is not good for us to be hard.

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,160
We can only be good to others.

66
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Let's make some contributions.

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
San.

68
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,160
I am so proud of you.

69
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
You are really going to fall asleep.

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
You are so stubborn.

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
If I am a man, you can't escape.

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
I am back.

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,160
Remember.

74
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
Have a good dream.

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Here you are.

76
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
I am here.

77
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
Why are you standing here?

78
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
Go and swim.

79
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
What are you looking for?

80
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,160
I am here to enjoy the swim.

81
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Go.

82
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Go.

83
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
San.

84
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Brother Cao.

85
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
How is it?

86
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
It is good.

87
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
It is very good.

88
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
I am so lucky.

89
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
Really?

90
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
It is a literary girl.

91
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
Please.

92
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
A-er.

93
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
He is injured.

94
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
He is afraid of the evil head.

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
I am sorry.

96
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
I am sorry.

97
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
I am sorry.

98
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Don't panic.

99
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
What are you doing?

100
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
I am a lotus.

101
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
San.

102
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
San.

103
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
San.

104
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Come on.

105
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Guess what I heard.

106
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I heard it.

107
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
He is the one who ran away.

108
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
San.

109
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
You are so talented.

110
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
In the same situation,

111
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
you can escape so many information.

112
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,160
You two have common love.

113
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
He is very smart.

114
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
He can do it.

115
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
You can leave him alone.

116
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
This painting.

117
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
I want to play with it.

118
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
San.

119
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,160
This.

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
It is dead.

121
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
It is red sand or cloth.

122
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
No.

123
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
No.

124
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
No.

125
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Look carefully.

126
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Look.

127
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
There is a scene.

128
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
I think it is

129
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,160
the woman who Yan Laotong said.

130
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
San.

131
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
San.

132
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
San.

133
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
San.

134
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Are you still close to me?

135
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
I am a good person.

136
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Tell you a secret.

137
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
When I was little,

138
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
my mom didn't want me.

139
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
I don't even know who my dad is.

140
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
But look.

141
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I am doing well now.

142
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
I am doing well.

143
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
What a pity.

144
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
After you go back,

145
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,160
you can take good care of him.

146
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
If you want,

147
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,160
you can come to Lixi to be with us.

148
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
We can have a talk.

149
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Really?

150
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
I haven't found the man in the village.

151
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
Don't worry.

152
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
We will find him.

153
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
After we go back,

154
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,160
we will sell the house.

155
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
We can't find any one.

156
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
By the way,

157
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
use your dagger.

158
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
I want to know more about the sword with the hand.

159
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
I forgot to tell you today.

160
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
The dagger

161
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,160
was used to deal with the woman.

162
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
So it was left there.

163
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
But don't worry.

164
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
I will find it.

165
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Trust me.

166
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
After all, it's the gift you gave me.

167
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
I will take it.

168
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Brother Cao.

169
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
I didn't mean to say that.

170
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
You are so small.

171
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Can you see it?

172
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I have a hope.

173
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I went to the beach when I was a kid.

174
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
I even cut a floating bottle.

175
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
It was so big.

176
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
It was so small.

177
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
I cut it.

178
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
What's written inside?

179
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Who...

180
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Who cut it?

181
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
It's a big...

182
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
dirty painting.

183
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
I think they should hurry and save us.

184
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
As I observed,

185
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Yan and the woman have all kinds of blood.

186
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,160
They should be with Yan.

187
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Today's plan is to go to the underground school

188
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
to stop that woman.

189
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,160
First, bring Yan and the woman here.

190
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
That woman was shocked yesterday.

191
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Did she run away?

192
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
She didn't wear the clothes.

193
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
I ran away yesterday.

194
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
That woman

195
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
gave up the old school because of this.

196
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,160
We have a plan.

197
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
We have a branch.

198
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Today's wind is strong.

199
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,160
It's suitable for the fire.

200
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Red sandstone

201
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
is used to light the fire.

202
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
She saw that you were the only one

203
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
who was on the ground

204
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
and was attacking.

205
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
I was guarding the dark place.

206
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
I waited for her to attack.

207
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
I went with you to the river.

208
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
She retreated.

209
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I took her to the underground school

210
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
to get out of the town.

211
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
What's going on?

212
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Why is there smoke?

213
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
No one's here.

214
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
No one's here.

215
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
She's not at home, is she?

216
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Or

217
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
she's not afraid of Yan Xun.

218
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
I think she's hiding in the deepest part of the city.

219
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Let's go in and have a look.

220
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
You guys go in and investigate the situation.

221
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
I'm guarding the cave.

222
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Someone came to attack us.

223
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Mudan, tell me if you have any situation.

224
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
Did you hear that?

225
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
What did you say?

226
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Tell Lu Ren?

227
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
I didn't tell him.

228
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
The one who was attacking

229
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
is my master.

230
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
You go in and look for him.

231
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
She seems to be weakened by Xun.

232
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Really?

233
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
I'm back.

234
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
Here.

235
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Give it to me.

236
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Yes.

237
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Good to see you.

238
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
What's this?

239
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
It's a piece of cake.

240
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
What's this?

241
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
It's a piece of cake.

242
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
What's this?

243
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
What's this?

244
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
It seems that the woman we saw before

245
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
was made by this woman.

246
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
She's made by the eye.

247
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
She's so clever.

248
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,160
She should have been a good person.

249
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Put your ears up.

250
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Is she watching the movie?

251
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Yes.

252
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
She's in a special way.

253
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
Where did she go?

254
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Really?

255
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I see.

256
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
The people in the village

257
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,160
are here to save us.

258
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
They're cooking.

259
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
It's not that big.

260
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
Lu Ren.

261
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Lu Ren.

262
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Lu Ren is here to save us.

263
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I didn't move.

264
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
I haven't seen the eye.

265
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

266
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,160
But you should have heard me.

267
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
We have two friends who are in the village.

268
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
If we can bring them back,

269
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
we can let them go.

270
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Should we?

271
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Should we make a fire?

272
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Let's make a fire.

273
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Let's make a fire.

274
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
Let's go.

275
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I'm going to open the door.

276
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
What are you doing?

277
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
San San, don't let him go.

278
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
San San, don't hurt me.

279
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,160
San San, I want to live like San Chang Ling.

280
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,160
I want you to live.

281
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
San San,

282
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
San San,

283
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,040
Ð¾Ñ

284
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,720
Mo Zou

285
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,680
Help

286
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
The fire is on.

287
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
It's a good sign.

288
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Help!

289
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Did you forget the fire?

290
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
Help!

291
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Help!

292
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,160
We're here. I'll go check.

293
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
You go help. I'll watch over here.

294
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Okay.

295
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Be careful.

296
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Help!

297
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Help!

298
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
I'm here.

299
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Help!

300
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Don't run!

301
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Help!

302
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Help!

303
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Help!

304
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Help!

305
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,160
No wonder they couldn't find you.

306
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
They can go up to the wooden house.

307
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
That's okay.

308
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,160
What's wrong with my master?

309
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,160
What's wrong?

310
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,160
What's wrong?

311
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
I'll go help.

312
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Master!

313
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
Hurry up.

314
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Master!

315
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Master!

316
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Master, hurry up.

317
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Put your things in.

318
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Master.

319
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Come on.

320
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
What's wrong?

321
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
I want to ask you something.

322
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
What happened?

323
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,160
He attacked me after I left.

324
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
Then...

325
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
It's okay.

326
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Be careful.

327
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Wait.

328
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
I'm right.

329
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,160
The tiger's tail was from your family.

330
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,160
I missed something.

331
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
I think...

332
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Xinjian is in the police.

333
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Do you remember the illusion?

334
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,160
I guess it's the previous owner of Xinjian.

335
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,160
When she was killed by the police,

336
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Xinjian chose her as the new owner.

337
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,160
She helped her recover the wound and let her face the consequences.

338
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
But...

339
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,160
In this process, the tiger's tail is soft.

340
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,160
The tiger's tail, Xinjian,

341
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,160
some blood-sucking organizations are all together.

342
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Maybe you don't know what happened.

343
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,160
She just thinks that the tiger's tail is a precious treasure.

344
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
So...

345
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
she gave birth to this child.

346
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,160
It's not good.

347
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
What's not good?

348
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,160
The wild man was so vicious at first.

349
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
But...

350
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
I've met him with him.

351
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
He's not that bad.

352
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
He's kind to us.

353
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
Then, did he treat her?

354
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
He was the one who took the tiger's tail.

355
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
He must have been affected by Xinjian.

356
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
Then, the tiger's tail was removed.

357
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
He's back to his original nature.

358
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Xinjian and the woman are not completely controlled.

359
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,160
They're like a kind of cooperation.

360
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Xinjian is dead for the woman.

361
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,160
And the woman is going to avenge the killer in a way that Xinjian has lost.

362
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
Anyway, we've settled the case.

363
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
The time is tight.

364
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
The new order is over.

365
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Give her to me.

366
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Then, should we deal with this first?

367
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
I'm sorry.

368
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
I'm sorry.

369
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
Let's go, Mudan.

370
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
No.

371
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
I can't just sit here.

372
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
I have to do something.

373
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Wait.

374
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Where's he?

375
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Where's he?

376
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Where's he?

377
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Where's he?

378
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Kill him.

379
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Kill him.

380
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
I'll kill you.

381
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Kill him.

382
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
No.

383
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,160
I can't take this for granted.

384
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
If I can't,

385
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
I'll die.

386
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,160
It's not worth it.

387
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
No.

388
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Where is he?

389
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
No.

390
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
No.

391
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
He's still alive?

392
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
13,000.

393
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
What if he's still inside?

394
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Yes.

395
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Lu Ren, give me the rope.

396
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
I'll go upstairs.

397
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Yes, be careful.

398
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
OK?

399
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Don't worry. I'll be there.

400
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
I'll go upstairs.

401
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
What are you doing here?

402
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
So handsome.

403
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
Nobody's here?

404
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
How's it going?

405
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,160
I've checked inside.

406
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,160
But there's blood.

407
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
I think it's a wild animal.

408
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,920
You said the wild man transferred 13,000.

409
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,400
This time he did it.

410
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,600
It's so big.

411
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,240
I have to find the horse moon.

412
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,000
What?

413
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,200
505.

414
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,280
SOS.

415
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,320
I threw up the hope stone from the top.

416
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,000
I was happy at that time.

417
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,600
I didn't expect I could find it.

418
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,840
What does this mean?

419
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,120
As long as the fate is right,

420
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,680
we can find it.

421
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,160
We can find it in the middle of the night.

422
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,320
We'll go down the mountain.

423
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,080
What does it mean?

424
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,640
Brother Luo,

425
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,360
we can't just leave without finding the new one.

426
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,080
We can live together.

427
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,400
I don't want to leave the middle of the night.

428
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,680
Now we're done with the dry land and the water.

429
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,560
The more we get,

430
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,880
the longer the energy will be.

431
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,440
We'll come back after we finish.

432
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,280
Master,

433
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,520
you know each other the longest.

434
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,640
What do you say?

435
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,120
I suggest we go down the mountain.

436
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,440
Because it's not just one eye.

437
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
No way.

438
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
We've been together for days.

439
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,960
We've been together for a long time.

440
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,160
No way.

441
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,640
Did you see the mural?

442
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,240
Yes.

443
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,560
Where's the mural on the top?

444
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,160
I saw a lot of people

445
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,480
in the cave.

446
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,400
Two of them were dead.

447
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,360
I thought it was the eyes and the woman.

448
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,600
You mean

449
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,000
it's a woman and two children?

450
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,480
Yes.

451
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,120
Then why didn't

452
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,520
one of them appear?

453
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,240
The woman didn't appear.

454
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,560
It doesn't mean she doesn't exist.

455
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,080
Wenpeng,

456
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,400
we've agreed to leave the middle of the night.

457
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,440
We'll come back after we finish.

458
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
We can't find the last night.

459
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,280
We can't leave, okay?

460
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:20,960
Let's go.

461
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,480
Let's go.

462
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,240
Why are you calling him?

463
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,440
Maybeâ¦

464
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:19,800
Don't know if it's filling it.

465
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,000
Be careful.

466
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,320
Watch it.

467
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,100
Madam Wang,

468
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,400
it looks like the boss is going toï¿½ on you.

469
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,460
Wait a little while.

470
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,920
Wait a while.

471
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,520
Ah!

472
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,060
I'll be back after that.

473
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,700
I'm going to force myself,

474
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,200
hold on tight

475
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,160
and I'llæke this for him into you.

476
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,960
Wait a moment.

477
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,840
I promise.

478
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
What?

479
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
Luo!

480
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Jiang Zha!

481
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I finally found you!

482
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
You didn't get any orders, right?

483
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Why are you here?

484
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Jiang Zha asked me to come.

485
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,040
He said you left,

486
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
he was afraid you would be lost in the mountains.

487
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
And then I saw this bag,

488
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
so I came looking for it.

489
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
You...

490
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
You...

491
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
You came with us, big brother!

492
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
Yes.

493
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
We saved him.

494
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
We killed the wild man.

495
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Jiang Zha!

496
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Okay.

497
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
Let's go back and find Jiang Zha.

498
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
You guys are so smart!

499
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,640
It's okay.

500
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
Let's go.

501
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
Be safe.

502
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Luo, let me tell you.

503
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
I'm so scared of the wild man.

504
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
The wild man has gone into the village.

505
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
He came back from the village,

506
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
and he wanted to catch him.

507
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
I also met this wild man at the first time.

508
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
He wanted to steal the rare,

509
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,640
and I was so happy.

510
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
I pulled up a rope,

511
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
and I was like,

512
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
and I was like,

513
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
these villagers are all together.

514
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,240
Because we used to be the old wild man,

515
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,240
we were afraid of the wild man,

516
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
and the bear.

517
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
We were afraid of the wild man,

518
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
and we were not afraid of him at all.

519
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,240
One hundred and thirty-three!

520
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Three minutes!

521
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
You are so smart!

522
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
You are so smart!

523
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Let me try.

524
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,240
He really came back from the village.

525
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
I'm not dead.

526
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
You are so smart!

527
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
You are not dead!

528
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
What's going on?

529
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
You are still alive?

530
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Why are you taking me for a good man?

531
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,240
How did you escape?

532
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
I heard from the police that

533
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
someone was chasing you into the village.

534
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Jiang Zhaiguo was scared away.

535
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
He was always in a coma after the accident.

536
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
But I think it's okay that nothing big happened.

537
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
It's okay to be in a coma.

538
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
The tiger has gone into the village.

539
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
Come and see.

540
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
The dinosaur has gone into the village.

541
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
I'll go and see.

542
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
One hundred and thirty-three!

543
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
The mountain is so high.

544
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,840
How did you get down?

545
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
I... I was...

546
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I wanted to run away from the dead.

547
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,840
But I didn't expect him to take me to the village.

548
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Your father was in a coma,

549
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
but he should be comical.

550
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,340
You're likely to have been objectives here,

551
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,840
so you could have beenÐ»ÑÐµÑÑÑ.

552
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,200
You're likely to have been

553
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
with Ð²ÑÐµ the ritualsuni to the village,.

554
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,440
The villagers wanted to see you

555
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,440
not because of your wife.

556
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,440
They told me you were going to send to the village

557
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
The dog is here.

558
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,440
The dog is here.

559
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,440
The dog is here.

560
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
It's a big evening.

561
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
The dog is here.

562
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,440
Zhang Guo.

563
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Zhang Guo.

564
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
You're back.

565
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
I'll take them here.

566
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Maybe I did too well.

567
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,440
I found something wrong.

568
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,440
So someone came out to save you in the window?

569
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
He won't die without me.

570
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,440
