00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Good, good, good.

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is a very good looking model.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Brother Yin, turn around.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Turn around, yes, yes, yes.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is our famous star-gazing fan.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Brother Yin, Brother Yin,

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
please introduce it to everyone.

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is our star-gazing platform.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a big piece of stone.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What is the name of the rock?

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What is the rock outside the sky?

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The flying rock outside the sky.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The flying rock outside the sky.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a very rare big piece of stone.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's called the meteorite.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And then here is our

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
rock eye.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Inside this

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
can reflect the stars in the sky.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's take a look.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Brother Yin, you have to keep smiling.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why are you so serious?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Six.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Brother Yin.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Brother Yin.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Sister, you're here.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
How is Master?

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He's asleep.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't worry, he's fine.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I told him you'd be here soon.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He said he wouldn't wait for you.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How can I wait for someone younger?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's okay.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll just make a cup of tea tomorrow morning.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Brother, you changed your style.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What style?

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I haven't washed my hair for days.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's all wrapped up.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why do I keep thinking about it?

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're pretty good.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who is this?

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm a student.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We've met before.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You probably don't remember me.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm Cao Yanhua.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're my uncle.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll be your little friend in the future.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know my uncle?

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What kind of student are you?

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You need to be smart.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is it up to you?

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll read every word first,

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
then multiplication, Then multiplication, then multiplication.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How can you How can you write them?

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm a hard ball player.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Who is this?

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm not a friend.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,220
Please go ahead.

62
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,220
Lower your Dayo villain snapped.

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,960
Won't go wrong.

64
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,720
Better than 40 million believe it in.

65
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,840
It will be covenant of deeds.

66
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
I'm not going in.

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,840
I can go in if you want.

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Let's see if you have the ability.

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Come on.

70
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,840
Take this bowl as my temple.

71
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
I'll let you in.

72
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
This...

73
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Not good.

74
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,840
I haven't eaten much yet.

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
It's a bit dirty.

76
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,840
Is it a good one?

77
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
What do you think?

78
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I can't hold it anymore.

79
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
What other moves do you have?

80
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,840
I'll use them all.

81
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
Don't hide it.

82
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I won't be polite then.

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Master Tai, you're here.

84
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Master Tai, you're here.

85
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Master Tai, you're here.

86
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Master Tai, you're here.

87
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Master Tai, you're here.

88
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I didn't flip the bowl yet.

89
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
The winner is decided.

90
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
I'll give you a piece of my shoulder.

91
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,840
Next one.

92
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
Senior,

93
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
it's your first time here.

94
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
How can you flip the bowl?

95
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Senior, have a meal.

96
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
I'm polite.

97
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
I'm well-behaved.

98
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
I'm polite.

99
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,840
What do you mean?

100
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Are you kidding me?

101
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Why don't you take the martial arts exam?

102
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Why are you so polite?

103
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
You're bullying me.

104
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
Come on.

105
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Tonight,

106
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
you two live in this room.

107
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,840
Find the quilt yourself.

108
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
It should be in the cabinet.

109
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
If you can't find it,

110
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
just sleep in it.

111
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
The same as before.

112
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
I'll sleep in the room.

113
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Where should I sleep?

114
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
You can sleep in the same bed.

115
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
There's another bed in the room.

116
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Let's go.

117
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
You're giving me a quilt?

118
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Women are not good at keeping things.

119
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
I'm not as good as this bowl of wine.

120
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Urys!

121
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
What's wrong?

122
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
What's wrong, Luo Xiaodong?

123
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,840
I dreamed of Urys.

124
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
The treasure is in the cabinet.

125
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
She came to seek revenge on me.

126
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Are you scared?

127
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
The treasure.

128
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
I lost to Gui Liebao twice.

129
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
He took away the most important person of mine.

130
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,840
I saw him kill them.

131
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,840
I had no other choice.

132
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,840
I felt like I couldn't do anything.

133
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
I was afraid before I saw him.

134
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
He was my new dream.

135
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I had a new dream too.

136
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Since it's a new dream, I'll break it.

137
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
I have a message for you.

138
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Take the journey of the new dream.

139
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Take a walk.

140
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
I'll accompany you.

141
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
I'll take you to the new dream.

142
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I'll take you to the new dream.

143
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Master, tea.

144
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Master, tea.

145
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Get up.

146
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,840
You're so tired from kneeling.

147
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
I'm nervous.

148
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
I'm nervous too.

149
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Master, do you miss me?

150
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
If you miss me, I'll miss you.

151
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,840
If you don't miss me, I don't have time to miss you.

152
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
I heard that you're going to be a good friend.

153
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm going to be a good friend.

154
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
I'm going to be a good friend.

155
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
I'm going to be a good friend.

156
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
I'm going to be a good friend.

157
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I heard that you brought me a grandson this time.

158
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Who is he?

159
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Greetings, Master Tai.

160
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Greetings, Master Tai.

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,840
I don't have such a big gift here.

162
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
His name is Cao Yanhua.

163
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,840
I took him as my apprentice.

164
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
But if you think it's not appropriate,

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
then forget it.

166
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
What's the good of him?

167
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,840
He is very kind and cute.

168
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
He is also able to change.

169
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
He is very kind and cute.

170
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
He is also able to change.

171
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
He is very kind and cute.

172
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,840
He is very good at doing things.

173
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Have you ever done anything in your life that hurts people?

174
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Say it.

175
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,840
I stole something in Wujiang.

176
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
I can't hide this from you.

177
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I know that the most hateful thing in your life is stealing.

178
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,840
My uncle was so embarrassed that he let you cut his legs because he stole something.

179
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
No one is embarrassed.

180
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,840
I think it's time to do this.

181
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
This is for our own good.

182
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,840
This is how we can learn to be a good person.

183
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm tired.

184
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,840
I believe that one day I can stand up again like my uncle.

185
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,840
You should know that.

186
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,840
You should call the railway department.

187
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
If you come, I will be the one who will be hit by a train.

188
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,840
I will save the lives of the people.

189
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Times are different now.

190
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I can't help learning to be a good person.

191
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Why do you want to learn martial arts?

192
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
I want to be a star.

193
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Justice.

194
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Justice.

195
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
I have a dream.

196
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,840
After I become famous, I can promote martial arts.

197
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,840
I can give money to people who need help.

198
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I have this dream since I was a child.

199
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,840
I have been dreaming about it since I was a child.

200
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
I met my master.

201
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,840
I think this is the way people talk.

202
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
That's what I mean.

203
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,840
It's like my master was sent by God to protect me.

204
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Come here.

205
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
It's my fault.

206
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
You didn't teach me any martial arts.

207
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Why don't you know the basic moves?

208
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Master, I was too busy these days.

209
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
I was neglected.

210
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,840
You can neglect when you are busy.

211
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
Did you neglect to eat and sleep?

212
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,840
As a master, you should be responsible.

213
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
The world is in your hands.

214
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
The fifth place is in your hands.

215
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
People call you master.

216
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,840
Do you think it's a joke?

217
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Master, actually my master taught me.

218
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,840
It's my lazy, not doing any private work.

219
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
And I'm busy.

220
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,840
I opened a restaurant and I'm busy.

221
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
You are right.

222
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
You know how to protect your master.

223
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Get up.

224
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
Who is this?

225
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Master, my name is Lou Ren.

226
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,840
He said I was a little bit busy.

227
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
Boyfriend.

228
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
What's the benefit of him?

229
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
He...

230
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
He has no benefit.

231
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
He just...

232
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
He just likes me.

233
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,840
If he has no benefit, what's the point?

234
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Master, you are embarrassing me.

235
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Tell me.

237
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,840
What's the benefit of our wood?

238
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,840
It seems nothing bad.

239
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Go.

240
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Go.

241
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
You are a good match.

242
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
It's not easy.

243
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
You are really good.

244
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
You asked me so many questions.

245
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
I just need to ask you one question.

246
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Do you really think I'm over?

247
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
No.

248
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Your brother told me that you brought a boyfriend back.

249
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
I didn't believe it.

250
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Eight years later,

251
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
the little girl grew up.

252
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Master, you have to be fine.

253
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,840
I have to be filial to you for many years.

254
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
It's not easy to live and die.

255
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Don't be sad.

256
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Everyone is an island in the sea.

257
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
There are islands that keep growing and sinking.

258
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
You are just younger than me.

259
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I'm just sinking before you.

260
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Master, don't you like Luo Ren?

261
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
If I don't like him, will you break up with him?

262
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
He may be a good man.

263
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,840
I know you brought him here to let me take over.

264
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,840
But I don't have time to know if he likes him.

265
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Instead of looking forward to Luo Ren,

266
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
I should look forward to you.

267
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Look forward to me?

268
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Look forward to me for what?

269
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
In the past, when daughters got married,

270
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,840
mothers had to say a lot of things.

271
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm old.

272
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,840
If you get married, you won't be able to catch up.

273
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
It's good that you brought him here.

274
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,840
I can tell you a lot of things.

275
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
I don't know Luo Ren.

276
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
I don't like him either.

277
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,840
In the eyes of your senior and I,

278
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,840
his background is much more complicated than yours.

279
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,840
In the future, you may marry Luo Ren.

280
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,840
You may marry another man.

281
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
But no matter how good that man is,

282
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,840
don't marry him.

283
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Be yourself at any time.

284
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
You are a wooden belt first.

285
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Then you are the disciple of my Meihua Jiu Niang

286
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
and the lover of others.

287
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
You have to turn yourself upside down

288
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
to have the wind to call you.

289
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,840
You have to turn yourself upside down

290
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,840
to have the wind to call you.

291
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,840
If you like him, you will be with him.

292
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,840
If one day you find out that you married the wrong person,

293
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,840
you will leave him and find another man.

294
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
As the old saying goes,

295
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
if a woman is afraid of marrying the wrong man,

296
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,840
it's all nonsense.

297
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
If you marry the wrong person, you will separate.

298
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Find your own love.

299
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
There is nothing to be afraid of.

300
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
If he bullies you,

301
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840
you will be happy.

302
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
If he bullies you,

303
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
you will be happy.

304
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
If he bullies you, you will be happy.

305
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
If you can't defeat him,

306
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,840
you will call your senior fellow disciple.

307
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I have said so much.

308
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
I'm tired.

309
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Come to my room after dinner.

310
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,840
I'll talk to you about the inheritance.

311
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,460
I'll check first.

312
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,260
Be patient.

313
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:53,740
I'm sorry to disappoint.

314
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,560
You are welcome.

315
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Come in.

316
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm sorry to disappoint.

317
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,540
Mm Hm.

318
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,200
I happier.

319
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,200
How many times have you been to a place called Xiahe Town?

320
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
How many months have you been there?

321
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Xiahe Town?

322
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
What do you mean by Xiahe Town?

323
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
I'm not sure.

324
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
It's not a big town.

325
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
The biggest thing that happened was a murder.

326
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
It wasn't them.

327
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
The killer ran away.

328
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
What else happened?

329
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
And…

330
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Wait!

331
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Wait!

332
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Wait!

333
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Wait!

334
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
What are you doing?

335
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Don't do this!

336
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Don't do this!

337
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm the owner of this place!

338
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
And what kind of friend did you make?

339
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Friend?

340
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
You're always around a chicken.

341
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
You'll be eaten by it sooner or later.

342
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Uncle Zhang, it's just a chicken.

343
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Don't be so mean.

344
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
I've been calling it all night.

345
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
I'll set a rule for it.

346
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Stop!

347
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Do you know what this is?

348
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I know.

349
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
This is a knife.

350
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
It's its neck.

351
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
I'll cut it and it'll be on its legs.

352
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Yes.

353
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Do you know?

354
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
I know.

355
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I'll let it nod its head.

356
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Nod its head.

357
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I know.

358
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I know.

359
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
I know.

360
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Don't call it again tonight.

361
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
If you call it again, I'll cut it.

362
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I'll do whatever I say.

363
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Don't worry.

364
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I won't let it call again.

365
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
If it calls again, you'll cut me.

366
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
I'll do it.

367
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
I'll do it.

368
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
It's so annoying.

369
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
It's almost like a chicken.

370
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
It's so annoying.

371
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Brother Ying,

372
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
look at this.

373
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Doesn't it look like a star?

374
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
When it grows up, it's...

375
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
It grows like this.

376
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
It grows like this.

377
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
It still grows like this.

378
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I see.

379
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I can see it.

380
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
You're not a person who can lie.

381
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Your ancestors

382
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
didn't just invite Mr. De to dinner.

383
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
It's that simple.

384
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
You care about him every day.

385
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
It's not just a hobby.

386
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Who said that?

387
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
What I said

388
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
is all true.

389
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
From a scientific point of view,

390
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,200
when you were talking,

391
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
your eyes were flashing.

392
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Your voice was loud and quiet.

393
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,200
You were shaking your head.

394
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
It means you're lying.

395
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Fine.

396
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
You have culture.

397
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
You know everything.

398
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Is that okay?

399
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
Brother Ying.

400
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Brother Ying.

401
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,200
We're related by eating and sleeping.

402
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Tell me.

403
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Where did this new test come from?

404
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
That old tree

405
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
and phoenix cage.

406
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Where is it?

407
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I don't know.

408
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
It's already six stars.

409
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
When will it be the seventh star?

410
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
What will happen to us?

411
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
What can we do?

412
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
Menggui.

413
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
You can't tell me.

414
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Don't make it hard for me.

415
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,200
You know it.

416
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
You're not good.

417
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
Old Ying.

418
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
You're hurting me.

419
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
That means

420
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
he knows a lot of things.

421
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
You're right.

422
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
I'm not good at it.

423
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
There's something wrong.

424
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Ying is a teacher.

425
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
She doesn't tell you anything.

426
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,200
I believe she has her reasons.

427
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
What should we do?

428
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
We should do it slowly.

429
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
She's a good speaker.

430
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
She's a good speaker.

431
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
We can find out more.

432
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
We can find out more.

433
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
Have you prepared the map?

434
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Wait.

435
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Okay.

436
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,200
I was studying the map.

437
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I saw a flash of light.

438
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
You can mark the location

439
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
of the small and upper rivers,

440
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
the village,

441
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
the mountains, the south,

442
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
and the village.

443
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Look.

444
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Okay.

445
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Did you see it?

446
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Five points.

447
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Compare the maps.

448
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
What's wrong with the star?

449
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
The star?

450
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
Let's go.

451
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
This shape

452
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
is the location

453
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
of the star on the map.

454
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
We found the light

455
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
and the location of the stars.

456
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
They're not the same.

457
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
They're exactly the same.

458
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
So,

459
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
if we follow the star's prediction,

460
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
we can find out

461
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
the location of the stars.

462
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Look at the map.

463
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Find the river,

464
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
the east and the south.

465
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Mark it.

466
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
According to the ratio,

467
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
the sixth star

468
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
is there.

469
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
The star was bright before.

470
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
It suddenly went out.

471
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
It's bright again.

472
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
It's very strange.

473
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
The location of the seventh star

474
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
is the map of the first lake.

475
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I don't need to teach you.

476
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
The stars in the map

477
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
are in the map.

478
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
They went to a place called

479
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Xiacheng Town.

480
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Is there anything special about it?

481
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Qing contacted me just now.

482
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
He said that a hunter

483
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
went there a year and a half ago.

484
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
He was active for a long time.

485
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
A year and a half ago,

486
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
there were six stars in the star.

487
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
But suddenly there were five.

488
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
I went to find the hunter to avenge.

489
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,200
He was shot so many times

490
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
and his eyes were broken.

491
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
We all thought he was dead.

492
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,200
But he's in the mirror now.

493
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
And just before he entered the mirror,

494
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
he saw the six stars.

495
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
That means the sixth star

496
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
was brought to the black sand a year ago.

497
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Now it's back with the hunter.

498
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
The house is so beautiful.

499
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Our family

500
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
is really a place of gods.

501
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
This house

502
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
feels like

503
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
something is hidden inside.

504
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
It's like a log.

505
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Sometimes, people are too pessimistic.

506
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Look at me.

507
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
I'm nothing.

508
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
But there must be a way to the mountain.

509
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
My master took me as his disciple.

510
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Then I started to worry

511
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
if I could get into the master's magic eye.

512
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
I've been through

513
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
the test of the master.

514
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,200
By the way,

515
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,200
I have to

516
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
make a bed with my master.

517
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
A bed?

518
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm not sure.

519
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,200
I used to be his disciple.

520
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
But now

521
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:11,260
I don't have to care about the

522
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,260
You said this can't be

523
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,260
a test of the master.

524
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
I'm wrong.

525
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,260
I can't sleep.

526
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,260
I'm not wearing the plum blossom-themed disciple.

527
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,260
I'm sorry.

528
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,260
Actually,

529
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,260
I've been hesitating

530
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,260
whether I should give this to you.

531
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,260
After all, you're carrying

532
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
a secret that doesn't belong to you.

533
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,260
It's my master who died.

534
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,260
But I promised my master

535
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
to pass on this secret.

536
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,260
And now

537
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
the big problem

538
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,260
is only you.

539
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Master, don't do this.

540
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,260
You taught me martial arts and

541
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,260
I'm not afraid of anything.

542
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,260
But please don't

543
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,260
be so selfish.

544
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,260
I can't stand it.

545
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,260
Actually,

546
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
there's nothing to talk about.

547
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,260
But if there's only one person left,

548
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,260
you should do what you should do.

549
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,260
You should take responsibility.

550
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,260
From now on,

551
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,260
you should be careful.

552
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Even if you're his disciple,

553
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,260
you should keep the secret

554
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
that belongs to you.

555
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Even if you can't live,

556
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,260
you should live

557
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,260
for your responsibility.

558
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,260
Can you do that?

559
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Yes.

560
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Our sect is called the plum blossom sect.

561
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,260
The founder of the sect

562
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,260
is called the plum blossom god.

563
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,260
The plum blossom god?

564
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
The plum blossom god?

565
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Master,

566
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,260
is our name passed down

567
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,260
by generations?

568
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,260
Should I be called the plum blossom god?

569
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
If you want to be called the plum blossom god,

570
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,260
I won't stop you.

571
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,260
Let's get down to business.

572
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
Later,

573
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
the founder of the sect

574
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
changed the name to

575
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
the temple of the god.

576
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
The temple of the god?

577
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,260
What a strange name.

578
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,260
Open the door.

579
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
Open it.

580
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
Open it.

581
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
A bat?

582
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Look carefully.

583
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,260
What's on the bat?

584
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
A bat?

585
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,260
Yes. Have you heard

586
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,260
about the woodman?

587
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,260
There are many legends

588
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,260
about him.

589
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
I heard that even the great Bo Yangzi

590
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
is his good friend.

591
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,260
This woodman was very kind.

592
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,260
He once made a bat

593
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,260
that could fly in the sky for three days and nights.

594
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
There's a bat

595
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,260
in the forest.

596
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
Is it...

597
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,260
Yes. This is the first sign of the founder.

598
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,260
In today's words,

599
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,260
it's his signature.

600
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
It's an antique.

601
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Can it really fly

602
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,260
in the sky?

603
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
Yes.

604
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Don't underestimate the wisdom of the ancients.

605
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,260
This is

606
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,260
a silver bat.

607
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,260
It's also half a map

608
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,260
and a key.

609
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,260
The other half of the map and key

610
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
are in the hands of others.

611
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,260
Only after they are combined

612
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,260
can they open the gate of the temple.

613
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,260
My master said that

614
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
the north is hard to fly.

615
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,260
One day, when the woodman

616
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,260
comes to the north with the other half of the map and key,

617
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,260
the silver bat

618
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,260
will take me

619
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,260
to the real temple.

620
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Woodman,

621
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,260
I've never

622
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,260
waited for the messenger.

623
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
You may not

624
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,260
wait for it in your life.

625
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,260
But I beg you,

626
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,260
please keep this house

627
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,260
until the night is over.

628
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Woodman.

629
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,260
Bring the food on the table

630
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,260
and come with me.

631
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Are we going to go very far?

632
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Yes.

633
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,260
Woodman.

634
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,260
Three squares above the left wing.

635
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,260
Four squares below the right wing.

636
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
Four squares above the left wing.

637
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,260
Master,

638
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
I finally understand why you said

639
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
you wanted to build the map.

640
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,260
It's amazing.

641
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Back then,

642
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
I followed my master on this road.

643
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
I also said that

644
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,260
this mountain is thick with dust.

645
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,260
It's full of animals and strange thoughts.

646
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,260
What mobile phone, drone,

647
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
as long as it flies in at night,

648
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,260
it's all a gift.

649
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Even in the daytime, it's good and bad.

650
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
Maybe

651
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
this is the reason

652
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,260
why I built the map.

653
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,260
It won't be lost.

654
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
It will always be a fixed line.

655
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,260
Master,

656
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
are you tired?

657
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,260
It's nothing.

658
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
I have a lot of energy.

659
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,260
I can fight a lot.

660
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,260
I haven't had a rival

661
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
for 30 years.

662
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,260
It's really a shame.

663
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
A man who knows martial arts

664
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
can't fight in the forest.

665
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
It's really

666
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
not pleasant.

667
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Then I'll call my senior

668
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
and Luo Ren.

669
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
We'll fight together.

670
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,260
I don't like you guys being my rivals.

671
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
Master,

672
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
there seems to be someone.

673
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,260
I know.

674
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
You go first.

675
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
I'll wait for you at the Bathing House.

676
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Master.

677
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
Go.

678
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,260
Is the map fixed?

679
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,260
Yes.

680
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,260
It's not even a piece of paper.

681
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
You're so generous.

682
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
I'm so generous.

683
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
I'm so romantic.

684
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,260
What?

685
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
My little sister

686
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
is so happy

687
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
to be with you.

688
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,260
You even put her on the pillow.

689
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,260
On the pillow?

690
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,260
What?

691
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Nothing.

692
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
I'll put it on.

693
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,260
What did you put on the pillow?

694
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
The flowers you gave me.

695
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,260
What flowers?

696
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,260
The roses.

697
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,260
I didn't give it to you.

698
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Master.

699
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,260
What's going on?

700
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
Did you put it on the pillow?

701
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
What are you doing?

702
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,260
Please.

703
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,260
I think it's fine.

704
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
It's been a long time since

705
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
we saw each other.

706
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,260
What are you two doing in my room?

707
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,260
Do you know where Mu Dai is?

708
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,260
Do I have to tell you?

709
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,260
He's very quiet with Master.

710
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,260
And Master doesn't like

711
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,260
outsiders in his room.

712
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,260
Get out!

713
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,260
Big Brother, I have a leader.

714
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,260
He wants to take revenge on me.

715
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,260
This rose is his mark.

716
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,260
This flower suddenly appears on Mu Dai's pillow.

717
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Are you too self-righteous?

718
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,260
You can go anywhere.

719
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,260
Get out!

720
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,260
Big Brother,

721
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
Mu Dai and Master are not here.

722
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,260
They might have an accident.

723
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,260
What accident?

724
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,260
You don't understand.

725
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
My opponent is very powerful.

726
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,260
Where is the back mountain?

727
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,260
Tell me.

728
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,260
Tonight,

729
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,260
Master will send a small group of people.

730
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,260
We all avoid outsiders.

731
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,260
So

732
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,260
you just wait here.

733
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
And it's late outside.

734
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,260
It's not easy to walk.

735
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,260
With your equipment,

736
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,260
you can't go far.

737
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,260
Okay.

738
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,260
I'll go find it myself.

739
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,260
Go find it.

740
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,260
I'll talk to him.

741
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,260
You think so?

742
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,260
I'll be back in half an hour.

743
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Brother Luo.

744
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,260
Brother Luo, listen to me.

745
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,260
Just believe me.

746
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
It's so foggy in the mountains.

747
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260
You'll get lost.

748
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,260
And you saw that Master Tai is not an ordinary person.

749
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,260
You can trust him.

750
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,260
The rift is not ordinary.

751
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,260
He might have a heart.

752
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,260
Xinjian.

753
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,260
The End

754
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,260
In my mind,

755
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,260
there is a light and sad scene.

756
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,260
And I am in the dark.

757
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,260
The people are looking at

758
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,260
two sides.

759
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,260
One side is the main character.

760
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,260
The other side is waiting for you.

761
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,260
This game

762
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,260
is not over yet.

763
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
It has no end.

764
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
It has the traces of the past.

765
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,260
You are my match.

766
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,260
I am your match.

767
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,260
I am your match.

768
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,260
I am your match.

769
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,260
I feel your every breath.

770
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,260
And then the time goes by.

771
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,260
The flower is so bright.

772
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,260
Tell me the end.

773
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,400
The gentle

774
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,260
is about to bloom.

775
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,260
In my mind,

776
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,260
there is a light and sad scene.

777
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,260
And I am in the dark.

778
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,260
The flower is so bright.

779
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,260
Tell me the end.

780
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,260
The gentle is about to bloom.

781
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,260
In my mind,

782
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,260
there is a light and sad scene.

783
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,260
And I am in the dark.

784
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,260
The flower is so bright.

785
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,260
Tell me the end.

786
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:37,260
The gentle is about to bloom.

787
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,260
In my mind,

788
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,260
there is a light and sad scene.

789
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,260
And I am in the dark.

790
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,260
Thank you for watching!
